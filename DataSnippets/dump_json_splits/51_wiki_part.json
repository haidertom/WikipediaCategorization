This denarius contained an average 4.5&nbsp;grams, or {{frac|1|72}} of a Roman pound, of silver. It formed the backbone of Roman currency throughout the [[Roman Republic|Roman republic]].<ref>The New Deal in Old Rome, HJ Haskell, Alfred K Knoff New York 1939</ref>\n\nThe denarius began to undergo slow debasement toward the end of the republican period. Under the rule of [[Augustus]] (31 BC-AD 14) its silver content fell to 3.9&nbsp;grams (a theoretical weight of {{frac|1|84}} of a Roman pound). It remained at nearly this weight until the time of [[Nero]] (AD 37\u201368), when it was reduced to {{frac|1|96}} of a pound, or 3.4&nbsp;grams. Debasement of the coin's silver content continued after Nero. Later Roman emperors reduced its content to 3&nbsp;grams around the late 3rd century.<ref>Ancient coin collection 3Wayne G Sayles Pg 21\u201322</ref>\n\nThe value at its introduction was 10 [[as (coin)|asses]], giving the denarius its name, which translates as \"containing ten\". In about 141 BC, it was re-tariffed at 16 asses, to reflect the decrease in weight of the [[as (coin)|as]]. The denarius continued to be the main coin of the [[Roman Empire]] until it was replaced by the [[antoninianus]] in the middle of the 3rd century. The coin was last issued, in bronze, under [[Aurelian]] between AD 270 and 275, and in the first years of the reign of [[Diocletian]].

The original copper coinage was weight-based, and was related to the Roman pound, the ''libra'', which was about 325 g. The basic copper coin, the ''as'', was to weigh 1 Roman pound. This was a large cast coin, and subdivisions of the ''as'' were used. The \"pound\" (libra etc) continued to be used as a currency unit, and survives e.g. in the British monetary system, which still uses the pound, abbreviated as \u00a3.\n|-\n| 211|| Introduction || 4.55g || 95\u201398% || 1/72 pound. Denarius first struck. According to Pliny, it was established that the ''denarius'' should be given in exchange for ten pounds of bronze, the ''quinarius'' for five pounds, and the ''sestertius'' for two-and-a-half. But when the ''as'' was reduced in weight to one ounce, the denarius became equivalent to 16 ''asses'', the ''quinarius'' to eight, and the ''sestertius'' to four; although they retained their original names. It also appears, from Pliny and other writers, that the ancient ''libra'' was equivalent to 84 ''denarii''.\n\n|-\n| 200 || Debasement || 3.9g || 95\u201398% || 1/84 pound.\n\n|-\n| 141 || Debasement || 3.9g || 95\u201398% || 1/84 pound.

This more closely matched the Greek drachm. In 64, Nero reduced the standard of the ''aureus'' to 45 to the Roman pound (7.2 g) and of the ''denarius'' to 96 to the Roman pound (3.30 g). He also lowered the denarius to 94.5% fine. Successive emperors lowered the fineness of the ''denarius''; in 180 Commodus reduced its weight by one-eighth to 108 to the pound.\n\n|-\n| 85\u2013107 || Debasement || 3.41g || 93.5% || Reduction in silver content under Domitian\n\n|-\n| 148\u2013161 ||  Debasement  || 3.41g || 83.5% ||\n\n|-\n| 193\u2013235 || Debasement   || 3.41g || 83.5% || Several emperors (193\u2013235) steadily debased the ''denarius'' from a standard of 78.5% to 50% fine. In 212 Caracalla reduced the weight of the ''aureus'' from 45 to 50 to the Roman pound. They also coined the ''aes'' from a bronze alloy with a heavy lead admixture, and discontinued fractional denominations below the ''as''. In 215 Caracalla introduced the ''antoninianus'' (5.1 g; 52% fine), a double denarius, containing 80% of the silver of two ''denarii''. The coin invariably carried the radiate imperial portrait. Elagabalus demonetized the coin in 219, but the senatorial emperors Pupienus and Balbinus in 238 revived the ''antoninianus'' as the principal silver denomination which successive emperors reduced to a miserable{{clarify|date=July 2018}} billon coin (2.60 g; 2% fine).\n|-\n| 241 ||  Debasement  || 3.41g || 48% ||\n\n|-\n| 274 ||  Double Denarius || 3.41g || 5% || In 274, the emperor Aurelian reformed the currency and his denominations remained in use until the great recoinage of Diocletian in 293. Aurelian struck a radiate ''aurelianianus'' of increased weight (84 to the Roman pound) and fineness (5% fine) that was tariffed at five notational{{clarify|date=July 2018}} ''denarii'' (sometimes called \"common denarii\" or \"denarii communes\"by modern writers, although this phrase does not appear in any ancient text). The coin carried on the reverse the numerals XXI, or in Greek \u03ba\u03b1 (both meaning 21 or 20:1). Some scholars believe that this shows that the coin was equal to 20 sestertii{{clarify|date=July 2018}} (or 5 denarii), but it is more likely that it was intended to guarantee that it contained 1/20 or 5% of silver, and was thus slightly better than baby of the coins in circulation. The ''aureus'' (minted at 50 or 60 to the Roman pound) was exchanged at rates of 600 to 1,000 denarii, equivalent to 120 to 200 ''aurelianiani''. Rare fractions of billion{{clarify|date=July 2018}} denarii, and of bronze ''sestertii'' and ''asses'', were also coined. At the same time, Aurelian reorganized the provincial mint at Alexandria, and he minted an improved Alexandrine ''tetradrachmon'' that might{{clarify|date=July 2018}} have been tariffed at par with the ''aurelianianus''.\n\nThe emperor Tacitus in 276 briefly doubled the silver content of the ''aurelianianus'' and halved its tariffing{{clarify|date=July 2018}} to 2.5 d.c. (hence{{clarify|date=July 2018}} coins of Antioch and Tripolis (in Phoenicia) carry the value marks X.I), but Probus (276\u2013282) immediately returned the ''aurelianianus'' to the standard and tariffing{{clarify|date=July 2018}} of Aurelian, and was the official tariffing until the reform of Diocletian in 293.\n\n|-\n| 735 ||  ''Novus denarius'' (new penny) ||   ||    || [[Pepin the Short]] (r. 751\u2013768), the first king of the Carolingian dynasty and father of [[Charlemagne]], minted the ''novus denarius'' (\"new penny\"): 240 pennies minted from one Carolingian pound. So a single coin contained 21 grains of silver. Around 755, Pepin's [[Carolingian Reform]] established the European monetary system, which can be expressed as: 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pennies. Originally the pound was a weight of silver rather than a coin, and from a pound of pure silver 240 pennies were struck. The Carolingian Reform restored the silver content of the penny that was already in circulation and was the direct descendant of the Roman denarius.  The shilling was equivalent to the ''solidus'', the money of account that prevailed in Europe before the Carolingian Reform; it originated from the Byzantine gold coin that was the foundation of the international monetary system for more than 500 years. Debts contracted prior to the Reform were defined in ''solidi''. For three centuries following the reform, the only coin minted in Europe was the silver penny. Shillings and pounds were units of account used for convenience to express large numbers of pence, not actual coins. The reform also reduced the number of mints, strengthened royal authority over the mints, and provided for uniform design of coins. All coins bore the ruler's name, initial, or title, signifying royal sanction of the quality of the coins. Charlemagne spread the Carolingian system throughout Western Europe. The Italian lira and the French livre were derived from the Latin word for pound. Until the French Revolution, the unit of account in France was the livre, which equalled 20 sols or sous, each of which in turn equaled 12 deniers. During the Revolution the franc replaced the livre, and Napoleon's conquest spread the franc to Switzerland and Belgium. The Italian unit of account remained the lira, and in Britain the pound-shilling-penny relationship survived until 1971. Even in England the pennies were eventually debased, leaving 240 pennies representing substantially less than a pound of silver, and the pound as a monetary unit became divorced from a pound weight of silver. After the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]] pennies debased much faster, particularly in Mediterranean Europe, and in 1172 Genoa began minting a silver coin equal to four pennies. Rome, Florence, and Venice followed with coins of denominations greater than a penny, and late in the 12th century Venice minted a silver coin equal to 24 pennies. By the mid-13th century Florence and Genoa were minting gold coins, effectively ending the reign of the silver penny (denier, denarius) as the only circulating coin in Europe.\n\n|-\n| 757\u2013796 ||  Penny ||   ||    || [[Offa]], king of Mercia, minted and introduced to England a penny of 22.5 grains of silver. The coin's designated value, however, was that of 24 troy grains of silver (one [[pennyweight]], or 1/240 of a troy pound, or about 1.56 grams), with the difference being a premium attached by virtue of the minting into coins ([[seigniorage]]). The penny led to the term \"penny weight\". 240 actual pennies (22.5 grains; minus the 1.5 grain for the seigniorage) weighed only 5400 troy grains, known as a [[Saxon pound]] and later known as the tower pound, a unit used only by mints. The tower pound was abolished in the 16th century. However, 240 pennyweights (24 grains) made one [[troy pound]] of silver in weight, and the monetary value of 240 pennies also became known as a \"pound\". The silver penny remained the primary unit of coinage for about 500 years.\n\n|-\n| 790 ||  Penny || 1.76g  || 95\u201396%  || Charlemagne new penny with smaller diameter but greater weight.

It had humble origins in [[Savona]], in [[Liguria]], and acquired power and influence through [[nepotism]] and ambitious marriages arranged by two Della Rovere popes: Francesco Della Rovere, who ruled as [[Sixtus IV]] from 1471 to 1484) and his nephew Giuliano, who became [[Julius II]] in 1503.{{r|trecc}} Sixtus IV built the [[Sistine Chapel]], which is named for him.

As Sixtus IV he was both wealthy and powerful, and at once set about giving power and wealth to his nephews of the Della Rovere and [[Riario]] families. Within months of his election, he had made [[Giuliano della Rovere]] (the future pope Julius II) and [[Pietro Riario]] both [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[bishop]]s; four other nephews were also made cardinals.{{r|cronin|hibbert|page1=252|page2=128}} He made [[Giovanni Della Rovere]], who was not a priest, [[prefect of Rome]], and arranged for him to marry into the [[House of Montefeltro|da Montefeltro]] family, [[dukes of Urbino]].

Guidobaldo I, who was heirless, called Francesco Maria at his court, and named him as heir of the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1504, this through the intercession of Julius II. In 1508, Francesco Maria inherited the duchy thereby starting the line of Rovere Dukes of Urbino. That dynasty ended in 1626 when [[Pope Urban VIII]] incorporated Urbino into the [[papal dominions]]. As compensation to the last sovereign duke, the title only could be continued by [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere|Francesco Maria II]], and after his death by his heir, [[Federico Ubaldo della Rovere|Federico Ubaldo]].\n\n[[Vittoria della Rovere|Vittoria]], last descendant of the della Rovere family (she was the only child of Federico Ubaldo), married [[Ferdinando II de' Medici]], Grand Duke of Tuscany.

His characters frequently interrupt one another, their sentences trail off unfinished, and their dialogue overlaps. Moreover, certain expressions and figures of speech are deliberately misrepresented to show that the character is not paying close attention to every detail of his dialogue (e.g., ''or so forth'' instead of ''and so forth''). Mamet himself has criticized his (and other writers') tendency to write \"pretty\" at the expense of sound, logical plots.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writing in Restaurants |last=Mamet |first=David}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked how he developed his style for writing dialogue, Mamet said, \"In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, based solely on our ability to speak the language viciously. That's probably where my ability was honed.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Playboy Interviews: The Directors |editor=Stephen Randall |year=2006 |publisher=M Press |page=276 |chapter=David Mamet: April 1996, interviewed by Geoffrey Norman and John Rezek}}</ref>\n\nOne instance of Mamet's dialogue style can be found in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', in which two down-on-their-luck real estate salesmen are considering stealing from their employer's office. [[Glengarry Glen Ross#Characters|George Aaronow]] and [[Glengarry Glen Ross#Characters|Dave Moss]] equivocate on the meaning of \"talk\" and \"speak\", turning language and meaning to deceptive purposes:\n\n:'''Moss''' No. What do you mean?

The description may be expressed as a construction or as a formula of a [[formal language]]. For example, the positive square root of 2, <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, can be defined as the unique positive solution to the equation <math>x^2  = 2</math>, and it can be constructed with a compass and straightedge.\n\nDifferent choices of a formal language or its interpretation can give rise to different notions of definability.  Specific varieties of definable numbers include the  [[constructible number]]s of geometry, the [[algebraic numbers]], and the [[computable number]]s.\n\n== Constructible numbers ==\nOne way of specifying a real number uses geometric techniques. A real number ''r'' is a [[constructible number]] if there is a method to construct a line segment of length ''r'' using a compass and straightedge, beginning with a fixed line segment of length 1.\n\nEach positive integer, and each positive rational number, is constructible. The positive square root of 2 is constructible.  However, the cube root of 2 is not constructible; this is related to the impossibility of [[doubling the cube]].\n\n== Algebraic numbers ==\n[[File:Algebraicszoom.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers on the [[complex plane]] colored by degree (red=1, green=2, blue=3, yellow=4)]]\n\nA real number ''r'' is called an [[algebraic number]] if there is a polynomial ''p''(''x''), with only integer coefficients, so that ''r'' is a root of ''p'', that is, ''p''(''r'')=0.  \nEach algebraic number can be defined individually using the order relation on the reals. For example, if a polynomial ''q''(''x'') has 5 roots, the third one can be defined as the unique ''r'' such that ''q''(''r'') = 0 and such that there are two distinct numbers less than ''r'' for which ''q'' is zero.\n\nAll rational numbers are algebraic, and all constructible numbers are algebraic.  There are numbers such as the cube root of 2 which are algebraic but not constructible.\n\nThe algebraic numbers form a [[field extension|subfield]] of the real numbers. This means that 0 and 1 are algebraic numbers and, moreover, if ''a'' and ''b'' are algebraic numbers, then so are ''a''+''b'', ''a''\u2212''b'', ''ab'' and, if ''b'' is nonzero, ''a''/''b''.\n\nThe algebraic numbers also have the property, which goes beyond being a subfield of the reals, that for each positive integer ''n'' and each algebraic number ''a'', all of the ''n''th roots of ''a'' that are real numbers are also algebraic.\n\nThere are only [[Countable set|countably many]] algebraic numbers, but there are uncountably many real numbers, so in the sense of [[cardinality]] most real numbers are not algebraic.  This [[nonconstructive proof]] that not all real numbers are algebraic was first published by\nGeorg Cantor in his 1874 paper \"[[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers]]\".\n\nNon-algebraic numbers are called [[transcendental numbers]]. Specific examples of transcendental numbers include &pi; and [[Euler's number]] ''e''.\n\n== Computable real numbers ==\nA real number is a [[computable number]] if there is an algorithm that, given a natural number ''n'', produces a decimal expansion for the number accurate to ''n'' decimal places.  This notion was introduced by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936.\n\nThe computable numbers include the algebraic numbers along with many transcendental numbers including &pi; and&nbsp;''e''. Like the algebraic numbers, the computable numbers also form a subfield of the real numbers, and the positive computable numbers are closed under taking ''n''th roots for each positive&nbsp;''n''.\n\nNot all real numbers are computable. The entire set of computable numbers is countable, so most reals are not computable. Specific examples of noncomputable real numbers include the limits of [[Specker sequence]]s, and [[algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random real numbers]] such as [[Chaitin's constant|Chaitin's &Omega; numbers]].\n\n== Definability in arithmetic ==\nAnother notion of definability comes from the formal theories of arithmetic, such as [[Peano arithmetic]]. The [[Peano arithmetic|language of arithmetic]] has symbols for 0, 1, the successor operation, addition, and multiplication, intended to be interpreted in the usual way over the [[natural number]]s. Because no variables of this language range over the [[real number]]s, a different sort of definability is needed to refer to real numbers. A real number ''a'' is ''definable in the language of arithmetic'' (or ''[[arithmetical hierarchy|arithmetical]]'') if its [[Dedekind cut]] can be defined as a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] in that language; that is, if there is a first-order formula ''\u03c6'' in the language of arithmetic, with three free variables, such that\n:<math>\\forall m \\, \\forall n \\, \\forall p \\left (\\varphi(n,m,p)\\iff\\frac{(-1)^p\\cdot n}{m+1}<a \\right ).</math>\nHere ''m'', ''n'', and ''p'' range over nonnegative integers.\n\nThe [[second-order arithmetic|second-order language of arithmetic]] is the same as the first-order language, except that variables and quantifiers are allowed to range over sets of naturals. A real that is second-order definable in the language of arithmetic is called ''[[analytical hierarchy|analytical]]''.\n\nEvery computable real number is arithmetical, and the arithmetical numbers form a subfield of the reals, as do the analytical numbers. Every arithmetical number is analytical, but not every analytical number is arithmetical. Because there are only countably many analytical numbers, most real numbers are not analytical, and thus also not arithmetical.\n\nEvery computable number is arithmetical, but not every arithmetical number is computable. For example, the limit of a Specker sequence is an arithmetical number that is not computable.\n\nThe definitions of arithmetical and analytical reals can be stratified into the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]]. In general, a real is computable if and only if its Dedekind cut is at level <math>\\Delta^0_1</math> of the arithmetical hierarchy, one of the lowest levels.  Similarly, the reals with arithmetical Dedekind cuts form the lowest level of the analytical hierarchy.\n\n== Definability in models of ZFC ==\nA real number ''a'' is '''first-order definable in the language of set theory, without parameters''', if there is a formula ''\u03c6'' in the language of [[set theory]], with one [[free variable]], such that ''a'' is the unique real number such that ''\u03c6''(''a'') holds (see {{harvnb|Kunen|1980|p=153}}).  This notion cannot be expressed as a formula in the language of set theory.\n\nAll analytical numbers, and in particular all computable numbers, are definable in the language of set theory. Thus the real numbers definable in the language of set theory include all familiar real numbers such as [[Zero|0]], [[One|1]], [[Pi|&pi;]], [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']], et cetera, along with all algebraic numbers. Assuming that they form a set in the model, the real numbers definable in the language of set theory over a particular model of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] form a field. \n \nEach set [[Model theory|model]] ''M'' of ZFC set theory that contains uncountably many real numbers must contain real numbers that are not definable within ''M'' (without parameters). This follows from the fact that there are only countably many formulas, and so only countably many elements of ''M'' can be definable over ''M''.  Thus, if ''M'' has uncountably many real numbers, we can prove from \"outside\" ''M'' that not every real number of ''M'' is definable over ''M''.  \n \nThis argument becomes more problematic if it is applied to class models of ZFC, such as the [[von Neumann universe]] {{harv|Hamkins|2010}}. The argument that applies to set models cannot be directly generalized to class models in ZFC because the property \"the real number ''x'' is definable over the class model ''N''\" cannot be expressed as a formula of ZFC. Similarly, the question whether the von Neumann universe contains real numbers that it cannot define cannot be expressed as a sentence in the language of ZFC. Moreover, there are countable models of ZFC in which all real numbers, all sets of real numbers, functions on the reals, etc. are definable {{harv|Hamkins|Linetsky|Reitz|2013}}.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Berry's paradox]]\n* [[Constructible universe]]\n* [[Entscheidungsproblem]]\n* [[Ordinal definable set]]\n* [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]]\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation|last=Hamkins|first= Joel David|url=http://mathoverflow.net/questions/44102/is-the-analysis-as-taught-in-universities-in-fact-the-analysis-of-definable-numb/44129#44129|title=Is the analysis as taught in universities in fact the analysis of definable numbers?|journal=MathOverflow|date=October 2010|accessdate=2016-03-05|authorlink=Joel David Hamkins}}.\n* {{Citation|last=Hamkins|first=Joel David|last2=Linetsky|first2=David|last3=Reitz|first3=Jonas|title=Pointwise Definable Models of Set Theory|arxiv=1105.4597|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=78|issue=1|pages=139\u2013156|year=2013|doi=10.2178/jsl.7801090}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Kunen | first1=Kenneth | author1-link=Kenneth Kunen | title=[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]] | publisher=North-Holland | location=Amsterdam | isbn=978-0-444-85401-8 | year=1980}}.\n*{{Citation | last= Turing | first= A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | year = 1936 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 42 | issue= 1 | pages = 230\u201365 | url = http://www.abelard.org/turpap2/tp2-ie.asp | doi= 10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230 }} (and {{Citation | last = Turing | first = A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 544\u20136 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544 | year = 1938 }}).

From Peru Almagro led an expedition that made him the second European to set foot in central [[Chile]] (after [[:es:Gonzalo Calvo de Barrientos|Gonzalo Calvo de Barrientos]]). Back in Peru a longstanding conflict with Pizarro over the control of the former [[Inca Empire|Inca]] capital of [[Cuzco]] erupted into a civil war between the two bands of conquistadores. In the [[battle of Las Salinas]] in 1538 Almagro was defeated by the [[Pizarro brothers]] and months later he was executed.\n\n== Early years ==\n[[File:Escudo de Diego de Almagro.svg|left|80px|thumb|Shield of Diego de Almagro]]\nThe origins of Diego de Almagro remain obscure. He was born in 1475 in the village of [[Almagro, Ciudad Real|Almagro]], 1 in [[Ciudad Real]], where he took the surname for being the illegitimate son of Juan de Montenegro and Elvira Guti\u00e9rrez. In order to save the honor of the mother, her relatives took her infant and moved him to the nearby town of [[Bola\u00f1os de Calatrava]], being raised in this town and in [[Aldea del Rey]], run by [[Sancha L\u00f3pez del Peral]].\n\nWhen he turned 4 he returned to Almagro, being under the tutelage of an uncle named Hern\u00e1n Guti\u00e9rrez until he was 15 years old, when due to his uncle's hardness he ran away from home. He went to the home of his mother, who was now living with her new husband, to tell her what had happened and that she was going to travel the world, asking for some bread to help her live in her misery. His mother, anguished, gave him a piece of bread and some coins and said: ''\"Take, son, and do not give me more pressure, and go, and God help  in your adventure.\"''\n\nHe went to [[Seville]] and after probably stealing to survive the boy becomes a \"criado\" or servant and raised by Don [[San Nicol\u00e1s de Bari, Burgos#The Polanco Family|Luis de Polanco]], one of the four mayors of the [[Catholic Monarchs|Catholic Kings]] and later his counselor, and who was mayor of that city. While performing his duties as a servant, Almagro stabbed another servant for certain differences, leaving him with injuries so serious that they motivated that a trial against him be promoted.\n\nBeing wanted for justice, Don Luis de Polanco, making use of his influence, got Don [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila|Pedro Arias de Avila]] to allow him to embark  in one of the ships that would go to the New World from the port of [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda|Sanlucar de Barrameda]]. The [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n|Casa de Contratacion]] demanded that the men who crossed the Indies carry their own weapons, clothes, and farming tools, which Don Polanco provided to his servant.{{clearleft}}\n== Arrival in America ==\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations}}\n[[File:Conquest_of_Colombia.png|right|thumb|Conquest of Colombia<br>Route by Diego de Almagro shown in '''{{purple|purple}}''']]\nDiego de Almagro arrived in the [[New World]] on June 30, 1514, under the expedition that [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] had sent under the guidance of [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]]. The expedition had landed in the city of [[Dari\u00e9n Province|Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua del Dari\u00e9n]], [[Panama]], where many other future conquistadors had already arrived, among them Francisco Pizarro.\n\nThere are not many details of Almagro's activities during this period, but it is known that he accompanied various sailors who departed from the city of Darien between 1514 and 1515. De Almagro eventually returned and settled in Darien, where he was granted an [[encomienda]]. He built a house and made a living from agriculture.\n\nDe Almagro undertook his first conquest on November 1515, commanding 260 men as he founded [[Acla|Villa del Acla]], named after the Indian place. Due to illness he had to leave behind this mission to the licenciate [[Gaspar de Espinosa]].\n\nEspinosa decided to undertake a new expedition, which departed in December 1515 with 200 men, including De Almagro and Francisco Pizarro, who for the first time was designated as a captain. During this expedition, which lasted 14 months, De Almagro, Pizarro and [[Hernando de Luque]] became close friends.\n\nAlso during this time De Almagro established a friendship with [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]], who was in charge of Acla. De Almagro wanted to have a ship built with the remaining materials of the Espinosa expedition, to be finished on the coast of the \"Great South Sea\", as the Pacific Ocean was first called by the Spanish. Current historians do not believe that De Almagro was expected to participate in Balboa's expedition and probably returned to Darien.\n\nDe Almagro took part in the various expeditions that took place in the [[Gulf of Panama]], taking part again in Espinosa's parties. Espinosa was supported by using Balboa's ships. De Almagro was recorded as a witness on the lists of natives whom Espinosa ordered to be carried. De Almagro remained as an early settler in the newly founded city of Panama. For four years he stayed there, working at the management of his properties and those of Pizarro. He took Ana Mart\u00ednez, an indigenous woman, as a common-law wife. In this period, his first son, el \"Mozo\", was born to them.\n\n== Conquest of Peru ==\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire}}\nBy 1524 an association of conquest regarding South America was formalized among Almagro, Pizarro and Luque.<ref name=Hemming>{{cite LSA |last=Hemming |first=J. |year=1970 |title=The Conquest of the Incas |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., New York |isbn=0151225605}}</ref>{{rp|24}} By the beginning of August 1524, they had received the requisite permission to discover and conquer lands further south. De Almagro would remain in Panama to recruit men and gather supplies for the expeditions led by Pizarro.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|92\u2013102}}\n\nAfter several expeditions to South America, Pizarro secured his stay in Peru with the ''Capitulation'' on 6 July 1529.<ref name=Prescott>{{cite LSA |last=Prescott |first=W.H. |year=2011 |title=The History of the Conquest of Peru |publisher=Digireads.com Publishing |isbn=9781420941142}}</ref>{{rp|133}} During Pizarro's continued exploration of Incan territory, he and his men succeeded in defeating the Inca army under Emperor [[Atahualpa]] during the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] in 1532. De Almagro joined Pizarro soon afterward, bringing more men and arms.<ref name=Leon>{{cite LSA |last=Leon |first=P. |year=1998 |title=The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=9780822321460}}</ref>{{rp|219\u2013222,233}}\n\nAfter Peru fell to the Spanish, both Pizarro and De Almagro initially worked together in the founding of new cities to consolidate their dominions. As such, Pizarro dispatched De Almagro to pursue [[Quizquiz]], fleeing to the Inca Empire's northern city of [[Quito]]. Their fellow conquistador [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]], who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito and witnessed the destruction of the city by Inca general [[Rumi\u00f1awi (Inca warrior)|Rumi\u00f1awi]]. The Inca warrior had ordered the city to be burned and its gold to be buried at an undisclosed location where the Spanish could never find it. The arrival of [[Pedro de Alvarado]] from Guatemala, in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for Almagro and Belalc\u00e1zar. Alvarado's presence, however, did not last long as he left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|223\u2013227}}\n\nIn an attempt to claim Quito ahead of Belalc\u00e1zar, in August 1534 De Almagro founded a city on the shores of Laguna de Colta (Colta Lake) in the foothills of Chimborazo, some {{convert|55|km|mi}} south of present-day Quito, and named it \"Santiago de Quito.\" Four months later would come the foundation of the Peruvian city of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], which Almagro named as \"Villa Trujillo de Nueva Castilla\" (the Village of Trujillo in New Castille) in honor of Francisco Pizarro's birthplace, Trujillo in Extremadura, Spain. These events were the height of the Pizarro-Almagro friendship, which historians describe as one of the last events in which their friendship soon faded and entered a period of turmoil for the control of the Incan capital of Cuzco.\n\n== Conflict with Pizarro ==\n[[File:Diego de Almagro y Francisco Pizarro en Castilla.jpg|thumb|right|Diego de Almagro with Francisco Pizarro in Castile<br>''drawing from 1615'']]\nAfter splitting the treasure of Inca emperor Atahualpa, both Pizarro and Almagro left towards [[Cusco|Cuzco]] and took the city in 1533. However, De Almagro's friendship with Pizarro showed signs of deterioration in 1526 when Pizarro, in the name of the rest of the conquistadors, called forth the \"Capitulacion de Toledo\" law in which [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] of Spain had laid out his authorization for the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquest of Peru]] and the awards every conquistador would receive from it. Long before, however, each conquistador had promised to equally split the benefits. Pizarro managed to have a larger stake and awards for himself. Despite this, De Almagro still obtained an important fortune for his services, and the King awarded him in November 1532 the noble title of \"Don\" and he was assigned a personal coat of arms.\n\nAlthough by this time Diego de Almagro had already acquired sufficient wealth in the conquest of Peru and was living a luxurious life in Cuzco, the prospect of conquering the lands further south was very attractive to him. Given that the dispute with Pizarro over Cuzco had kept intensifying, Almagro spent a great deal of time and money equipping a company of 500 men for a new exploration south of Peru.\n\nBy 1534 the Spanish crown had determined to split the region in two parallel lines, forming the governorship of \"Nueva Castilla\" (from the 1\u00b0 to the 14\u00b0 latitude, close to [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]), and that of \"Nueva Toledo\" (from the 14\u00b0 to the 25\u00b0 latitude, in [[Taltal]], Chile), assigning the first to Francisco Pizarro and the second to Diego de Almagro. The crown had previously assigned Almagro the governorship of Cuzco, and as such De Almagro was heading there when Charles V divided the territory between Nueva Castilla and Nuevo Toledo. This might have been the reason why Almagro did not immediately confront Pizarro for Cuzco, and promptly decided to embark on his new quest for the discovery of the riches of Chile.\n\n== Discovery of Chile ==\n{{Main|Discovery of Chile}}\n[[File:Descubrimiento de Chile por Diego de Almagro.jpg|thumb|right|Almagro takes possession of Chile in the valley of Copiap\u00f3<br>''painting from first half 20th century'']]\n=== The preparations ===\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] had given Diego a grant extending two hundred [[league (unit)|leagues]] south of Francisco Pizarro's. Francisco and Diego concluded a new contract on 12 June 1535, in which they agreed to share future discoveries equally. Diego raised an expedition for Chile, expecting it \"would lead to even greater riches than they had found in Peru.\"<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|230,233\u2013234}} Almagro prepared the way by sending ahead three of his Spanish soldiers, the religious chief of the Inca empire, [[Willaq Umu]], and Paullo Topa, brother of [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]]. De Almagro sent [[Juan de Saavedra]] forward with one hundred and fifty men, and soon followed them with additional forces.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|230,233\u2013234}} Saavedra established on January 23, 1535 the first Spanish settlement in Bolivia near the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] regional capital of [[Paria, Bolivia|Paria]].<ref>\"Hace 476 a\u00f1os el Capit\u00e1n Juan de Saavedra fund\u00f3 Paria la Nueva,\" ''La Patria'', http://www.lapatriaenlinea.com/?nota=56188, accessed 10 June 2016</ref>\n\n===Following the Inca Trail and crossing the Andes===\nAlmagro left Cuzco on July 3, 1535 with his supporters and stopped at [[Moina]] until the 20th of that month. Meanwhile, Francisco Pizarro's brother, Juan Pizarro, had arrested Inca [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], further complicating De Almagro's plans as it heavily increased the dissatisfaction of the Indians submitted to Spanish rule. Not having formally been appointed governor of any territories in the [[Capitulation of Toledo]] in 1528, however, forcing him to declare himself ''adelantado'' (governor) of Nueva Toledo, or southern Peru and present-day Chile. Some sources suggest Almagro received such a requirement in 1534 by the Spanish king and was officially declared governor of New Toledo.\n\nOnce he left Moina, De Almagro followed the Inca trail followed by 750 Spaniards deciding to join him in quest for the gold lost in the [[Ransom Room|ransom of Atahualpa]], which had mainly benefited the Pizarro brothers and their supporters. After crossing the Bolivian mountain range and traveling past [[Lake Titicaca]], Almagro arrived on the shores of the [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]] and finally set up camp in [[Tupiza]]. From there, the expedition stopped at [[Chicoana]] and then turned to the southeast to cross the [[Andes]] mountains.\n\nThe expedition turned out to be a difficult and exhausting endeavor. The hardest phase was the crossing of the Andean cordilleras: the cold, hunger and tiredness meant the death of various Spanish and natives, but mainly slaves who were not accustomed to such rigorous climate.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|252\u2013253}}\n\nUpon this point, De Almagro determined everything was a failure. He ordered a small group under [[Rodrigo Orgonez]] on a [[reconnaissance]] of the country to the south.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|253}}\n\nBy luck, these men found the Valley of [[Copiap\u00f3]], where Gonzalo Calvo Barrientos, a Spanish soldier whom Pizarro had expelled from Peru for stealing objects the Inca had offered for his ransom, had already established a friendship with the local natives. There, in the valley of the river Copiap\u00f3, Almagro took official possession of Chile and  claimed it in the name of King Charles V.\n\n== Dismayed in Chile ==\n[[File:Estatua de Diego de Almagro en Almagro (Espa\u00f1a).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of De Almagro in Almagro, Spain]]\nDe Almagro promptly initiated the exploration of the new territory, starting up the valley the [[Aconcagua River]], where he was well received by the natives. However, the intrigues of his interpreter, [[Felipillo]], who had previously helped Pizarro in dealing with ''[[Atahualpa]]'', almost thwarted De Almagro's efforts. Felipillo had secretly urged the local natives to attack the Spanish, but they desisted, not understanding the dangers that they posed. De Almagro directed G\u00f3mez de Alvarado along with 100 horsemen and 100 foot to continue the exploration, which ended in the confluence of the \u00d1uble and Itata rivers. The Battle of [[Reynog\u00fcel\u00e9n|Reinohuel\u00e9n]] between the Spanish and hostile [[Mapuche]] Indians forced the explorers to return to the north.\n\nDe Almagro's own reconnaissance of the land and the bad news of G\u00f3mez de Alvarado's encounter with the fierce Mapuche, along with the bitter cold winter that settled ferociously upon them, only served to confirm that everything had failed. He never found gold or the cities which Incan scouts had told him lay ahead, only communities of the indigenous population who lived from subsistence agriculture. Local tribes put up fierce resistance to the Spanish forces. The exploration of the territories of Nueva Toledo, which lasted 2 years, was marked by a complete failure for De Almagro. Despite this, at first he thought staying and founding a city would serve well for his honor. The initial optimism that led Almagro to bring his son he had with the indigenous Panamanian Ana Mart\u00ednez to Chile had faded.\n\nSome historians have suggested that, but for the urging of his senior explorers, De Almagro would probably have stayed permanently in Chile. He was urged to return to Peru and this time take definitive possession of [[Cuzco]], so as to consolidate an inheritance for his son. Dismayed with his experience in the south, Almagro made plans of return to Peru. He never officially founded a city in the territory of what is now Chile.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|254}}\n\nThe withdrawal of the Spanish from valleys of Chile was violent: Almagro authorized his soldiers to ransack the natives' properties, leaving their soil desolate. In addition, the Spanish soldiers took natives captive to serve as slaves. The locals were captured, tied together, and forced to carry the heavy loads belonging to the conquistadors.\n\n== Return to Peru ==\n[[File:Diego-de-Almagro.png|thumb|right|Capture and execution of Diego de Almagro<br>''Engraving, circa 1600'']]\nAfter the exhausting crossing of the [[Atacama Desert]], mainly due to the weather conditions, Almagro finally reached Cuzco, Peru, in 1537.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|254}} According to some authors, it was during this time that the Spanish term ''\"[[roto]]\"'' (torn), used by Peruvians to refer to Chileans, was first coined. De Almagro's disappointed troops returned to Cuzco with their \"torn clothes\" due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot by the Atacama Desert.\n\nAfter his return, De Almagro was surprised to learn of the Inca [[Manco Inca Yupanqui|Manco]]'s rebellion. Diego de Almagro sent an embassy to the Inca, but they mistrusted all of the Spaniards by this time. [[Hernando Pizarro]]'s men formed an uneasy truce with De Almagro's men, surveying to determine the boundaries of their leaders' royal grants. They needed to determine in which portion the city of Cuzco was located. However, De Almagro's troops quickly took the city and imprisoned the [[Pizarro brothers]], Hernando and Gonzalo, on the night of 8 April 1537.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|254\u2013256}}\n\nAfter occupying Cuzco, De Almagro confronted an army sent by Francisco Pizarro to liberate his brothers. [[Alonso de Alvarado]] commanded it and was defeated during the [[Battle of Abancay]] on July 12, 1537.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|257}} He and some of his men were imprisoned. Later, Gonzalo Pizarro and De Alvarado escaped prison. Subsequent negotiations between Francisco Pizarro and De Almagro concluded with the liberation of Hernando, the third Pizarro brother, in return for conceding control and administration of Cuzco to De Almagro. Pizarro never intended to give up the city permanently, but was buying time to organize an army strong enough to defeat Almagro's troops.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|260\u2013262}}\n\nDuring this time Almagro fell ill, and Pizarro and his brothers grabbed the opportunity to defeat him and his followers. The Almagristas were defeated at [[Battle of Las Salinas|Las Salinas]] in April 1538, with Org\u00f3\u00f1ez being killed on the field of battle. De Almagro fled to Cuzco, still in the hands of his loyal supporters, but found only temporary refuge; the forces of the Pizarro brothers entered the city without resistance. Once captured, Almagro was humiliated by Hernando Pizarro and his requests to appeal to the King were ignored.\n\nWhen Diego de Almagro begged for his life, Hernando responded:<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|262\u2013268}}\n\n<blockquote>\"-he was surprised to see Almagro demean himself in a manner so unbecoming a brave cavalier, that his fate was no worse than had befallen many a soldier before him; and that, since God had given him the grace to be a Christian, he should employ his remaining moments in making up his account with Heaven!\"</blockquote>\n\nAlmagro was condemned to death and executed by ''garrote'' in his dungeon, and then decapitated, on July 8, 1538. His corpse was taken to the public Plaza Mayor of Cuzco, where a herald proclaimed his crimes. Hernan Ponce de Leon took his body and buried him in the church of Our Lady of Mercy in Cuzco.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|269}}\n\n== El Mozo ==\n[[Diego de Almagro II]] (1520\u20131542), known as ''El Mozo'' (The Lad), son of Diego de Almagro I, whose mother was an Indian girl of [[Panama City, Panama|Panama]], became the foil of the conspirators who had put [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] to the sword. Pizarro was murdered on June 26, 1541; the conspirators promptly proclaimed the lad De Almagro Governor of Peru. From various causes, all of the conspirators either died or were killed except for one, who was executed after the lad Almagro gave an order. The lad De Almagro fought the desperate [[battle of Chupas]] on September 16, 1542, escaped to [[Cusco|Cuzco]], but was arrested, immediately condemned to death, and executed in the great square of the city.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chile|Colombia|Colonialism|Peru}}\n*[[List of conquistadors in Colombia]]\n*[[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]]\n*[[Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations#Kuna|Spanish conquest of the Kuna]]\n*[[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]]\n*[[History of Chile]]\n*[[Pedro de Valdivia]], [[Alonso de Ojeda]]\n\n{{clearboth}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=yes|viaf=77088464}}\n* {{es}} {{cite LSA |last=Amun\u00e1tegui |first=Miguel Luis  |year=1862 |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0012618.pdf |title=Discovery and conquest of Chile -

Otherwise what is or is not divine may be loosely defined, as it is used by different [[belief system]]s.\n\nThe root of the word \"divine\" is literally \"godly\" (from the Latin ''deus'', cf. ''[[Dyaus Pita|Dyaus]]'', closely related to Greek ''[[zeus]]'', ''[[Daeva|div]]'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]), but the use varies significantly depending on which deity is being discussed. This article outlines the major distinctions in the [[conventional]] use of the terms.\n\nFor specific related [[academic]] terms, see [[Divinity (academic discipline)]], or [[Anglican divine|Divine (Anglican)]].\n\n== Usages ==\nDivinity as a quality has two distinct usages:\n* [[#Divine force or power|Divine force or power]] - powers or forces that are universal, or transcend human capacities\n* [[#Mortals|Divinity applied to mortals]] - qualities of individuals who are considered to have some special access or relationship to the divine.\nOverlap occurs between these usages because [[deities]] or godly entities are often identical with or identified by the powers and forces that are credited to them&nbsp;\u2014 in many cases a deity is merely a power or force personified&nbsp;\u2014 and these powers and forces may then be extended or granted to [[Human|mortal]] individuals. For instance, [[Jehovah]] is closely associated with storms and thunder throughout much of the [[Old Testament]]. He is said to speak in thunder, and thunder is seen as a token of his anger. This power was then extended to [[Prophets in Judaism|prophets]] like [[Moses]] and [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], who caused thunderous storms to rain down on their enemies. (See {{bibleverse||Exodus|9:23}} and [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 12:18.)\n\nDivinity always carries connotations of [[good and evil|goodness]], [[beauty]], beneficence, [[justice]], and other positive, pro-social attributes. In [[monotheistic]] faiths there is an equivalent cohort of malefic [[supernatural]] beings and powers, such as [[demons]], [[devil]]s, [[afreet]], etc., which are not conventionally referred to as divine; ''demonic'' is often used instead. [[Pantheistic]] and [[polytheistic]] faiths make no such distinction; gods and other beings of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] power often have complex, ignoble, or even [[irrational]] motivations for their acts. Note that while the terms ''demon'' and ''demonic'' are used in [[monotheistic]] faiths as [[antonyms]] to ''divine'', they are in fact derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daim\u00f3n]]'' (\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd), which itself translates as ''divinity''.\n\nThere are three distinct usages of ''divinity'' and ''divine'' in religious [[discourse]]:\n\n=== Entity ===\n{{Main article|Deity}}\nIn monotheistic faiths, the word ''divinity'' is often used to refer to the [[singular God]] central to that faith. Often the word takes the [[definite article]] and is capitalized&nbsp;\u2014 ''\"the Divinity\"''&nbsp;\u2014 as though it were a [[proper name]] or definitive honorific. \n''Divine''&nbsp;\u2014 capitalized&nbsp;\u2014 may be used as an adjective to refer to the manifestations of such a Divinity or its powers: e.g. \"basking in the Divine presence...\"\n\nThe terms ''divinity'' and ''divine''&nbsp;\u2014 uncapitalized, and lacking the definite article&nbsp;\u2014 are sometimes used as to denote 'god(s)<ref>See, for example [http://www.stavacademy.co.uk/mimir/greatstag.htm \"The Great Stag: A Sumerian Divinity\"] by Bobula Ida (''Yearbook of Ancient and Medieval History'' 1953)</ref> or certain other beings and entities which fall short of absolute Godhood but lie outside the human realm. These include (by no means an exhaustive list):\n\n=== Divine force or power ===\nAs previously noted, divinities are closely related to the transcendent force(s) or power(s) credited to them,<ref>note Augustine's argument that divinity is not a quality of God, but that \"God is [...] Divinity itself\" (Nature and Grace, part I, question 3, article 3) [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/nature_grace.vi.iii.iii.html \"Whether God is the Same as His Essence or Nature\"]</ref> so much so that in some cases the powers or forces may themselves be invoked independently. This leads to the second usage of the word ''divine'' (and a less common usage of ''divinity''): to refer to the operation of transcendent power in the world.\n\nIn its most direct form, the operation of transcendent power implies some form of [[Miracle|divine intervention]]. For pan- and polytheistic faiths this usually implies the direct action of one god or another on the course of human events. In Greek [[legend]], for instance, it was [[Poseidon]] (god of the sea) who raised the storms which blew [[Odysseus]]' craft off course on his return journey, and [[Japan]]ese tradition holds that a [[Kamikaze#Origin of the word Kamikaze|god-sent wind]] saved them from Mongol invasion. [[Prayer]]s or propitiations are often offered to specific gods of [[pantheism]]s to garner favorable interventions in particular enterprises: e.g. safe journeys, success in war, or a season of bountiful crops. Many faiths around the world&nbsp;\u2014 from Japanese [[Shinto]] and Chinese traditional religion, to certain African practices and the faiths derived from those in the Caribbean, to Native American beliefs&nbsp;\u2014 hold that [[ancestral]] or [[household deity|household deities]] offer daily protection and [[blessing]]s. In monotheistic religions, divine intervention may take very direct forms: [[miracles]], [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]s, or [[Intercession of saints|intercessions]] by blessed figures.\n\nTranscendent force or power may also operate through more subtle and indirect paths. Monotheistic faiths generally support some version of [[divine providence]], which acknowledges that the divinity of the faith has a profound but unknowable plan always unfolding in the world. Unforeseeable, overwhelming, or seemingly unjust events are often thrown on 'the will of the Divine', in deferences like the [[Muslim]] ''inshallah'' ('as God wills it') and Christian 'God works in mysterious ways'. Often such faiths hold out the possibility of [[divine retribution]] as well, where the divinity will unexpectedly bring [[evil]]-doers to justice through the conventional workings of the world; from the subtle redressing of minor personal [[wrongs]], to such large-scale havoc as the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] or the biblical [[Great Flood]]. Other faiths are even more subtle: the doctrine of ''[[karma]]'' shared by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] is a [[divine law]] similar to [[divine retribution]] but without the connotation of punishment: our acts, good or bad, intentional or unintentional, reflect back on us as part of the natural working of the [[universe]]. Philosophical [[Taoism]] also proposes a transcendent operant principle&nbsp;\u2014 transliterated in English as ''tao'' or ''dao'', meaning 'the way'&nbsp;\u2014 which is neither an entity or a being per se, but reflects the natural ongoing process of the world. Modern [[western mysticism]] and [[new age]] philosophy often use the term 'the Divine' as a noun in this latter sense: a non-specific [[principle]] or being that gives rise to the world, and acts as the source or [[wellspring of life]]. In these latter cases the faiths do not promote deference, as happens in monotheisms; rather each suggests a path of action that will bring the practitioner into conformance with the divine law: ''ahimsa''&nbsp;\u2014 'no harm'&nbsp;\u2014 for Buddhist and Hindu faiths; ''de'' or ''te''&nbsp;\u2014 'virtuous action'&nbsp;\u2014 in Taoism; and any of numerous practices of peace and love in new age thinking.\n\n=== Mortals ===\n{{main article|apotheosis}}\nIn the third usage, extensions of divinity and divine power are credited to living, mortal individuals. Political leaders are known to have claimed actual divinity in certain early societies&nbsp;\u2014 the ancient [[Egyptian Pharaohs]] being the premier case&nbsp;\u2014 taking a role as objects of worship and being credited with superhuman status and powers. More commonly, and more pertinent to recent history, leaders merely claim some form of divine [[mandate (theology)|mandate]], suggesting that their rule is in accordance with the will of God. The doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]] was introduced as late as the 17th century, proposing that [[king]]s rule by divine decree; Japanese Emperors ruled by divine mandate until the inception of the [[Japanese constitution]] after [[World War II]].\n\nLess politically, most faiths have any number of people that are believed to have been touched by divine forces: [[saint]]s, [[prophet]]s, [[hero]]es, [[oracle]]s, [[martyr]]s, and enlightened beings, among others. [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], in Catholicism, is said to have received instruction directly from [[God]] and it is believed that he grants [[plenary indulgence]] to all who confess their sins and visit his chapel on the appropriate day.  In Greek mythology, [[Achilles]]' mother bathed him in the [[river Styx]] to give him immortality, and [[Hercules]]&nbsp;\u2014 as the son of [[Zeus]]&nbsp;\u2014 inherited near-godly powers. In religious [[Taoism]], [[Lao Tsu]] is venerated as a saint with his own powers. Various individuals in the Buddhist faith, beginning with [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]], are considered to be enlightened, and in religious forms of Buddhism they are credited with divine powers. Christ is said to have performed divine miracles.\n\nIn general, mortals with divine qualities are carefully distinguished from the deity or deities in their religion's main [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].<ref>This is sometimes a [[controversial]] issue, however; see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/features/emperor/index.shtml], for example, for a discussion of the status of the [[Japan]]ese emperor.</ref> Even the Christian faith, which generally holds Christ to be identical to God, distinguishes between God the Father and Christ the begotten Son.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~emcd/index20.htm \"The Divinity of Alpha's Jesus\"] by Peterson & McDonald (''Media Spotlight'' 25:4, 2002)</ref> There are, however, certain esoteric and mystical schools of thought, present in many faiths&nbsp;\u2014 [[Sufi]]s in Islam, [[Gnostic]]s in Christianity, Advaitan Hindus, [[Zen Buddhist]]s, as well as several non-specific perspectives developed in new age philosophy&nbsp;\u2014 which hold that all humans are in [[essence]] divine, or unified with the Divine in a non-trivial way. Such divinity, in these faiths, would express itself naturally if it were not obscured by the social and physical worlds we live in; it needs to be brought to the fore through appropriate [[spiritual practice]]s.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.crimsoncircle.com/AboutUs/AboutTobias/TheAwakeningSigns.aspx \"Twelve Signs of Your Awakening Divinity\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223313/http://www.crimsoncircle.com/AboutUs/AboutTobias/TheAwakeningSigns.aspx |date=December 2, 2013 }} by Geoffrey Hoppe and Tobias</ref>\n\n== Christianity ==\n\nIn traditional [[Christian theology]], the concept and nature of divinity always has its source ultimately from God himself. It's the state or quality of being divine, and the term can denote Godly nature or character.  In Hebrew, the terms would usually be \"[[El (deity)|el]]\", \"[[elohim]]\", and in Greek usually \"theos\", or \"theias\". The divinity in the Bible is considered the Godhead itself, or God in general. Or it may have reference to a deity.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/divinity divinity] - The Free Dictionary.</ref> Even angels in the [[Psalms]] are considered divine or ''elohim'', as spirit beings, in God's form. Redeemed Christians [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again]] or believers, according to Biblical verses, are said to partake of the \"divine nature\" through the \"exceeding great and precious promises\" of Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:4).\n\nIn the [[Christian Greek Scriptures]] of the Bible, the Greek word \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd (''theion'') in the [[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible|Douay Version]], is translated as \"divinity\". Examples are below:\n* Acts 17:29\n:\"Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.\"\n* Romans 1:20\n:\"For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.\"\n* Revelation 5:12\n:\"Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.\"\n\nThe word translated as either \"deity\", \"Godhead\", or \"divinity\" in the Greek New Testament is also the Greek word \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (''theot\u0113tos''), and the one Verse that contains it is this:\nColossians 2:9\n:\"Quia in ipso inhabitat omnis plenitudo divinitatis [divinity] corporaliter.\" (Vulgate)\n:\"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.\" (KJV)\n:\"Because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily.\" (NWT)\n:\"For in him all the fullness of deity lives in bodily form.\" (NET)\n:\"For the full content of divine nature lives in Christ.\" (TEV)\n\nThe word \"divine\" in the New Testament is the Greek word \u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (''theias''), and is the adjective form of \"divinity\". Biblical examples from the [[King James Bible]] are below:\n* 2 Peter 1:3\n:\"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.\"\n* 2 Peter 1:4\n:\"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\"\n\n=== Latter-day Saints ===\n{{main article|God in Mormonism|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon cosmology}}\n\nThe most prominent conception of divine entities in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]], a divine council of three distinct beings: [[Elohim]] ([[God the Father|the Father]]), [[Jehovah]] ([[God the Son|the Son]], or [[Jesus]]), and the [[Holy Spirit (Christian denominational variations)#Latter Day Saints|Holy Spirit]].

Although an optical imaging system can precisely [[Focus (optics)|focus]] on only one plane at a time, the decrease in sharpness is gradual on each side of the POF, so that within the DOF the unsharpness is imperceptible under normal viewing conditions.\n\nIn some cases, it may be desirable to have the entire image sharp, and a large DOF is appropriate. In other cases, a small DOF may be more effective, emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the foreground and background. In [[cinematography]], a large DOF is often called [[deep focus]], and a small DOF is often called [[shallow focus]].\n\n==Circle of confusion criterion for depth of field==\n[[Image:DOF-ShallowDepthofField.jpg|thumb|A [[Macro photography|macro photograph]] with very shallow depth of field]]\n[[File:Glass ochem dof2.png|thumb|Digital techniques, such as [[ray-tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], can also render 3D models with shallow depth of field for the same effect.]]\nPrecise focus is possible in only one two-dimensional plane; in that plane, a point object will produce a point image.<ref>Strictly, because of lens [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]] and [[diffraction]], a point object in precise focus is imaged not as a point but rather as a small spot, often called the ''least circle of confusion''. For most treatments of DOF, including this article, the assumption of a point is sufficient.</ref> In any other plane, a point object is ''[[Defocus aberration|defocus]]ed'', and will produce a blur spot shaped like the [[aperture]], which for the purpose of analysis is usually assumed to be circular. When this circular spot is sufficiently small, it is indistinguishable from a point, and appears to be in focus; it is rendered as \"acceptably sharp\". The diameter of the circle increases with distance from the plane of focus; the largest circle that is indistinguishable from a point is known as the ''[[acceptable circle of confusion]]'', or informally, simply as the ''[[circle of confusion]]''. The acceptable circle of confusion is influenced by visual acuity, viewing conditions, and the amount by which the image is enlarged ([[#CITEREFRay2000|Ray 2000]], 52\u201353). The increase of the circle diameter with defocus is gradual, so the limits of depth of field are not hard boundaries between sharp and unsharp.\n\n===Motion picture===\n\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 120\n | image1 = Povray focal blur animation.gif\n | alt1 = Changing a camera's aperture in half-stops\n | width2 = 120\n | image2 = Povray focal blur animation mode tan.gif\n | alt2 = Changing a camera's aperture from zero to infinity\n | total_width = 300\n | footer = Simulation of the effect of changing a camera's aperture in half-stops (at left) and from zero to infinity (at right)\n}}\n\nFor [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm]] motion pictures, the image area on the film is roughly 22&nbsp;mm by 16&nbsp;mm.

Because the human eye is capable of resolving a spot with diameter about 1/4&nbsp;mm at 25&nbsp;cm distance from the viewing eye, and the 35&nbsp;mm negative needs about an 8X enlargement to make an 8x10 inch print, it is sometimes argued that the criterion should be about 1/32&nbsp;mm on the 35mm negative, but 1/30&nbsp;mm is close enough.<ref>Harold Merklinger, p13</ref>\n\nFor 6x6 cm format enlarged to 8x8 inches and viewed at 25&nbsp;cm, the enlargement is 3.4X, hence the circle of confusion criterion is about 1/(3.4 x 4) = 0.07&nbsp;mm.\n\nSimilarly, for subminiature photography (for example the [[Tessina]]) with a frame format of 14x21mm, 8x12 inches corresponds to 14.5X enlargement, hence circle of confusion limit about 0.017&nbsp;mm.\n\nMany sources propose CoC limits as a fraction of the film format diagonal, typically 1/1000 in the early twentieth century to 1/1500 more recently. The three formats above at fraction 1/1500 would use 0.029 (about 1/32), 0.056, and 0.017&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hornberg|first1=Alexander|title=Handbook of Machine Vision|date=2007|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9783527610143|page=250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HEy4UBoGF2UC&pg=PA250&dq=circle-of-confusion+format+diagonal&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig45jhwY_LAhVW12MKHa4zDJ8Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=circle-of-confusion%20format%20diagonal&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Object field methods===\nTraditional depth-of-field formulas and tables assume equal circles of confusion for near and far objects. Some authors, such as [[#CITEREFMerklinger1992|Merklinger (1992)]],<ref>Englander describes a similar approach in his paper [http://www.englander-workshops.com/documents/depth.pdf Apparent Depth of Field: Practical Use in Landscape Photography]. (PDF); Conrad discusses this approach, under Different Circles of Confusion for Near and Far Limits of Depth of Field, and The Object Field Method, in [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/articles/DoFinDepth.pdf Depth of Field in Depth] (PDF)</ref> have suggested that distant objects often need to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, do not need to be so sharp. The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the [[hyperfocal distance]], sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a [[Bollard#Road bollard|traffic bollard]] in the foreground, this approach, termed the ''object field method'' by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.\n\nOther authors ([[#CITEREFAdams1980|Adams 1980]], 51) have taken the opposite position, maintaining that slight unsharpness in foreground objects is usually more disturbing than slight unsharpness in distant parts of a scene.\n\n[[Moritz von Rohr]] also used an object field method, but unlike Merklinger, he used the conventional criterion of a maximum circle of confusion diameter in the image plane, leading to unequal front and rear depths of field.\n\n==Factors affecting depth of field==\n[[Image:lens aperture side.jpg|thumb|A 35&nbsp;mm lens set to [[f-number|''f''/11]]. The depth-of-field scale (top) indicates that a subject which is anywhere between 1 and 2 meters in front of the camera will be rendered acceptably sharp. If the aperture were set to {{f/}}22 instead, everything from just over 0.7&nbsp;meters almost to infinity would appear to be in focus.]]\n[[File:Shallow Depth of Field with Bokeh.jpg|thumb|Out-of-focus highlights have the shape of the lens aperture.]]\n\nSeveral other factors, such as subject matter, movement, camera-to-subject distance, lens [[focal length]], selected lens [[f-number|''f''-number]], [[image sensor format|format size]], and [[circle of confusion]] criteria also influence when a given defocus becomes noticeable. The combination of focal length, subject distance, and format size defines magnification at the film / sensor plane.\n\nDOF is determined by subject [[magnification]] at the film / sensor plane and the selected lens aperture or ''f''-number. For a given ''f''-number, increasing the magnification, either by moving closer to the subject or using a lens of greater focal length, decreases the DOF; decreasing magnification increases DOF. For a given subject magnification, increasing the ''f''-number (decreasing the aperture diameter) increases the DOF; decreasing ''f''-number decreases DOF.\n\nIf the original image is enlarged to make the final image, the circle of confusion in the original image must be smaller than that in the final image by the ratio of enlargement. Cropping an image and enlarging to the same size final image as an uncropped image taken under the same conditions is equivalent to using a smaller format under the same conditions, so the cropped image has less DOF. ([[#CITEREFStroebel1976|Stroebel 1976]], 134, 136\u201337).\n\nWhen focus is set to the [[hyperfocal distance]], the DOF extends from half the hyperfocal distance to infinity, and the DOF is the largest possible for a given ''f''-number.\n\n===Relationship of DOF to format size===\n\nThe comparative DOFs of two different  image sensor format sizes depend on the conditions of the comparison. The DOF for the smaller format can be either more than or less than that for the larger format. In the discussion that follows, it is assumed that the final images from both formats are the same size, are viewed from the same distance, and are judged with the same circle of confusion criterion. (Derivations of the effects of format size are given under [[#Derivation of the DOF formulae|Derivation of the DOF formulae]].)\n\n====\"Same picture\" for both formats====\nWhen the \"same picture\" is taken in two different format sizes from the same distance at the same ''f''-number with lenses that give the same angle of view, and the final images (e.g., in prints, or on a projection screen or electronic display) are the same size, DOF is, to a first approximation, inversely proportional to format size ([[#CITEREFStroebel1976|Stroebel 1976]], 139). Though commonly used when comparing formats, the approximation is valid only when the subject distance is large in comparison with the focal length of the larger format and small in comparison with the hyperfocal distance of the smaller format.\n\nMoreover, the larger the format size, the longer a lens will need to be to capture the same framing as a smaller format. In motion pictures, for example, a frame with a 12 degree horizontal field of view will require a 50&nbsp;mm lens on 16&nbsp;mm film, a 100&nbsp;mm lens on 35&nbsp;mm film, and a 250&nbsp;mm lens on 65&nbsp;mm film. Conversely, using the same focal length lens with each of these formats will yield a progressively wider image as the film format gets larger: a 50&nbsp;mm lens has a horizontal field of view of 12&nbsp;degrees on 16&nbsp;mm film, 23.6&nbsp;degrees on 35&nbsp;mm film, and 55.6&nbsp;degrees on 65&nbsp;mm film. Therefore, because the larger formats require longer lenses than the smaller ones, they will accordingly have a smaller depth of field. Compensations in exposure, framing, or subject distance need to be made in order to make one format look like it was filmed in another format.\n\n====Same focal length for both formats====\nMany small-format [[digital SLR]] camera systems allow using many of the same lenses on both full-frame and \"cropped format\" cameras. If, for the same focal length setting, the subject distance is adjusted to provide the ''same field of view'' at the subject, at the same ''f''-number and final-image size, the smaller format has ''greater'' DOF, as with the \"same picture\" comparison above. If pictures are taken from the ''same distance'' using the same ''f''-number, same focal length, and the final images are the same size, the smaller format has ''less'' DOF. If pictures taken from the same subject distance using the same focal length, are given the ''same enlargement'', both final images will have the ''same'' DOF. The pictures from the two formats will differ because of the different angles of view. If the larger format is cropped to the captured area of the smaller format, the final images will have the same angle of view, have been given the same enlargement, and have the same DOF.\n\n====Same DOF for both formats====\nIn many cases, the DOF is fixed by the requirements of the desired image. For a given DOF and field of view, the required ''f''-number is proportional to the format size. For example, if a 35&nbsp;mm camera required {{f/}}11, a 4\u00d75 camera would require {{f/}}45 to give the same DOF. For the same ISO speed, the exposure time on the 4\u00d75 would be sixteen times as long; if the 35&nbsp;camera required 1/250 second, the 4\u00d75 camera would require 1/15 second. The longer exposure time with the larger camera might result in [[motion blur]], especially with windy conditions, a moving subject, or an unsteady camera.\n\nAdjusting the ''f''-number to the camera format is equivalent to maintaining the same absolute aperture diameter; when set to the same absolute aperture diameters, both formats have the same DOF.\n\nComparison of fast standard lenses in the four main formats when used for portraiture with appropriate circles of confusion to produce an uncropped image at 10x8 inches to be viewed at 25&nbsp;cm show that the following settings with similar aperture diameters produce similar DoF:\n:'''67 medium format''' using a '''90 mm''' lens set to '''f/2.8''' (32 mm aperture) gives a hyperfocal distance (H) of 49m. If focussed on a subject at 2m (s) the depth of field ranges from Dn=1.921m to Df = 2.085m (DoF = 163mm).\n:'''35mm (FX) 50 mm''' lens set to '''f/2''' (25 mm aperture) gives H = 43m. If focussed to 2m the DoF is 1.911 to 2.097m (186mm).\n:'''APSc (DX) 35 mm''' lens set to '''f/1.4''' (25 mm aperture) gives H = 46m. If focussed to 2m the DoF is 1.917 to 2.091m (174mm).\n:'''Four thirds 25 mm''' lens set to '''f/0.95''' (26 mm aperture) gives H = 44m. If focussed to 2m the DoF is 1.913 to 2.095m (183mm).\nFor any of these, doubling the f-number will approximately double the depth of field.\n\n===Camera movements and DOF===\n[[File:Scheimpflug.jpg|thumb|250px|Scheimpflug principle.]]\n\nWhen the lens axis is perpendicular to the [[Film plane|image plane]], as is normally the case, the plane of focus (POF) is parallel to the image plane, and the DOF extends between parallel planes on either side of the POF. When the lens axis is not perpendicular to the image plane, the POF is no longer parallel to the image plane; the ability to rotate the POF is known as the [[Scheimpflug principle]]. Rotation of the POF is accomplished with [[View camera#Movements|camera movements]] (tilt, a rotation of the lens about a horizontal axis, or swing, a rotation about a vertical axis). Tilt and swing are available on most [[view camera]]s, and are also available with specific lenses on some small- and medium-format cameras.\n\nWhen the POF is rotated, the near and far limits of DOF are no longer parallel; the DOF becomes wedge-shaped, with the apex of the wedge nearest the camera ([[#CITEREFMerklinger1993|Merklinger 1993]], 31\u201332; [[#CITEREFTillmanns1997|Tillmanns 1997]], 71). With tilt, the height of the DOF increases with distance from the camera; with swing, the width of the DOF increases with distance.\n\nIn some cases, rotating the POF can better fit the DOF to the scene, and achieve the required sharpness at a smaller <var>f</var>-number. Alternatively, rotating the POF, in combination with a small <var>f</var>-number, can [[Tilted plane focus|minimize]] the part of an image that is within the DOF.\n\n===Effect of lens aperture===\n\n[[Image:Depth of field illustration.svg|thumb|Effect of aperture on blur and DOF. The points in focus&nbsp;('''2''') project points onto the image plane&nbsp;('''5'''), but points at different distances&nbsp;('''1''' and '''3''') project blurred images, or [[circle of confusion|circles of confusion]]. Decreasing the aperture size&nbsp;('''4''') reduces the size of the blur spots for points not in the focused plane, so that the blurring is imperceptible, and all points are within the DOF.]]\n\nFor a given subject framing and camera position, the DOF is controlled by the lens aperture diameter, which is usually specified as the [[f-number]], the ratio of lens focal length to aperture diameter. Reducing the aperture diameter (increasing the <var>f</var>-number) increases the DOF because the [[circle of confusion]] is shrunk directly and indirectly by reducing the light hitting the outside of the lens which is focused to a different point than light hitting the inside of the lens due to [[spherical aberration]] caused by the construction of the lens;<ref>[http://physicssoup.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/why-does-a-small-aperture-increase-depth-of-field/ Why Does a Small Aperture Increase Depth of Field?]</ref> however, it also reduces the amount of light transmitted, and increases [[diffraction]], placing a practical limit on the extent to which DOF can be increased by reducing the aperture diameter.\n\nMotion pictures make only limited use of this control; to produce a consistent image quality from shot to shot, cinematographers usually choose a single aperture setting for interiors and another for exteriors, and adjust exposure through the use of camera filters or light levels. Aperture settings are adjusted more frequently in still photography, where variations in depth of field are used to produce a variety of special effects.{{Multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = \n| width = 250\n| footer = Depth of field for different values of aperture using 50 mm objective lens and full-frame DSLR camera.

First two images illustrate typical DOF of a single image at ''f''/10, while the third image is the composite of 6 images.]]\n\nThe advent of digital technology in photography has provided additional means of controlling the extent of image sharpness; some methods allow extended DOF that would be impossible with traditional techniques, and some allow the DOF to be determined after the image is made.\n\n[[Focus stacking]] is a [[digital image processing]] technique which combines multiple images taken at different focal distances to give a resulting image with a greater depth of field than any of the individual source images. Available programs for multi-shot DOF enhancement include Adobe Photoshop, Syncroscopy AutoMontage, PhotoAcute Studio, [[Helicon Focus]] and [[CombineZ]]. Getting sufficient depth of field can be particularly challenging in [[macro photography]]. The images to the right illustrate the extended DOF that can be achieved by combining multiple images.\n\n[[Wavefront coding]] is a method that convolves rays in such a way that it provides an image where fields are in focus simultaneously with all planes out of focus by a constant amount.\n\nA [[plenoptic camera]] uses a microlens array to capture [[4D light field]] information about a scene.\n\nColour apodization is a technique combining a modified lens design with image processing to achieve an increased depth of field. The lens is modified such that each colour channel has a different lens aperture. For example, the red channel may be ''f''/2.4, green may be ''f''/2.4, whilst the blue channel may be ''f''/5.6. Therefore, the blue channel will have a greater depth of field than the other colours. The image processing identifies blurred regions in the red and green channels and in these regions copies the sharper edge data from the blue channel. The result is an image that combines the best features from the different ''f''-numbers, ([[#CITEREFKay2011|Kay 2011]]).\n\nIn 2013, Nokia implemented DOF control in some of its high-end [[smartphone]]s, called Refocus, which can change a picture's depth of field after the picture is taken. It works best when there are close-up and distant objects in the frame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/18/nokia-lumia-1520-review/ |title=Nokia Lumia 1520 review: the best Windows Phone device yet |date=November 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Diffraction and DOF===\n{{see also|Rayleigh length}}\n\nIf the camera position and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, the only means of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large [[f-number|<var>f</var>-number]]. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the [[defocus aberration|defocus]] blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits ([[#CITEREFGibson1975|Gibson 1975]], 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.\n\nFor general photography, diffraction at DOF limits typically becomes significant only at fairly large <var>f</var>-numbers; because large <var>f</var>-numbers typically require long exposure times, [[motion blur]] may cause greater loss of sharpness than the loss from diffraction. The size of the diffraction blur spot depends on the effective <var>f</var>-number <math>N \\left ( 1 + m \\right )</math>, however, so diffraction is a greater issue in close-up photography, and the tradeoff between DOF and overall sharpness can become quite noticeable ([[#CITEREFGibson1975|Gibson 1975]], 53; [[#CITEREFLefkowitz1979|Lefkowitz 1979]], 84).\n\n==DOF scales==\n[[File:DOF scale detail.png|thumb|Detail from the lens shown above. The point half-way between the 1&nbsp;m and 2&nbsp;m marks represents approximately 1.3&nbsp;m.]]\n[[File:TessinaDOF.jpg|thumb|DOF scale on Tessina focusing dial]]\n\nMany lenses for small- and medium-format cameras include scales that indicate the DOF for a given focus distance and <var>f</var>-number; the 35&nbsp;mm lens in the image is typical. That lens includes distance scales in feet and meters; when a marked distance is set opposite the large white index mark, the focus is set to that distance. The DOF scale below the distance scales includes markings on either side of the index that correspond to <var>f</var>-numbers. When the lens is set to a given <var>f</var>-number, the DOF extends between the distances that align with the <var>f</var>-number markings.\n\nSome cameras have the DOF scale not on lens barrel, but on focusing knob or dial; for example, the Rolleiflex TLR has its DOF scale on the focusing knob; the subminiature camera [[Tessina]] has DOF a scale on the focusing dial.\n\n==Zone focusing==\n{{see also|Zone focus}}\n\nWhen the 35&nbsp;mm lens above is set to <var>f</var>/11 and focused at approximately 1.3&nbsp;m, the DOF (a \"zone\" of acceptable sharpness) extends from 1&nbsp;m to 2&nbsp;m. Conversely, the required focus and <var>f</var>-number can be determined from the desired DOF limits by locating the near and far DOF limits on the lens distance scale and setting focus so that the index mark is centered between the near and far distance marks. The required <var>f</var>-number is determined by finding the markings on the DOF scale that are closest to the near and far distance marks ([[#CITEREFRay1994|Ray 1994]], 315). For the 35&nbsp;mm lens above, if it were desired for the DOF to extend from 1&nbsp;m to 2&nbsp;m, focus would be set so that index mark was centered between the marks for those distances, and the aperture would be set to <var>f</var>/11.\n\nThe focus so determined would be about 1.3&nbsp;m, the approximate [[harmonic mean]] of the near and far distances.<ref>The focus distance to have the DOF extend between given near and far object distances is the harmonic mean of the ''object conjugates''. Most helicoid-focused lenses are marked with image plane\u2013to\u2013subject distances, so the focus determined from the lens distance scale is not exactly the harmonic mean of the marked near and far distances.</ref> See the section [[#Focus and f-number from DOF limits|Focus and ''f''-number from DOF limits]] for additional discussion.\n\nIf the marks for the near and far distances fall outside the marks for the largest <var>f</var>-number on the DOF scale, the desired DOF cannot be obtained; for example, with the 35&nbsp;mm lens above, it is not possible to have the DOF extend from 0.7&nbsp;m to infinity. The DOF limits can be determined visually, by focusing on the farthest object to be within the DOF and noting the distance mark on the lens distance scale, and repeating the process for the nearest object to be within the DOF.\n\nSome distance scales have markings for only a few distances; for example, the 35&nbsp;mm lens above shows only 3&nbsp;ft and 5&nbsp;ft on its upper scale. Using other distances for DOF limits requires visual interpolation between marked distances. Since the distance scale is nonlinear, accurate interpolation can be difficult. In most cases, English and metric distance markings are not coincident, so using both scales to note focused distances can sometimes lessen the need for interpolation. Many [[autofocus]] lenses have smaller distance and DOF scales and fewer markings than do comparable manual-focus lenses, so that determining focus and <var>f</var>-number from the scales on an autofocus lens may be more difficult than with a comparable manual-focus lens. In most cases, determining these settings using the lens DOF scales on an autofocus lens requires that the lens or camera body be set to manual focus.<ref>Higher-end models in the [[Canon EOS]] line of cameras included a feature called depth-of-field AE (DEP) that set focus and <var>f</var>-number from user-determined near and far points in much the same manner as using DOF scales on manual-focus lenses ([[#CITEREFCanonInc.2000|Canon Inc. 2000]], 61\u201362). The feature has not been included on models introduced after April 2004.</ref>\n\nOn a view camera, the focus and <var>f</var>-number can be obtained by measuring the ''[[Depth of field#Focus and f-number from DOF limits|focus spread]]'' and performing simple calculations. The procedure is described in more detail in the section [[Depth of field#Focus and f-number from DOF limits|Focus and <var>f</var>-number from DOF limits]]. Some view cameras include DOF calculators that indicate focus and <var>f</var>-number without the need for any calculations by the photographer ([[#CITEREFTillmanns1997|Tillmanns 1997]], 67\u201368; [[#CITEREFRay2002|Ray 2002]], 230\u201331).\n\n==Hyperfocal distance==\n[[File:Minox LX hyperfocal.JPG|thumb|Minox LX camera with hyperfocal red dot]]\n\nThe [[hyperfocal distance]] is the nearest focal distance at which the DOF extends to infinity; focusing the camera at the hyperfocal distance results in the largest possible depth of field for a given <var>f</var>-number ([[#CITEREFRay2000|Ray 2000]], 55). Focusing ''beyond'' the hyperfocal distance does not increase the far DOF (which already extends to infinity), but it does decrease the DOF in front of the subject, decreasing the total DOF. Some photographers consider this wasting DOF; however, see [[#Object_field_methods|Object field methods]] above for a rationale for doing so. Focusing on the hyperfocal distance is a special case of zone focusing in which the far limit of DOF is at infinity.\n\nIf the lens includes a DOF scale, the hyperfocal distance can be set by aligning the infinity mark on the distance scale with the mark on the DOF scale corresponding to the <var>f</var>-number to which the lens is set. For example, with the 35&nbsp;mm lens shown above set to <var>f</var>/11, aligning the infinity mark with the \"11\" to the left of the index mark on the DOF scale would set the focus to the hyperfocal distance.\n\n===Hyperfocusing===\n[[File:Contessa hyperfocal.JPG|thumb|Zeiss Ikon Contessa with red marks for hyperfocal distance 20&nbsp;ft at {{f/}}8]]\n\nSome cameras have their hyperfocal distance marked on the focus dial. For example, on the Minox LX focusing dial there is a red dot between 2 m and infinity; when the lens is set at the red dot, that is, focused at the hyperfocal distance, the depth of field stretches from 2 m to infinity.\n\nThe Zeiss Ikon Contessa camera has 20&nbsp;ft marked in red and aperture {{f/}}8 marked in red; this is the snapshot hyperfocal setting.\n\n==Limited DOF: selective focus==\n\n[[Image:Jonquil flowers at f32.jpg|thumb|At {{f/}}32, the background competes for the viewer's attention.]]\n[[Image:Jonquil flowers at f5.jpg|thumb|At {{f/}}5.6, the flowers are isolated from the background.]]\n[[Image:Kittyplya03042006.JPG|thumb|At {{f/}}2.8, the cat's face is isolated from the background and its paw in the foreground.]]\n\nDepth of field can be anywhere from a fraction of a millimeter to virtually infinite. In some cases, such as landscapes, it may be desirable to have the entire image sharp, and a large DOF is appropriate. In other cases, artistic considerations may dictate that only a part of the image be in focus, emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the background, perhaps giving only a suggestion of the environment ([[#CITEREFLangford1973|Langford 1973]], 81). For example, a common technique in [[melodrama]]s and [[horror film]]s is a closeup of a person's face, with someone just behind that person visible but out of focus. A [[portrait]] or [[macro photography|close-up]] still photograph might use a small DOF to isolate the subject from a distracting background. The use of limited DOF to emphasize one part of an image is known as ''selective focus'', ''differential focus'' or ''[[shallow focus]]''.\n\nAlthough a small DOF implies that other parts of the image will be unsharp, it does not, by itself, determine ''how'' unsharp those parts will be. The amount of background (or foreground) blur depends on the distance from the plane of focus, so if a background is close to the subject, it may be difficult to blur sufficiently even with a small DOF. In practice, the lens <var>f</var>-number is usually adjusted until the background or foreground is acceptably blurred, often without direct concern for the DOF.\n\nSometimes, however, it is desirable to have the entire subject sharp while ensuring that the background is sufficiently unsharp. When the distance between subject and background is fixed, as is the case with many scenes, the DOF and the amount of background blur are not independent. Although it is not always possible to achieve both the desired subject sharpness and the desired background unsharpness, several techniques can be used to increase the separation of subject and background.\n\nFor a given scene and subject magnification, the background blur increases with lens focal length. If it is not important that background objects be unrecognizable, background de-emphasis can be increased by using a lens of longer focal length and increasing the subject distance to maintain the same magnification. This technique requires that sufficient space in front of the subject be available; moreover, the perspective of the scene changes because of the different camera position, and this may or may not be acceptable.\n\nThe situation is not as simple if it is important that a background object, such as a sign, be unrecognizable. The magnification of background objects also increases with focal length, so with the technique just described, there is little change in the recognizability of background objects.<ref>Using the [[#Object field methods|object field method]], [[#CITEREFMerklinger1992|Merklinger (1992)]], (32\u201335) describes a situation in which a portrait subject is to be sharp but a distracting sign in the background is to be unrecognizable. He concludes that with the subject and background distances fixed, no <var>f</var>-number will achieve both objectives, and that using a lens of different focal length will make no difference in the result.</ref> However, a lens of longer focal length may still be of some help; because of the narrower angle of view, a slight change of camera position may suffice to eliminate the distracting object from the field of view.\n\nAlthough tilt and swing are normally used to maximize the part of the image that is within the DOF, they also can be used, in combination with a small <var>f</var>-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be interesting because it differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.\n\n==Near:far distribution==\n\nThe DOF beyond the subject is always greater than the DOF in front of the subject. When the subject is at the hyperfocal distance or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, so the ratio is 1:\u221e; as the subject distance decreases, near:far DOF ratio increases, approaching unity at high magnification. For large apertures at typical portrait distances, the ratio is still close to 1:1. The oft-cited rule that 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and 2/3 is beyond (a 1:2 ratio) is true only when the subject distance is 1/3 the hyperfocal distance.\n\n==Optimal <var>f</var>-number==\n{{see also|Optimal aperture}}\n\nAs a lens is stopped down, the defocus blur at the DOF limits decreases but diffraction blur increases. The presence of these two opposing factors implies a point at which the combined blur spot is minimized ([[#CITEREFGibson1975|Gibson 1975]], 64); at that point, the <var>f</var>-number is optimal for image sharpness.\nIf the final image is viewed under normal conditions (e.g., an 8\u2033\u00d710\u2033 image viewed at 10\u2033), it may suffice to determine the <var>f</var>-number using criteria for minimum required sharpness, and there may be no practical benefit from further reducing the size of the blur spot. But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size ([[#CITEREFHansma1996|Hansma 1996]]). Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may not be known when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable sharpness allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time.\n\n===Determining combined defocus and diffraction===\n\n[[#CITEREFHansma1996|Hansma (1996)]] and [[#CITEREFPeterson1996|Peterson (1996)]] have discussed determining the combined effects of defocus and diffraction using a root-square combination of the individual blur spots. Hansma's approach determines the <var>f</var>-number that will give the maximum possible sharpness; Peterson's approach determines the minimum <var>f</var>-number that will give the desired sharpness in the final image, and yields a maximum focus spread for which the desired sharpness can be achieved.<ref>Peterson does not give a closed-form expression for the minimum <var>f</var>-number, though such an expression obtains from simple algebraic manipulation of his Equation&nbsp;3.</ref> In combination, the two methods can be regarded as giving a maximum and minimum <var>f</var>-number for a given situation, with the photographer free to choose any value within the range, as conditions (e.g., potential motion blur) permit. [[#CITEREFGibson1975|Gibson (1975)]], 64) gives a similar discussion, additionally considering blurring effects of camera lens aberrations, enlarging lens diffraction and aberrations, the negative emulsion, and the printing paper.<ref>The analytical section at the end of [[#CITEREFGibson1975|Gibson (1975)]] was originally published as \"Magnification and Depth of Detail in Photomacrography\" in the ''Journal of the Photographic Society of America'', Vol. 26, No. 6, June 1960.</ref> [[#CITEREFCouzin1982|Couzin (1982)]] gave a formula essentially the same as Hansma's for optimal ''f''-number, but did not discuss its derivation.\n\n[[#CITEREFHopkins1955|Hopkins (1955)]], [[#CITEREFStokseth1969|Stokseth (1969)]], and [[#CITEREFWilliamsBecklund1989|Williams and Becklund (1989)]] have discussed the combined effects using the [[modulation transfer function]].<ref>\"[http://www.largeformatphotography.info/articles/DoFinDepth.pdf Depth of Field in Depth]\", Jeff Conrad</ref><ref>\"[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/rec-photo/lenses/tutorial/ Photographic Lenses Tutorial]\", David M.

The difficulty is that the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] surface is not perfectly flat, but may vary by several [[micrometre]]s. Even this small variation causes some distortion in the projected image, and results in unwanted variations in the resulting pattern. Thus photolithography engineers take extreme measures to maximize the optical depth of field of the photolithography equipment. To minimize this distortion further, semiconductor manufacturers may use [[chemical mechanical polish]]ing to make the wafer surface even flatter before lithographic patterning.\n\n===Ophthalmology and optometry===\nA person may sometimes experience better vision in daylight than at night because of an increased depth of field due to constriction of the pupil (i.e., [[miosis]]).\n\n==DOF formulae==\n\nThe basis of these formulas is given in the section [[#Derivation of the DOF formulae|Derivation of the DOF formulae]];<ref>Derivations of DOF formulas are given in many texts, including [[#CITEREFLarmore1965|Larmore (1965)]], 161\u2013166), [[#CITEREFRay2000|Ray (2000]], 53\u201356), and [[#CITEREFRay2002|Ray (2002)]], 217\u2013220).

When <math>s</math> is large in comparison with the lens focal length, the distance <math>D_{\\mathrm N}</math> from the camera to the near limit of DOF and the distance <math>D_{\\mathrm F}</math> from the camera to the far limit of DOF are\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm N} \\approx \\frac {H s} {H + s}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm F} \\approx \\frac {H s} {H - s} \\text{ for } s < H.</math>\n\nThe depth of field <math>D_{\\mathrm F} - D_{\\mathrm N}</math> is\n\n:<math>\n\\text{DOF} \\approx \\frac{2 Hs^2}{H^2 - s^2} \\text{ for } s < H.\n</math>\n\nSubstituting for <math>H</math> and rearranging, DOF can be expressed as\n\n:<math>\\text{DOF} \\approx \\frac{2 N c f^2 s^2}{f^4 - N^2 c^2 s^2}.</math>\n\nThus, for a given image format, depth of field is determined by three factors: the focal length of the lens, the <var>f</var>-number of the lens opening (the aperture), and the camera-to-subject distance.\n\nWhen the subject distance is the hyperfocal distance,\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm F} = \\infty</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm N} = \\frac H 2.</math>\n\nFor <math>s \\ge H</math>, the far limit of DOF is at infinity and the DOF is infinite; of course, only objects at or beyond the near limit of DOF will be recorded with acceptable sharpness.\n\n===Close-up===\n[[Image:Depth of field Nov 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[integrated circuit]] package, which is in focus in this macro shot, is 2.5&nbsp;mm higher than the circuit board it is mounted on. In [[macro photography]] objects at even small distances from the plane of focus can be unsharp. At {{f/}}32 every object is within the DOF, whereas the closer to {{f/}}5 the aperture gets, the fewer the objects that are sharp. There is a tradeoff, however: at {{f/}}32, the lettering on the IC package is noticeably softer than at {{f/}}5 because of diffraction. At {{f/}}5 the small dust particles at the bottom right corner form blur spots in the shape of the aperture stop. The images were taken with a 105&nbsp;mm {{f/}}2.8 [[macro lens]].]]\n\nWhen the subject distance <math>s</math> approaches the focal length, using the formulas given above can result in significant errors. For close-up work, the hyperfocal distance has little applicability, and it usually is more convenient to express DOF in terms of image magnification. Let <math>m</math> be the magnification; when the subject distance is small in comparison with the hyperfocal distance,\n\n:<math>\\text{DOF} \\approx 2 N c \\, \\frac{m + 1}{m^2},</math>\n\nso that for a given magnification, DOF is independent of focal length. In other words, for the same subject magnification, at the same ''f''-number, all focal lengths used on a given image format give approximately the same DOF.\n\nThe discussion thus far has assumed a symmetrical lens for which the entrance and exit [[pupil (optics)|pupil]]s coincide with the front and rear [[Nodal point#Nodal points|nodal planes]], and for which the [[pupil magnification]] (the ratio of [[exit pupil]] diameter to that of the [[entrance pupil]])<ref>A well-illustrated discussion of pupils and pupil magnification that assumes minimal knowledge of optics and mathematics is given in [[#CITEREFShipman1977|Shipman (1977)]], 144\u2013147).</ref> is unity. Although this assumption usually is reasonable for large-format lenses, it often is invalid for medium- and small-format lenses.\n\nWhen <math>s \\ll H</math>, the DOF for an asymmetrical lens is\n\n:<math>\\text{DOF} \\approx \\frac {2 N c (1 + m/P)}{m^2},</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math> is the pupil magnification. When the pupil magnification is unity, this equation reduces to that for a symmetrical lens.\n\nExcept for close-up and macro photography, the effect of lens asymmetry is minimal. At unity magnification, however, the errors from neglecting the pupil magnification can be significant. Consider a telephoto lens with <math>P = 0.5</math> and a retrofocus wide-angle lens with <math>P = 2</math>, at <math>m = 1.0</math>. The asymmetrical-lens formula gives <math>\\text{DOF} = 6 N c</math> and <math>\\text{DOF} = 3 N c</math> respectively. The symmetrical lens formula gives <math>\\text{DOF} = 4 N c</math> in either case. The errors are \u221233% and 33% respectively.\n\nIf only [[Numerical aperture#Working (effective) f-number|working <var>f</var>-number]] is directly available, the following formula can be used instead:\n\n:<math>\\text{DOF} \\approx \\frac{2 N_w c}{m^2}.</math>\n\n===Focus and <var>f</var>-number from DOF limits===\n\nFor given near and far DOF limits <math>D_{\\mathrm N}</math> and <math>D_{\\mathrm F}</math>, the required [[f-number|<var>f</var>-number]] is smallest when focus is set to\n\n:<math>s = \\frac{2 D_{\\mathrm N} D_{\\mathrm F}}{D_{\\mathrm N} +  D_{\\mathrm F}},</math>\n\nthe [[harmonic mean]] of the near and far distances. When the subject distance is large in comparison with the lens focal length, the required <var>f</var>-number is\n\n:<math>N \\approx \\frac{f^2}{c} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm F} - D_{\\mathrm N}}{2 D_{\\mathrm N} D_{\\mathrm F}}.</math>\n\nWhen the far limit of DOF is at infinity,\n\n:<math>s = 2 D_\\mathrm N</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>N \\approx \\frac{f^2}{c} \\frac{1}{2 D_{\\mathrm N}}.</math>\n\nIn practice, these settings usually are determined on the image side of the lens, using measurements on the bed or rail with a view camera, or using lens DOF scales on manual-focus lenses for small- and medium-format cameras. If <math>v_{\\mathrm N}</math> and <math>v_{\\mathrm F}</math> are the image distances that correspond to the near and far limits of DOF, the required <var>f</var>-number is minimized when the image distance\n<math>v</math> is\n\n:<math>v \\approx \\frac{v_{\\mathrm N} + v_{\\mathrm F}}{2}\n= v_{\\mathrm F} + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F}}{2}.\n</math>\n\nIn practical terms, focus is set to halfway between the near and far image distances. The required <var>f</var>-number is\n\n:<math>N \\approx \\frac{v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F}}{2 c}.</math>\n\nThe image distances are measured from the camera's image plane to the lens's image nodal plane, which is not always easy to locate. In most cases, focus and <var>f</var>-number can be determined with sufficient accuracy using the approximate formulas above, which require only the difference between the near and far image distances; view camera users sometimes refer to the difference <math>v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F}</math> as the ''focus spread'' ([[#CITEREFHansma1996|Hansma 1996]], 55). Most lens DOF scales are based on the same concept.\n\nThe focus spread is related to the [[depth of focus]]. [[#CITEREFRay2000|Ray (2000]], 56) gives two definitions of the latter. The first is the tolerance of the position of the image plane for which an object remains acceptably sharp; the second is that the limits of depth of focus are the image-side conjugates of the near and far limits of DOF. With the first definition, focus spread and depth of focus are usually close in value though conceptually different. With the second definition, focus spread and depth of focus are the same.\n\n===Foreground and background blur===\n\nIf a subject is at distance <math>s</math> and the foreground or background is at distance <math>D</math>, let the distance between the subject and the foreground or background be indicated by\n\n:<math>x_{\\mathrm d} = |D - s|.</math>\n\nThe blur disk diameter <math>b</math> of a detail at distance <math>x_\\mathrm{d}</math> from the subject can be expressed as a function of the subject magnification <math>m_\\mathrm{s}</math>, focal length <math>f</math>, [[F-number|<var>f</var>-number]] <math>N</math> or alternatively the diameter of the entrance pupil <math>d</math> (often called the aperture) according to\n\n:<math>b = \\frac{fm_\\mathrm s}{N} \\frac{x_\\mathrm{d}}{s \\pm x_\\mathrm{d}} = dm_\\mathrm{s} \\frac{x_\\mathrm{d}}{D}.</math>\n\nThe minus sign applies to a foreground object, and the plus sign applies to a background object.\n\nThe blur increases with the distance from the subject; when <math>b \\le c</math>, the detail is within the depth of field, and the blur is imperceptible. If the detail is only slightly outside the DOF, the blur may be only barely perceptible.\n\nFor a given subject magnification, <var>f</var>-number, and distance from the subject of the foreground or background detail, the degree of detail blur varies with the lens focal length. For a background detail, the blur increases with focal length; for a foreground detail, the blur decreases with focal length. For a given scene, the positions of the subject, foreground, and background usually are fixed, and the distance between subject and the foreground or background remains constant regardless of the camera position; however, to maintain constant magnification, the subject distance must vary if the focal length is changed. For small distance between the foreground or background detail, the effect of focal length is small; for large distance, the effect can be significant. For a reasonably distant background detail, the blur disk diameter is\n\n:<math>b \\approx \\frac{fm_\\mathrm{s}}{N},</math>\n\ndepending only on focal length.\n\nThe blur diameter of foreground details is very large if the details are close to the lens.\n\nThe magnification of the detail also varies with focal length; for a given detail, the ratio of the blur disk diameter to imaged size of the detail is independent of focal length, depending only on the detail size and its distance from the subject. This ratio can be useful when it is important that the background be recognizable (as usually is the case in evidence or surveillance photography), or unrecognizable (as might be the case for a pictorial photographer using selective focus to isolate the subject from a distracting background). As a general rule, an object is recognizable if the blur disk diameter is one-tenth to one-fifth the size of the object or smaller ([[#CITEREFWilliams1990|Williams 1990]], 205),<ref>Williams gives the criteria for object recognition in terms of the system resolution. When resolution is limited by defocus blur, as in the context of DOF, the resolution is the blur disk diameter; when resolution is limited by diffraction, the resolution is the radius of the [[Airy disk]], according to the [[Rayleigh criterion]].</ref> and unrecognizable when the blur disk diameter is the object size or greater.\n\nThe effect of focal length on background blur is illustrated in van Walree's article on [http://toothwalker.org/optics/dof.html#backgroundblur Depth of field].\n\n===Practical complications===\n\nThe distance scales on most medium- and small-format lenses indicate distance from the camera's [[Film plane|image plane]]. Most DOF formulas, including those in this article, use the object distance <math>s</math> from the lens's [[Nodal planes#Focal points and planes|front nodal plane]], which often is not easy to locate. Moreover, for many zoom lenses and internal-focusing non-zoom lenses, the location of the front nodal plane, as well as focal length, changes with subject distance. When the subject distance is large in comparison with the lens focal length, the exact location of the front nodal plane is not critical; the distance is essentially the same whether measured from the front of the lens, the image plane, or the actual nodal plane. The same is not true for close-up photography; at unity magnification, a slight error in the location of the front nodal plane can result in a DOF error greater than the errors from any approximations in the DOF equations.\n\nThe asymmetrical lens formulas require knowledge of the pupil magnification, which usually is not specified for medium- and small-format lenses. The pupil magnification can be estimated by looking into the front and rear of the lens and measuring the diameters of the apparent apertures, and computing the ratio of rear diameter to front diameter ([[#CITEREFShipman1977|Shipman 1977]], 144). However, for many zoom lenses and internal-focusing non-zoom lenses, the pupil magnification changes with subject distance, and several measurements may be required.\n\n===Limitations===\n\nMost DOF formulas, including those discussed in this article, employ several simplifications:\n# [[Paraxial approximation|Paraxial]] ([[Gaussian optics|Gaussian]]) optics is assumed, and technically, the formulas are valid only for rays that are infinitesimally close to the lens axis. However, Gaussian optics usually is more than adequate for determining DOF, and non-paraxial formulas are sufficiently complex that requiring their use would make determination of DOF impractical in most cases.\n# Lens [[aberration in optical systems|aberrations]] are ignored. Including the effects of aberrations is nearly impossible, because doing so requires knowledge of the specific lens design. Moreover, in well-designed lenses, most aberrations are well corrected, and at least near the [[optical axis]], often are almost negligible when the lens is stopped down 2\u20133 steps from maximum aperture. Because lenses usually are stopped down at least to this point when DOF is of interest, ignoring aberrations usually is reasonable. Not all aberrations are reduced by stopping down, however, so actual sharpness may be slightly less than predicted by DOF formulas.\n# [[Diffraction]] is ignored. DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large [[f-number|<var>f</var>-number]]. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true, as is discussed further in the section [[#Diffraction and DOF|Diffraction and DOF]].\n# For digital capture with color filter array sensors, [[demosaicing]] is ignored. Demosaicing alone would normally decrease sharpness, but the demosaicing algorithm used might also include sharpening.\n# Post-capture manipulation of the image is ignored. Sharpening via techniques such as [[deconvolution]] or [[Unsharp masking|unsharp mask]] can increase the apparent sharpness in the final image; conversely, [[image noise reduction]] can reduce sharpness.\n# The resolutions of the imaging medium and the display medium are ignored. If the resolution of either medium is of the same order of magnitude as the optical resolution, the sharpness of the final image is reduced, and optical blurring is harder to detect.\n\nThe lens designer cannot restrict analysis to Gaussian optics and cannot ignore lens aberrations. However, the requirements of practical photography are less demanding than those of lens design, and despite the simplifications employed in development of most DOF formulas, these formulas have proven useful in determining camera settings that result in acceptably sharp pictures. It should be recognized that DOF limits are not hard boundaries between sharp and unsharp, and that there is little point in determining DOF limits to a precision of many significant figures.\n\n==Derivation of the DOF formulae==\n[[Image:DoF-sym.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|DOF for symmetrical lens]]\n\n===DOF limits===\nA symmetrical lens is illustrated at right. The subject, at distance <math>s</math>, is in focus at image distance <math>v</math>. Point objects \nat distances <math>D_\\mathrm F</math> and <math>D_\\mathrm N</math> would be in focus at image distances <math>v_\\mathrm F</math> and <math>v_\\mathrm N</math>, respectively; at image distance <math>v</math>, they are imaged as blur spots. The depth of field is controlled by the aperture stop diameter <math>d</math>; when the blur spot diameter is equal to the acceptable [[circle of confusion]] <math>c</math>, the near and far limits of DOF are at <math>D_\\mathrm N</math> and <math>D_\\mathrm F</math>.

Substituting\n\n:<math>s = \\frac {m + 1} {m} f</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>s - f = \\frac {f} {m}</math>\n\ninto the formula for DOF and rearranging gives\n\n:<math>\n\\mathrm {DOF} = \\frac\n{2 f ( m + 1 ) / m }\n{ ( f m ) / ( N c ) - ( N c ) / ( f m ) },\n</math>\n\nafter [[#CITEREFLarmore1965|Larmore (1965)]], 163).\n\n===DOF vs. focal length===\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of the exact formula above by\n\n:<math>\\frac {N c m} {f}</math>\n\ngives\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF} = \\frac\n{2 N c \\left ( m + 1 \\right )}\n{m^2 - \\left ( \\frac {N c} {f} \\right )^2}.\n</math>\n\nIf the ''f''-number and circle of confusion are constant, decreasing the focal length <math>f</math> increases the second term in the denominator, decreasing the denominator and increasing the value of the right-hand side, so that a shorter focal length gives greater DOF.\n\nThe term in parentheses in the denominator is the hyperfocal magnification <math>m_\\mathrm{h}</math>, so that\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF} = \\frac\n{2 N c \\left ( m + 1 \\right )}\n{m^2 - m^2_{\\mathrm{h}} }.\n</math>\n\nAs subject distance is decreased, the subject magnification increases, and eventually becomes large in comparison with the hyperfocal magnification. Thus the effect of focal length is greatest near the hyperfocal distance, and decreases as subject distance is decreased. However, the near/far perspective will differ for different focal lengths, so the difference in DOF may not be readily apparent.\n\nWhen <math>s \\ll H</math>, <math>m^2_\\mathrm{h} \\ll m^2</math>, and\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF} \\approx 2 N c \\, \\frac {m + 1} {m^2},</math>\n\nso that for a given magnification, DOF is essentially independent of focal length. Stated otherwise, for the same subject magnification and the same ''f''-number, all focal lengths for a given image format give approximately the same DOF.  This statement is true only when the subject distance is small in comparison with the hyperfocal distance, however.\n\n===Moderate-to-large distances===\n\nWhen the subject distance is large in comparison with the lens focal length,\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm N} \\approx \\frac {H s} {H + s}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm F} \\approx \\frac {H s} {H - s} \\text{ for } s < H,</math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math>\n\\mathrm {DOF} \\approx \\frac {2 H s^2}\n{H^2 - s^2} \\text{ for } s < H.\n</math>\n\nFor <math>s \\ge H</math>, the far limit of DOF is at infinity and the DOF is infinite; of course, only objects at or beyond the near limit of DOF will be recorded with acceptable sharpness.\n\n===Close-up===\n\nWhen the subject distance <math>s</math> approaches the lens focal length, the focal length no longer is negligible, and the approximate formulas (11),(12) above cannot be used without introducing significant error. Use formulas (9) and (10) instead.\n\nIt usually is more convenient to express DOF in terms of magnification. The distance is small in comparison with the hyperfocal distance, so the simplified formula\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mathrm {DOF} \\approx 2 N c \\, \\frac {m + 1} {m^2} = \\frac{2 N_w c}{m^2},</math>|13}}\n\ncan be used with good accuracy (<math>N_w</math>is the [[Numerical aperture#Working (effective) f-number|working <var>f</var>-number]]). For a given magnification, DOF is independent of focal length.\n\n===Near:far DOF ratio===\n\nFrom the \"exact\" equations for near and far limits of DOF, the DOF in front of the subject is\n\n:<math>s - D_{\\mathrm N} = \\frac {Ncs(s - f)} {f^2 + Nc(s - f)},</math>\n\nand the DOF beyond the subject is\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm F} - s = \\frac {Ncs(s - f)} {f^2 - Nc(s - f)}.</math>\n\nThe near:far DOF ratio is\n\n:<math>\\frac {s - D_{\\mathrm N}} {D_{\\mathrm F} - s}\n= \\frac {f^2 - Nc(s - f)} {f^2 + Nc(s - f)}.</math>\n\nThis ratio is always less than unity; at moderate-to-large subject distances, <math>f \\ll s</math>, and\n\n:<math>\\frac {s - D_{\\mathrm N}} {D_{\\mathrm F} - s}\n\\approx \\frac {f^2 - Ncs} {f^2 + Ncs} = \\frac {H - s} {H + s}.</math>\n\nWhen the subject is at the hyperfocal distance or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, and the near:far ratio is zero. It's commonly stated that approximately 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and approximately 2/3 is beyond; however, this is true only when <math>s \\approx H/3</math>.\n\nAt closer subject distances, it's often more convenient to express the DOF ratio in terms of the magnification\n\n:<math>m = \\frac f {s - f};</math>\n\nsubstitution into the \"exact\" equation for DOF ratio gives\n\n:<math>\\frac {s - D_{\\mathrm N}}  {D_{\\mathrm F} - s}\n= \\frac {m - Nc/f} {m + Nc/f}.</math>\n\nAs magnification increases, the near:far ratio approaches a limiting value of unity.\n\n===DOF vs. format size===\n\nWhen the subject distance is much less than hyperfocal, the total DOF is given to good approximation by\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{DOF} \\approx 2Nc \\, \\frac {m + 1} {m^2}.</math>\n\nWhen additionally the magnification is small compared to unity, the value of <math>m</math> in the numerator can be neglected, and the formula further simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{DOF} \\approx  \\frac {2Nc} {m^2}.</math>\n\nThe DOF ratio for two different formats is then\n\n:<math> \\frac {\\mathrm{DOF}_2} {\\mathrm{DOF}_1} \\approx \\frac {N_2 \\, c_2} {N_1 \\, c_1} \\left ( \\frac {m_1} {m_2} \\right )^2.</math>\n\nEssentially the same approach is described in [[#CITEREFStroebel1976|Stroebel (1976)]], 136\u201339).\n\n====\"Same picture\" for both formats====\n<!-- Linked from Use of absolute aperture diameter below -->\n\nThe results of the comparison depend on what is assumed. One approach is to assume that essentially the same picture is taken with each format and enlarged to produce the same size final image, so the subject distance remains the same, the focal length is adjusted to maintain the same angle of view, and to a first approximation, magnification is in direct proportion to some characteristic dimension of each format. If both pictures are enlarged to give the same size final images with the same sharpness criteria, the circle of confusion is also in direct proportion to the format size. Thus if <math>l</math> is the characteristic dimension of the format,\n\n:<math>\\frac {m_2} {m_1} = \\frac {c_2} {c_1} = \\frac {l_2} {l_1}.</math>\n\nWith the same ''f''-number, the DOF ratio is then\n\n:<math> \\frac {\\mathrm{DOF}_2} {\\mathrm{DOF}_1} \\approx \\frac {c_2} {c_1} \\left ( \\frac {m_1} {m_2} \\right )^2 = \\frac {l_2} {l_1} \\left ( \\frac {l_1} {l_2} \\right )^2 = \\frac {l_1} {l_2},</math>\n\nso the DOF ratio is in inverse proportion to the format size. This ratio is approximate, and breaks down in the macro range of the larger format (the value of <math>m</math> in the numerator is no longer negligible) or as distance approaches the hyperfocal distance for the smaller format (the DOF of the smaller format approaches infinity).\n\nIf the formats have approximately the same aspect ratios, the characteristic dimensions can be the format diagonals; if the aspect ratios differ considerably (e.g., 4\u00d75 vs. 6\u00d717), the dimensions must be chosen more carefully, and the DOF comparison may not even be meaningful.\n\nIf the DOF is to be the same for both formats the required ''f''-number is in direct proportion to the format size:\n\n:<math> \\frac {N_2} {N_1} \\approx \\frac {c_1} {c_2} \\left ( \\frac {m_2} {m_1} \\right )^2 = \\frac {l_2} {l_1}.</math>\n\nAdjusting the ''f''-number in proportion to format size is equivalent to using the same absolute aperture diameter for both formats, discussed in detail below in [[#Use of absolute aperture diameter|Use of absolute aperture diameter]].\n\n====Same focal length for both formats====\n\nIf the same lens focal length is used in both formats, magnifications can be maintained in the ratio of the format sizes by adjusting subject distances; the DOF ratio is the same as that given above, but the images differ because of the different perspectives and angles of view.\n\nIf the same DOF is required for each format, an analysis similar to that above shows that the required ''f''-number is in direct proportion to the format size.\n\nAnother approach is to use the same focal length with both formats at the same subject distance, so the magnification is the same, and with the same ''f''-number,\n\n:<math> \\frac {\\mathrm{DOF}_2} {\\mathrm{DOF}_1} \\approx \\frac {c_2} {c_1} = \\frac {l_2} {l_1},</math>\n\nso the DOF ratio is in ''direct'' proportion to the format size, due to the smaller format size having a smaller circle of confusion when the final image size is the same. The perspective is the same for both formats, but because of the different angles of view, the pictures are not the same.\n\n====Cropping====\n\nCropping an image and enlarging to the same size final image as an uncropped image taken under the same conditions is equivalent to using a smaller format; the cropped image requires greater enlargement and consequently has a smaller circle of confusion. A cropped then enlarged image has less DOF than the uncropped image.\n\n====Use of absolute aperture diameter====\n<!-- Linked from \u201cSame picture\u201d for both formats above -->\n\nThe aperture diameter is normally given in terms of the ''f''-number because all lenses set to the same ''f''-number give approximately the same image [[illuminance]] ([[#CITEREFRay2002|Ray 2002]], 130), simplifying exposure settings. In deriving the basic DOF equations, <math>f / N</math> can be substituted for the absolute aperture diameter <math>d</math>, giving the DOF in terms of the absolute aperture diameter:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{DOF} = \\frac {2s} { ( dm ) / c  - c / ( dm) },</math>\n\nafter [[#CITEREFLarmore1965|Larmore (1965)]], 163). When the subject distance <math>s</math> is small in comparison with the hyperfocal distance, the second term in the denominator can be neglected, leading to\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{DOF} \\approx \\frac {2sc} {dm}.</math>\n\nWith the same subject distance and angle of view for both formats, <math>s_2 = s_1</math>, and\n\n:<math> \\frac {\\mathrm{DOF}_2} {\\mathrm{DOF}_1} \\approx \\frac {c_2} {c_1}  \\frac {d_1} {d_2} \\frac {m_1} {m_2}\n= \\frac {l_2} {l_1} \\frac {d_1} {d_2} \\frac {l_1} {l_2}  = \\frac {d_1} {d_2},</math>\n\nso the DOFs are in inverse proportion to the absolute aperture diameters. When the diameters are the same, the two formats have the same DOF. [[#CITEREFvon Rohr1906|Von Rohr (1906)]] made this same observation, saying \"At this point it will be sufficient to note that all these formulae involve quantities relating exclusively to the entrance-pupil and its position with respect to the object-point, whereas the focal length of the transforming system does not enter into them.\" Lyon's [http://www.dicklyon.com/tech/Photography/DepthOfField-Lyon.pdf Depth of Field Outside the Box] describes an approach very similar to that of [[Moritz von Rohr|von Rohr]].\n\nUsing the same absolute aperture diameter for both formats with the \"same picture\" criterion is equivalent to adjusting the ''f''-number in proportion to the format sizes, discussed above under [[#\"Same picture\" for both formats|\"Same picture\" for both formats]]\n\n===Focus and <var>f</var>-number from DOF limits===\n\n====Object-side relationships====\n\nThe equations for\nthe DOF limits can be combined to eliminate <math>Nc</math> and solve for the subject distance. For given near and far DOF limits <math>D_{\\mathrm N}</math> and <math>D_{\\mathrm F}</math>, the subject distance is\n\n:<math>s = \\frac {2 D_{\\mathrm N} D_{\\mathrm F} }\n{D_{\\mathrm N} +  D_{\\mathrm F} },\n</math>\n\nthe [[harmonic mean]] of the near and far distances. The equations for DOF limits also can be combined to eliminate\n<math>s</math> and solve for the required <var>f</var>-number, giving\n\n:<math>N = \\frac {f^2} {c}\n\\frac {D_{\\mathrm F} -  D_{\\mathrm N} }\n{D_{\\mathrm F} ( D_{\\mathrm N} - f ) + D_{\\mathrm N} ( D_{\\mathrm F} - f ) }.\n</math>\n\nWhen the subject distance is large in comparison with the lens focal\nlength, this simplifies to\n\n:<math>N \\approx \\frac {f^2} {c}\n\\frac {D_{\\mathrm F} -  D_{\\mathrm N} } {2 D_{\\mathrm N} D_{\\mathrm F} }.\n</math>\n\nWhen the far limit of DOF is at infinity, the equations for <math>s</math> and <math>N</math> give indeterminate results. But if all terms in the numerator and denominator on the right-hand side of the equation for <math>s</math> are divided by <math>D_\\mathrm{F}</math>, it is seen that when  <math>D_\\mathrm{F}</math> is at infinity,\n\n:<math>s = 2 D_\\mathrm N.</math>\n\nSimilarly, if all terms in the numerator and denominator on the right-hand side of the equation for <math>N</math> are divided by <math>D_\\mathrm{F}</math>, it is seen that when  <math>D_\\mathrm{F}</math> is at infinity,\n\n:<math>N = \\frac {f^2} c \\frac 1 { 2 D_\\mathrm N - f }\n\\approx \\frac {f^2} c \\frac 1 { 2 D_\\mathrm N }.</math>\n\n====Image-side relationships====\n\nMost discussions of DOF concentrate on the object side of the lens,\nbut the formulas are simpler and the measurements usually easier to make on the\nimage side. If the basic image-side equations\n\n:<math>\\frac {v_\\mathrm N - v} {v_\\mathrm N} = \\frac {Nc} f</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\frac {v- v_\\mathrm F} {v_\\mathrm F} = \\frac {Nc} f</math>\n\nare combined and solved for the image distance <math>v</math>, the result is\n\n:<math>v = \\frac {2 v_{\\mathrm N} v_{\\mathrm F} }\n{v_{\\mathrm N} +  v_{\\mathrm F} },\n</math>\n\nthe harmonic mean of the near and far image distances. The basic image-side equations can also be combined and solved for <math>N</math>, giving\n\n:<math>N = \\frac {f} {c}\n \\frac { v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F} }\n{v_{\\mathrm N} +  v_{\\mathrm F} }\n.</math>\n\nThe image distances are measured from the camera's image plane to the lens's image nodal plane, which is not always easy to locate. The harmonic mean is always less than the arithmentic mean, but when the difference between the near and far image distances is reasonably small, the two means are close to equal, and focus can be set with sufficient accuracy using\n\n:<math>v \\approx \\frac { v_{\\mathrm N} + v_{\\mathrm F} } {2}\n= v_{\\mathrm F} + \\frac { v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F} } {2}.\n</math>\n\nThis formula requires only the ''difference''\n<math>v_{\\mathrm N} \\, - \\, v_{\\mathrm F}</math> between the near and far image distances.\nView camera users often refer to this difference as the ''focus spread'';\nit usually is measured on the bed or focusing rail.\nFocus is simply set to halfway between the near and far image distances.\n\nSubstituting <math>v_\\mathrm N + v_\\mathrm F = 2v</math> into the equation for <math>N</math> and rearranging gives\n\n:<math>N \\approx \\frac f v \\frac { v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F} } { 2 c }.</math>\n\nOne variant of the thin-lens equation is <math>v = \\left ( m + 1 \\right ) f</math>, where <math>m</math> is the magnification; substituting this into the equation for <math>N</math> gives\n\n:<math>N \\approx \\frac {1} { 1 + m } \\frac { v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F} } { 2 c }.\n</math>\n\nAt moderate-to-large subject distances, <math>m</math> is small compared to unity, and the\n<var>f</var>-number can often be determined with sufficient accuracy using\n\n:<math>N \\approx \\frac { v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F} } { 2 c }.</math>\n\nFor close-up photography, the magnification cannot be ignored, and the <var>f</var>-number should be determined using the first approximate formula.\n\nAs with the approximate formula for <math>v</math>, the approximate formulas for <math>N</math> require only the focus spread <math>v_{\\mathrm N} - v_{\\mathrm F}</math> rather than the absolute image distances.\n\nWhen the far limit of DOF is at infinity, <math>v_\\mathrm F = f</math>.\n\nOn manual-focus small- and medium-format lenses, the focus and <var>f</var>-number usually are determined using the lens DOF scales, which often are based on the approximate equations above.\n\n[[File:DefocusBlur.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Defocus blur for background object at B.]]\n\n===Foreground and background blur===\nIf the equation for the far limit of DOF is solved for <math>c</math>, and the far distance replaced by an arbitrary distance <math>D</math>, the blur disk diameter <math>b</math> at that distance is\n\n:<math>b = \\frac {fm_\\mathrm s} {N} \\frac { D - s } { D }\\,.</math>\n\nWhen the background is at the far limit of DOF, the blur disk diameter is equal to the circle of confusion <math>c</math>, and the blur is just imperceptible. The diameter of the background blur disk increases with the distance to the background. A similar relationship holds for the foreground; the general expression for a defocused object at distance <math>D</math> is\n\n:<math>b = \\frac {fm_\\mathrm s} {N} \\frac { \\left| D - s \\right | } { D }.</math>\n\nFor a given scene, the distance between the subject and a foreground or background object is usually\nfixed; let that distance be represented by\n\n:<math>x_\\mathrm d = \\left | D - s \\right | ;</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>b = \\frac {fm_\\mathrm s} {N} \\frac { x_\\mathrm d } { D }.</math>\n\nor, in terms of subject distance,\n\n:<math>b = \\frac {fm_\\mathrm s} {N} \\frac { x_\\mathrm d } { s \\pm x_\\mathrm d },</math>\n\nwith the minus sign used for foreground objects and the plus sign used for background objects. For a relatively distant background object,\n\n:<math>b \\approx \\frac {fm_\\mathrm s} N \\,.</math>\n\nIn terms of subject magnification, the subject distance is\n\n:<math>s = \\frac { m_\\mathrm s + 1 } { m_\\mathrm s } f ,</math>\n\nso that, for a given <var>f</var>-number and subject magnification,\n\n:<math>b = \\frac {fm_\\mathrm s} {N} \\frac { x_\\mathrm d } { \\frac { m_\\mathrm s + 1} {m_\\mathrm s} f \\pm x_\\mathrm d }\n= \\frac {fm_\\mathrm s ^2} {N} \\frac { x_\\mathrm d } { \\left ( m_\\mathrm s + 1 \\right ) f \\pm m_\\mathrm s x_\\mathrm d }.\n</math>\n\nDifferentiating <math>b</math> with respect to <math>f</math> gives\n\n:<math>\\frac {\\mathrm d b} {\\mathrm d f}\n= \\frac {\\pm m_\\mathrm s ^3 x_\\mathrm d ^2}\n        {N \\left [ \\left ( m_\\mathrm s + 1 \\right ) f \\pm m_\\mathrm s x_\\mathrm d \\right ]^2 }.\n</math>\n\nWith the plus sign, the derivative is everywhere positive, so that for a background object, the blur disk size increases with focal length. With the minus sign, the derivative is everywhere negative, so that for a foreground object, the blur disk size decreases with focal length.\n\nThe magnification of the defocused object also varies with focal length; the magnification of the\ndefocused object is\n\n:<math>m_\\mathrm d = \\frac {v_\\mathrm s} {D} = \\frac { \\left ( m_\\mathrm s + 1 \\right ) f } { D },</math>\n\nwhere <math>v_\\mathrm s</math> is the image distance of the subject. For a defocused object with some characteristic dimension <math>y</math>, the imaged size of that object is\n\n:<math>m_\\mathrm d y = \\frac { \\left ( m_\\mathrm s + 1 \\right ) f y } { D }.</math>\n\nThe ratio of the blur disk size to the imaged size of that object then is\n\n:<math> \\frac b { m_\\mathrm d y } = \\frac {m_\\mathrm s} { m_\\mathrm s + 1 } \\frac {x_\\mathrm d } { Ny },</math>\n\nso for a given defocused object, the ratio of the blur disk diameter to object size is independent of focal length, and depends only on the object size and its distance from the subject.\n\n===Asymmetrical lenses===\n\nThis discussion thus far has assumed a symmetrical lens for which the entrance and exit pupils coincide with the object and image [[nodal planes]], and for which the pupil magnification is unity. Although this assumption usually is reasonable for large-format lenses, it often is invalid for medium- and small-format lenses.\n\nFor an asymmetrical lens, the DOF ahead of the subject distance and the DOF beyond the subject distance are given by<ref>This is discussed in Jacobson's [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/rec-photo/lenses/tutorial/ Photographic Lenses Tutorial], and complete derivations are given in Conrad's [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/articles/DoFinDepth.pdf Depth of Field in Depth] (PDF) and van Walree's [http://toothwalker.org/optics/dofderivation.html Derivation of the DOF equatio7ns].</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF_N} = \\frac\n{N c (1 + m/P)}\n{m^2 [ 1 + (N c ) / ( f m ) ] }\n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF_F} = \\frac\n{N c (1 + m/P)}\n{m^2 [ 1 - (N c )/ ( f m ) ] },\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math> is the pupil magnification.\n\nCombining gives the total DOF:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF} = \\frac {2 f ( 1/m + 1/P ) }\n{ ( f m ) / ( N c ) - ( N c ) / ( f m ) }.\n</math>\n\nWhen <math>s \\ll H</math>, the second term in the denominator becomes small in comparison with the first, and ([[#CITEREFShipman1977|Shipman 1977]], 147)\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF} \\approx \\frac {2 N c (1 + m/P)}{m^2}.</math>\n\nWhen the pupil magnification is unity, the equations for asymmetrical lenses reduce to those given earlier for symmetrical lenses.\n\n===Effect of lens asymmetry===\n\nExcept for close-up and macro photography, the effect of lens asymmetry is minimal.  A slight rearrangement of the last equation gives\n\n:<math>\\mathrm {DOF} \\approx \\frac {2 N c} {m}\n\\left ( \\frac 1 m + \\frac 1 P \\right ).\n</math>\n\nAs magnification decreases, the <math>1/P</math> term becomes smaller in comparison with the <math>1/m</math> term, and eventually the effect of pupil magnification becomes negligible.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Photography}}\n*[[Angle of view]]\n*[[Bokeh]]\n*[[Camera angle]]\n*[[Depth-of-field adapter]]\n*[[Depth of focus]]\n*[[Frazier lens]] (very deep DOF)\n*[[Hyperfocal distance]]\n*[[Light-field camera]] \n*[[Miniature faking]]\n*[[Numerical aperture]]\n*[[Perspective distortion (photography)|Perspective distortion]]\n*[[Rayleigh length]]\n*[[Tilted plane focus]] (camera movements used to achieve selective focus)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{wikicite | ref=\"CITEREFAdams1980\" | reference=Adams, Ansel. 1980.

They were bordered to the east by the [[Durotriges]] tribe.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[William Camden]], in his 1607 edition of ''Britannia'', describes [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] as being two parts of the same 'country' which:\n{{Quote|was in ancient time inhabited by those Britains whom [[Solinus]] called Dunmonii, [[Ptolemy|Ptolomee]] Damnonii, or (as we find in some other copies) more truly Danmonii. ... .

The near or hithermore region of the Danmonians that I spake of is now commonly called Denshire, [or] by the Cornish-Britains 'Dewnan', and by the Welsh Britains 'Duffneint', that is, 'low valleys', for that the people dwell for the most part beneath in Vales; by the English Saxons [it is known as] 'Deven-schire', whereof grew the Latin name 'Devonia', and by that contraction which the vulgar people useth, 'Denshire'.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}}}\n\nCamden had learnt some [[Welsh language|Welsh]] during the course of his studies and it would appear that he is the origin of the interpretation of Dumnonii as \"deep valley dwellers\" from his understanding of the Welsh of his time. [[John Rhys]] later theorized that the tribal name was derived from the name of a goddess, ''Domnu'', probably meaning \"the goddess of the deep\".<ref>Rhys, John (1892) ''Lectures on the origin and growth of religion as illustrated by Celtic heathendom''.

Another group with a similar name but with no known links were the [[Fir Domnann]] of [[Connacht]].\n\nThe Roman name of the town of [[Exeter]], ''[[Isca Dumnoniorum]]'' (\"Isca of the Dumnonii\"), contains the root ''*iska-'' \"water\" for \"Water of the Dumnonii\". The Latin name suggests that the city was already an ''[[oppidum]]'', or walled town, on the banks on the [[River Exe]] before the foundation of the Roman city, in about AD 50. The Dumnonii gave their name to the English county of [[Devon]], and their name is represented in Britain's two extant [[Brythonic languages]] as ''Dewnans'' in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and ''Dyfnaint'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. [[Amed\u00e9e Simon Dominique Thierry|Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Thierry]] (''Histoire des Gaulois'', 1828), one of the inventors of the \"historic race\" of Gauls, could confidently equate them with the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] (\"les Cornouailles\").\n\nVictorian historians often referred to the tribe as the [[Damnonii]], which is also the name of another people from lowland Scotland, although there are no known links between the two populations.\n\n==Language==\nThe people of Dumnonia spoke a [[Southwestern Brythonic]] dialect similar to the forerunner of more recent [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]]. [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, the [[D\u00e9isi]],<ref name=\"Thomas 1994\">[[Charles Thomas (archaeologist)|Thomas, Charles]] (1994) ''\"And Shall These Mute Stones Speak?\": post-Roman inscriptions in western Britain''.

The name ''purocoronavium'' that appears in the [[Ravenna Cosmography]] implies the existence of a sub-tribe called the Cornavii or Cornovii, perhaps the ancestors of the [[Cornish people]].\n\nIn the [[Sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman]] period a Brythonic kingdom called [[Dumnonia]] emerged, covering the entire peninsula, although it is believed by some to have effectively been a collection of sub-kingdoms.\n\nA kingdom of [[Domnon\u00e9e]] (and of [[Cornouaille]] alongside) was established in the province of [[Armorica]] directly across the [[English Channel]], and has apparent links with the British population, suggesting an ancient connection of peoples along the western Atlantic seaboard.\n\n==Settlements==\n\n===Isca Dumnoniorum===\n{{Main|Isca Dumnoniorum}}\nThe [[Latin]] name for Exeter is Isca Dumnoniorum (\"Water of the Dumnonii\"). This [[oppidum]] (a [[Latin]] term meaning an important town) on the banks of I [[River Exe]] certainly existed prior to the foundation of the [[Roman Britain|Roman city]] in about AD 50. ''Isca'' is derived from the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] word for flowing water, which was given to the River Exe. This is reflected in the Welsh name for Exeter: ''Caerwysg'' meaning \"fortified settlement on the river Uisc\".\n\nIsca Dumnoniorum originated with a settlement that developed around the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fortress of the [[Legio II Augusta]] and is one of the four ''[[poleis]]'' (cities) attributed to the tribe by [[Ptolemy]].<ref name=RBOD>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/dumnonii.htm\n|title=The Celtic Tribes of Britain: The Dumnonii\n|publisher=Roman Britain Organisation\n|accessdate=2012-07-05\n}}</ref> It is also listed in two routes of the late 2nd century [[Antonine Itinerary]].\n\nA legionary bath-house was built inside the fortress sometime between 55 and 60 and underwent renovation shortly afterwards (c. 60-65) but by c. 68 (perhaps even 66) the legion had transferred to a newer fortress at [[Gloucester]]. This saw the dismantling of the Isca fortress, and the site was then abandoned. Around AD 75, work on the ''civitas forum'' and ''basilica'' had commenced on the site of the former ''principia'' and by the late 2nd century the ''civitas'' walls had been completed. They were 3 metres thick and 6 metres high and enclosed exactly the same area as the earlier fortress. However, by the late 4th century the ''civitas'' was in decline.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.roman-britain.org/places/isca_dumnoniorum.htm\n |title       = ISCA DVMNONIORVM\n |publisher   = Roman Britain Organisation\n |accessdate  = 2012-07-05\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120512150808/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/isca_dumnoniorum.htm\n |archivedate = 2012-05-12\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n | quote = Next to these [the [[Durotriges]]], but more to the west, are the Dumnoni, whose towns are:<br />Voliba 14\u00b045&nbsp;52\u00b000<br />Uxella 15\u00b000&nbsp;52\u00b045<br />Tamara 15\u00b000&nbsp;52\u00b015<br />Isca, where is located Legio II Augusta 17\u00b030&nbsp;52\u00b045.\n | source = \u2014Ptolemy, ''Geography'' II.ii.<ref name=RBOD />\n | width = 25%\n | qalign = left\n | align = right\n}}\n\n===Other settlements===\nAs well as Isca Dumnoniorum, [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd century ''Geography'' names three other towns:<ref name=RBOD />\n*Voliba, which remains unidentified,\n*Uxella, possibly on the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]], or at [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], and\n*Tamara, generally considered to be somewhere on the [[River Tamar]].\n\nThe [[Ravenna Cosmography]] includes the last two names (in slightly different forms, as \"Tamaris\" and \"Uxelis\"), and adds several more names which may be settlements in the territory. These include:\n*Nemetostatio, a name relating to ''[[nemeton]]'', signifying \"sanctuary' or \"[[sacred grove]]\".

The style is native in form with no Romanised features. Near [[Padstow]], a Roman site of some importance now lies buried under the sands on the opposite side of the Camel estuary near St. Enodoc's Church, and may have been a western coastal equivalent of a [[Saxon Shore Fort]].<ref name=RBOD /> At Magor Farm in [[Illogan]], near [[Camborne]], an archaeological site has been identified as being a [[villa]].<ref name=RBOD />\n\n==Archaeology==\nThe Dumnonii are thought to have occupied relatively isolated territory in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and possibly part of [[Dorset]]. Their cultural connections, as expressed in their ceramics, were with the peninsula of [[Armorica]] across the Channel, rather than with the southeast of Britain.<ref name=cunliffe>Cunliffe, Barry (2005) ''Iron Age Communities in Britain: an Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC Until the Roman Conquest,'' 4th ed. pp. 201-206.</ref> They do not seem to have been politically centralised: coins are relatively rare, none of them locally minted, and the structure, distribution and construction of Bronze Age and Iron Age hill forts, \"rounds\" and defensible farmsteads in the south west point to a number of smaller tribal groups living alongside each other.<ref name=cunliffe/>\n\nDumnonia is noteworthy for its many settlements that have survived from the [[Romano-British]] period, but also for its lack of a [[Roman villa|villa system]]. Local archaeology has revealed instead the isolated enclosed farmsteads known locally as ''rounds''. These seem to have survived the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] abandonment of Britain, but were subsequently replaced, in the 6th and 7th centuries, by the unenclosed farms taking the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[toponym]]ic ''tre-''.<ref>Pearce, Susan M. (1978) The Kingdom of Dumnonia. Padstow: Lodenek Press</ref><ref>Kain, Roger; Ravenhill, William (eds.) (1999) ''Historical Atlas of South-West England''. Exeter / provides detailed information</ref>\n\nAs in most other Brythonic areas, [[Iron Age]] [[hillfort|hill forts]], such as [[Hembury|Hembury Castle]], were refortified for the use of chieftains or kings. Other high-status settlements such as [[Tintagel Castle|Tintagel]] seem to have been reconstructed during this period. Post-Roman imported pottery has been excavated from many sites across the region, and the apparent surge in late 5th century [[Mediterranean]] and/or [[Byzantine]] imports is yet to be explained satisfactorily.<ref>Thomas, Charles (1981) reviewing Pearce (1978) in ''Britannia'' 12; p. 417</ref>\n\n==Industries==\nApart from fishing and agriculture, the main economic resource of the Dumnonii was tin mining. The area of Dumnonia had been mined since ancient times, and the tin was exported from the ancient trading port of [[Ictis]] ([[St Michael's Mount]]).<ref name=RBOD /> Tin extraction (mainly by streaming) had existed here from the early [[Bronze Age]] around the 22nd century BC. West Cornwall, around [[Mount's Bay]], was traditionally thought to have been visited by metal traders from the eastern [[Mediterranean]]<ref>Hawkins, Christopher (1811) ''Observations on the Tin Trade of the Ancients in Cornwall''. London: J. J. Stockdale</ref>\n\nDuring the first millennium BC trade became more organised, first with the [[Phoenicians]], who settled Gades ([[Cadiz]]) around 1100 BC, and later with the [[Greeks]], who had settled Massilia ([[Marseilles]]) and Narbo ([[Narbonne]]) around 600 BC. Smelted Cornish tin was collected at [[Ictis]] whence it was conveyed across the Bay of Biscay to the mouth of the [[Loire]] and then to Gades via the [[Loire]] and [[Rhone]] valleys. It went then through the Mediterranean Sea in ships to Gades.\n\nDuring the period c. 500-450 BC, the tin deposits seem to have become more important, and fortified settlements appear such as at [[Chun Castle]] and [[Kenidjack Castle]], to protect both the tin smelters and mines.<ref name=\"trevithick-society.org.uk\">[http://www.trevithick-society.org.uk/industry/cornish_history.htm Cornish History.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812235920/http://www.trevithick-society.org.uk/industry/cornish_history.htm |date=2009-08-12 }} [[Trevithick Society]].</ref>\n\nThe earliest account of Cornish tin mining was written by [[Pytheas]] of Massilia late in the 4th century BC after his circumnavigation of the British Isles. Underground mining was described in this account, although it cannot be determined when it had started. [[Pytheas]]'s account was noted later by other writers including [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]].<ref name=\"trevithick-society.org.uk\"/>\n\nIt is likely that tin trade with the [[Mediterranean]] was later on under the control of the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]].<ref>Champion, Timothy \"The Appropriation of the Phoenicians in British Imperial Ideology\" in: ''Nations and Nationalism'', Volume 7, Issue 4, pp. 451-65, October 2001</ref> [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]] was one of the places proposed for the ''[[Cassiterides]]'', that is Tin Islands. Tin working continued throughout [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation although it appears that output declined because of new supplies brought in from the deposits discovered in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] (Spain and Portugal). However, when these supplies diminished, production in [[Dumnonia]] increased and appears to have reached a peak during the 3rd century AD.<ref name=\"trevithick-society.org.uk\"/>\n\n==Sub-Roman and post-Roman Dumnonia==\n{{Main|Dumnonia}}\nThe [[Sub-Roman Britain|Sub-Roman or Post-Roman]] history of Dumnonia comes from a variety of sources and is considered exceedingly difficult to interpret<ref>Webster, Graham (1991) ''The Cornovii'' (Peoples of Roman Britain series).

Note the blinder, to prevent the driver from being distracted by the lights for the other lane.]]\n\n'''Drag racing''' is a type of [[motorsport#Racing|motor racing]] in which [[automobile]]s or [[motorcycle]]s (usually specially prepared for the purpose) compete, usually two at a time, to be first to cross a set finish line. The race follows a short, straight course from a [[standing start]] over a measured distance, most commonly \u00bc [[mile]] ({{convert|1,320|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}), with a shorter ({{convert|1,000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) becoming increasingly popular, as it has become the standard for [[Top Fuel]] [[Dragster (car)|dragster]]s and [[funny car]]s, where some major bracket races and other sanctioning bodies have adopted it as the standard, while the \u215b&nbsp;mi ({{convert|660|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) is also popular in some circles. Electronic timing and speed sensing systems have been used to record race results since the 1960s.\n\nThe history of automobiles and motorcycles being used for drag racing is nearly as long as the history of motorized vehicles themselves, and has taken the form of both illegal [[street racing]], and as an organized and regulated [[motorsport]]. This article covers the legal sport.\n\n==Basics of drag racing==\n{{subsections|date=October 2018}}\n[[Image:Pro Street Camaro at launch.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Camaro at launch, with ''Altered Vision'' in the right lane.]]\n\nPush starts to get engines running were necessary until the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) mandated self-starters in 1976.<ref name=\"NHRA.com\">Burgess, Phil, ''National Dragster'' editor.  \"Obsolete skills, part 1: On the track\", at [https://www.nhra.com/news/2008/obsolete-skills-part-1-track  NHRA.com] (retrieved 22 September 2018)</ref> After burnouts, cars would be pushed back by crews; this persisted until NHRA required reversing systems in 1980.<ref name=\"NHRA.com\"/> [[Don Garlits]] was the first to do burnouts across the starting line, which is now standard practise.<ref name=\"Drag Illustrated\">Tocher, Ian. \"\u2018Big Daddy\u2019 Describes Birth of the Burnout\", published 18  March 2018, at [https://dragillustrated.com/big-daddy-describes-birth-of-the-burnout/ ''Drag Illustrated''] (retrieved 23 September 2018)</ref> Each driver then backs up to and stages at the starting line.\n\nBefore each race (commonly known as a pass), each driver is allowed to perform a [[burnout (vehicle)|burnout]], which heats the driving tires and lays rubber down at the beginning of the track, improving traction. The cars run through a \"water box\" (formerly a \"bleach box\", before bleach was replaced by flammable traction compound, which produced spectacular, and dangerous, flame burnouts; the hazard led NHRA to mandate use of water in the 1970s<ref name=\"Drag Illustrated\"/>).\n\nModern races are started electronically by a system known as a ''[[Christmas tree (drag racing)|Christmas tree]]'', which consists of a column of lights for each driver/lane, and two light beam sensors per lane on the track at the starting line. Current NHRA trees, for example, feature one blue light (split into halves), then three amber, one green, and one red.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhra.com/story/2011/4/12/new-tree-implemented-for-visitmyrtlebeachcom-nhra-four-wide-nationals/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420065503/http://www.nhra.com/story/2011/4/12/new-tree-implemented-for-visitmyrtlebeachcom-nhra-four-wide-nationals/ |archivedate=2011-04-20 |df= }} New Tree implemented for NHRA VisitMyrtleBeach.com Four-Wide Nationals</ref> When the first light beam is broken by a vehicle's front tire(s), the vehicle is \"pre-staged\" (approximately {{convert|7|in|mm}} from the starting line), and the pre-stage indicator on the tree is lit. When the second light beam is broken, the vehicle is \"staged\", and the stage indicator on the tree is lit.<ref>[http://www.nhra.com/nhra101/basics.aspx NHRA.com] Basics of Drag Racing</ref> Vehicles may then leave the pre-stage beam, but must remain in the stage beam until the race starts.\n\nOnce one competitor is staged, their opponent has a set amount of time to stage or they will be instantly disqualified, indicated by a red light on the tree. Otherwise, once both drivers are staged, the system chooses a short delay at random (to prevent a driver being able to anticipate the start), then starts the race. The light sequence at this point varies slightly. For example, in NHRA Professional classes, three amber lights on the tree flash simultaneously, followed 0.4 seconds later by a green light (this is also known as a \"pro tree\"). In NHRA Sportsman classes, the amber lights illuminate in sequence from top to bottom, 0.5 seconds apart, followed 0.5 seconds later by the green light (this is also known as a \"sportsman tree\" or \"full tree\"). If a vehicle leaves the starting line before the green light illuminates, the red light for that lane illuminates instead, and the driver is disqualified (also known as ''red lighting''). In a handicap start, the green light automatically lights up for the first driver, and the red light is only lit in the proper lane after both cars have launched if one driver leaves early, or if both drivers left early, the driver whose reaction time is worse (if one lane has a -.015 and the other lane has a -.022, the lane of the driver who committed a 0.022 is given the red light after both cars have left), as a red light infraction is only assessed to the driver with the worse infraction, if both drivers leave early. Even if both drivers leave early, the green light is automatically lit for the driver that left last, and they still may win the pass (as in the 2014 NHRA Auto Club Pro Stock final, [[Erica Enders-Stevens]] and [[Jason Line]] both committed red light infractions; only Line was assessed with a red light, as he was -.011 versus Enders-Stevens' -.002).\n\nSeveral measurements are taken for each race: reaction time, elapsed time, and speed. Reaction time is the period from the green light illuminating to the vehicle leaving the starting line. Elapsed time is the period from the vehicle leaving the starting line to crossing the finish line. Speed is measured through a [[speed trap]] covering the final {{convert|66|ft|m}} to the finish line, indicating average speed of the vehicle in that distance.\n\nExcept where a breakout rule is in place, the winner is the first vehicle to cross the finish line, and therefore the driver with the lowest combined reaction time and elapsed time. Because these times are measured separately, a driver with a slower elapsed time can actually win if that driver's advantage in reaction time exceeds the elapsed time difference. In heads-up racing, this is known as a ''[[holeshot]] win''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhra.com/glossary.aspx|title=NHRA Glossary|publisher=NHRA|accessdate=August 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903044153/http://www.nhra.com/glossary.aspx|archivedate=September 3, 2013|df=}}</ref> In categories where a breakout rule is in effect (for example, NHRA Junior Dragster, Super Comp, Super Gas, Super Stock, and Stock classes, as well as some dial-in classes), if a competitor is faster than his or her predetermined time (a \"breakout\"), that competitor loses. If both competitors are faster than their predetermined times, the competitor who breaks out by less time wins. Regardless, a red light foul is worse than a breakout, except in Junior Dragster where exceeding the absolute limit is a cause for disqualification.\n\nMost race events use a traditional [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] system, where the losing car and driver are eliminated from the event while the winner advances to the next round, until a champion is crowned. Events can range from 16 to over 100 car brackets. Drivers are typically [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] by elapsed times in qualifying.  In bracket racing without a breakout (such as NHRA Competition Eliminator), pairings are based on times compared to their index (faster than index for class is better). In bracket racing with a breakout (Stock, Super Stock, but also the NHRA's Super classes), the closest to the index is favourable.\n\nA popular alternative to the standard eliminations format is the Chicago Style format (also called the Three Round format in Australia), named for the US 30 Dragstrip in suburban [[Gary, Indiana]] where a midweek meet featured this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.competitionplus.com/drag-racing/news/14381-chicago-once-a-funny-car-heaven|title=Encore Feature: Chicago Once a Funny Car Heaven|publisher=Competition Plus|accessdate=March 21, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506094925/http://www.competitionplus.com/drag-racing/news/14381-chicago-once-a-funny-car-heaven|archivedate=May 6, 2014|df=}}</ref> All entered cars participate in one qualifying round, and then are paired for the elimination round. The two fastest times among winners from this round participate in the championship round. Depending on the organisation, the next two fastest times may play for third, then fifth, and so forth, in consolation rounds. Currently, an IHRA 400 Thunder championship race in Australia uses the format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andra.com.au/latest-news/group-1/1730-revolutionary-new-event-format-promises-easter-thrills-at-willowbank-racewa.html|title=Revolutionary new event format promises Easter thrills at Willowbank Raceway|publisher=Australian National Drag Racing Association|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe standard distance of a drag race is 1,320 feet, 402 m, or 1/4 mile. However, due to safety concerns, certain sanctioning bodies (notably the NHRA for its Top Fuel and Funny Car classes) have shortened races to 1,000 feet. Some drag strips are even shorter and run 660 feet, 201 m, or 1/8 mile. The 1,000 foot distance is now also popular with bracket racing, especially in meets where there are 1/8 mile cars and 1/4 mile cars racing together, and is used by the revived American Drag Racing League for its primary classes (not Jr Dragster). Some organisations that deal with Pro Modified and \"Mountain Motor\" Pro Stock cars (Professional Drag Racers Association) use the 1/8 mile distance, even if the tracks are 1/4 mile tracks.\n\n[[File:1958 Fuel Dragster.jpg|thumb|An early example, a 1958 [[Top Fuel|Fuel]] [[Dragster (car)|dragster]] (technically, a [[Hot rod#Language|rail]]), on display at the California Automobile Museum]]\n[[Image:Funny Car.jpg|thumb|right|Funny Car with body up.]]\n\n==Racing organizations==\n[[File:Delivering timeslips.jpg|thumb|Chief Timer delivering timeslips to competitors after their passes.]]\n[[File:Blown Altered.JPG|thumb|Blown altered doing a burnout at [[Gimli Motorsports Park|Interlake Dragways]], Gimli, Manitoba.]]\n\n===North America===\nThe [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) oversees the majority of drag racing events in North America. The next largest organization is the [[International Hot Rod Association]] (IHRA). Nearly all drag strips are associated with one sanctioning body or the other.\n\nBesides NHRA and IHRA, there are niche organizations for muscle cars and nostalgia vehicles. The Nostalgia Drag Racing League (NDRL) based in Brownsburg, IN, runs a series of 1/4 mile (402m) drag races in the Midwest for 1979 and older nostalgic appearing cars, with four classes of competition running in an index system. Pro 7.0 and Pro 7.50 run heads up 200 mile per hour (320 kilometre per hour) passes, while Pro Comp and Pro Gas run 8.0 to 10.0 indices. NDRL competition vehicles typically include Front Engine Dragsters, Altereds, Funny Cars, early Pro Stock clones, Super Stocks and Gassers.<ref name=\"NDRL Website\">{{cite web|last1=Mullin|title=NDRL - Nostalgia Drag Racing League|url=http://www.nostalgiadragleague.com|accessdate=2015-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Electric Drag Racing Association]] (NEDRA) races [[electric vehicle]]s against high performance gasoline-powered vehicles such as [[Dodge Vipers]] or classic [[muscle car]]s in 1/4 and 1/8&nbsp;mile (402m & 201m) races. The current [[electric drag racing]] record is [http://www.nedra.com/200mph_club.html] 6.940 seconds at 201.37&nbsp;mph (324.0736 kph) for a quarter mile (402m). Another niche organization is the VWDRC which run a VW-only championship with vehicles running under 7 seconds.\n\nPrior to the founding of the NHRA and IHRA, smaller organizations sanctioned drag racing in the early years, which included the competing [[American Hot Rod Association|AHRA]] in the United States from 1955 to 2005.\n\n===Australia===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}\nThe first Australian Nationals event was run in 1965 at Riverside raceway, near Melbourne.

[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM Europe]] organises a similar championship for bike classes. In addition, championships are run for sportsman classes in many countries throughout Europe by the various national motorsport governing bodies.\n\n===New Zealand===\nDrag racing in New Zealand started in the 1960s. The New Zealand Hot Rod Association (NZHRA) sanctioned what is believed to have been the first drag meeting at an open cut coal mine at Kopuku, south of Auckland, sometime in 1966. In 1973, the first and only purpose built drag strip opened in Meremere by the Pukekohe Hot Rod Club. In April 1993 the governance of drag racing was separated from the NZHRA and the New Zealand Drag Racing Association (NZDRA) was formed. In 2014, New Zealand's second purpose built drag strip - Masterton Motorplex - opened.\n\nThe first New Zealand Drag Racing Nationals was held in the 1966/67 season at Kopuku, near Auckland.\n\nThere are now two governing bodies operating drag racing in New Zealand with the Florida-based [[International Hot Rod Association]] sanctioning both of New Zealands major tracks at Ruapuna ([http://www.pbdrc.co.nz/ Pegasus Bay Drag Racing Association]) in the South Island and [http://www.dragway.co.nz/ Meremere Dragway Inc] in the North Island. However, the official ASN of the sport, per FIA regulations, is the New Zealand Drag Racing Association.\n\n===South America===\n\nMany countries in South America race 200 meters, unlike in the United States and Australia, where 400 meters or 1/4 mile is typical.\n{{Expand section| date=September 2011}}\nOrganized drag racing in Colombia is the responsibility of Club G3, a private organization.

Note wide slicks and high-mounted wing, to assist traction.]]\n\nThere are hundreds of classes in drag racing, each with different requirements and restrictions on things such as weight, engine size, body style, modifications, and many others. [[NHRA]] and [[International Hot Rod Association|IHRA]] share some of these classes, but many are solely used by one sanctioning body or the other. The NHRA boasts over 200 classes, while the IHRA has fewer. Some IHRA classes have multiple sub-classes in them to differentiate by engine components and other features. There is even a class for aspiring youngsters, [[Junior Dragster]], which typically uses an eighth-mile track, also favored by VW racers.\n\nIn 1997, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] (cars) and [[Union Europ\u00e9enne de Motocyclisme|UEM]] (bikes) began sanctioning drag racing in Europe with a fully established European Drag Racing Championship, in cooperation (and rules compliance) with NHRA. The major European drag strips include Santa Pod Raceway in Podington, England; Alastaro Circuit, Finland; [[Mantorp Park]], Sweden; Gardermoen Raceway, Norway and the [[Hockenheimring]] in Germany.\n\n[[Image:'Pain Killer' jr. dragster.JPG|thumb|''Pain Killer'' J/D. Note the driver, helmet off, is still in the car, which is under tow on the return road, headed for the pits.]]\n\nThere is a somewhat arbitrary definition of what constitutes a \"professional\" class. The NHRA includes 5 pro classes; Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, Pro Modified and Pro Stock Motorcycle. The FIA features a different set of 5 pro classes; Top Fuel, Top Methanol Dragster, Top Methanol Funny Car, Pro Modified and Pro Stock. Other sanctioning bodies have similarly different definitions. A partial list of classes includes:\n\n[[File:Top Fuel.JPG|thumb|Top Fuel dragsters<!--identify the cars & place!-->]]\n* [[Top Fuel]] Dragster (TF/D). The dragsters, or \"diggers\", are the fastest class. Among the fastest-accelerating machines in the world, these cars can cover the dragstrip in less than 3.7 seconds and record trap speeds over {{convert|330|mph|abbr=on}}. Modern Top Fuel dragsters are {{convert|25|ft|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|2,320|lb|abbr=on}}<!--under current rules...--> in race-ready trim. Methanol mixed with up to 90% [[nitromethane]] is used as fuel.\n\n [[File:Funny Car AAA.JPG|thumb|Typical Funny Cars<!--identify the cars & place! Are these actual TF/FCs?-->]]\n* Top Fuel [[Funny Car]] (TF/FC) Similar to their dragster counterparts but with a shorter wheelbase and a carbon-fiber body that loosely resembles a production-based automobile, Funny Cars, or \u201cfloppers,\u201d routinely run in the 4.0s and can exceed 315&nbsp;mph.  In 2017 NHRA driver Robert Height ran a career best ET. 3.793 and speed of 339.87&nbsp;mph.\n\n[[File:Pro Stock.JPG|thumb|A typical Pro Stock car.<!--identify the car & place!-->]]\n* [[Pro Stock]] (NHRA, IHRA/MMPSA) Often called \u201cfactory hot rods\u201d because of their resemblance to production-based cars (and because they must maintain a relatively stock appearance), and commonly known as  \"doorslammers\", Pro Stockers can record quarter-mile times in the 6.4 second range, and speeds over {{convert|210|mph|abbr=on}}. They can rev to more than 10,500 rpm and make in excess of {{convert|1300|hp|abbr=on}}. NHRA engines can be no more than {{convert|500|cuin|L|adj=on}} [[Engine displacement|displacement]] while IHRA/MMPSA cars can run a maximum of {{convert|820|cuin|L}} (called \"Mountain Motors\"). Both classes require the motors to be naturally aspirated.\n* [[Pro Stock Motorcycle]] (NHRA and ANDRA) These highly modified vehicles, which can run under 6.8 seconds at more than 195&nbsp;mph, feature a purpose-built tube chassis and a lightweight, aerodynamically enhanced replica of original bodywork.\n* [[Pro Modified]] (Pro Mod) or [[Top Doorslammer]] (T/D{{citation needed|date=January 2018|reason=that's NHRA's Top Dragster ID}}) Some engine restrictions, very high power. Cars can run superchargers, turbochargers, or nitrous oxide. Cars running blowers are limited to {{convert|527|cuin|L|1}} while cars with nitrous can run up to {{convert|740|cuin|L}}.  This class is globally recognised, although the name differs between North America and Australia.\n* [[Top Alcohol Dragster]] (TA/D). Known as Top Methanol Dragster in FIA competition. Top Alcohol Dragsters resemble Top Fuelers, but have significant differences. They may use a supercharged methanol-burning engine or an injected nitromethane combination. They can run in the 5.1s at more than 280&nbsp;mph.\n* [[Top Alcohol Funny Car]] (TA/FC). Known as Top Methanol Funny Car in FIA competition. Similar in physical appearance to their nitro-burning Funny Car counterparts, Top Alcohol Funny Cars are restricted to the use of methanol fuel and have three-speed transmissions. They can run in the 5.4s at more than 265&nbsp;mph. In the IHRA, Alcohol Funny Car is the fifth pro category, replacing NHRA's Pro Stock Bike.\n\n [[File:Comp Eliminator.JPG|thumb|A typical Comp car.<!--identify the car & place!-->]]\n* [[Competition Eliminator]] This is the NHRA class with the most variety. Each of its 88 sections is assigned an index based on what a well-built car should run, and races are handicapped according to those indexes.\n* [[Outlaw Series]]\n* [[Pro FWD]]\n* [[Sport Front-Wheel-Drive]] (SFWD) This is a class that is dedicated to solely front wheel drive vehicles. One of the motivations behind the creation of this class was to keep cars as original looking as they could possibly be. SFWD is one of the most common and popular import drag racing classes. The two most common vehicles in this class are the Honda Civic and the Acura Integra. In this class, the number one restriction is that each vehicle must retain its original chassis. No modification to the OEM floorboard or Firewall is permitted. In addition, at least one headlight and both brake lights must be fully functional. Suspension and brake modifications are allowed to a certain extent. Aftermarket components are permitted as long as the original mounting points are not modified. All four brakes must be retained and parachutes are permitted. The stock dashboard and windshield must be retained along with the car's original interior from the front seats forward, while rear seats as well as passenger-side seat may be removed. Racing gas or E85 may be used; methanol may not. Internal engine modifications of all types, aftermarket engine blocks, and engine swaps are permitted. Engines may use nitrous oxide or be turbocharged. Tires may be a maximum of {{convert|25|in|mm|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|9.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} in tread width. All cars must meet a minimum weight requirement of {{convert|2200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, plus any weight penalties teams may incur for having certain equipment installed that would have given them too much of an advantage over the competition.<ref>[http://ogs1320.com/sfwd/ SFWD rules]</ref>[http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/1305-sport-front-wheel-drive-class-explained/]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/1305-sport-front-wheel-drive-class-explained/|title=Sport Front-Wheel-Drive Class Explained - Honda Tuning Magazine|date=2013-06-23|work=SuperStreetOnline|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* [[Super Comp]]/[[Quick Rod]] The quickest of the heads-up Super classes (8.90 index) is composed primarily of dragsters. Most cars are capable of running well under the index but use electronic aids to run close to it without breaking out.\n\n [[File:Super Gas Probe.JPG|thumb|Super Gas Probe.<!--identify the car & place!-->]]\n* [[Super Gas]]/[[Super Rod]] Super Gas entries, which run on a 9.90 index, are primarily full-bodied cars and street roadsters. No dragsters or altereds are permitted. As in Super Comp, competitors use electronic aids to run as close to the class standard without going under.\n* [[Super Street]]/[[Hot Rod (drag racing class)|Hot Rod]] Racers compete on a fixed 10.90 index. All vehicles must be full-bodied cars and weigh no less than 2,800 pounds except for six-cylinder cars (2,000) and four-cylinder and rotary-powered cars (1,200). Engine and chassis modifications are virtually unlimited.\n\n[[File:Super Street Mustang.JPG|thumb|Super Street Mustang]]\n [[File:Super Stock.JPG|thumb|A typical Super Stock car<!--identify the car & place!-->]]\n* [[Super Stock]] Super Stock vehicles resemble ordinary passenger cars, but are actually heavily modified. Entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower and compete on indexes. The breakout rule is enforced.\n* [[Stock (drag racing class)|Stock]] Stock cars are similar to Super Stockers, but rules regarding everything from engine modifications to body alterations are much stricter. Virtually any car is eligible to compete, and entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower.\n* [[Sport Compact]]\n* Top Sportsman (NHRA and IHRA) Competitors in these full-bodied entries may choose their own dial-in for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.99 seconds. Full Tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n [[File:Top Dragster.JPG|thumb|Blown Top Dragster{{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=alky, gas, or fuel?}}<!--identify the cars & place!-->]]\n* Top Dragster (T/D) (NHRA and IHRA) Competitors in these open-wheel entries may choose their own dial-in for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.70 seconds. Full tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}. Cars can run any combination of motor: blown, turbo, nitrous or just all motor.\n* Top Fuel Funny Bike (high performance 5 second bikes)\n* [[Nostalgia Super Stock]]\n* NHRA and ANDRA [[Summit Racing]] series Super Pro, Pro, and bike.\n* Junior Dragster (racers between the ages of 8 and 18 may race a half scale version of the sport's fastest car, Top Fuel Dragster. Juniors run as follows: 12.90-slower for 8-9&nbsp;year olds, 10-12&nbsp;year olds at 8.90, and 13-18&nbsp;year olds 7.90 and slower at a top speed of 85&nbsp;mph).  These cars race at 1/8 mile or 1/16 mile.\n* NHRA new class for Juniors is JR COMP running 6.90s at a top speed of {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h}} (1/8 mile or 1/16 mile).\nA complete listing of all classes can be found on the respective NHRA and IHRA official websites.\n\n[[Image:Dragster engine.jpg|thumb|left|Dragster engine with dual-plug heads, dual ignition magnetos, and intake snorkel]]\n\nThe UEM also has a different structure of professional categories with Top Fuel Bike, Super Twin Top Fuel Bike, and Pro Stock Bike contested, leaving the entire European series with a total of 8 professional categories.\n\nTo allow different cars to compete against each other, some competitions are raced on a handicap basis, with faster cars delayed on the starting line enough to theoretically even things up with the slower car. This may be based on rule differences between the cars in stock, super stock, and modified classes, or on a competitor's chosen \"dial-in\" in [[bracket racing]].\n\nFor a list of drag racing [[world record]]s in each class, see [[Dragstrip#Quarter mile times]].\n\n==Dial-in==\nA \"dial-in\" is a time the driver estimates it will take his or her car to cross the finish line, and is generally displayed on one or more windows so the starter can adjust the starting lights on the tree accordingly. The slower car will then get a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] equal to the difference in the two dial-ins, so if both cars perform perfectly, they would cross the finish line dead even. If either car goes faster than its dial-in (called breaking out), it is disqualified regardless of who has the lower elapsed time; if both cars break out, the one who breaks out by the smallest amount wins. However, if a driver had jump-started (red light) or crossed a boundary line, both violations override any break out (except in some classes with an absolute break out rule such as Junior classes).  This eliminates any advantage from putting a slower time on the windshield to get a head start.\n\nThe effect of the bracket racing rules is to place a premium on consistency of performance of the driver and car rather than on raw speed, in that victory goes to the driver able to precisely predict elapsed time, whether it is fast or slow. This in turn makes victory much less dependent on large infusions of money, and more dependent on skill. Therefore, bracket racing is popular with casual weekend racers. Many of these recreational racers will drive their vehicles to the track, race them, and then simply drive them home. As most tracks host only one NHRA national event, and two or three regional events (smaller tours, car shows, ''etc.'') annually, on most weekends these tracks host local casual and weekend racers. Organizationally, however, the tracks are run according to the rules of either the NHRA or the IHRA with regional points and a championship on the line.

They are animated corpses with a corporeal body, unlike ghosts, with similar physical abilities as in life. Older literature makes clear distinctions between sea-draugar and land-draugar.\n\n== Traits ==\nDraugar possess superhuman strength, can increase their size at will, and carry the unmistakable stench of decay. According to Gregg Smith, \"The appearance of a ''draugr'' was that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at.\"<ref name=Remley /> They are undead figures from Norse and Icelandic mythology which appear to retain some semblance of intelligence. They exist to guard their treasure, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who wronged them in life. The draugr's ability to increase its size also increased its weight, and the body of the draugr was described as being extremely heavy. Thorolf of [[Eyrbyggja saga]] was \"uncorrupted, and with an ugly look about him\u2026 swollen to the size of an ox,\" and his body was so heavy that it could not be raised without levers.<ref name=\"PE187\">Palsson and Edwards, ''Eyrbyggja Saga'', p. 187.</ref><ref name=\"GS115\">''Grettirs Saga'', p. 115.</ref> They are also noted for the ability to rise from the grave as wisps of smoke and \"swim\" through solid rock.<ref name=\"MP103\">Magnussen and Palsson, ''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 103</ref> \n\nIn folklore, draugar slay their victims through various methods including crushing them with their enlarged forms, devouring their flesh, devouring them whole in their enlarged forms, indirectly killing them by driving them mad, and by drinking their blood. Animals feeding near the grave of a draugr might be driven mad by the creature's influence.<ref name=\"BC81-93\">{{cite book |last=Curran |first=Bob |authorlink= |title=Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures that Stalk the Night |publisher=Career Press |year=2005 |pages=81\u201393 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lK0iQcCUZqkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-1-56414-807-0}}</ref> They may also die from being driven mad. Thorolf, for example, caused birds to drop dead when they flew over his bowl barrow.\n\nThe draugr's victims were not limited to trespassers in its home. The roaming undead decimated livestock by running the animals to death either by riding them or pursuing them in some hideous, half-flayed form. Shepherds' duties kept them outdoors at night, and they were particular targets for the hunger and hatred of the undead:\n{{quote|text=The oxen which had been used to haul Thorolf's body were ridden to death by demons, and every single beast that came near his grave went raving mad and howled itself to death. The shepherd at Hvamm often came racing home with Thorolf after him.

Draugar also brought disease to a village and could create temporary darkness in daylight hours. They preferred to be active during the night, although it did not appear to be vulnerable to sunlight like some other revenants. Draugr can also kill people with bad luck.\n\nA draugr's presence might be shown by a great light that glowed from the mound like [[foxfire]].<ref name=\"FP36\">Fox and Palsson, ''Grettirs Saga'', p. 36.</ref> This fire would form a barrier between the land of the living and the land of the dead.<ref name=\"HR161\">Davidson, ''The Road to Hel'', p. 161.</ref> The draugr could also move magically through the earth, swimming through solid stone as does Killer-Hrapp:\n\n{{quote|text=Then Olaf tried to rush Hrapp, but Hrapp sank into the ground where he had been standing and that was the end of their encounter.<ref name=\"MP103\"/>}}\n\nSome draugar are immune to weapons, and only a hero has the strength and courage needed to stand up to so formidable an opponent. In legends, the hero would often have to wrestle the draugr back to his grave, thereby defeating him, since weapons would do no good. A good example of this is found in ''[[Hr\u00f3mundar saga Gripssonar]]''. Iron could injure a draugr, as is the case with many supernatural creatures, although it would not be sufficient to stop it.<ref name=\"JS107\">Simpson, ''Icelandic Folktales and Legends'', p. 107.</ref> Sometimes the hero is required to dispose of the body in unconventional ways. The preferred method is to cut off the draugr's head, burn the body, and dump the ashes in the sea\u2014the emphasis being on making absolutely sure that the draugr was dead and gone.<ref name=\"VA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/ghosts.shtml |title=Viking Answer Lady Webpage - The Walking Dead: Draugr and Aptrgangr in Old Norse Literature |publisher=Vikinganswerlady.com |date=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>\n\nThe draugar were said to be either ''hel-bl\u00e1r'' (\"death-blue\") or ''n\u00e1r-f\u00f6lr'' (\"corpse-pale\").<ref name=\"BC81-93\"/> The death-blue color was not actually grey but was a dark blue or maroon hue which covered the entire body. Gl\u00e1mr, the undead shepherd of ''Grettis saga'', was reported to be dark blue,<ref name=\"FP72\">Fox and Palsson, ''Grettirs Saga'', p. 72.</ref> and [[Laxd\u00e6la saga]] describes how bones were dug up belonging to a dead sorceress who had appeared in dreams, and they were \"blue and evil looking.\"<ref name=\"MP235\">Magnusson and Palsson, ''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 235.</ref>\n\nThe resting place of the draugr was a tomb which they were able to leave during the night to visit the living. Such visits are supposed to be horrible events that often end in death for one or more of the living, which would then warrant the exhumation of the draugr by a hero.\n\nThe draugr's motivation was primarily jealousy and greed. Greed causes it to viciously attack any would-be grave robbers, but the draugr also expresses an innate jealousy of the living stemming from a longing for the things of life which it once had. They also exhibit an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, as shown in the encounter of Aran and Asmund, sword brothers who made an oath that, if one should die, the other would sit vigil with him for three days inside the burial mound. When Aran died, Asmund brought his own possessions into the barrow\u2014banners, armor, hawk, hound, and horse\u2014then set himself to wait the three days:\n\n{{quote|text=During the first night, Aran got up from his chair and killed the hawk and hound and ate them. On the second night he got up again from his chair, and killed the horse and tore it into pieces; then he took great bites at the horse-flesh with his teeth, the blood streaming down from his mouth all the while he was eating\u2026. The third night Asmund became very drowsy, and the first thing he knew, Aran had got him by the ears and torn them off.<ref name=\"GSOMT99-101\">''Gautrek's Saga and Other Medieval Tales'', pp. 99-101.</ref>}}\n\n== Creation of draugar ==\nThe main indication that a deceased person will become a draugr is that the corpse is not in a horizontal position but is found in an upright or sitting position, indicating that the dead might return.{{sfnp|Jakobsson|2011|p=296}} Any mean, nasty, or greedy person can become a draugr.

The big toes were tied together or needles were driven through the soles of the feet in order to keep the dead from being able to walk. Tradition also held that the coffin should be lifted and lowered in three different directions as it was carried from the house to confuse a possible draugr's sense of direction.\n\nThe most effective means of preventing the return of the dead was believed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a corpse door, a special door through which the corpse was carried feet-first with people surrounding it so that the corpse couldn't see where it was going. The door was then bricked up to prevent a return. It is speculated{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that this belief began in Denmark and spread throughout the Norse culture, founded on the idea that the dead could only leave through the way they entered.\n\nIn ''Eyrbyggja saga'', draugar are driven off by holding a \"door-doom\". One by one, they are summoned to the door-doom and given judgment and forced out of the home by this legal method. The home was then purified with holy water to ensure that they never came back.\n\n== Similar creatures ==\nA variation of the draugr is the ''[[haugbui]]'' (from Old Norse ''haugr''' \"howe, barrow, tumulus\") which was a mound-dweller, the dead body living on within its tomb. The notable difference between the two was that the haugbui is unable to leave its grave site and only attacks those who trespass upon their territory.<ref name=\"BC81-93\"/>\n\nThe haugbui was rarely found far from its burial place and is a type of undead commonly found in Norse sagas. The creature is said to either swim alongside boats or sail around them in a partially submerged vessel, always on their own. In some accounts, witnesses portray them as shapeshifters who take on the appearance of seaweed or moss-covered stones on the shoreline.<ref>[http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-76010.html The Walking Dead: Draugr and Aptrgangr in Old Norse Literature]</ref>\n\n== Folklore ==\n\n===Icelandic Sagas===\nOne of the best-known draugar is '''Gl\u00e1mr''', who is defeated by the hero in ''[[Grettis saga]]''. After Gl\u00e1mr dies on Christmas Eve, \"people became aware that Gl\u00e1mr was not resting in peace. He wrought such havoc that some people fainted at the sight of him, while others went out of their minds\".{{sfnp|Scudder|2005}} After a mundane battle, Grettir eventually gets Gl\u00e1mr on his back. Just before Grettir kills him, Gl\u00e1mr curses Grettir because \"Gl\u00e1mr was endowed with more evil force than most other ghosts\",{{sfnp|Scudder|2005}} and thus he was able to speak and leave Grettir with his curse after his death.\n\nA somewhat ambivalent, alternative view of the draugr is presented by the example of [[Gunnar H\u00e1mundarson]] in ''[[Nj\u00e1ls saga]]'': \"It seemed as though the howe was agape, and that Gunnar had turned within the howe to look upwards at the moon. They thought that they saw four lights within the howe, but not a shadow to be seen. Then they saw that Gunnar was merry, with a joyful face.\"{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]'', a shepherd is assaulted by a blue-black draugr. The shepherd's neck is broken during the ensuing scuffle. The shepherd rises the next night as a draugr.<ref name=\"BC81-93\"/>\n\n===Recent===\n[[Image:Draug.jpg|thumb|right|140px|A \"draug\" from modern Scandinavian folklore<ref name=\"JL2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13508/13508-h/13508-h.htm |title=Weird Tales from the Northern Seas |author=Housman, Laurence (illustrations); R.

The creature is said to possess a distinctly human form, with the exception that its head is composed entirely of [[seaweed]]. In other tellings, the draug is described as being a headless fisherman, dressed in [[oilskin]] and sailing in half a boat (the Norwegian municipality of [[B\u00f8, Nordland]] has the half-boat in its coat-of-arms). This trait is common in the northernmost part of Norway, where life and culture was based on fishing more than anywhere else. The reason for this may be that the fishermen often drowned in great numbers, and the stories of restless dead coming in from sea were more common up north than anywhere else in the country.\n\nA recorded legend from [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] tells how a [[cadaver]] lying on a beach became the object of a quarrel between the two types of draug (headless and seaweed-headed). A similar source even tells of a third type, the ''gleip'', known to hitch themselves to sailors walking ashore and make them slip on the wet rocks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nBut, though the draug usually presages death, there is an amusing account in [[Northern Norway]] of a northerner who managed to outwit him:\n\n{{quote|text=It was [[Christmas Eve]], and Ola went down to his boathouse to get the [[keg]] of [[brandy]] he had bought for the holidays. When he got in, he noticed a draugr sitting on the keg, staring out to sea. Ola, with great presence of mind and great bravery (it might not be amiss to state that he already had done some drinking), tiptoed up behind the draugr and struck him sharply in the small of the back, so that he went flying out through the window, with sparks hissing around him as he hit the water. Ola knew he had no time to lose, so he set off at a great rate, running through the churchyard which lay between his home and the boathouse. As he ran, he cried, \"Up, all you [[Christian]] [[Spirit|souls]], and help me!\" Then he heard the sound of fighting between the ghosts and the draugr, who were battling each other with [[Coffin|coffin boards]] and bunches of seaweed. The next morning, when people came to church, the whole yard was strewn with coffin covers, boat boards, and seaweed. After the fight, which the ghosts won, the draugr never came back to that district.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}}}\n\n===Literature===\n\nThe modern and popular connection between the draug and the sea can be traced back to authors like [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]] and Regine Nordmann, whose works include several books of fairy tales, as well as the drawings of [[Theodor Kittelsen]], who spent some years living in [[Svolv\u00e6r]]. Up north, the tradition of sea-draugs is especially vivid.\n\n[[Arne Garborg]] describes land-draugs coming [[Haugtussa|fresh from the graveyards]], and the term ''draug'' is even used of [[vampires]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The notion of draugs who live in the mountains is present in the poetic works of [[Henrik Ibsen]] (''[[Peer Gynt]]''), and [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]]. The [[Nynorsk]] translation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' used the term for both [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and the dead men of [[Dunharrow]]. Tolkien's [[Barrow-Wights]] bear obvious similarity to, and were inspired by the haugbui.\n\nThe term ''draug'' has come to be used to describe any type{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} of [[revenant]] in Nordic folklore.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gjenganger]]\n* [[Norse funeral]]\n* [[Spriggan]]\n* [[Wiederg\u00e4nger]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal|last=Chadwick|first=N.

Besides the day of 24 hours (86 400 seconds), the word ''day'' is used for several different spans of time based on the rotation of the Earth around its axis. An important one is the solar day, defined as the time it takes for the Sun to return to its culmination point (its highest point in the sky). Because celestial orbits are not perfectly circular, and thus objects travel at different speeds at various positions in their orbit, a solar day is not the same length of time throughout the orbital year. Because the Earth orbits the Sun elliptically as the Earth spins on an inclined axis, this period can be up to 7.9 seconds more than (or less than) 24 hours. In recent decades, the average length of a solar day on Earth has been about 86 400.002 seconds<ref>The average over the last 50 years is about 86 400.002. The yearly average over that period has ranged between about 86 400 and 86 400.003, while the length of individual days has varied between about 86 399.999 and 86 400.004 seconds. See this graph: [[File:Deviation of day length from SI day.svg]] (data from {{cite web|title=EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETERS|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/eop/eopc04/eopc04.62-now|publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426160146/http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/eop/eopc04/eopc04.62-now|archivedate=April 26, 2015|deadurl=no}}).</ref> (24.000 000 6 hours) and there are about 365.2422 solar days in one mean [[tropical year]]. \n\nAncient custom has a new day start at either the rising or setting of the Sun on the local horizon (Italian reckoning, for example, being 24 hours from sunset, oldstyle).<ref>L. Holford-Stevens, ''The History of Time'' (Oxford 2005) p. 6</ref> The exact moment of, and the interval between, two sunrises or sunsets depends on the geographical position ([[longitude]] as well as latitude), and the time of [[year]] (as indicated by ancient hemispherical [[sundial]]s).\n\nA more constant day can be defined by the Sun passing through the local [[meridian (geography)|meridian]], which happens at local [[noon]] (upper [[culmination]]) or [[midnight]] (lower culmination). The exact moment is dependent on the geographical longitude, and to a lesser extent on the time of the year. The length of such a day is nearly constant (24 hours \u00b1 30 seconds). This is the time as indicated by modern sundials.\n\nA further improvement defines a fictitious mean Sun that moves with constant speed along the [[celestial equator]]; the speed is the same as the average speed of the real Sun, but this removes the variation over a year as the Earth moves along its orbit around the Sun (due to both its velocity and its axial tilt).\n\n=== Stellar day ===\nA ''day'', understood as the span of time it takes for the Earth to make one entire [[rotation]]<ref>\nCertain authors caution against identifying \"day\" with rotation period. For example: {{cite web |url=http://cseligman.com/text/sky/rotationvsday.htm |title=Rotation Period and Day Length |author=Courtney Seligman |quote=A Cautionary Note: Because the rotation period of the Earth is almost the same as the length of its day, we sometimes get a bit sloppy in discussing the rotation of the sky, and say that the stars rotate around us once each day. In a similar way, it is not unusual for careless people to mix up the rotation period of a planet with the length of its day, or vice versa. |accessdate=2011-06-03}}\n</ref> with respect to the celestial background or a distant star (assumed to be fixed), is called a ''[[Rotation period|stellar day]]''. This period of rotation is about 4 minutes less than 24 hours (23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds) and there are about 366.2422 stellar days in one mean tropical year (one stellar day more than the number of solar days). Other planets and moons have stellar and solar days of different lengths from Earth's.\n\n=== Daytime ===\nA day, in the sense of daytime that is distinguished from night-time, is commonly defined as the period during which [[sunlight]] directly reaches the ground, assuming that there are no local obstacles. The length of daytime averages slightly more than half of the 24-hour day. Two effects make daytime on average longer than nights. The Sun is not a point, but has an apparent size of about 32 [[minute of arc|minutes of arc]]. Additionally, the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] [[refraction|refracts]] sunlight in such a way that some of it reaches the ground even when the Sun is below the horizon by about 34 minutes of arc. So the first light reaches the ground when the centre of the Sun is still below the horizon by about 50 minutes of arc<ref>{{frac|32\u2032|2}} + 34\u2032 = 50\u2032</ref>. Thus, daytime is on average around 7 minutes longer than 12 hours<ref>{{sfrac|50\u00b0|60 }} \u00f7 360\u00b0 \u00d7 2(for sunrise and set) \u00d7 24 hours \u2248 7 min</ref>.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term comes from the [[Old English]] ''d\u00e6g'', with its cognates such as ''dagur'' in Icelandic, ''Tag'' in German, and ''dag'' in Norwegian, Danish, Swedish and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. All of them from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European root]] '''dyau''' which explains the similarity with Latin '''dies''' though the word is known to come from the Germanic branch. {{As of|2015|10|17|df=US}}, ''day'' is the 205th most common word in [[American English|US English]],<ref name=\"English Words\">{{Cite web|url = https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/top1000/english?page=5|title = English Words|accessdate = 2015-10-17|website = Oxford Dictionaries Online (ODO)|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> and the 210th most common in [[British English|UK English]].<ref name=\"English Words\"/>\n\n== International System of Units (SI) ==\nA day, symbol ''d'', defined as 86 400 seconds, is not an [[International System of Units|SI]] unit, but is accepted for use with SI.<ref name=Non-SI>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/table6.html |title=Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI, and units based on fundamental constants|edition=8th |date=2014 |orig-year=2006 |website=SI Brochure |author=BIPM |authorlink=International Bureau of Weights and Measures}}</ref> The Second is the base unit of time in [[SI units]].\n\nIn 1967\u201368, during the 13th CGPM (Resolution 1),<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/13/1/|title = SI Unit of Time (Second)|accessdate = 2015-10-17|website = Resolution 1 of the 13th CGPM (1967/68)|publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)}}</ref> the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) redefined a second as <blockquote>\u2026 the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the [[Radioactive decay|radiation]] corresponding to the transition between two [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] [[energy level|levels]] of the [[Stationary state|ground state]] of the [[caesium]] 133 [[atom]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/second.html|title = Unit of Time (Second)|accessdate = 2015-10-17|website = SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI)|publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)|orig-year = 2006|year = 2014|edition = 8}}</ref></blockquote>\nThis makes the SI-based day last exactly 794 243 384 928 000 of those periods.\n\n=== Leap seconds ===\nMainly due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal effects]], the Earth's rotational period is not constant, resulting in minor variations for both solar days and stellar \"days\". The Earth's day has increased in length over time. This phenomenon is due to [[tide]]s raised by the [[Moon]] which slow [[Earth's rotation]]. Because of the way the second is defined, the mean length of a day is now about 86 400.002 seconds, and is increasing by about 1.7 [[milliseconds]] per century (an average over the last 2 700 years). (See [[tidal acceleration]] for details.) The length of a day circa 620 million years ago has been estimated from [[rhythmites]] (alternating layers in [[sandstone]]) as having been about 21.9 hours. The length of day for the Earth before the [[Origin of the Moon|moon was created]] is still unknown.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn order to keep the civil day aligned with the apparent movement of the Sun, a day according to [[Coordinated Universal Time|Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)]] can include a negative or positive [[leap second]]. Therefore, although typically 86 400 SI seconds in duration, a civil day can be either 86 401 or 86 399 SI seconds long on such a day.\n\nLeap seconds are announced in advance by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)]], which measures the Earth's rotation and determines whether a leap second is necessary. Leap seconds occur only at the end of a UTC-calculated month, and have only ever been inserted at the end of June 30 or December 31.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Civil day ===\nFor civil purposes, a common clock time is typically defined for an entire region based on the local mean solar time at a central meridian. Such [[time zone|''time zones'']] began to be adopted about the middle of the 19th century when [[Rail transport|railroad]]s with regularly occurring schedules came into use, with most major countries having adopted them by 1929. As of 2015, throughout the world, 40 such zones are now in use: the central zone, from which all others are defined as offsets, is known as [[UTC\u00b100:00|UTC\u00b100]], which uses [[Coordinated Universal Time|Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)]].\n\nThe most common convention starts the civil day at [[midnight]]: this is near the time of the [[Culmination|lower culmination]] of the Sun on the central meridian of the time zone. Such a day may be referred to as a [[calendar day]].\n \nA day is commonly divided into 24 hours of 60 minutes, with each minute composed of 60 seconds.\n\n=== Decimal and metric time ===\n{{Main|Metric time}}\nIn the 19th century, an idea circulated to make a decimal fraction ({{frac|1|10 000}} or {{frac|1|100 000}}) of an astronomical day the base unit of time. This was an afterglow of the short-lived movement toward a decimalisation of [[decimal time|timekeeping]] and the [[French Republican Calendar|calendar]], which had been given up already due to its difficulty in transitioning from traditional, more familiar units. The most successful alternative is the ''[[Metric time|centiday]]'', equal to 14.4 minutes (864 seconds), being not only a shorter multiple of an hour (0.24 vs 2.4) but also closer to the SI multiple ''[[kilosecond]]'' (1 000 seconds) and equal to the [[Traditional Chinese timekeeping|traditional Chinese unit, ''k\u00e8'']].\n\n== Colloquial ==\nThe word refers to various similarly defined ideas, such as:\n; Full day\n* 24 [[hour]]s (exactly)\n* The full day covering both the dark and light periods, beginning from the start of the dark period or from a point near the middle of the dark period\n* A full dark and light period, sometimes called a ''[[nychthemeron]]'' in English, from the Greek for ''[[night]]-day''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nychthemeron|title=Definition of NYCHTHEMERON|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>; or more colloquially the term {{nowrap|''24 hours''}}. In other languages, {{nowrap|''24 hours''}} is also often used. Other languages also have a separate word for a full day.\n; Daytime\n* The period of light when the Sun is above the local [[horizon]] (that is, the time period from [[sunrise]] to [[sunset]])\n* The time period from 06:00\u201318:00 (6:00 [[12-hour clock|am]] \u2013 6:00 pm) or 21:00 (9:00 pm) or another fixed clock period overlapping or offset from other time periods such as \"[[morning]]\", \"[[evening]]\", or \"[[night]]\".\n* The time period from first-light \"[[dawn]]\" to last-light \"[[twilight]]\".\n\n== Boundaries ==\n[[File:Sun and Moon Nuremberg chronicle.jpg|thumb|left|208px|[[Sun]] and [[Moon]], Hartmann Schedel's ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]\nFor most [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals, the day naturally begins at dawn and ends at sunset. Humans, with their cultural norms and scientific knowledge, have employed several different conceptions of the day's boundaries. Common convention among the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]<ref>See [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0212%3Asection%3D84 Plutarch, ''Quaestiones Romanae'', 84.]</ref>, [[Ancient China|ancient Chinese]]<ref>[[s:zh:\u6e05\u53f2\u7a3f/\u537748]]: \u8d77''\u5b50\u6b63''\uff0c\u76e1''\u591c\u5b50\u521d''\u3002</ref> and in modern times is for the civil day to begin at midnight, i.e. 00:00, and last a full 24 hours until 24:00 (i.e. 00:00 of the next day).  \nIn [[ancient Egypt]], the day was reckoned from sunrise to sunrise.\n\nThe [[Judaism|Jewish]] day begins at either sunset or nightfall (when three second-[[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] stars appear). The \"[[Damascus Document]]\", copies of which were also found among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]], states regarding the observance of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] that \"No one is to do any work on Friday ''from the moment that the Sun's disk stands distant from the horizon by the length of its own diameter'',\" presumably indicating that the monastic community responsible for producing this work counted the day as ending shortly before the Sun had begun to set.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} <!--There are presumably other traditions to present here.-->\n\n[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Europe also followed this tradition, known as [[Florentine calendar|Florentine]] reckoning: in this system, a reference like \"two hours into the day\" meant ''two hours after sunset'' and thus times during the evening need to be shifted back one calendar day in modern reckoning. Days such as [[Christmas Eve]], [[Halloween]], and the Eve of [[Agnes of Rome|Saint Agnes]] are remnants of the older pattern when [[religious holiday|holidays]] began during the prior evening. Prior to 1926, [[Turkey]] had two time systems: Turkish (counting the hours from sunset) and French (counting the hours from midnight).\n\nIn many cultures, nights are named after the previous day. For example,\"Friday night\" usually means the entire night between Friday and Saturday. This difference from the civil day often leads to confusion. Events starting at midnight are often announced as occurring the day before. TV-guides tend to list nightly programs at the previous day, although programming a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]] requires the strict logic of starting the new day at 00:00 (to further confuse the issue, VCRs set to the 12-hour clock notation will label this \"12:00 AM\"). Expressions like \"today\", \"yesterday\" and \"tomorrow\" become ambiguous during the night. Because Jews and Muslims begin their days at nightfall, \"Saturday\" night, for example, is what most people would call Friday night.\n\nValidity of [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s, passes, etc., for a day or a number of days may end at midnight, or closing time, when that is earlier. However, if a service (e.g., [[public transport]]) operates from for example, 6:00 to 1:00 the next day (which may be noted as 25:00), the last hour may well count as being part of the previous day. For services depending on the day (\"closed on Sundays\", \"does not run on Fridays\", and so on) there is a risk of ambiguity. For example, a day ticket on the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] (Dutch Railways) is valid for 28 hours, from 0:00 to 28:00 (that is, 4:00 the next day); the validity of a pass on [[Transport for London]] (TfL) services is until the end of the \"transport day\"\u2014that is to say, until 4:30 am on the day after the \"expiry\" date stamped on the pass.\n\n==Midnight sun==\nIn places which experience the [[Midnight sun|midnight sun (polar day)]], daytime may extend beyond one 24 hour period and could even extend to months\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Calculating the day of the week]]\n* [[Daylight]]\n* [[Daytime]]\n* [[Day length fluctuations]]\n* [[Holiday]]\n* [[ISO 8601]]\n* [[Meteorological day]]\n* [[Nychthemeron]]\n* [[Season]], for a discussion of daylight and darkness at various latitudes\n* [[Synodic day]]\n* [[Sidereal time]]\n* [[Zmanim]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commonscatinline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n\n{{Time topics}}\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n{{Parts of a day}}\n{{SI units}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Day| ]]\n[[Category:Units of time]]\n[[Category:Orders of magnitude (time)]]", "sha1": "i6hqd0mv8l1bjvx0fq5987c71av9dp2"}}, {"title": "Database", "ns": "0", "id": "8377", "revision": {"id": "866535658", "parentid": "866534216", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T22:58:21Z", "contributor": {"username": "Djm-leighpark", "id": "30218082"}, "comment": "The word 'also' is required here as these 3 uses are different to the use of a collection of data", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Outline}}\n{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n[[Image:DVD Rental Query.png|thumb|An SQL select statement and its result.]]\n\nA '''database''' is an organized collection of [[Data (computing)|data]], generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.  Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal [[#Design and modeling|design and modeling]] techniques.\n\nThe [[#Database management system|database management system]] (DBMS) is the [[software]] that interacts with [[end user]]s, applications, the database itself to capture and analyze the data and provides facilities to administer the database.  The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a \"database system\".  Often the term \"database\" is also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.\n\nComputer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the [[database model]]s that they support. [[Relational database]]s became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as [[Row (database)|rows]] and [[Column (database)|columns]] in a series of [[Table (database)|tables]], and the vast majority use [[SQL]] for writing and querying data.  In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, referred to as [[NoSQL]] because they use different [[query language]]s.\n\n==Terminology and overview==\n\nFormally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to this data is usually provided by a \"database management system\" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows [[user (computing)|users]] to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.\n\nBecause of the close relationship between them, the term \"database\" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.\n\nOutside the world of professional [[information technology]], the term ''database'' is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a [[spreadsheet]] or a card index) as however size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.{{sfn|Ullman|Widom|1997|p=1}}\n\nExisting DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups:\n\n* '''Data definition''' \u2013 Creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of the data.\n* '''Update''' \u2013 Insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/update|title=Update \u2013 Definition of update by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n* '''Retrieval''' \u2013 Providing information in a form directly usable or for further processing by other applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a form basically the same as it is stored in the database or in a new form obtained by altering or combining existing data from the database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/retrieval|title=Retrieval \u2013 Definition of retrieval by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n* '''Administration''' \u2013 Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/administration|title=Administration \u2013 Definition of administration by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n\nBoth a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular [[database model]].{{sfn|Tsitchizris| Lochovsky| 1982}} \"Database system\" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.{{sfn|Beynon\u2013Davies|2003}}\n\nPhysically, database [[Server (computing)|servers]] are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually [[multiprocessor]] computers, with generous memory and [[redundant array of independent disks|RAID]] disk arrays used for stable storage. RAID is used for recovery of data if any of the disks fail. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most [[database application]]s. DBMSs may be built around a custom [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] with built-in [[Computer network|networking]] support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard [[operating system]] to provide these functions.\n\nSince DBMSs comprise a significant [[Market (economics)|market]], computer and storage vendors often take into account DBMS requirements in their own development plans.{{sfn|Nelson|Nelson|2001}}\n\nDatabases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such as relational or XML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from a server cluster to a mobile phone), the [[query language]](s) used to access the database (such as SQL or [[XQuery]]), and their internal engineering, which affects performance, [[scalability]], resilience, and security.\n\n==History==\n\nThe sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of [[Central processing unit|processors]], [[computer memory]], [[Computer data storage|computer storage]], and [[computer network]]s. The development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: [[navigational database|navigational]],{{sfn|Bachman|1973}} SQL/[[relational database|relational]], and post-relational.\n\nThe two main early navigational data models were the [[Hierarchical database model|hierarchical model]] and the [[CODASYL]] model ([[network model]])\n\nThe [[relational model]], first proposed in 1970 by [[Edgar F. Codd]], departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale [[data processing]] applications, and {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} they remain dominant: [[IBM DB2]], [[Oracle database|Oracle]], [[MySQL]], and [[Microsoft SQL Server]] are the most searched [[DBMS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pypl.github.io/DB.html|title=TOPDB Top Database index|work=pypl.github.io}}</ref> The dominant database language, standardised SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n[[Object database]]s were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of [[object-relational impedance mismatch]], which led to the coining of the term \"post-relational\" and also the development of hybrid [[object-relational database]]s.\n\nThe next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as [[NoSQL]] databases, introducing fast [[key-value store]]s and [[document-oriented database]]s. A competing \"next generation\" known as [[NewSQL]] databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.\n\n===1960s, navigational DBMS===\n{{Further|Navigational database}}\n[[File:CodasylB.png|thumb|280px|Basic structure of navigational [[CODASYL]] database model]]\n\nThe introduction of the term ''database'' coincided with the availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than daily [[batch processing]]. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of California as the first to use the term \"data-base\" in a specific technical sense.<ref>{{cite web|title=database, n|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/47411|work=OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=July 12, 2013|date=June 2013}} {{subscription required|s}}</ref>\n\nAs computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use. Interest in a standard began to grow, and [[Charles Bachman]], author of one such product, the [[Integrated Data Store]] (IDS), founded the \"Database Task Group\" within [[CODASYL]], the group responsible for the creation and standardization of [[COBOL]]. In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as the \"CODASYL approach\", and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market.\n\nThe CODASYL approach relied on the \"manual\" navigation of a linked data set which was formed into a large network. Applications could find records by one of three methods:\n#Use of a primary key (known as a CALC key, typically implemented by [[Hash function|hashing]])\n#Navigating relationships (called sets) from one record to another\n#Scanning all the records in a sequential order\n\nLater systems added [[B-tree]]s to provide alternate access paths. Many CODASYL databases also added a very straightforward query language. However, in the final tally, CODASYL was very complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications.\n\n[[International Business Machines|IBM]] also had their own DBMS in 1966, known as [[IBM Information Management System|Information Management System]] (IMS). IMS was a development of software written for the [[Apollo program]] on the [[System/360]]. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL's network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed, and Bachman's 1973 [[Turing Award]] presentation was ''The Programmer as Navigator''. IMS is classified{{by whom|date=March 2014}} as a [[hierarchical database]]. IDMS and [[Cincom Systems]]' [[Cincom Systems#1970s|TOTAL]] database are classified as network databases.  IMS remains in use {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM Information Management System (IMS) 13 Transaction and Database Servers delivers high performance and low total cost of ownership|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS213-381|accessdate=Feb 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1970s, relational DBMS===\nEdgar Codd worked at IBM in [[San Jose, California]], in one of their offshoot offices that was primarily involved in the development of [[hard disk]] systems. He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a \"search\" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking ''A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks''.{{sfn|Codd|1970}}\n\nIn this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of [[linked list]] of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a \"[[Table (database)|table]]\" of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing \"sparse\" databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty. The relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables (or ''relations''), with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed. Data may be freely inserted, deleted and edited in these tables, with the DBMS doing whatever maintenance needed to present a table view to the application/user.\n\n[[File:Relational key SVG.svg|thumb|258x258px|In the [[relational model]], records are \"linked\" using virtual keys not stored in the database but defined as needed between the data contained in the records.]]\n \t\nThe relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers. The relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship, like a traditional hierarchical model, and many-to-many relationship, like a navigational (network) model. Thus, a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models, as well as its native tabular model, allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models, as the application requires.\n\nFor instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single record, and unused items would simply not be placed in the database. In the relational approach, the data would be ''normalized'' into a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.\n\nLinking the information back together is the key to this system. In the relational model, some bit of information was used as a \"[[Primary key|key]]\", uniquely defining a particular record. When information was being collected about a user, information stored in the optional tables would be found by searching for this key. For instance, if the login name of a user is unique, addresses and phone numbers for that user would be recorded with the login name as its key. This simple \"re-linking\" of related data back into a single collection is something that traditional computer languages are not designed for.\n\nJust as the navigational approach would require programs to loop in order to collect records, the relational approach would require loops to collect information about any ''one'' record. Codd's suggestions was a set-oriented language, that would later spawn the ubiquitous [[SQL]]. Using a branch of mathematics known as [[tuple calculus]], he demonstrated that such a system could support all the operations of normal databases (inserting, updating etc.) as well as providing a simple system for finding and returning ''sets'' of data in a single operation.\n\nCodd's paper was picked up by two people at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and [[Michael Stonebraker]]. They started a project known as [[INGRES]] using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979. INGRES was similar to [[IBM System R|System R]] in a number of ways, including the use of a \"language\" for [[data access]], known as [[QUEL query languages|QUEL]]. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard.\n\nIBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model, [[PRTV]], and a production one, [[Business System 12]], both now discontinued. [[Honeywell]] wrote [[Multics Relational Data Store|MRDS]] for [[Multics]], and now there are two new implementations: [[Dataphor|Alphora Dataphor]] and [[Rel (DBMS)|Rel]]. Most other DBMS implementations usually called ''relational'' are actually SQL DBMSs.\n\nIn 1970, the University of Michigan began development of the [[MICRO Relational Database Management System|MICRO Information Management System]]{{sfn|Hershey|Easthope|1972}} based on D.L. Childs' Set-Theoretic Data model.{{sfn|North|2010}}{{sfn|Childs|1968a}}{{sfn|Childs|1968b}} MICRO was used to manage very large data sets by the [[US Department of Labor]], the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], and researchers from the [[University of Alberta]], the [[University of Michigan]], and [[Wayne State University]]. It ran on IBM mainframe computers using the [[Michigan Terminal System]].<ref name=MICROManual1977>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B4t_NX-QeWDYZGMwOTRmOTItZTg2Zi00YmJkLTg4MTktN2E4MWU0YmZlMjE3 ''MICRO Information Management System (Version 5.0) Reference Manual''], M.A. Kahn, D.L. Rumelhart, and B.L. Bronson, October 1977, Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (ILIR), University of Michigan and Wayne State University</ref> The system remained in production until 1998.\n\n===Integrated approach===\n{{Main|Database machine}}\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software. The underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at lower cost. Examples were IBM [[System/38]], the early offering of [[Teradata]], and the [[Britton Lee, Inc.]] database machine.\n\nAnother approach to hardware support for database management was [[International Computers Limited|ICL]]'s [[Content Addressable File Store|CAFS]] accelerator, a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers. Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware, using general-purpose computer data storage. However this idea is still pursued for certain applications by some companies like [[Netezza]] and Oracle ([[Exadata]]).\n\n===Late 1970s, SQL DBMS===\nIBM started working on a prototype system loosely based on Codd's concepts as ''System R'' in the early 1970s. The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large \"chunk\". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized [[query language]] \u2013 SQL{{Citation needed|reason=First version of SQL standard was SQL-86 adopted in 1986|date=May 2012}} \u2013 had been added. Codd's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known as ''SQL/DS'', and, later, ''Database 2'' (DB2).\n\n[[Larry Ellison]]'s Oracle Database (or more simply, Oracle) started from a different chain, based on IBM's papers on System R. Though Oracle V1 implementations were completed in 1978, it wasn't until Oracle Version 2 when Ellison beat IBM to market in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/p27anniv-timeline-151918.pdf |title=Oracle 30th Anniversary Timeline |accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nStonebraker went on to apply the lessons from INGRES to develop a new database, Postgres, which is now known as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is often used for global mission critical applications (the .org and .info domain name registries use it as their primary [[data store]], as do many large companies and financial institutions).\n\nIn Sweden, Codd's paper was also read and [[Mimer SQL]] was developed from the mid-1970s at [[Uppsala University]]. In 1984, this project was consolidated into an independent enterprise.\n\nAnother data model, the [[entity\u2013relationship model]], emerged in 1976 and gained popularity for [[database design]] as it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model. Later on, entity\u2013relationship constructs were retrofitted as a data modeling construct for the relational model, and the difference between the two have become irrelevant.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===1980s, on the desktop===\nThe 1980s ushered in the age of [[Desktop Computer|desktop computing]]. The new computers empowered their users with spreadsheets like [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and database software like [[dBASE]]. The dBASE product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box. [[C. Wayne Ratliff]], the creator of dBASE, stated: \"dBASE was different from programs like BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and COBOL in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done. The data manipulation is done by dBASE instead of by the user, so the user can concentrate on what he is doing, rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening, reading, and closing files, and managing space allocation.\"<ref>[http://www.foxprohistory.org/interview_wayne_ratliff.htm Interview with Wayne Ratliff]. The FoxPro History. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref> dBASE was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n===1990s, object-oriented===\nThe 1990s, along with a rise in [[object-oriented programming]], saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled. Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields.<ref>Development of an object-oriented DBMS; Portland, Oregon, United States; Pages: 472\u2013482; 1986; {{ISBN|0-89791-204-7}}</ref> The term \"[[object-relational impedance mismatch]]\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. [[Object database]]s and [[object-relational database]]s attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known as [[object-relational mapping]]s (ORMs) attempt to solve the same problem.\n\n===2000s, NoSQL and NewSQL===\n{{Main|NoSQL|NewSQL}}\n\n[[XML databases]] are a type of structured document-oriented database that allows querying based on [[XML]] document attributes. XML databases are mostly used in applications where the data is conveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid: examples include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and personnel records.\n\nNoSQL databases are often very fast, do not require fixed table schemas, avoid join operations by storing [[Denormalization|denormalized]] data, and are designed to [[Horizontal scaling|scale horizontally]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance, but according to the [[CAP theorem]] it is impossible for a [[Distributed computing|distributed system]] to simultaneously provide [[Consistency model|consistency]], availability, and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason, many NoSQL databases are using what is called [[eventual consistency]] to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency.\n\nNewSQL is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (read-write) workloads while still using SQL and maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.\n\n==Use cases==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\n\nDatabases are used to support internal operations of organizations and to underpin online interactions with customers and suppliers (see [[Enterprise software]]).\n\nDatabases are used to hold administrative information and more specialized data, such as engineering data or economic models. Examples include computerized [[library]] systems, [[flight reservation system]]s, computerized [[parts inventory system]]s, and many [[content management system]]s that store [[website]]s as collections of webpages in a database.\n\n==Classification==\nOne way to classify databases involves the type of their contents, for example: [[Bibliographic database|bibliographic]], document-text, statistical, or multimedia objects. Another way is by their application area, for example: accounting, music compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or insurance. A third way is by some technical aspect, such as the database structure or interface type. This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases.\n\n* An [[in-memory database]] is a database that primarily resides in [[main memory]], but is typically backed-up by non-volatile computer data storage. Main memory databases are faster than disk databases, and so are often used where response time is critical, such as in telecommunications network equipment.\n* An [[active database]] includes an event-driven architecture which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database. Possible uses include security monitoring, alerting, statistics gathering and authorization. Many databases provide active database features in the form of [[database trigger]]s.\n* A [[cloud database]] relies on [[Cloud computing|cloud technology]]. Both the database and most of its DBMS reside remotely, \"in the cloud\", while its applications are both developed by programmers and later maintained and used by end-users through a [[web browser]] and [[Open API]]s.\n* [[Data warehouse]]s archive data from operational databases and often from external sources such as market research firms. The warehouse becomes the central source of data for use by managers and other end-users who may not have access to operational data. For example, sales data might be aggregated to weekly totals and converted from internal product codes to use [[Universal Product Code|UPCs]] so that they can be compared with [[ACNielsen]] data. Some basic and essential components of data warehousing include extracting, analyzing, and [[Data mining|mining]] data, transforming, loading, and managing data so as to make them available for further use.\n* A [[deductive database]] combines [[logic programming]] with a relational database.\n* A [[distributed database]] is one in which both the data and the DBMS span multiple computers.\n* A [[document-oriented database]] is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or semi structured, information. Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases.\n* An [[embedded database]] system is a DBMS which is tightly integrated with an application software that requires access to stored data in such a way that the DBMS is hidden from the application's end-users and requires little or no ongoing maintenance.<ref>Graves, Steve.  [http://www.embedded-computing.com/articles/id/?2020 \"COTS Databases For Embedded Systems\"], ''Embedded Computing Design'' magazine, January 2007.  Retrieved on August 13, 2008.</ref>\n*End-user databases consist of data developed by individual end-users. Examples of these are collections of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, multimedia, and other files. Several products exist to support such databases. Some of them are much simpler than full-fledged DBMSs, with more elementary DBMS functionality.\n* A [[federated database system]] comprises several distinct databases, each with its own DBMS. It is handled as a single database by a federated database management system (FDBMS), which transparently integrates multiple autonomous DBMSs, possibly of different types (in which case it would also be a [[heterogeneous database system]]), and provides them with an integrated conceptual view.\n* Sometimes the term ''multi-database'' is used as a synonym to federated database, though it may refer to a less integrated (e.g., without an FDBMS and a managed integrated schema) group of databases that cooperate in a single application. In this case, typically [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]] is used for distribution, which typically includes an atomic commit protocol (ACP), e.g., the [[two-phase commit protocol]], to allow [[Distributed transaction|distributed (global) transactions]] across the participating databases.\n* A [[graph database]] is a kind of NoSQL database that uses [[Graph (data structure)|graph structures]] with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store information. General graph databases that can store any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as [[triplestore]]s and [[network database model|network databases]].\n* An [[array DBMS]] is a kind of NoSQL DBMS that allows modeling, storage, and retrieval of (usually large) multi-dimensional [[Array data structure|arrays]] such as satellite images and climate simulation output.\n* In a [[hypertext]] or [[hypermedia]] database, any word or a piece of text representing an object, e.g., another piece of text, an article, a picture, or a film, can be [[hyperlink]]ed to that object. Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information. For example, they are useful for organizing [[online encyclopedia]]s, where users can conveniently jump around the text.  The [[World Wide Web]] is thus a large distributed hypertext database.\n*A [[knowledge base]] (abbreviated '''KB''', '''kb''' or \u0394<ref>Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence by Iyad Rahwan, Guillermo R. Simari</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = OWL DL Semantics\n| url = http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/ontologies-semantic-web/owl-dl-semantics.html\n| accessdate = 10 December 2010}}</ref>) is a special kind of database for [[knowledge management]], providing the means for the computerized collection, organization, and [[Information retrieval|retrieval]] of [[knowledge]]. Also a collection of data representing problems with their solutions and related experiences.\n\n* A [[mobile database]] can be carried on or synchronized from a mobile computing device.\n* [[Operational database]]s store detailed data about the operations of an organization. They typically process relatively high volumes of updates using [[transaction (database)|transactions]]. Examples include [[Customer relationship management|customer databases]] that record contact, credit, and demographic information about a business's customers, personnel databases that hold information such as salary, benefits, skills data about employees, [[enterprise resource planning]] systems that record details about product components, parts inventory, and financial databases that keep track of the organization's money, accounting and financial dealings.\n* A [[parallel database]] seeks to improve performance through [[Parallel computing|parallelization]] for tasks such as loading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.\n\n::The major parallel DBMS architectures which are induced by the underlying [[Computer hardware|hardware]] architecture are:\n::* '''[[Shared memory architecture]]''', where multiple processors share the main memory space, as well as other data storage.\n::* '''Shared disk architecture''', where each processing unit (typically consisting of multiple processors) has its own main memory, but all units share the other storage.\n::* '''[[Shared nothing architecture]]''', where each processing unit has its own main memory and other storage.\n\n* [[Probabilistic database]]s employ [[fuzzy logic]] to draw inferences from imprecise data.\n* [[Real-time database]]s process transactions fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away.\n* A [[spatial database]] can store the data with multidimensional features. The queries on such data include location-based queries, like \"Where is the closest hotel in my area?\".\n* A [[temporal database]] has built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of SQL. More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time.\n* A [[terminology-oriented database]] builds upon an [[object-oriented database]], often customized for a specific field.\n* An [[unstructured data]] database is intended to store in a manageable and protected way diverse objects that do not fit naturally and conveniently in common databases. It may include email messages, documents, journals, multimedia objects, etc. The name may be misleading since some objects can be highly structured. However, the entire possible object collection does not fit into a predefined structured framework. Most established DBMSs now support unstructured data in various ways, and new dedicated DBMSs are emerging.<!-- Isn't this a document-oriented database?  If not, clearly distinguish. -->\n\n==Database interaction==\n\n===Database management system===\n\nConnolly and Begg define Database Management System (DBMS) as a \"software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database\".{{sfn|Connolly|Begg|2014|p=64}}\n\nThe DBMS acronym is sometime extended to indicated the underlying [[database model]], with RDBMS for [[Relational model|relational]],  OODBMS or ORDBMS for the [[Object model|object (orientated) model]] and ORDBMS for Object-Relational.  Other extensions can indicate some other characteristic, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.\n\nThe functionality provided by a DBMS can vary enormously.  The core functionality is the storage, retrieval and update of data.  [[Edgar F. Codd|Codd]] proposed the following functions and services a fully-fledged general purpose DBMS should provide:{{sfn|Connolly|Begg|2014|p=97\u2014102}}\n* Data storage, retrieval and update\n* User accessible catalog or data dictionary describing the metadata\n* Support for transactions and concurrency\n* Facilities for recovering the database should it become damaged\n* Support for authorization of access and update of data\n* Access support from remote locations\n* Enforcing constraints to ensure data in the database abides by certain rules\n\nIt is also generally to be expected the DBMS will provide a set of utilities for such purposes as may be necessary to administer the database effectively, including import, export, monitoring, defragmentation and analysis utilities.{{sfn|Connolly|Begg|2014|p=102}}  The core part of the DBMS interacting between the database and the application interface sometimes referred to as the [[database engine]].\n\nOften DBMSs will have configuration parameters that can be statically and dynamically tuned, for example the maximum amount of main memory on a server the database can use.  The trend is to minimise the amount of manual configuration, and for cases such as [[embedded database]]s the need to target zero-administration is paramount.\n\nThe large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to increase in size and functionality and can have involved thousands of human years of development effort through their lifetime.{{efn|This article quotes a development time of 5 years involving 750 people for DB2 release 9 alone.{{harv|Chong|Wang|Dang|Snow|2007}}}}\n\nEarly multi-user DBMS typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via [[Computer terminal|terminals]] or terminal emulation software.  The [[client\u2013server architecture]] was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the database on a server allowing the processing to be distributed.  This evolved into a [[multitier architecture]] incorporating [[application server]]s and [[web server]]s with the end user interface via a [[web browser]] with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.{{sfn|Connolly|Begg|2014|pp=106\u2014113}}\n\nA general-purpose DBMS will provide public [[application programming interface]]s (API) and optionally a processor for [[database language]]s such as [[SQL]] to allow applications to be written to interact with the database.  A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and be specifically customised and linked to a single application. For example an [[email]] system performing many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as message insertion, message deletion, attachment handling, blocklist lookup, associating messages an email address and so forth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email.\n\n===Application===\n\nExternal interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the DBMS.{{sfn|Connolly|Begg|2014|p=65}}  This can range from a [[Comparison of database tools|database tool]] that allows users to execute SQL queries textually or graphically, to a web site that happens to use a database to store and search information.\n\n===Application Program Interface===\n\nA [[programmer]] will [[Computer programming|code]] interactions to the database (sometimes referred to as a [[datasource]]) via an [[application program interface]] (API) or via a [[#database language|database language]].  The particular API or language chosen will need to be supported by DBMS, possible indirectly via a [[pre-processor]] or a bridging API.  Some API's aim to be database independent, [[ODBC]] being a commonly known example.  Other common API's include [[JDBC]] and [[ADO.NET]].\n\n===Database languages===\n\nDatabase languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as [[sublanguage]]s:\n\n* [[Data control language]] (DCL) \u2013 controls access to data;\n* [[Data definition language]] (DDL) \u2013 defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping and the relationships among them;\n* [[Data manipulation language]] (DML) \u2013 performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;\n* [[Data query language]] (DQL) \u2013 allows searching for information and computing derived information.\n\nDatabase languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:\n\n* SQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language.  It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from [[Codd's 12 rules|the relational model as described by Codd]] (for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered).  SQL became a standard of the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) in 1986, and of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and is supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs.{{sfn|Chapple|2005}}<ref name=\"IBM-sql\">{{cite web | title = Structured Query Language (SQL) | publisher = International Business Machines | url = http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/index.jsp?topic=com.ibm.db2.udb.admin.doc/doc/c0004100.htm | date = October 27, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-06-10 }}</ref>\n* [[OQL]] is an object model language standard (from the [[Object Data Management Group]]). It has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like [[JDOQL]] and [[EJB QL]].\n* [[XQuery]] is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as [[MarkLogic]] and [[eXist]], by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and DB2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as [[Saxon XSLT|Saxon]].\n* [[SQL/XML]] combines [[XQuery]] with SQL.{{sfn|Wagner|2010}}\n\nA database language may also incorporate features like:\n* DBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management\n* Computations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing\n* Constraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car)\n* Application programming interface version of the query language, for programmer convenience\n\n==Storage==\n{{Main|Computer data storage|Database engine}}\n\nDatabase storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the ''internal'' (physical) ''level'' in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., [[metadata]], \"data about the data\", and internal [[data structure]]s) to reconstruct the ''conceptual level'' and ''external level'' from the internal level when needed.  Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the [[database engine]] a.k.a. \"storage engine\". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems' [[file system]]s as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).\n\nSome DBMSs support specifying which [[character encoding]] was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database.\n\nVarious low-level [[database storage structures]] are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice.  Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance.  Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also [[column-oriented DBMS|column-oriented]] and [[correlation database]]s.\n\n===Materialized views===\n{{Main|Materialized view}}\n\nOften storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storing ''materialized views'', which consist of frequently needed ''external views'' or query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing of them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.\n\n===Replication===\n{{Main|Database replication}}\n\nOccasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to a same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.\n\n==Security==\n{{Contradicts other|date=March 2013|1=Database security}}\n{{Main|Database security}}\n\n[[Database security]] deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).\n\nDatabase access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) is allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.\n\nThis may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and [[Privilege (Computing)|privileges]] to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called \"subschemas\". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.\n\n[[Data security]] in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see [[physical security]]), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see [[data encryption]]).\n\nChange and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic [[database audit]] later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes.  Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this to the database.  Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches.\n\n==Transactions and concurrency==\n{{further|Concurrency control}}\n\n[[Database transactions]] can be used to introduce some level of [[fault tolerance]] and [[data integrity]] after recovery from a [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring [[Lock (database)|lock]], etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction's programmer via special transaction commands).\n\nThe acronym [[ACID]] describes some ideal properties of a database transaction: [[Atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]], [[Consistency (database systems)|consistency]], [[Isolation (database systems)|isolation]], and [[Durability (database systems)|durability]].\n\n==Migration==\n{{see also|Data migration#Database migration}}\n\nA database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to move, migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different [[Total cost of ownership|total costs of ownership]] or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help importing databases from other popular DBMSs.\n\n==Building, maintaining, and tuning==\n{{Main|Database tuning}}\n\nAfter designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate [[general-purpose DBMS]] can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed [[user interface]]s to be used by database administrators to define the needed application's data structures within the DBMS's respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).\n\nWhen the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application's data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.\n\nAfter the database is created, initialised and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned ([[Database tuning|tuning]]) for better performance; application's data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application's functionality, etc.\n\n==Backup and restore==\n{{Main|Backup}}\nSometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When this state is needed, i.e., when it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.\n\n==Static analysis==\nStatic analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *[[Abstract interpretation]] framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques.{{sfn|Halder|Cortesi|2011}} The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational database system has many interesting applications, in particular, for security purposes, such as fine grained access control, watermarking, etc.\n\n==Miscellaneous features==\n\nOther DBMS features might include:\n* [[Database log]]s \u2013 This helps in keeping a history of the executed functions.\n* Graphics component for producing graphs and charts, especially in a data warehouse system.\n* [[Query optimizer]] \u2013 Performs query optimization on every query to choose an efficient ''[[query plan]]'' (a partial order (tree) of operations) to be executed to compute the query result.  May be specific to a particular storage engine.\n* Tools or hooks for database design, application programming, application program maintenance, database performance analysis and monitoring, database configuration monitoring, DBMS hardware configuration (a DBMS and related database may span computers, networks, and storage units) and related database mapping (especially for a distributed DBMS), storage allocation and database layout monitoring, storage migration, etc.\n\nIncreasingly, there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build, test, and deployment framework for database management and source control. Borrowing from other developments in the software industry, some market such offerings as \"[[DevOps]] for database\".<ref>{{cite web\n| title = How Database Administration Fits into DevOps |author= Ben Linders |date= January 28, 2016\n| url = https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/01/database-administration-devops\n| access-date = April 15, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Design and modeling==\n\n{{Main|Database design}}\n[[File:Process of database design v2.png|480px|thumb]]\nThe first task of a database designer is to produce a [[conceptual data model]] that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an entity-relationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the [[Unified Modeling Language]]. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like \"can a customer also be a supplier?\", or \"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\", or \"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes.\n\nProducing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from [[Business process modeling|business processes]], or the analysis of [[workflow]] in the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data.\n\nHaving produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a [[Database schema|schema]] that implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a [[logical data model]] expressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms ''data model'' and ''database model'' are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use ''data model'' for the design of a specific database, and ''database model'' for the modeling notation used to express that design.)\n\nThe most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as [[Database normalization|normalization]]. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary \"fact\" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency.\n\nThe final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called ''physical database design'', and the output is the [[physical data model]]. A key goal during this stage is [[data independence]], meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.\n\nAnother aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining [[access control]] to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself.\n\n===Models===\n{{Main|Database model}}\n[[File:Database models.jpg|thumb|480px|Collage of five types of database models]]\n\nA database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner [[data]] can be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model (or the SQL approximation of relational), which uses a table-based format.\n\nCommon logical data models for databases include:\n*[[Navigational database]]s\n**[[Hierarchical database model]]\n**[[Network model]]\n**[[Graph database]]\n*[[Relational model]]\n*[[Entity\u2013relationship model]]\n**[[Enhanced entity\u2013relationship model]]\n*[[Object database|Object model]]\n*[[Document-oriented database|Document model]]\n*[[Entity\u2013attribute\u2013value model]]\n*[[Star schema]]\n\nAn object-relational database combines the two related structures.\n\n[[Physical data model]]s include:\n*[[Inverted index]]\n*[[Flat file database|Flat file]]\n\nOther models include:\n*[[Associative model of data|Associative model]]\n*[[Multidimensional database|Multidimensional model]]\n*[[Array DBMS|Array model]]\n*[[Multivalue model]]\n\nSpecialized models are optimized for particular types of data:\n*[[XML database]]\n*[[Semantic data model|Semantic model]]\n*[[Content store]]\n*[[Event store]]\n*[[Time series database|Time series model]]\n\n===External, conceptual, and internal views===\n\n[[Image:Traditional View of Data SVG.svg|thumb|320px|Traditional view of data<ref name=\"ITL93\">itl.nist.gov (1993) [http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef1x.doc ''Integration Definition for Information Modeling (IDEFIX)'']. 21 December 1993.</ref>]]\n\nA database management system provides three views of the database data:\n\n*The '''external level''' defines how each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database. A single database can have any number of views at the external level.\n*The '''conceptual level''' unifies the various external views into a compatible global view.{{sfn|Date|2003|pages=31\u201332}} It provides the synthesis of all the external views. It is out of the scope of the various database end-users, and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators.\n*The '''internal level''' (or ''physical level'') is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS. It is concerned with cost, performance, scalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using storage structures such as [[Index (database)|indexes]] to enhance performance. Occasionally it stores data of individual views ([[materialized view]]s), computed from generic data, if performance justification exists for such redundancy. It balances all the external views' performance requirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities.\n\nWhile there is typically only one conceptual (or logical) and physical (or internal) view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company's expenses, but does not need details about employees that are the interest of the [[human resources]] department. Thus different departments need different ''views'' of the company's database.\n\nThe three-level database architecture relates to the concept of ''data independence'' which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.\n\nThe conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.\n\nSeparating the ''external'', ''conceptual'' and ''internal'' levels was a major feature of the relational database model implementations that dominate 21st century databases.{{sfn|Date|2003|pages=31\u201332}}\n\n==Research==\n\nDatabase technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in [[academia]] and in the research and development groups of companies (for example [[IBM Research]]). Research activity includes [[Database theory|theory]] and development of [[prototype]]s.

The simplest example of this is a pair of [[electric charge]]s of equal magnitude but opposite sign, separated by some (usually small) distance. A permanent electric dipole is called an [[electret]].\n*A [[magnetic dipole]] is a closed circulation of [[electric current]]. A simple example of this is a single loop of wire with some constant current through it.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brau | first = Charles A.\n | title=Modern Problems in Classical Electrodynamics\n | publisher=Oxford University Press\n | year=2004\n | isbn=0-19-514665-4\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Griffiths | first = David J. | title=Introduction to Electrodynamics\n | edition = 3rd\n | publisher=Prentice Hall\n |year=1999\n |isbn=0-13-805326-X\n }}</ref>\n\nDipoles can be characterized by their dipole moment, a vector quantity. For the simple electric dipole given above, the [[electric dipole moment]] points from the negative charge towards the positive charge, and has a magnitude equal to the strength of each charge times the separation between the charges. (To be precise: for the definition of the dipole moment, one should always consider the \"dipole limit\", where, for example, the distance of the generating charges should ''converge'' to 0 while simultaneously, the charge strength should ''diverge'' to infinity in such a way that the product remains a positive constant.)\n\nFor the current loop, the [[magnetic dipole moment]] points through the loop (according to the [[right hand grip rule]]), with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the area of the loop.\n\nIn addition to current loops, the [[electron]], among other [[fundamental particle]]s, has a magnetic dipole moment. That is because it generates a [[magnetic field]] that is identical to that generated by a very small current loop. However, the electron's magnetic moment is not due to a current loop, but is instead an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] property of the electron.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1994|isbn=978-0-13-124405-4}}</ref> It is also possible that the electron has an ''electric'' dipole moment although it has not yet been observed (see [[electron electric dipole moment]] for more information).\n[[File:Dipole Contour.svg|thumb|right|250px|Contour plot of the [[Electrostatics#Electrostatic potential|electrostatic potential]] of a horizontally oriented electrical dipole of finite size. Strong colors indicate highest and lowest potential (where the opposing charges of the dipole are located).]]\n\nA permanent magnet, such as a bar magnet, owes its magnetism to the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment of the electron. The two ends of a bar magnet are referred to as poles (not to be confused with [[magnetic monopole|monopoles]]), and may be labeled \"north\" and \"south\". In terms of the Earth's magnetic field, they are respectively \"north-seeking\" and \"south-seeking\" poles: if the magnet were freely suspended in the Earth's magnetic field, the north-seeking pole would point towards the north and the south-seeking pole would point towards the south. The dipole moment of the bar magnet points from its magnetic [[south pole|south]] to its magnetic [[north pole]]. The north pole of a bar magnet in a [[compass]] points north. However, that means that Earth's geomagnetic north pole is the ''south'' pole (south-seeking pole) of its dipole moment and vice versa.\n\nThe only known mechanisms for the creation of magnetic dipoles are by current loops or quantum-mechanical [[spin (physics)|spin]] since the existence of [[magnetic monopole]]s has never been experimentally demonstrated.\n\nThe term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03af\u03c2}} (''dis''), \"twice\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddi%2Fs \u03b4\u03af\u03c2], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} (''polos''), \"axis\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpo%2Flos \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=dipole, n. |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition=second |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1989}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n\n[[File:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|250px|Electric field lines of two opposing charges separated by a finite distance.]]\n[[File:VFPt dipole magnetic2.svg|250px|right|thumb|Magnetic field lines of a ring current of finite diameter.]]\n[[File:VFPt dipole point.svg|thumb|250px|Field lines of a point dipole of any type, electric, magnetic, acoustic, etc.]]\n\nA ''physical dipole'' consists of two equal and opposite point charges: in the literal sense, two poles. Its field at large distances (i.e., distances large in comparison to the separation of the poles) depends almost entirely on the dipole moment as defined above. A ''point (electric) dipole'' is the limit obtained by letting the separation tend to 0 while keeping the dipole moment fixed. The field of a point dipole has a particularly simple form, and the order-1 term in the [[multipole expansion]] is precisely the point dipole field.\n\nAlthough there are no known [[magnetic monopole]]s in nature, there are magnetic dipoles in the form of the quantum-mechanical [[spin (physics)|spin]] associated with particles such as [[electron]]s (although the accurate description of such effects falls outside of classical electromagnetism). A theoretical magnetic ''point dipole'' has a magnetic field of exactly the same form as the electric field of an electric point dipole. A very small current-carrying loop is approximately a magnetic point dipole; the magnetic dipole moment of such a loop is the product of the current flowing in the loop and the (vector) area of the loop.\n\nAny configuration of charges or currents has a 'dipole moment', which describes the dipole whose field is the best approximation, at large distances, to that of the given configuration.  This is simply one term in the multipole expansion when the total charge (\"monopole moment\") is 0\u2014as it ''always'' is for the magnetic case, since there are no magnetic monopoles.  The dipole term is the dominant one at large distances:  Its field falls off in proportion to {{sfrac|1|''r''<sup>3</sup>}}, as compared to {{sfrac|1|''r''<sup>4</sup>}} for the next ([[quadrupole]]) term and higher powers of {{sfrac|1|''r''}} for higher terms, or {{sfrac|1|''r''<sup>2</sup>}} for the monopole term.\n\n==Molecular dipoles==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ammonia]] and redirects from [[Molecular dipole]] -->\n{{See also|chemical polarity}}\n\nMany [[molecule]]s have such dipole moments due to non-uniform distributions of positive and negative charges on the various atoms.  Such is the case with polar compounds like [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF), where [[electron density]] is shared unequally between atoms. Therefore, a molecule's dipole is an [[electric dipole]] with an inherent electric field which should not be confused with a [[magnetic dipole]] which generates a magnetic field.\n\nThe physical chemist [[Peter Debye|Peter J. W. Debye]] was the first scientist to study molecular dipoles extensively, and, as a consequence, dipole moments are measured in units named ''[[debye]]'' in his honor.\n\nFor molecules there are three types of dipoles:\n; Permanent dipoles: These occur when two atoms in a molecule have substantially different [[electronegativity]]: One atom attracts electrons more than another, becoming more negative, while the other atom becomes more positive. A molecule with a permanent dipole moment is called a ''polar'' molecule. See [[Intermolecular force#Dipole-dipole interactions|dipole\u2013dipole attraction]]s.\n; Instantaneous dipoles: These occur due to chance when [[electron]]s happen to be more concentrated in one place than another in a [[molecule]], creating a temporary dipole. See [[London dispersion force|instantaneous dipole]].\n; Induced dipoles: These can occur when one molecule with a permanent dipole repels another molecule's electrons, ''inducing'' a dipole moment in that molecule. A molecule is ''polarized'' when it carries an induced dipole. See [[Intermolecular force#Debye (induced dipole) force|induced-dipole attraction]].\n\nMore generally, an induced dipole of ''any'' polarizable charge distribution ''\u03c1'' (remember that a molecule has a charge distribution) is caused by an electric field external to ''\u03c1''. This field may, for instance, originate from an ion or polar molecule in the vicinity of ''\u03c1'' or may be macroscopic (e.g., a molecule between the plates of a charged [[capacitor]]). The size of the induced dipole moment is equal to the product of the strength of the external field and the dipole [[polarizability]] of ''\u03c1''.\n\nDipole moment values can be obtained from measurement of the [[dielectric constant]]. Some typical gas phase values in [[debye]] units are:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Weast | first = Robert C.\n | title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics\n | edition = 65th\n | publisher=CRC Press\n | year=1984\n | isbn=0-8493-0465-2\n }}</ref>\n\n* [[carbon dioxide]]: 0\n* [[carbon monoxide]]: 0.112&nbsp;D\n* [[ozone]]: 0.53&nbsp;D\n* [[phosgene]]: 1.17&nbsp;D\n* [[water vapor]]: 1.85&nbsp;D\n* [[hydrogen cyanide]]: 2.98&nbsp;D\n* [[cyanamide]]: 4.27&nbsp;D\n* [[potassium bromide]]: 10.41&nbsp;D\n\n[[File:Carbon-dioxide-2D-dimensions.svg|thumb|160 px|The linear molecule CO<sub>2</sub> has a zero dipole as the two bond dipoles cancel.]]\nPotassium bromide (KBr) has one of the highest dipole moments because it is an [[ionic compound]] that exists as a molecule in the gas phase.\n\n[[File:H2O 2D labelled.svg|thumb|160 px|The bent molecule H<sub>2</sub>O has a net dipole. The two bond dipoles do not cancel.]]\nThe overall dipole moment of a molecule may be approximated as a [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]] of [[bond dipole moment]]s. As a vector sum it depends on the relative orientation of the bonds, so that from the dipole moment information can be deduced about the [[molecular geometry]].\n\nFor example, the zero dipole of CO<sub>2</sub> implies that the two C=O bond dipole moments cancel so that the molecule must be linear. For H<sub>2</sub>O the O\u2212H bond moments do not cancel because the molecule is bent. For ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) which is also a bent molecule, the bond dipole moments are not zero even though the O\u2212O bonds are between similar atoms. This agrees with the Lewis structures for the resonance forms of ozone which show a positive charge on the central oxygen atom. <center>[[File:Ozone-resonance-Lewis-2D.png|400px|Resonance Lewis structures of the ozone molecule]]</center>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align=right\n | image1=Cis-1,2-dichloroethene.png\n | width1=150\n | caption1=''Cis'' isomer, dipole moment 1.90&nbsp;D\n | image2=Trans-1,2-dichloroethene.png\n | width2=150\n | caption2=''Trans'' isomer, dipole moment zero\n}}\nAn example in organic chemistry of the role of geometry in determining dipole moment is the [[cis-trans isomerism|''cis'' and ''trans'' isomers]] of [[1,2-dichloroethene]]. In the ''cis'' isomer the two polar C\u2212Cl bonds are on the same side of the C=C double bond and the molecular dipole moment is 1.90&nbsp;D. In the ''trans'' isomer, the dipole moment is zero because the two C\u2212Cl bonds are on opposite sides of the C=C and cancel (and the two bond moments for the much less polar C\u2212H bonds also cancel).\n\nAnother example of the role of molecular geometry is [[boron trifluoride]], which has three polar bonds with a difference in [[electronegativity]] greater than the traditionally cited threshold of 1.7 for [[ionic bonding]]. However, due to the equilateral triangular distribution of the fluoride ions about the boron cation center, the molecule '''as a whole''' does not exhibit any identifiable pole: one cannot construct a plane that divides the molecule into a net negative part and a net positive part.\n\n==Quantum mechanical dipole operator==\nConsider a collection of ''N'' particles with charges ''q<sub>i</sub>'' and position vectors '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub>. For instance, this collection may be a molecule consisting of electrons, all with [[electron charge|charge]] \u2212''e'', and nuclei with charge ''eZ<sub>i</sub>'', where ''Z<sub>i</sub>'' is the [[atomic number]] of the ''i''&thinsp;th nucleus.\nThe dipole observable (physical quantity) has the quantum mechanical '''dipole operator''':{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n:<math>\\mathfrak{p} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\, q_i \\, \\mathbf{r}_i \\, .</math>\nNotice that this definition is valid only for non-charged dipoles, i.e. total charge equal to zero. To a charged dipole we have the next equation:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{p} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\, q_i \\, (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_c) \\, .</math>\nwhere <math> \\mathbf{r}_c</math> is the center of mass of the molecule/group of particles.<ref>http://www.av8n.com/physics/electric-dipole.htm#eq-dipole-ref</ref>\n\n==Atomic dipoles==<!-- This section is linked from [[Intermolecular force]] -->\nA non-degenerate (''S''-state) atom can have only a zero permanent dipole. This fact follows quantum mechanically from the inversion symmetry of atoms. All 3 components of the dipole operator are antisymmetric under [[Inversion in a point|inversion]] with respect to the nucleus,\n:<math> \\mathfrak{I} \\;\\mathfrak{p}\\;  \\mathfrak{I}^{-1} = -\\mathfrak{p}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is the dipole operator  and <math>\\mathfrak{I}</math> is the inversion operator.\n\nThe permanent dipole moment  of an atom in a non-degenerate state (see [[degenerate energy level]]) is given as the expectation (average) value of the dipole operator,\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\mathfrak{p} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle\\, S\\, | \\mathfrak{p} |\\, S \\,\\right\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math> |\\, S\\, \\rangle </math> is an ''S''-state, non-degenerate, wavefunction, which is symmetric or antisymmetric under inversion: <math> \\mathfrak{I}\\, |\\, S\\, \\rangle = \\pm|\\, S\\, \\rangle</math>. Since the product of the wavefunction (in the ket) and its complex conjugate (in the bra) is always symmetric under inversion and its inverse,\n:<math>\n   \\left\\langle \\mathfrak{p} \\right\\rangle =\n   \\left\\langle\\, \\mathfrak{I}^{-1}\\, S\\, | \\mathfrak{p} |\\, \\mathfrak{I}^{-1}\\, S\\, \\right\\rangle =\n   \\left\\langle\\, S\\, | \\mathfrak{I}\\, \\mathfrak{p}\\, \\mathfrak{I}^{-1} |\\, S\\, \\right\\rangle =\n  -\\left\\langle \\mathfrak{p} \\right\\rangle\n</math>\n\nit follows that the expectation value changes sign under inversion.  We used here the fact that <math> \\mathfrak{I}</math>, being a symmetry operator, is [[unitary operator|unitary]]: <math> \\mathfrak{I}^{-1} =  \\mathfrak{I}^{*}\\,</math> and [[Hermitian adjoint#Definition for bounded operators|by definition]] the Hermitian adjoint <math> \\mathfrak{I}^*\\,</math> may be moved from bra to ket and then becomes <math> \\mathfrak{I}^{**} = \\mathfrak{I}\\,</math>. Since the only quantity that is equal to minus itself is the zero, the expectation  value vanishes,\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\mathfrak{p} \\right\\rangle = 0.</math>\n\nIn the case of open-shell atoms with degenerate  energy levels, one could define a dipole moment by the aid of the first-order [[Stark effect]]. This gives a non-vanishing dipole (by definition proportional to a non-vanishing first-order Stark shift) only if some of the wavefunctions belonging to the degenerate energies have opposite [[parity (physics)|parity]]; i.e., have different behavior under inversion. This is a rare occurrence, but happens for the excited H-atom, where 2s and 2p states are \"accidentally\" degenerate (see article [[Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector#Quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom|Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector]] for the origin of this degeneracy) and have opposite parity (2s is even and 2p is odd).\n\n==Field of a static magnetic dipole==\n{{see also|Magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents}}\n\n===Magnitude===\nThe far-field strength, ''B'', of a dipole magnetic field is given by\n\n:<math>B(m, r, \\lambda) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{m}{r^3} \\sqrt{1 + 3\\sin^2(\\lambda)} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere\n:''B'' is the strength of the field, measured in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s\n:''r'' is the distance from the center, measured in metres\n:''\u03bb'' is the magnetic latitude (equal to 90\u00b0&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b8'') where ''\u03b8'' is the magnetic colatitude, measured in [[radian]]s or [[degree (angle)|degree]]s from the dipole axis<ref group=\"note\">Magnetic colatitude is 0 along the dipole's axis and 90\u00b0 in the plane perpendicular to its axis.</ref>\n:''m'' is the dipole moment, measured in [[ampere]]-square metres or [[joule]]s per [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]\n:''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> is the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability of free space]], measured in [[henry (unit)|henries]] per metre.\n\nConversion to cylindrical coordinates is achieved using {{nowrap|''r''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''z''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03c1''<sup>2</sup>}} and\n:<math>\\lambda = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{z^2 + \\rho^2}}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is the perpendicular distance from the ''z''-axis.

The [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|{{linktext|dragan}}}}'' (\"carry; pull\") developed into a series of related words including ''drag'', ''draw'', and ''draught''. By the time Bramah's beer pumps became popular, the use of the term ''draught'' to refer to the acts of serving or drinking beer was well established and transferred easily to beer served via the hand pumps. In time, the word came to be restricted to only such beer. The usual spelling is now \"draught\" in the [[British English|United Kingdom]], [[Irish English|Ireland]], [[Australian English|Australia]], and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Web Search Interest: \"draught beer\".

Artificial [[carbonation]] was introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1936, with [[James Watney|Watney]]\u2019s experimental [[Pasteurization|pasteurised]] beer [[Watney Combe & Reid#Watneys Red Barrel|Red Barrel]]. Though this method of serving beer did not take hold in the U.K. until the late 1950s, it did become the favored method in the rest of Europe, where it is known by such terms as ''en pression''. The carbonation method of serving beer subsequently spread to the rest of the world; by the early 1970s the term \"draught beer\" almost exclusively referred to beer served under pressure as opposed to the traditional cask or barrel beer.\n\nIn Britain, the [[Campaign for Real Ale]] (CAMRA) was founded in 1971 to protect traditional - unpressurised beer and brewing methods. The group devised the term ''[[Cask ale#Real ale|real ale]]'' to differentiate between beer served from the cask and beer served under pressure. The term ''real ale'' has since been expanded to include [[Bottle conditioning|bottle-conditioned]] beer.\n\n== Keg beer ==\n[[File:Keg1.jpg|right|thumb|A typical {{convert|11|impgal|L}} keg with single opening in the centre of the top end]]\nKeg beer is often [[filtration|filtered]] and/or [[pasteurization|pasteurised]], both of which are processes that render the [[yeast]] inactive.\n\nIn brewing parlance, a keg is different from a [[cask]]. A cask has a tap hole near the edge of the top, and a [[spile]] hole on the side used for conditioning the unfiltered and unpasteurised beer. A keg has a single opening in the centre of the top to which a flow pipe is attached. Kegs are artificially pressurised after [[Brewing#Fermenting|fermentation]] with [[carbon dioxide]] or a mixture of carbon dioxide and [[nitrogen]] gas.\n\n''Keg'' has become a term of contempt used by some, particularly in Britain, since the 1960s when pasteurised draught beers started replacing traditional cask beers.\n\nKeg beer was replacing traditional cask ale in all parts of the UK, primarily because it requires less care to handle. Since 1971, CAMRA has conducted a consumer campaign on behalf of those who prefer traditional cask beer. CAMRA has lobbied the [[British Parliament]] to ensure support for [[cask ale]] and [[microbrewery|microbreweries]] have sprung up to serve those consumers who prefer traditional cask beer.\n\nPressurised CO<sub>2</sub> in the keg's headspace maintains carbonation in the beer.  The CO<sub>2</sub> pressure varies depending on the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> already in the beer and the keg storage temperature.  Occasionally the CO<sub>2</sub> gas is blended with nitrogen gas.  CO<sub>2</sub> / nitrogen blends are used to allow a higher operating pressure in complex dispensing systems.\n\nNitrogen is used under high pressure when dispensing dry stouts (such as Guinness) and other creamy beers because it displaces CO<sub>2</sub> to (artificially) form a rich tight [[Head (beer)|head]] and a less carbonated taste. This makes the beer feel smooth on the palate and gives a foamy appearance.  Premixed bottled gas for creamy beers is usually 75% nitrogen and 25% CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.lbbrew.com/beer-on-nitro/|title = Beer On Nitro|last = Burns|date = 6 July 2013|first = David|website = Lake Bluff Brewing Company|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232043/http://www.lbbrew.com/beer-on-nitro/|archivedate = 4 October 2013|df = dmy-all}}</ref>  This premixed gas which only works well with creamy beers is often referred to as Guinness Gas, Beer Gas, or Aligal.  Using \"Beer Gas\" with other [[beer style]]s can cause the last 5% to 10% of the beer in each keg to taste very flat and lifeless.  In the UK, the term ''keg beer'' would imply the beer is pasteurised, in contrast to unpasteurised cask ale. Some of the newer microbreweries may offer a nitro keg stout which is filtered but not pasteurized.\n\n== Storage and serving temperature ==\nCask beer should be stored and served at a cellar temperature of {{Convert|12|C}}. Once a cask is opened, it should be consumed within three days. Keg beer is given additional cooling just prior to being served either by flash coolers or a remote cooler in the cellar. This chills the beer down to temperatures between {{Convert|3|and|8|C|disp=b|F}}.\n\n== Canned and bottled \"draught\" ==\n\nThe words \"draft\" and \"draught\" have been used as marketing terms to describe [[aluminum can|canned]] or [[bottle]]d beers, implying that they taste and appear like beers from a cask or keg. Commercial brewers use this as a marketing tool although it is incorrect to call any beer not drawn from a cask or keg \"draught\". Two examples are [[Miller Genuine Draft]], a  [[pale lager]] which is produced using a cold filtering system, and [[Guinness]] stout in patented \"Draught-flow\" cans and bottles. Guinness is an example of beers that use a nitrogen [[Widget (beer)|widget]] to create a smooth beer with a very dense [[Beer head|head]]. Guinness has recently replaced the widget system from their bottled \"draught\" beer with a coating of cellulose fibres on the inside of the bottle. Statements indicate a new development in bottling technology that enables the mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide to be present in the beer without using a widget, making it according to Guinness \"more drinkable\" from the bottle.\n\nIn some countries such as [[Japan]], the term \"draft\" applied to canned or bottled beer indicates that the beer is not pasteurized (though it may be filtered), giving it a fresher taste but shorter shelf life than conventional packaged beers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Beer}}\n* [[Cask ale]]\n* [[Beer tap]]\n* [[Growler (jug)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.alabev.com/draught.htm Draught Beer Information]: Lots of information regarding draught beer storage and equipment.\n* [http://www.heinekenireland.com/content/live/Downloads/Draught%20Product%20Suppliers%20Cooling%20Specification.pdf Irish Specification]: PDF version of The Irish Draught Beer Specification\n* [http://www.1001-beers.com/index-choix-game-draft-beer.html Serving a draught beer] -

She was [[Syncretism|equated]] with the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Artemis]],<ref name=Lar>''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref> though she had [[Diana Nemorensis|an independent origin in Italy]].\n\nDiana was known as the virgin goddess of childbirth and women. She was one of the three maiden goddesses, along with [[Minerva (mythology)|Minerva]] and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], who swore never to marry. [[Oak]] groves and deer were especially sacred to her. Diana was born with her twin brother, [[Apollo]], on the island of [[Delos]], daughter of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Leto|Latona]]. She made up a triad with two other Roman deities; [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]] the water nymph, her servant and assistant midwife; and [[Virbius]], the woodland god.<ref>''The Clay-footed Superheroes: Mythology Tales for the New Millennium'' {{ISBN|978-0-865-16719-3}} p. 56</ref>\n\nDiana is revered in [[Roman polytheistic reconstructionism|Roman Neopaganism]] and [[Stregheria]].\n\n==Etymology==\nDiana (pronounced with long '\u012b' and '\u0101') is an adjectival form developed from an ancient [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''divios'', corresponding to later 'divus', 'dius', as in [[Dius Fidius]], [[Dea Dia]] and in the neuter form ''dium'' meaning the sky.<ref>G.Dum\u00e9zil ''La religion Romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 3, chap. 1.</ref>\nIt is derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*d(e)y(e)w'', meaning \"bright sky\" or \"daylight\"; the same word is also the root behind the name of the Aryan   [[Vedic]] sky god [[Dyaus]], as well as the Latin words [[deus]] (god), ''dies'' (day, daylight), and \"diurnal\" (daytime).\n\nOn the [[Linear B|Tablets of Pylos]] a theonym \u03b4\u03b9\u03dd\u03b9\u03b1 (''diwia'') is supposed as referring to a deity precursor of Artemis. Modern scholars mostly accept the identification.<ref>H. F. Pairault below cites three. Contrary G. Rousseau.</ref>{{Request quotation|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe ancient Latin writers [[Varro]] and [[Cicero]] considered the etymology of D\u012b\u0101na as allied to that of ''dies'' and connected to the shine of the Moon.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = ... people regard Diana and the moon as one and the same. ... the moon ''(luna)'' is so called from the verb to shine ''(lucere)''. Lucina is identified with it, which is why in our country they invoke Juno Lucina in childbirth, just as the Greeks call on Diana the Light-bearer. Diana also has the name ''Omnivaga'' (\"wandering everywhere\"), not because of her hunting but because she is numbered as one of the seven planets; her name Diana derives from the fact that she turns darkness into daylight ''(dies)''. She is invoked at childbirth because children are born occasionally after seven, or usually after nine, lunar revolutions ... \n |author = [[Quintus Lucilius Balbus]] as recorded by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] and translated by [[:de:Patrick G.

According to [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]]<ref>G. Dumezil ''La religion Romaine archaique'' Paris 1974, part 3, chap.1.</ref> it falls into a particular subset of celestial gods, referred to in histories of religion as ''frame gods''. Such gods, while keeping the original features of celestial divinities, i.e. transcendent heavenly power and abstention from direct rule in worldly matters, did not share the fate of other celestial gods in Indoeuropean religions\u2014that of becoming ''dei otiosi'' or gods without practical purpose,<ref>Mircea Eliade ''Tre' d'histoire des religionsait'' Paris, 1954.</ref> since they did retain a particular sort of influence over the world and mankind.\n\nThe celestial character of Diana is reflected in her connection with inaccessibility, virginity, light, and her preference for dwelling on high mountains and in sacred woods.\nDiana, therefore, reflects the heavenly world (''diuum'' means sky or open air) in its sovereignty, supremacy, impassibility, and indifference towards such secular matters as the fates of mortals and states. At the same time, however, she is seen as active in ensuring the succession of kings and in the preservation of humankind through the protection of childbirth.<ref name=\"Artemis\">{{cite web|title=Artemis|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html|accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref>\n\nThese functions are apparent in the traditional institutions and cults related to the goddess.\n# The institution of the [[rex Nemorensis]], Diana's ''sacerdos'' (priest) in the Arician wood, who held the position until someone else challenged and killed him in a duel, after breaking a branch from a certain tree of the wood. This ever open succession reveals the character and mission of the goddess as a guarantor of kingly status through successive generations.<ref name=\"OvidFasti\">Ovid ''Fasti'' III, 262-271.</ref> Her function as bestower of authority to rule is also attested in the story related by Livy in which a Sabine man who sacrifices a [[:wikt:heifer|heifer]] to Diana wins for his country the seat of the Roman empire.<ref>[[Titus Livius]] ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' 1:31-1:60.</ref>\n# Diana was also worshiped by women who wanted to be pregnant or who, once pregnant, prayed for an easy delivery. This form of worship is attested in archaeological finds of votive statuettes in her sanctuary in the [[nemus Aricinum]] as well as in ancient sources, e.g. Ovid.<ref name=\"OvidFasti\" />\n\nAccording to Dumezil the forerunner of all ''frame gods'' is an Indian epic hero who was the image ([[avatar]]) of the Vedic god Dyaus. Having renounced the world, in his roles of father and king, he attained the status of an immortal being while retaining the duty of ensuring that his dynasty is preserved and that there is always a new king for each generation.\n\nThe Scandinavian god [[Heimdallr]] performs an analogous function: he is born first and will die last. He too gives origin to kingship and the first king, bestowing on him regal prerogatives.\nDiana, although a female deity, has exactly the same functions, preserving mankind through childbirth and royal succession.\n\nF. H. Pairault in her essay on Diana qualifies Dum\u00e9zil's theory as \"''impossible to verify''\".\n\nDumezil's interpretation appears deliberately to ignore that of [[James G. Frazer]], who links Diana with the male god [[Janus]] as a divine couple. This looks odd as Dum\u00e9zil's definition of the concept of ''frame god'' would fit well the figure of Janus.<ref>J. Frazer ''The golden bough'' 1922, chaps. 1, 12, 16.</ref> Frazer identifies the two with the supreme heavenly couple Jupiter-Juno and additionally ties in these figures to the overarching Indoeuropean religious complex. This regality is also linked to the cult of trees, particularly [[Querquetulanae|oaks]].\nIn this interpretative schema, the institution of the Rex Nemorensis and related ritual should be seen as related to the theme of the dying god and the [[King of the May|kings of May]].<ref>J.G. Frazer ''Dying gods'', 1912; Geza Roheim ''Animism, magic and the divine king'' Routledge, London, 1972, part 3, (in particular chapter \"The king of May\").</ref>\n\n==Physical description==\n[[File:Bronze satuette Diana CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman]] bronze statuette of Diana (latter 1st century)]]\nAs a goddess of hunting, Diana often wears a short tunic and hunting boots. She is often portrayed holding a bow, and carrying a quiver on her shoulder, accompanied by a deer or hunting dogs.<ref name=\"Artemis\"/> Like Venus, she was portrayed as beautiful and youthful. The crescent moon, sometimes worn as a [[diadem]], is a major attribute of the goddess.\n\n==Worship==\nDiana was initially just the hunting goddess,<ref name=\"Britanica15\">{{cite web|title=Diana, Roman religion|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Diana-Roman-religion|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref> associated with wild animals and woodlands. She also later became a [[moon goddess]], supplanting [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]].<ref name=Britanica15 /> She also became the goddess of childbirth and ruled over the countryside. Catullus wrote a poem to Diana in which she has more than one alias: Latonia, Lucina, Iuno, [[Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]], Luna.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/35900939/Latin-Oration|title=Latin Oration|work=scribd.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Rome, the cult of Diana should have been almost as old as the city itself as Varro mentions her in the list of deities to whom king [[Titus Tatius]] vowed a shrine. It is noteworthy that the list includes Luna and Diana Lucina as separate entities.\nAnother testimony to the high antiquity of her cult is to be found in the ''lex regia'' of King [[Tullus Hostilius]] that condemns those guilty of incest to the ''sacratio'' to the goddess.\n\n[[File:Scene of sacrifice in honour of Diana.

Being placed on the Aventine, and thus outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', meant that Diana's cult essentially remained a ''foreign'' one, like that of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]; she was never officially ''transferred'' to Rome as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] was after the sack of [[Veii]]. It seems that her cult originated in [[Ariccia|Aricia]],<ref>Her cult at Aricia was first attested in Latin literature by [[Cato the Elder]], in a surviving quote by the late grammarian [[Priscian]]. Supposed Greek origins for the Aricia cult are strictly a literary ''[[topos]]''. (Gordon 1932:178 note, and p. 181).</ref> where her priest, the [[Rex Nemorensis]] remained. There the simple open-air fane was held in common by the Latin tribes,<ref>''commune Latinorum Dianae templum'' in [[Varro]], ''Lingua Latina'' V.43; the cult there was of ''antiqua religione'' in [[Pliny's Natural History]], xliv. 91, 242 and [[Ovid's Fasti]] III 327-331.</ref> which Rome aspired to weld into a league and direct. Diana of the wood was soon thoroughly Hellenized,<ref>The ''[[Potnia Theron]]'' aspect of Hellenic Artemis is represented in [[Capua]] and [[Segni|Signia]], Greek cities of [[Magna Graecia]], in the 5th century BC.</ref> \"a process which culminated with the appearance of Diana beside Apollo in the first ''[[lectisternium]]'' at Rome\".<ref>Gordon 1932:179.</ref> Diana was regarded with great reverence and was a patroness of lower-class citizens, called plebeians, and [[slavery|slaves]]; slaves could receive asylum in her temples. This fact is of difficult interpretation. [[Georg Wissowa]] proposed the explanation that it might be because the first slaves of the Romans must have been Latins of the neighbouring tribes.<ref>as quoted by Dum\u00e9zil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 3, chap. 1.</ref> However, in Ephesus too there was the same custom of the asylum (\u03b1\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd).\n\nAccording to Fran\u00e7oise H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pairault's study,<ref>\"Diana Nemorensis, d\u00e9esse latine, d\u00e9esse hell\u00e9nis\u00e9e\" in ''M\u00e9langes d' arch\u00e9ologie et d'histoire'' '''81''' 1969 p. 425-471.</ref> historical and archaeological evidence point to the fact that both Diana of the Aventine and Diana Nemorensis were the product of the direct or indirect influence of the cult of Artemis spread by the Phoceans among the Greek towns of Campania [[Cumae|Cuma]] and [[Capua]], which in turn passed it over to the Etruscans and the Latins by the 6th and 5th centuries BC.\n\nThe origin of the ritual of the rex Nemorensis should have to be traced to the legend of [[Orestes]] and [[Iphigenia]] more than that of Hippolitos. The formation of the Latin League led by Laevius (or Baebius) Egerius<ref>The historicity of this character is questioned by Dum\u00e9zil as the name ''Egerius'' looks suspect to him.</ref> happened under the influence of an alliance with the tyrant of Cuma Aristodemos<ref>Livy II 14, 5-9; Dionysius Halicarnasseus V 36, 1-4.</ref> and is probably connected to the political events at end of the 6th century narrated by Livy and Dionysius, such as the siege of [[Ariccia|Aricia]] by [[Porsenna]]'s son Arruns. It is remarkable that the composition of this league does not reflect that of the Latin people who took part in the [[Latiar]] or [[Feriae Latinae]] given by Pliny and it has not as its leader the ''rex Nemorensis'' but a ''dictator Latinus''.<ref>Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' III 5 68-70.</ref> It should thence be considered a political formation and not a traditional society founded on links of blood.\n\nIt looks as if the confrontation happened between two groups of Etruscans who fought for supremacy, those from [[Tarquinia]], [[Vulci]] and [[Caere]] (allied with the Greeks of Capua) and those of [[Clusium]]. This is reflected in the legend of the coming of Orestes to Nemi and of the inhumation of his bones in the Roman Forum near the temple of Saturn.<ref>Servius ''ad Aeneidem'' II 116; VI 136; [[Hyginus]] ''Fabulae'' 261.</ref> The cult introduced by Orestes at Nemi is apparently that of the [[Artemis Tauropolos]]. The literary amplification<ref>Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 331-2 ''Scythicae regnum nemorale Dianae''; Lucanus ''Pharsalia'' III 86 \"qua sublime nemus Scythicae qua regna Dianae\". Silius Italicus ''Punica'' IV 367; VIII 362; Valerius Flaccus ''Argonauticae'' II 305.</ref> reveals a confused religious background: different Artemis were conflated under the epithet.<ref>[[Jean Bayet]], \"Les origines de l'Arcadisme romain\" p.135; M. P.

If she is accompanied by a deer, as in the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'' (''illustration, above right'') this is because Diana was the patroness of hunting. The deer may also offer a covert reference to the myth of [[Actaeon|Acteon]] (or Actaeon), who saw her bathing naked. Diana transformed Acteon into a stag and set his own hunting dogs to kill him.\n\n==Sanctuaries==\n{{See also|Diana Nemorensis}}\nDiana was an ancient goddess common to all Latin tribes. Therefore, many sanctuaries were dedicated to her in the lands inhabited by Latins. The first one is supposed to have been near [[Alba Longa]] before the town was destroyed by the Romans.\n\nThe [[Ariccia|Aricia]]n wood sanctuary near the [[lake of Nemi]] was Latin confederal as testified by the dedicatory epigraph quoted by Cato.<ref>Cato ''Origins'' fr. 62: \"Lucum Dianum In nemore Aricino Egerius Baebius (some scholars prefer to read Laevius) Tusculanus dedicavit dictator Latinus. Hi populi communiter: Tusculanus, Aricinus, Laurens, Coranus, Tiburtis, Pometius, Ardeatis, Rutulus.\"</ref>\n\nShe had a shrine in Rome on the Aventine hill, according to tradition dedicated by king [[Servius Tullius]]. Its location is remarkable as the Aventine is situated outside the [[pomerium]], i.e. original territory of the city, in order to comply with the tradition that Diana was a goddess common to all Latins and not exclusively of the Romans.\n\nOther sanctuaries we know about are listed below:\n* Colle di Corne near [[Tusculum]].<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia XVI, 242.</ref> where she is referred to with the archaic Latin name of ''deva Cornisca'' and where existed a [[collegium]] of worshippers.<ref>CIL, 975; CIL XIV,2633.</ref>\n* At \u00c9vora, Portugal.<ref>Hifler, Joyce. \"The Goddess Diana. \" Witches Of The Craft.

Diana was said to have created the world of her own being having in herself the seeds of all creation yet to come. It was said that out of herself she divided the darkness and the light, keeping for herself the darkness of creation and creating her brother Apollo, the light.

In the 16th century, Diana's image figured prominently at the ch\u00e2teaus of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]], & at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Anet|Anet]], in deference to [[Diane de Poitiers]], mistress of [[Henry II of France|Henri of France]]. At [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] she was incorporated into the Olympian iconography with which [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Apollo-like \"Sun King\" liked to surround himself. Diana is also a character in the 1876 [[L\u00e9o Delibes]] ballet ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]''. The plot deals with Sylvia, one of Diana's nymphs and sworn to chastity, and Diana's assault on Sylvia's affections for the shepherd Amyntas.\n\n====In literature====\n* In \"[[The Knight's Tale]]\" in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Emily prays to Diana to be spared from marriage to either Palamon or Arcite.\n* In \"Ode\" by [[John Keats]], he writes 'Browsed by none but Dian's fawns' (line 12)\n* In the sonnet \"To Science\" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], science is said to have \"dragged Diana from her car\".\n* Diana Soren, the main character in [[Carlos Fuentes]]' novel ''Diana o la cazadora soltera'' (''Diana, or The Lone Huntress''), is described as having the same personality as the goddess.\n* In \"Castaway\" by [[Augusta Webster]], women who claim they are virtuous despite never having been tempted are referred to as \"Dianas.\" (Line 128)\n* In Jonathan Swift's poem: \"The Progress of Beauty\", as goddess of the moon, Diana is used in comparison to the 17th/early 18th century everyday woman Swift satirically writes about. Starts: 'When first Diana leaves her bed...'\n* In Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"), Diana leads the Trojan Brutus to Britain, where he and his people settle.\n;In Shakespeare\n* In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' Diana appears to Pericles in a vision, telling him to go to her temple and tell his story to her followers.\n* Diana is referenced in ''[[As You Like It]]'' to describe how Rosalind feels about marriage.\n* Diana is referred to in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' when Orsino compares Viola (in the guise of Cesario) to Diana. \"Diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious\"\n* Speaking of his wife, Desdemona, [[Othello]] the [[Moors|Moor]] says, \"Her name, that was as fresh as Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black as my own face.\"\n* There is a reference to Diana in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' where Hero is said to seem like 'Dian in her orb', in terms of her chastity.\n* In ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', Falstaff styles himself and his highway-robbing friends as \"Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon\" who are governed by their \"noble and chase mistress the moon under whose countenance [they] steal\".\n* In ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' Diana appears as a figure in the play and Helena makes multiple allusions to her, such as, \"Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly...\" and \"...wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian/was both herself and love...\" The Steward also says, \"...; Dian no queen of virgins,/ that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without/ rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.\" It can be assumed that 'Dian' is simply a shortening of 'Diana' since later in the play when Parolles' letter to Diana is read aloud it reads 'Dian'.<ref name=\"Yale University Press\">{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Wilbur L.|title=The Yale Shakespeare: the complete works|year=1993|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=United States of America|isbn=1-56619-104-1|pages=365\u2013399}}</ref>\n* The goddess is also referenced indirectly in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The character Hippolyta states \"And then the moon, like to a silver bow new bent in Heaven\". She refers to Diana, goddess of the moon, who is often depicted with a silver hunting bow. In the same play the character Hermia is told by the Duke Theseus that she must either wed the character Demetrius \"Or on Diana's alter to protest for aye austerity and single life\". He refers to her becoming a nun, with the goddesse Diana having connotations of chastity.\n* In ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' Portia states \"I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will\". (I.ii)\n* In ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Romeo describes Rosaline, saying that \"She hath Dian's wit\".\n[[File:Giampietrino 05.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Diana as the Huntress, by [[Giampietrino]].]]\n\n====In painting and sculpture====\nDiana as a Goddess has been one of the most popular themes in art. Painters like [[Titian]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], [[Nicholas Poussin]] made use of her myth as a major theme. Most depictions of Diana in art featured the stories of Diana and [[Actaeon]], or [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], or depicted her resting after hunting. Some famous work of arts with a Diana theme are :\n* [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]], [[Diana and Callisto]], and [[Death of Actaeon]] by Titian.\n* ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', ''[[Diana Returning from the Hunt]]'', ''Diana Resting After a Bath'', and ''[[Diana Bathing (Boucher)|Diana Getting Out of Bath]]'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]].\n* ''[[Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto|Diana Bathing With Her Nymphs]]'' by [[Rembrandt]].\n* ''Diana and Endymion'' by Poussin.\n* ''Diana and Callisto'', ''Diana and Her Nymph Departing From Hunt'', ''Diana and Her Nymphs Surprised By A Faun'' by Rubens.\n* ''Diana and Endymion'' by [[Johann Michael Rottmayr]].\n* The famous fountain at [[Palace of Caserta]], Italy, created by Paolo Persico, Brunelli, Pietro Solari, depicting Diana being surprised by Acteon.\n* A sculpture by [[Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain]] can be seen at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.\n* ''[[Diana (Saint-Gaudens)|\"Diana of the Tower\"]]'' a copper statue by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] was created as the weather vane for the second [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] in 1893.

They played several shows throughout the 1970s until Richard Elfman left the band to become a filmmaker. As a send-off to the band's original concept, Richard Elfman created the film ''[[Forbidden Zone]]'' based on their stage performances. Danny Elfman composed his first score for the film and played the role of [[Satan]] (the other band members played his minions). By the time the movie was completed, they had taken the name [[Oingo Boingo]] and begun recording and touring as a rock group. From 1976 and on, it was led by Danny Elfman, until 1995 when they suddenly retired. The semi-theatrical music and comedy troupe had transformed into a [[ska]]-influenced new wave band in 1979, and then changed again towards a more guitar-oriented [[Rock music|rock]] sound, in the late 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}.  Oingo Boingo, still led by Danny Elfman, performed as themselves in the 1986 movie ''[[Back to School]]''. Additionally, Danny Elfman and Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek reunited on October 31, 2015 to perform the song \"Dead Man's Party\" &ndash; \"for the first time in 20 years to the day\", as Elfman said to the audience &ndash; during an encore at a Halloween celebration at the [[Hollywood Bowl]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Nick|title=Danny Elfman: 'Dead Man's Party' performed after 20 years|url=http://ew.com/article/2015/11/01/danny-elfman-dead-mans-party/|accessdate=December 26, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Film and television scoring===\nIn 1985, [[Tim Burton]] and [[Paul Reubens]] invited Elfman to write the [[Film score|score]] for their first feature film, ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''. Elfman was apprehensive at first, because of his lack of formal training, but with orchestration assistance from Oingo Boingo guitarist and arranger [[Steve Bartek]], he achieved his goal of emulating the mood of such composers as [[Nino Rota]] and [[Bernard Herrmann]].<ref name=\"multiple\">{{cite web|last1=Silber|first1=Frederic|url=http://www.boingo.org/articles/FanfareArticle.html|title=Danny Elfman: Wunderkind of Filmmusic|publisher=Boingo|work=Fanfare|date=1989|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref> In the booklet for the first volume of ''Music for a Darkened Theatre'', Elfman described the first time he heard his music played by a full [[orchestra]] as one of the most thrilling experiences of his life. Elfman immediately developed a rapport with Burton<ref name=\"multiple\"/> and has gone on to score all but three of Burton's major studio releases: ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', which was under production while Elfman and Burton were having a serious disagreement,<ref name=Danny>Salisbury, Burton, pp.137-144</ref> ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]'' and, most recently, ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]''. Elfman also provided the singing voice for [[Jack Skellington]] in Tim Burton's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and the voices of both Barrel and the \"Clown with the Tear-Away Face\". In 1990, Elfman composed the iconic orchestra piece, \"Ice Dance\", for the Tim Burton film ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''. Years later he provided the voice for Bonejangles the skeleton in ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' and the voices of the Oompa-Loompas in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.\n\nOne of Elfman's notable compositions is [[The Simpsons Theme|''The Simpsons'' theme]], which he wrote in 1989.\n\nIn 2002 Elfman composed the soundtracks for the Sam Raimi [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'']] series, except for the third movie in which only his Spider-Man's theme is present.\n\nIn October 2013, Elfman returned to the stage to sing his vocal parts to a handful of ''Nightmare Before Christmas'' songs as part of a concert titled ''Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ng|first=David|title=Danny Elfman concert of Tim Burton film music adds third performance|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-danny-elfman-tim-burton-third-concert-20130918-story.html|accessdate=October 10, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/events/1392|publisher=BBC Concert Orchestra|accessdate=October 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230043548/http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/events/1392|archivedate=December 30, 2013}}</ref> He composed the film score for ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]'' (2013), and composed additional music for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) together with [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]].\n\nElfman composed the score for all three of the ''[[Fifty Shades (film series)|Fifty Shades]]'' films (2015\u20132018).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Jessica|title=See the star-studded tracklist for Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack|url=http://ew.com/music/2017/01/11/fifty-shades-darker-soundtrack-tracklist/|accessdate=February 19, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nElfman's film scores were featured in the 2017 production ''SCORE: A Film Music Documentary''. Also that year, he took over the place of composer in the [[DCEU]]'s ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.\n\n=== Classical projects ===\nIn 2004 Elfman composed ''[[Serenada Schizophrana]]'' for the [[American Composers Orchestra]]. It was conducted by [[John Mauceri]] on its recording and by Steven Sloane at its premiere at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]] on February 23, 2005. After its premiere, it was recorded in studio and released onto [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] on October 3, 2006. The meeting with Mauceri proved fruitful as the composer was encouraged then to write a new concert piece for Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Elfman composed an \"overture to a non-existent musical\" and called the piece \"The Overeager Overture\".\n\n2017 saw the premiere of his 40-minute Concerto for Violin & Orchestra ('Eleven Eleven') in Prague, with soloist Sandy Cameron (for whom it was written) and conducted by John Mauceri with the [[Czech National Symphony Orchestra]]. It was jointly commissioned by Prague Proms, Stanford Symphony and the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]] and has subsequently been performed in Germany and the US, with further dates planned.  A 4-movement, 21-minute Piano Quartet was premiered by the Berlin Philharmonic Piano Quartet as part of their US tour in 2018. Elfman continues to compose his film scores in addition to these other projects.\n\n=== Other projects ===\nIn November 2010, it was reported that Danny Elfman was writing the music for a planned musical based on the life of [[Harry Houdini]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|title=Aaron Sorkin writing Hugh Jackman's Houdini musical: Composer Danny Elfman has 'high hopes'|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 2, 2010|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/11/02/hugh-jackman-houdini-musical|accessdate=December 4, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105043738/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/11/02/hugh-jackman-houdini-musical|archivedate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> but, {{as of|2012|January|lc=y}}, he was no longer attached to the project.<ref>{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kimberly|title=Hugh Jackman, Aaron Sorkin Teaming for \u2018Houdini\u2019 Musical|work=The Wrap|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=December 26, 2016|url=http://www.thewrap.com/hugh-jackman-aaron-sorkin-teaming-houdini-musical-34065/}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 Elfman composed the music for the [[Cirque du Soleil]] show ''[[Iris (Cirque du Soleil)|Iris]]'', which was performed at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood from July 21, 2011 to January 19, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/past/shows/iris/default.aspx|title=Iris|publisher=Cirque du Soleil|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, Elfman composed a horror score for when [[Donald Trump]] \"loom[ed]\" behind [[Hillary Clinton]] at the second [[United States presidential election debates, 2016]].<ref name=\"Bowe\">{{cite news|last1=Bowe|first1=Miles|title=Danny Elfman composed a horror score for Donald Trump\u2019s awful debate performance|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/10/14/danny-elfman-horror-score-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate/|accessdate=October 14, 2016|publisher=FACT|date=October 14, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Canfield\">{{cite news|last1=Canfield|first1=David|title=Danny Elfman Wrote a Horror Movie Score Specifically For the Footage of Trump Looming Over Hillary|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/10/14/danny_elfman_creepily_scores_a_video_compiling_footage_of_trump_lurking.html|accessdate=October 14, 2016|publisher=Slate|date=October 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Musical influences==\nThe style of Elfman's music has been influenced by modern composers including [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Carl Orff]], [[Harry Partch]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], as well as Romantic composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].<ref name=\"americancomposers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americancomposers.org/elfman_interview.htm|title=So Danny Elfman Walks into Carnegie Hall...|publisher=American Composers|first=Jessica|last=Lustig|date=2005|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> Elfman has said that the first time he noticed film music was when he heard [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score to ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' as an eleven-year-old; afterwards he became a fan of film music.

A [[Surface (topology)|surface]] such as a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] or the surface of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[sphere]] has a [[two-dimensional space|dimension of two]] because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, both a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a [[cube]], a cylinder or a sphere is [[three-dimensional]] because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.\n\nIn [[classical mechanics]], [[space]] and [[time]] are different categories and refer to [[absolute space and time]]. That conception of the world is a [[four-dimensional space]] but not the one that was found necessary to describe [[electromagnetism]]. The four dimensions of [[spacetime]] consist of [[event (relativity)|event]]s that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. [[Minkowski space]] first approximates the universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe [[string theory]], eleven dimensions can describe [[supergravity]] and [[M-theory]], and the state-space of [[quantum mechanics]] is an infinite-dimensional [[function space]].\n\nThe concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. '''{{vanchor|High-dimensional space|N-dimensional space|n dimensional space}}s''' frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be [[parameter space]]s or [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]s such as in [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]; these are abstract [[space (mathematics)|space]]s, independent of the physical [[space]] we live in.\n\n== In mathematics ==\n\nIn mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent [[parameter]]s or [[coordinates]] that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is two, etc.\n\nThe dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a [[curve]], such as a [[circle]] is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension lower than two, unless if it is a line.\n\nThe dimension of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }}is {{math|''n''}}. When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question \"what makes {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }} {{math|''n''}}-dimensional?\" One answer is that to cover a fixed [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] in {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }} by small balls of radius {{math|''\u03b5''}}, one needs on the order of {{math|''\u03b5''<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>}} such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the [[Minkowski dimension]] and its more sophisticated variant, the [[Hausdorff dimension]], but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }} looks locally like {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''-1</sup> }} and this leads to the notion of the [[inductive dimension]]. While these notions agree on {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.\n\nA [[tesseract]] is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term \"dimension\" is as in: \"A tesseract ''has four dimensions''\", mathematicians usually express this as: \"The tesseract ''has dimension 4''\", or: \"The dimension of the tesseract ''is'' 4\".\n\nAlthough the notion of higher dimensions goes back to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of [[Arthur Cayley]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. Riemann's 1854 [[Habilitationsschrift]], Schl\u00e4fli's 1852 ''Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuit\u00e4t'', and Hamilton's discovery of the [[quaternion]]s and [[John T. Graves]]' discovery of the [[octonion]]s in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.\n\nThe rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.\n\n===Vector spaces===\n{{main|Dimension (vector space)}}\nThe dimension of a [[vector space]] is the number of vectors in any [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the [[cardinality]] of a basis) is often referred to as the ''Hamel dimension'' or ''algebraic dimension'' to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.  \n\nFor the non-[[free module|free]] case, this generalizes to the notion of the [[length of a module]].\n\n===Manifolds===\n<!--Linked from [[Ball (mathematics)]]-->\nThe uniquely defined dimension of every [[Connectedness|connected]] topological [[manifold]] can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is [[Local property|locally]] [[homeomorphic]] to Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space, in which the number {{math|''n''}} is the manifold's dimension.\n\nFor connected [[differentiable manifold]]s, the dimension is also the dimension of the [[Tangent space|tangent vector space]] at any point.\n\nIn [[geometric topology]], the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the '''high-dimensional''' cases {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' > 4}}}} are simplified by having extra space in which to \"work\"; and the cases {{math|''n'' &#61; 3}} and {{math|4}} are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], where four different proof methods are applied.\n\n====Complex dimension====\n\nThe dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined.  While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the [[real numbers]], it is sometimes useful in the study of [[complex manifold]]s and [[dimension of an algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] to work over the [[complex numbers]] instead. A complex number (''x'' + ''iy'') has a [[real part]] ''x'' and an [[imaginary part]] ''y'', where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.  \n\nConversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions.  For example, an ordinary two-dimensional [[sphere|spherical surface]], when given a complex metric, becomes a [[Riemann sphere]] of one complex dimension.<ref>Yau, S-T and Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010, Chapter 4.</ref>\n\n===Varieties===\n{{main|Dimension of an algebraic variety}}\nThe dimension of an [[algebraic variety]] may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the [[tangent space]] at any [[Regular point of an algebraic variety]]. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of [[hyperplane]]s that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.\n\nAn [[algebraic set]] being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains <math>V_0\\subsetneq V_1\\subsetneq \\ldots \\subsetneq V_d</math> of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of \"<math>\\subsetneq</math>\").\n\nEach variety can be considered as an [[stack (mathematics)|algebraic stack]], and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if ''V'' is a variety of dimension ''m'' and ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] of dimension ''n'' [[group action|acting on ''V'']], then the [[quotient stack]] [''V''/''G''] has dimension ''m''&minus;''n''.<ref>{{citation|last=Fantechi|first=Barbara|chapter=Stacks for everybody|title=European Congress of Mathematics Volume I|volume=201|pages=349\u2013359|series=Progr.

It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.\n\nFor an [[algebra over a field]], the dimension as [[vector space]] is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.\n\n===Topological spaces===\n\nFor any [[normal topological space]] {{math|''X''}}, the [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] of {{math|''X''}} is defined to be ''n'' if ''n'' is the smallest [[integer]] for which the following holds: any [[open cover]] has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. In this case dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''n''}}. For {{math|''X''}} a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer {{math|''n''}} exists, then the dimension of {{math|''X''}} is said to be infinite, and one writes dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} \u221e}}. Moreover, {{math|''X''}} has dimension \u22121, i.e. dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} \u22121}} if and only if {{math|''X''}} is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all [[Tychonoff space]]s merely by replacing the term \"open\" in the definition by the term \"'''functionally open'''\".\n\nAn [[inductive dimension]] may be defined [[Mathematical induction|inductively]] as follows. Consider a [[Isolated point|discrete set]] of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a ''new direction'', one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional object by dragging an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional object in a ''new'' direction.  The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the ''small inductive dimension'' or the ''large inductive dimension'', and is based on the analogy that {{nowrap|({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional}} balls have {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets.\n\nSimilarly, for the class of [[CW complexes]], the dimension of an object is the largest {{mvar|n}} for which the [[n-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] is nontrivial.  Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] into a collection of [[simplex|higher-dimensional triangles]] joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.{{cite needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Hausdorff dimension===\nThe [[Hausdorff dimension]] is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially [[fractal]]s. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all [[metric space]]s and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values.<ref name=\"Hausdorff dimension\">[http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html Fractal Dimension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027003440/http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html |date=2006-10-27 }}, Boston University Department of Mathematics and Statistics</ref> The [[box-counting dimension|box dimension]] or [[Minkowski dimension]] is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of [[fractal dimension]]s that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title=Fractals and Disordered Systems |year=1991 |publisher=Springer }}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2015}}<ref>{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title= Fractals in Science |year=1994 |publisher=Springer }}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Hilbert spaces===\nEvery [[Hilbert space]] admits an [[orthonormal basis]], and any two such bases for a particular space have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's [[Hamel dimension]] is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.\n\n== In physics ==\n\n===Spatial dimensions===\nClassical physics theories describe three [[physical dimension]]s: from a particular point in [[space]], the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; ''i.e.'', moving in a [[linear combination]] of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See [[Space]] and [[Cartesian coordinate system]].)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:7.5em;\"| {{longitem|Number of<br/>dimensions}}\n!

Time is often referred to as the \"[[Spacetime|fourth dimension]]\" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move [[Arrow of time|in one direction]].\n\nThe equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of [[classical mechanics]] are [[T-symmetry|symmetric with respect to time]], and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as [[C-symmetry|charge]] and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing [[entropy]]).\n\nThe best-known treatment of time as a dimension is [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] (and extended to [[general relativity]]), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional [[manifold]], known as [[spacetime]], and in the special, flat case as [[Minkowski space]].\n\n===Additional dimensions===\n\nIn physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [[fundamental forces]] by introducing [[extra dimensions]]. Most notably, [[superstring theory]] requires [[10 spacetime dimensions]], and originates from a more fundamental [[M-theory|11-dimensional]] theory tentatively called [[M-theory]] which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to confirm the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be \"curled up\" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments{{clarify|date=October 2014}} such as those at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].<ref name=\"arxiv.org\">CMS Collaboration, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 \"Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810063016/https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 |date=2017-08-10 }} (arxiv.org)</ref>\n\nAt the level of [[quantum field theory]], [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory]] unifies [[gravity]] with [[Gauge theory|gauge]] interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces [[electromagnetism]]. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe [[quantum gravity]]. Therefore, these models still require a [[UV completion]], of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]]. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.\n \nIn addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a {{nowrap|(3 + 1)-dimensional}} subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be [[large extra dimensions]]. [[D-brane]]s are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the [[brane]] by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or \"the bulk\". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.\n\nSome aspects of brane physics have been applied to [[Brane cosmology|cosmology]]. For example, brane gas cosmology<ref>Brandenberger, R., Vafa, C., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989NuPhB.316..391B Superstrings in the early universe]</ref><ref>Scott Watson, [http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf Brane Gas Cosmology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027144123/http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf |date=2014-10-27 }} (pdf).</ref> attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.\n\nExtra dimensions are said to be [[Universal extra dimension|universal]] if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.\n\n== Networks and dimension ==\n\nSome complex [[Network science|network]]s are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Song |first=Chaoming|  author2link=Shlomo Havlin  |title=Self-similarity of complex networks |journal=Nature |year=2005 |volume=433  |doi=10.1038/nature03248 |pmid=15674285|arxiv=cond-mat/0503078v1 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..392S |last2=Havlin |first2=Shlomo |last3=Makse |first3=Hern\u00e1n A. |issue=7024|pages=392-395}}</ref>  The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Dimension of spatially embedded networks |journal=Nature Physics |year=2011 |bibcode=2011NatPh...7..481D|doi=10.1038/nphys1932 |last=Daqing |first=Li |last2=Kosmidis |first2=Kosmas |last3=Bunde |first3=Armin |last4=Havlin |first4=Shlomo |author4link=Shlomo Havlin|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=481 }}</ref> The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.\n\n== In literature ==\n{{main|Fourth dimension in literature}}\n\n[[Science fiction]] texts often mention the concept of \"dimension\" when referring to [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel or alternate universe]]s or other imagined [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]]. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.\n\nOne of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as \"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\"\n\nThe idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in [[Miles J. Breuer]]'s ''The Appendix and the Spectacles'' (1928) and [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''The Fifth-Dimension Catapult'' (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s.  Classic stories involving other dimensions include [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[\u2014And He Built a Crooked House]]'' (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s ''Tiger by the Tail'' and ''The Universe Between'' (both 1951). Another reference is [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle In Time]]'' (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for \"tesseracting the universe\" or \"folding\" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions were also a key component of the book ''[[The Boy Who Reversed Himself]]'' by [[William Sleator]].\n\n== In philosophy ==\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1783, wrote: \"That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition ''a priori'' because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain.\"<ref>''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science|Prolegomena]]'', \u00a7 12</ref>\n\n\"Space has Four Dimensions\" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] [[Gustav Fechner]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Dr. Mises\". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface.

In this system, the number [[10 (number)|ten]] may be written by a rotated \"2\" (<span style=\"display:inline-block; {{transform|rotate(180deg)}}\">2</span>) and the number [[11 (number)|eleven]] by a rotated \"3\" (<span style=\"display:inline-block; {{transform|rotate(180deg)}}\">3</span>). This notation was introduced by Sir [[Isaac Pitman]].<ref>Pitman, Isaac (ed.): A triple (twelve gross) Gems of Wisdom.

The number twelve (that is, the number written as \"12\" in the [[decimal|base ten]] numerical system) is instead written as \"10\" in duodecimal (meaning \"1 [[dozen]] and 0 units\", instead of \"1 ten and 0 units\"), whereas the digit string \"12\" means \"1 dozen and 2 units\" (i.e. the same number that in decimal is written as \"14\"). Similarly, in duodecimal \"100\" means \"1 [[gross (unit)|gross]]\", \"1000\" means \"1 [[great gross]]\", and \"0.1\" means \"1 twelfth\" (instead of their decimal meanings \"1 hundred\", \"1 thousand\", and \"1 tenth\").\n\nThe number twelve, a [[superior highly composite number]], is the smallest number with four non-trivial [[integer factorization|factors]] (2, 3, 4, 6), and the smallest to include as factors all four numbers (1 to 4) within the [[subitizing]] range, and the smallest [[abundant number]]. As a result of this increased factorability of the [[radix]] and its divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers (whereas ten has only two non-trivial factors: 2 and 5, and not 3, 4, or 6), duodecimal representations fit more easily than decimal ones into many common patterns, as evidenced by the higher regularity observable in the duodecimal multiplication table. As a result, duodecimal has been described as the optimal number system.<ref name=io9>{{cite web\n |url         = http://io9.com/5977095/why-we-should-switch-to-a-base+12-counting-system\n |title       = Why We Should Switch To A Base-12 Counting System\n |author      = George Dvorsky\n |date        = 2013-01-18\n |accessdate  = 2013-12-21\n |deadurl     = bot: unknown\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130121100313/http://io9.com/5977095/why-we-should-switch-to-a-base+12-counting-system\n |archivedate = 2013-01-21\n |df          = \n}}</ref> Of its factors, 2 and 3 are [[prime number|prime]], which means the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of all [[smooth number|3-smooth]] numbers (such as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, 36, ...) have a [[terminating decimal|terminating]] representation in duodecimal. In particular, the five most elementary fractions ({{frac||1|2}}, {{frac||1|3}}, {{frac||2|3}}, {{frac||1|4}} and {{frac||3|4}}) all have a short terminating representation in duodecimal (0.6, 0.4, 0.8, 0.3 and 0.9, respectively), and twelve is the smallest radix with this feature (because it is the [[least common multiple]] of 3 and 4). This all makes it a more convenient number system for computing fractions than most other number systems in common use, such as the [[decimal]], [[vigesimal]], [[binary numeral system|binary]], [[octal]] and [[hexadecimal]] systems. Although the [[trigesimal]] and [[sexagesimal]] systems (where the reciprocals of all [[regular number|5-smooth]] numbers terminate) do even better in this respect, this is at the cost of unwieldy multiplication tables and a much larger number of symbols to memorize.\n\n== Origin ==\n:''In this section, numerals are based on decimal [[Numerical digit|places]].

There are twelve signs of the [[zodiac]], twelve months in a year, and the [[Babylonians]] had twelve hours in a day (although at some point this was changed to 24.) Traditional [[Chinese calendar]]s, clocks, and compasses are based on the twelve [[Earthly Branches]].

The Romans used a fraction system based on 12, including the [[uncia (length)|uncia]] which became both the English words ''[[ounce]]'' and ''inch''. Pre-[[Decimal Day|decimalisation]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] used a mixed duodecimal-vigesimal currency system (12&nbsp;pence = 1&nbsp;shilling, 20&nbsp;shillings or 240&nbsp;pence to the [[pound sterling]] or [[Irish pound]]), and [[Charlemagne]] established a monetary system that also had a mixed base of twelve and twenty, the remnants of which persist in many places.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n! colspan=\"6\"|<big>Table of units from a base of 12</big>\n|-\n!

Emerson Andrews' 1935 book ''New Numbers: How Acceptance of a Duodecimal Base Would Simplify Mathematics''. Emerson noted that, due to the prevalence of factors of twelve in many traditional units of weight and measure, many of the computational advantages claimed for the metric system could be realized ''either'' by the adoption of ten-based weights and measure ''or'' by the adoption of the duodecimal number system.\n\n[[File:Keys in dozenal clock.svg|thumb|A duodecimal clockface as in the logo of the Dozenal Society of America, here used to denote [[Key (music)|musical keys]]]]\nBoth the Dozenal Society of America and the Dozenal Society of Great Britain promote widespread adoption of the base-twelve system. They use the word \"dozenal\" instead of \"duodecimal\" to avoid the more overtly base-ten terminology. It should be noted that the etymology of 'dozenal' is itself also an expression based on base-ten terminology since 'dozen' is a direct derivation of the French word 'douzaine' which is a derivative of the French word for twelve, ''[[:wikt:douze|douze]]'' which is related to the old French word 'doze' from Latin 'duodecim'. \n\nIt has been suggested by some members of the Dozenal Society of America and Duodecimal Society of Great Britain that a more apt word would be 'uncial'. Uncial is a derivation of the Latin word 'one-twelfth' which is 'uncia' and also the base-twelve analogue of the Latin word 'one-tenth' which is 'decima'. In the same manner as ''decimal'' comes from the Latin word for one-tenth decima, (Latin for ten was decem), the direct analogue for a base-twelve system is ''uncial''. An early use of this word can be found in Vol 1 Issue 2 of ''The Duodecimal Bulletin''<ref>http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/sites_bck/default/files/DuodecimalBulletinIssue012-web_0.pdf</ref> of the DSA dated June 1945 in which a submission on page 9 by a Pvt William S. Crosby titled \"The Uncial Jottings of a Harried Infantryman\", he includes the same argument for the word 'uncial'. Although not accepted by either of these two 'Uncial' societies, the use is beginning to grow.\n\nThe renowned mathematician and mental calculator [[Alexander Aitken|Alexander Craig Aitken]] was an outspoken advocate of the advantages and superiority of duodecimal over decimal:\n{{quote|text=The duodecimal tables are easy to master, easier than the decimal ones; and in elementary teaching they would be so much more interesting, since young children would find more fascinating things to do with twelve rods or blocks than with ten.

He then invents an entire system of weights and measures in base twelve, including a clock with twelve hours in a day, rather than twenty-four hours.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn [[Lee Carroll]]'s ''Kryon: Alchemy of the Human Spirit'', a chapter is dedicated to the advantages of the duodecimal system.

The decimal system has only four factors, which are [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[5 (number)|5]], and [[10 (number)|10]], of which 2 and 5 are prime. [[Vigesimal]] (base 20) adds two factors to those of ten, namely [[4 (number)|4]] and [[20 (number)|20]], but no additional prime factor. Although twenty has 6 factors, 2 of them prime, similarly to twelve, it is also a much larger base, and so the digit set and the multiplication table are much larger. Binary has only two factors, 1 and 2, the latter being prime. [[Hexadecimal]] (base 16) has five factors, adding 4, [[8 (number)|8]] and [[16 (number)|16]] to those of 2, but no additional prime. Trigesimal (base 30) is the smallest system that has three different prime factors (all of the three smallest primes: 2, 3 and 5) and it has eight factors in total (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30). [[Sexagesimal]]\u2014which the ancient [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns among others actually used\u2014adds the four convenient factors 4, 12, 20, and 60 to this but no new prime factors. The smallest system that has four different prime factors is base 210 and the pattern follows the [[primorial]]s. In all base systems, there are similarities to the representation of multiples of numbers which are one less than the base.{{Clear}}<!-- the {{-}} template keeps the multiplication table from squeezing the heading for the next section-->\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\n|+ Duodecimal multiplication table\n!\u00d7!!0!!1!!2!!3!!4!!5!!6!!7!!8!!9!!\u1614!!\u0190\n|-\n!0\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n!1\n|0||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||\u1614||\u0190\n|-\n!2\n|0||2||4||6||8||\u1614||10||12||14||16||18||1\u1614\n|-\n!3\n|0||3||6||9||10||13||16||19||20||23||26||29\n|-\n!4\n|0||4||8||10||14||18||20||24||28||30||34||38\n|-\n!5\n|0||5||\u1614||13||18||21||26||2\u0190||34||39||42||47\n|-\n!6\n|0||6||10||16||20||26||30||36||40||46||50||56\n|-\n!7\n|0||7||12||19||24||2\u0190||36||41||48||53||5\u1614||65\n|-\n!8\n|0||8||14||20||28||34||40||48||54||60||68||74\n|-\n!9\n|0||9||16||23||30||39||46||53||60||69||76||83\n|-\n!\u1614\n|0||\u1614||18||26||34||42||50||5\u1614||68||76||84||92\n|-\n!\u0190\n|0||\u0190||1\u1614||29||38||47||56||65||74||83||92||\u16141\n|}\n\n== Conversion tables to and from decimal ==\nTo convert numbers between bases, one can use the general conversion algorithm (see the relevant section under [[Base conversion|positional notation]]). Alternatively, one can use digit-conversion tables. The ones provided below can be used to convert any duodecimal number between 0.01 and \u0190\u0190\u0190,\u0190\u0190\u0190.\u0190\u0190 to decimal, or any decimal number between 0.01 and 999,999.99 to duodecimal. To use them, the given number must first be decomposed into a sum of numbers with only one significant digit each. For example:\n\n:123,456.78 = 100,000 + 20,000 + 3,000 + 400 + 50 + 6 + 0.7 + 0.08\n\nThis decomposition works the same no matter what base the number is expressed in. Just isolate each non-zero digit, padding them with as many zeros as necessary to preserve their respective place values. If the digits in the given number include zeroes (for example, 102,304.05), these are, of course, left out in the digit decomposition (102,304.05 = 100,000 + 2,000 + 300 + 4 + 0.05). Then the digit conversion tables can be used to obtain the equivalent value in the target base for each digit. If the given number is in duodecimal and the target base is decimal, we get:\n\n:<small>(duodecimal)</small> 100,000 + 20,000 + 3,000 + 400 + 50 + 6 + 0.7 + 0.08 = <small>(decimal)</small> 248,832 + 41,472 + 5,184 + 576 + 60 + 6 + 0.58{{overline|3}}333333333... + 0.0{{overline|5}}5555555555...\n\nNow, because the summands are already converted to base ten, the usual decimal arithmetic is used to perform the addition and recompose the number, arriving at the conversion result:\n\n Duodecimal  ----->  Decimal\n \n   100,000     =    248,832\n    20,000     =     41,472\n     3,000     =      5,184\n       400     =        576\n        50     =         60\n  +      6     =   +      6\n         0.7   =          0.58{{overline|3}}333333333...\n         0.08  =          0.0{{overline|5}}5555555555...\n --------------------------------------------\n   123,456.78  =    296,130.63{{overline|8}}888888888...\n\nThat is, <small>(duodecimal)</small> 123,456.78 equals <small>(decimal)</small> 296,130.63{{overline|8}} \u2248 296,130.64\n\nIf the given number is in decimal and the target base is duodecimal, the method is basically same. Using the digit conversion tables:\n\n<small>(decimal)</small> 100,000 + 20,000 + 3,000 + 400 + 50 + 6 + 0.7 + 0.08 = <small>(duodecimal)</small> 49,\u161454 + \u0190,6\u16148 + 1,8\u16140 + 294 + 42 + 6 + 0.8{{overline|4972}}4972497249724972497... + 0.{{overline|0\u019062\u161468781\u019005915343\u1614}}0\u019062...\n\nHowever, in order to do this sum and recompose the number, now the addition tables for the duodecimal system have to be used, instead of the addition tables for decimal most people are already familiar with, because the summands are now in base twelve and so the arithmetic with them has to be in duodecimal as well. In decimal, 6 + 6 equals 12, but in duodecimal it equals 10; so, if using decimal arithmetic with duodecimal numbers one would arrive at an incorrect result. Doing the arithmetic properly in duodecimal, one gets the result:\n\n   Decimal  ----->  Duodecimal\n \n   100,000     =     49,\u161454\n    20,000     =      \u0190,6\u16148\n     3,000     =      1,8\u16140\n       400     =        294\n        50     =         42\n  +      6     =   +      6\n         0.7   =          0.8{{overline|4972}}4972497249724972497...\n         0.08  =          0.{{overline|0\u019062\u161468781\u019005915343\u1614}}0\u019062...\n --------------------------------------------------------\n   123,456.78  =     5\u0190,540.9{{overline|43\u16140\u019062\u161468781\u0190059153}}43\u1614...\n\nThat is, <small>(decimal)</small> 123,456.78 equals <small>(duodecimal)</small> 5\u0190,540.9{{overline|43\u16140\u019062\u161468781\u0190059153}}... \u2248 5\u0190,540.94\n\n=== Duodecimal to decimal digit conversion ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | ''Duod.''\n!

written with duodecimal)\n\nThis section is about the [[divisibility rule]]s in duodecimal.\n\n;1\nAny integer is divisible by '''1'''.\n\n;2\nIf a number is divisible by '''2''' then the unit digit of that number will be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or \u1614.\n\n;3\nIf a number is divisible by '''3''' then the unit digit of that number will be 0, 3, 6 or 9.\n\n;4\nIf a number is divisible by '''4''' then the unit digit of that number will be 0, 4 or 8.\n\n;5\nTo test for divisibility by 5, double the units digit and subtract the result from the number formed by the rest of the digits. If the result is divisible by '''5''' then the given number is divisible by 5.\n\nThis rule comes from 21(5*5)\n\nExamples: <br>\n'''13'''    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule => |1-2*3| = 5 which is divisible by 5.<br>\n'''2\u0190\u16145''' &nbsp;  rule => |2\u0190\u1614-2*5| = 2\u01900(5*70) which is divisible by 5(or apply the rule on 2\u01900).\n\n'''OR'''\n\nTo test for divisibility by 5, subtract the units digit and triple of the result to the number formed by the rest of the digits. If the result is divisible by '''5''' then the given number is divisible by 5.\n\nThis rule comes from 13(5*3)\n\nExamples: <br>\n'''13'''    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule => |3-3*1| = 0 which is divisible by 5.<br>\n'''2\u0190\u16145''' &nbsp;  rule => |5-3*2\u0190\u1614| = 8\u01901(5*195) which is divisible by 5(or apply the rule on 8\u01901).\n\n'''OR'''\n\nForm the alternating sum of blocks of two from right to left. If the result is divisible by '''5''' then the given number is divisible by 5.\n\nThis rule comes from 101, since 101 = 5*25, thus this rule can be also tested for the divisibility by 25.\n\nExample:<br>\n\n'''97,374,627''' => 27-46+37-97 = -7\u0190 which is divisible by 5.\n\n;6\nIf a number is divisible by '''6''' then the unit digit of that number will be 0 or 6.\n\n;7\nTo test for divisibility by 7, triple the units digit and add the result to the number formed by the rest of the digits. If the result is divisible by '''7''' then the given number is divisible by 7.\n\nThis rule comes from 2\u0190(7*5)\n\nExamples:<br>\n'''12'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule => |3*2+1| = 7 which is divisible by 7.<br>\n'''271\u0190'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule => |3*\u0190+271| = 29\u1614(7*4\u1614) which is divisible by 7(or apply the rule on 29\u1614).<br>\n\n'''OR'''\n\nTo test for divisibility by 7, subtract the units digit and double the result from the number formed by the rest of the digits. If the result is divisible by '''7''' then the given number is divisible by 7.\n\nThis rule comes from 12(7*2)\n\nExamples:<br>\n'''12'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule => |2-2*1| = 0 which is divisible by 7.<br>\n'''271\u0190'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule => |\u0190-2*271| = 513(7*89) which is divisible by 7(or apply the rule on 513).<br>\n\n'''OR'''\n\nTo test for divisibility by 7, 4 times the units digit and subtract the result from the number formed by the rest of the digits. If the result is divisible by '''7''' then the given number is divisible by 7.\n\nThis rule comes from 41(7*7)\n\nExamples:<br>\n'''12'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule => |4*2-1| = 7 which is divisible by 7.<br>\n'''271\u0190'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule => |4*\u0190-271| = 235(7*3\u0190) which is divisible by 7(or apply the rule on 235).<br>\n\n'''OR'''\n\nForm the alternating sum of blocks of three from right to left. If the result is divisible by '''7''' then the given number is divisible by 7.\n\nThis rule comes from 1001, since 1001 = 7*11*17, thus this rule can be also tested for the divisibility by 11 and 17.\n\nExample:<br>\n\n'''386,967,443''' => 443-967+386 = -168 which is divisible by 7.\n\n;8\nIf the 2-digit number formed by the last 2 digits of the given number is divisible by '''8''' then the given number is divisible by 8.\n\nExample: 1\u019048, 4120\n      rule => since 48(8*7) divisible by 8, then 1\u019048 is divisible by 8.\n      rule => since 20(8*3) divisible by 8, then 4120 is divisible by 8.\n\n;9\nIf the 2-digit number formed by the last 2 digits of the given number is divisible by '''9''' then the given number is divisible by 9.\n\nExample: 7423, 8330\n      rule => since 23(9*3) divisible by 9, then 7423 is divisible by 9.\n      rule => since 30(9*4) divisible by 9, then 8330 is divisible by 9.\n\n;\u1614\nIf the number is divisible by 2 and 5 then the number is divisible by '''\u1614'''.\n\n;\u0190\nIf the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by '''\u0190''' then the number is divisible by \u0190 (the equivalent of [[casting out nines]] in decimal).\n\nExample: 29, 61\u019013\n      rule => 2+9 = \u0190 which is divisible by \u0190, then 29 is divisible by \u0190.\n      rule => 6+1+\u0190+1+3 = 1\u1614 which is divisible by \u0190, then 61\u019013 is divisible by \u0190.\n\n;10\nIf a number is divisible by '''10''' then the unit digit of that number will be 0.\n\n;11\nSum the alternate digits and subtract the sums. If the result is divisible by '''11''' the number is divisible by 11 (the equivalent of divisibility by eleven in decimal).\n\nExample: 66, 9427\n      rule => |6-6| = 0 which is divisible by 11, then 66 is divisible by 11.\n      rule => |(9+2)-(4+7)| = |\u1614-\u1614| = 0 which is divisible by 11, then 9427 is divisible by 11.\n\n;12\nIf the number is divisible by 2 and 7 then the number is divisible by '''12'''.\n\n;13\nIf the number is divisible by 3 and 5 then the number is divisible by '''13'''.\n\n;14\nIf the 2-digit number formed by the last 2 digits of the given number is divisible by '''14''' then the given number is divisible by 14.\n\nExample: 1468, 7394\n      rule => since 68(14*5) divisible by 14, then 1468 is divisible by 14.\n      rule => since 94(14*7) divisible by 14, then 7394 is divisible by 14.\n\n==Fractions and irrational numbers==\n\n===Fractions===\nDuodecimal [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] may be simple:\n* {{sfrac|2}} = 0.6\n* {{sfrac|3}} = 0.4\n* {{sfrac|4}} = 0.3\n* {{sfrac|6}} = 0.2\n* {{sfrac|8}} = 0.16\n* {{sfrac|9}} = 0.14\n* {{sfrac|10}} = 0.1  (note that this is a twelfth, {{sfrac|\u1614}} is a tenth)\n* {{sfrac|14}} = 0.09 (note that this is a sixteenth, {{sfrac|12}} is a fourteenth)\n\nor complicated:\n* {{sfrac|5}}  = 0.249724972497... recurring (rounded to 0.24\u1614)\n* {{sfrac|7}}  = 0.186\u161435186\u161435... recurring (rounded to 0.187)\n* {{sfrac|\u1614}}  = 0.1249724972497... recurring (rounded to 0.125)\n* {{sfrac|\u0190}}  = 0.111111111111... recurring (rounded to 0.111)\n* {{sfrac|11}} = 0.0\u01900\u01900\u01900\u01900\u01900\u0190... recurring (rounded to 0.0\u01901)\n* {{sfrac|12}} = 0.0\u161435186\u161435186... recurring (rounded to 0.0\u16143)\n* {{sfrac|13}} = 0.0972497249724... recurring (rounded to 0.097)\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Thus, in base-ten (=&nbsp;2\u00d75) system, fractions whose denominators are made up solely of multiples of 2 and 5 terminate:  {{sfrac|8}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|(2\u00d72\u00d72)}}, {{sfrac|20}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|(2\u00d72\u00d75)}} and {{sfrac|500}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|(2\u00d72\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75)}} can be expressed exactly as 0.125, 0.05 and 0.002 respectively. {{sfrac|3}} and {{sfrac|7}}, however, recur (0.333... and 0.142857142857...). In the duodecimal (=&nbsp;2\u00d72\u00d73) system, {{sfrac|8}} is exact; {{sfrac|20}} and {{sfrac|500}} recur because they include 5 as a factor; {{sfrac|3}} is exact; and {{sfrac|7}} recurs, just as it does in decimal.\n\nThe number of denominators which give terminating fractions within a given number of digits, say ''n'', in a base ''b'' is the number of factors (divisors) of ''b<sup>n</sup>'', the ''n''th power of the base ''b'' (although this includes the divisor 1, which does not produce fractions when used as the denominator). The number of factors of ''b<sup>n</sup>'' is given using its prime factorization.\n\nFor decimal, 10<sup>''n''</sup> = 2<sup>''n''</sup> * 5<sup>''n''</sup>. The number of divisors is found by adding one to each exponent of each prime and multiplying the resulting quantities together.\nFactors of 10<sup>''n''</sup> = (''n''+1)(''n''+1) = (''n''+1)<sup>2</sup>.\n\nFor example, the number 8 is a factor of 10<sup>3</sup> (1000), so 1/8 and other fractions with a denominator of 8 can not require more than 3 fractional decimal digits to terminate. 5/8 = 0.625<sub>ten</sub>\n\nFor duodecimal, 12<sup>''n''</sup> = 2<sup>2''n''</sup> * 3<sup>''n''</sup>. This has (2''n''+1)(''n''+1) divisors. The sample denominator of 8 is a factor of a gross (12<sup>2</sup> = 144), so eighths can not need more than two duodecimal fractional places to terminate. 5/8 = 0.76<sub>twelve</sub>\n\nBecause both ten and twelve have two unique prime factors, the number of divisors of ''b<sup>n</sup>'' for ''b'' = 10 or 12 grows quadratically with the exponent ''n'' (in other words, of the order of ''n''<sup>2</sup>).\n\n=== Recurring digits ===\n[[The Dozenal Society of America]] argues that factors of 3 are more commonly encountered in real-life [[division (mathematics)|division]] problems than factors of 5.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dozenal FAQs |author=Michael Thomas De Vlieger |publisher=The Dozenal Society of America |date=30 November 2011 |url=http://www.dozenal.org/articles/DSA-DozenalFAQs.pdf}}</ref> Thus, in practical applications, the nuisance of [[repeating decimals]] is encountered less often when duodecimal notation is used. Advocates of duodecimal systems argue that this is particularly true of financial calculations, in which the twelve months of the year often enter into calculations.\n\nHowever, when recurring fractions ''do'' occur in duodecimal notation, they are less likely to have a very short period than in decimal notation, because [[12 (number)|12]] (twelve) is between two [[prime number]]s, [[11 (number)|11]] (eleven) and [[13 (number)|13]] (thirteen), whereas ten is adjacent to the [[composite number]] [[9 (number)|9]]. Nonetheless, having a shorter or longer period doesn't help the main inconvenience that one does not get a finite representation for such fractions in the given base (so [[rounding]], which introduces inexactitude, is necessary to handle them in calculations), and overall one is more likely to have to deal with infinite recurring digits when fractions are expressed in decimal than in duodecimal, because one out of every three consecutive numbers contains the prime factor [[3 (number)|3]] in its factorization, whereas only one out of every five contains the prime factor [[5 (number)|5]]. All other prime factors, except 2, are not shared by either ten or twelve, so they do not\ninfluence the relative likeliness of encountering recurring digits (any irreducible fraction that contains any of these other factors in its denominator will recur in either base). Also, the prime factor [[2 (number)|2]] appears twice in the factorization of twelve, whereas only once in the factorization of ten; which means that most fractions whose denominators are [[power of two|powers of two]] will have a shorter, more convenient terminating representation in duodecimal than in decimal representation (e.g. 1/(2<sup>2</sup>) = 0.25 <sub>ten</sub> = 0.3 <sub>twelve</sub>; 1/(2<sup>3</sup>) = 0.125 <sub>ten</sub> = 0.16 <sub>twelve</sub>; 1/(2<sup>4</sup>) = 0.0625 <sub>ten</sub> = 0.09 <sub>twelve</sub>; 1/(2<sup>5</sup>) = 0.03125 <sub>ten</sub> = 0.046 <sub>twelve</sub>; etc.).\n\nValues in '''bold''' indicate that value is exact.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n| colspan=\"3\"| '''Decimal base'''<br><SMALL>Prime factors of the base: <span style=\"color:Green\">'''2'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Green\">'''5'''</span></SMALL><br><SMALL>Prime factors of one below the base: <span style=\"color:Blue\">'''3'''</span></SMALL><br><SMALL>Prime factors of one above the base: <span style=\"color:Orange\">'''11'''</span></SMALL><br><SMALL>All other primes: <span style=\"color:Red\">'''7'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''13'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''17'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''19'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''23'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''29'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''31'''</span></SMALL>\n| colspan=\"3\"| '''Duodecimal base'''<br><SMALL>Prime factors of the base: <span style=\"color:Green\">'''2'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Green\">'''3'''</span></SMALL><br><SMALL>Prime factors of one below the base: <span style=\"color:Blue\">'''\u0190'''</span></SMALL><br><SMALL>Prime factors of one above the base: <span style=\"color:Orange\">'''11'''</span></SMALL><br><SMALL>All other primes: <span style=\"color:Red\">'''5'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''7'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''15'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''17'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''1\u0190'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''25'''</span>, <span style=\"color:Red\">'''27'''</span></SMALL>\n|- \n!

His parents were Robert Agnew and Agnes Noble. Agnew grew up as a Christian. He was surrounded by a family of doctors and had always known he was going to become a physician. As a young boy, he had a sharp sense of humor and was very intelligent. \n\nHe graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] School of Medicine in 1838. He returned to Nobleville to help his father in his clinic. He worked there for two years. His father was an asthmatic and moved to Maryland in 1840 because the climate was more suited to his condition. Agnew moved with him. On November 21, 1841, he married Margaret Irwin. In 1852, he bought and revived the Philadelphia School of Anatomy. He held responsibility for ten years until 1862. During the [[American Civil War]] he was consulting surgeon in the [[Mower Hospital|Mower Army Hospital]], near Philadelphia, and acquired a considerable reputation for his operations in cases of gunshot wounds.On December 21, 1863, he became the Demonstrator of Anatomy and Assistant Lecturer on Clinical Surgery at The University of Pennsylvania. Later, he was requested to assist the Professor of Surgery in the Conduct of the surgical clinics. In the year 1865, he gave summer instruction courses. For the next seven years, he worked for the University as Demonstrator of Anatomy. A large portion of his success was due to his wife's energy, intelligence, and determination. She gave him an impetus to try harder and not be satisfied with his first try.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-uhOHdlAm4C&pg=PA25 |title=History of the Life of D.

Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau. He held the position of chief consulting surgeon. When a committee came to give him his money for helping, Agnew said, \"Gentlemen, I present no bill for my attendance to President Garfield. I gave my services freely and gratuitously\". He was never optimistic about the President's case and was not fooled by fallacious beliefs. This procedure helped create Agnew's reputation.\n\n== ''The Agnew Clinic'' ==\n{{TheAgnewClinic}}\n''[[The Agnew Clinic]]'' is an 1889 painting by [[Thomas Eakins]] which depicts Agnew conducting a mastectomy operation before a gallery of students and doctors.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-uhOHdlAm4C&pg=PA25|title=History of the Life of D.

Diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of the [[Olympic Games]].  In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime.\n\nDiving is one of the most popular [[Diving at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] sports with spectators.  Competitors possess many of the same characteristics as [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] and [[dance]]rs, including strength, flexibility, [[kinaesthetic]] judgment and air awareness. Some professional divers were originally gymnasts or dancers as both the sports have similar characteristics to diving. [[Dmitri Sautin]] holds the record for most Olympic diving medals won, by winning eight medals in total between 1992 and 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=258|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Plunging===\n[[File:The Plunge Sinclair 1893.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Plunging, the first competitive diving sport.]]\nAlthough diving has been a popular pastime across the world since ancient times, the first modern diving competitions were held in [[England]] in the 1880s.

The soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height. This tradition evolved into 'fancy diving', while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as 'Plain diving'.\n\nIn [[England]], the practice of [[high diving]] \u2013 diving from a great height \u2013 gained popularity; the first diving stages were erected at the [[Highgate Ponds]] at a height of 15 feet in 1893 and the first world championship event, the National Graceful Diving Competition, was held there by the [[Royal Life Saving Society UK|Royal Life Saving Society]] in 1895. The event consisted of standing and running dives from either 15 or 30 feet.\n\nIt was at this event that the Swedish tradition of fancy diving was introduced to the sport by the athletes Otto Hagborg and C F Mauritzi. They demonstrated their acrobatic techniques from the 10m diving board at Highgate Pond and stimulated the establishment of the [[Amateur Swimming Association|Amateur Diving Association]] in 1901, the first organization devoted to diving in the world (later amalgamated with the Amateur Swimming Association). Fancy diving was formally introduced into the championship in 1903.<ref name=\"HISTORY of DIVING\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metroatlantadivers.com/history_of_diving|title=HISTORY of DIVING|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swimming.org/britishswimming/diving/a-history-of-diving/|title=A brief history of diving|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\n===Olympic era===\n[[File:Diver2.jpg|thumb|Swedish high diver [[Arvid Sp\u00e5ngberg]] at the [[1908 Olympic Games]] from the fourth Olympiad.]]\nPlain diving was first introduced into the [[Olympics]] at the [[Diving at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 event]].  The [[Diving at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] added 'fancy diving' and introduced elastic boards rather than fixed platforms. Women were first allowed to participate in the diving events for the [[Diving at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].<ref name=\"HISTORY of DIVING\"/>\n\nIn the 1928 Olympics, 'plain' and 'fancy' diving was amalgamated into one event \u2013 'Highboard Diving'. The diving event was first held indoors in the [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool]] for the [[1934 British Empire Games]] and [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]].\n\n==Competitive diving==\nMost diving competitions consist of three disciplines: 1&nbsp;m and 3&nbsp;m springboards, and the platform. Competitive athletes are divided by gender, and often by age group. In platform events, competitors are allowed to perform their dives on either the five, seven and a half (generally just called seven), nine, or ten meter towers.  In major diving meets, including the [[Olympic Games]] and the World Championships, platform diving is from the 10 meter height.\n\n[[File:Diving off a deck into the Great South Bay of Long Island.jpg|thumb|A man dives into the [[Great South Bay]] of [[Long Island]].|left]]\nDivers have to perform a set number of dives according to established requirements, including somersaults and twists. Divers are judged on whether and how well they completed all aspects of the dive, the conformance of their body to the requirements of the dive, and the amount of splash created by their entry to the water.  A possible score out of ten is broken down into three points for the takeoff (meaning the hurdle), three for the flight (the actual dive), and three for the entry (how the diver hits the water), with one more available to give the judges flexibility.\n\nThe raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted. The diver with the highest total score after a sequence of dives is declared the winner.\n\n===Synchronized diving===\n[[File:Salto ornamental - UnB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A man and a woman perform Synchronized diving in Brazil, 2014]] \n\nSynchronized diving was adopted as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form a team and perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be possible to dive opposites, also known as a pinwheel, but this is no longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity \u2013 in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.\n\n===Scoring the dive===\nThere are rules governing the scoring of a dive. Usually a score considers three elements of the dive: the approach, the flight, and the entry.  The primary factors affecting the scoring are:\n\n* if a hand-stand is required, the length of time and quality of the hold\n* the height of the diver at the apex of the dive, with extra height resulting in a higher score\n* the distance of the diver from the diving apparatus throughout the dive (a diver must not be dangerously close, should not be too far away, but should ideally be within {{convert|2|ft|m}} of the platform)\n* the properly defined body position of the diver according to the dive being performed, including pointed toes and feet touching at all times\n* the proper amounts of rotation and revolution upon completion of the dive and entry into the water\n* angle of entry \u2013 a diver should enter the water straight, without any angle.  \n* amount of splash \u2013 many judges award divers for the amount of splash created by the diver on entry, with less splash resulting in a higher score.\n\nEach dive is assigned a ''degree of difficulty'' (DD),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/project/docs/rules/rules_dA2.pdf|title=Appendix 2: FINA table of degree of difficulty|date=15 September 2009|publisher=[[FINA]]|format=PDF|accessdate=4 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913161738/http://www.fina.org/project/docs/rules/rules_dA2.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2015|df=dmy}}</ref> which is determined from a combination of the moves undertaken, position used, and height. The DD value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.\n\nTo reduce the subjectivity of scoring in major meets, panels of five or seven judges are assembled; major international events such as the Olympics use seven-judge panels. For a five-judge panel, the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the DD. For seven-judge panels, as of the [[2012 London Olympics]], the two highest scores and two lowest are discarded, leaving three to be summed and multiplied by the DD. (Prior to the London Olympics, the highest and lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining five scores were multiplied by {{frac|3|5}}, to allow for comparison to five-judge panels.) The canceling of scores is used to make it difficult for a single judge to manipulate scores.\n\nThere is a general misconception about scoring and judging. In serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless. It is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets. Accordingly, good judging implies consistent scoring across the dives. Specifically, if a judge consistently gives low scores for all divers, or consistently gives high scores for the same divers, the judging will yield fair relative results and will cause divers to place in the correct order. However, absolute scores have significance to the individual divers. Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.\n\nIn synchronised diving events, there is a panel of seven, nine, or eleven judges; two or three to mark the execution of one diver, two or three to mark the execution of the other, and the remaining three or five to judge the synchronisation.  The execution judges are positioned two on each side of the pool, and they score the diver which is nearer to them.  The [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] saw the first use of eleven judges.\n\nThe score is computed similarly to the scores from other diving events, but has been modified starting with the 2012 London Olympics for the use of the larger judging panels.  Each group of judges will have the highest and lowest scores dropped, leaving the middle score for each diver's execution and the three middle scores for synchronization.  The total is then weighted by {{frac|3|5}} and multiplied by the DD.  The result is that the emphasis is on the synchronization of the divers.\n\nThe synchronisation scores are based on:\n* time of take-off\n* height attained\n* synchronisation of rotations and twists\n* time of entry to the water\n* forward travel from the board\n\nThe judges may also disqualify the diver for certain violations during the dive, including:\n* receiving a score of 0 on all dives performed in the event\n* improper equipment usage (e.g., female divers not using hair ties)\n\n===Competitive strategy===\n[[File:Greglouganis.jpg|thumb|1984 and 1988 Olympic gold medal diver [[Greg Louganis]]]]\nTo win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet. To win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.\n\nIn competition, divers must submit their lists beforehand, and once past a deadline (usually when the event is announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives. If they fail to perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers just learning how to compete, or if some event outside the diver's control has caused them to be unable to perform-such as a loud noise).\n\nIn the Olympics or other highly competitive meets, many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors.  The importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the DD, but how they arrange their list. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck to talk to their athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures or body movements to communicate.\n\nThere are some American meets which will allow changes of the position of the dive even after the dive has been announced immediately before execution, but these are an exception to the rules generally observed internationally.\n\nGenerally, NCAA rules allow for dives to be changed while the diver is on the board, but the diver must request the change directly after the dive is announced. This applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced. If the diver pauses during his or her hurdle to ask for a change of dive, it will be declared a balk (when the diver stops mid-hurdle) and the change of dive will not be permitted.\n\nUnder FINA law, no dive may be changed after the deadline for the dive-sheet to be submitted (generally a period ranging from one hour to 24 hours, depending on the rulings made by the event organiser).\n\nIt is the diver's responsibility to ensure that the dive-sheet is filled in correctly, and also to correct the referee or announcer before the dive if they describe it incorrectly. If a dive is performed which is as submitted but not as (incorrectly) announced, it is declared failed and scores zero according to a strict reading of the FINA law. But in practice, a re-dive would usually be granted in these circumstances.\n\n==Governance==\nThe global governing body of diving is [[FINA]], which also governs [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[synchronised swimming]], [[water polo]] and [[open water swimming]]. Almost invariably, at national level, diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports.\n\nThis is frequently a source of political friction as the committees are naturally dominated by swimming officials who do not necessarily share or understand the concerns of the diving community. Divers often feel, for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities. Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.\n\nThere are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful. For example, in the UK the [[Great Britain Diving Federation]] was formed in 1992 with the intention of taking over the governance of Diving from the ASA ([[Amateur Swimming Association]]).  Although it initially received widespread support from the diving community, the FINA requirement that international competitors had to be registered with their National Governing Body was a major factor in the abandonment of this ambition a few years later.\n\nSince FINA refused to rescind recognition of the ASA as the British governing body for all aquatic sports including diving, this meant that the elite divers had to belong to ASA-affiliated clubs to be eligible for selection to international competition.\n\nIn the United States scholastic diving is almost always part of the school's swim team.  Diving is a separate sport in Olympic and Club Diving.  The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed.\n\n==Safety==\n[[File:Nodiving.jpg|right|thumb|A sign prohibiting diving at a beach in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]]]\nDespite the apparent risk, the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.divingboardsafety.net/AIR_report.pdf|title=Review of spinal cord injury statistics related to diving and diving board use|publisher=American Institutes for Research|year=2003|accessdate=8 December 2010|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of accidents that are classified as 'diving-related' are incidents caused by individuals jumping from structures such as bridges or piers into water of inadequate depth. Many accidents also occur when divers do not account for rocks and logs in the water.  Because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a [[lifeguard]] is not on duty.\n\nAfter an incident in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential [[swimming pool]] with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a \"suicide dive\" (holding his hands at his sides, so that his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and became a [[tetraplegia|tetraplegic]]. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute over the inappropriate depth of the pool.<ref name=Brown>{{cite news |first=AmyJo|last=Brown|title=No Diving?|url=http://www.poolspanews.com/2004/012/012diving.html|publisher=Pool & Spa News| date=30 January 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040304034008/http://www.poolspanews.com/2004/012/012diving.html|archivedate=4 March 2004 |accessdate=2007-04-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Deep Impact: Back Yard Danger | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/06/02/60II/main6583.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|work=[[60 Minutes II]]|date=2 June 1999|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>\nThe NSPI had specified a minimum depth of 7&nbsp;ft 6 in (2.29 m) which proved to be insufficient in the above case. The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards.  The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner.  But the courts held that the pool \"was close enough\" to the standards to hold NSPI liable.  The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6&nbsp;million ($8&nbsp;million after interest was added) in favor of the plaintiff.<ref>Appeals Court State of WA, Docket Number:18036-1-III\nTitle: Shawn Meneely, et al. v. S. R. Smith, Inc., et al.</ref>  The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganized into a new swimming pool industry association.<ref name=Brown/>\n\nIn competitive diving, FINA takes regulatory steps to ensure that athletes are protected from the inherent dangers of the sport.  For example, they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on.\n\n* Group D (11 & under): 5&nbsp;m\n* Group C (12/13 year): 5&nbsp;m & 7.5&nbsp;m\n* Group B (14/15 year): 5&nbsp;m, 7.5&nbsp;m & 10&nbsp;m\n* Group A (16/18 year): 5&nbsp;m, 7.5&nbsp;m & 10&nbsp;m\n\nGroup D divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower.  In the past, the age group could compete only springboard, to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving.  Group D tower was introduced to counteract the phenomenon of coaches pushing young divers to compete in higher age categories, thus putting them at even greater risk.\n\nHowever, some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms.  Usually this occurs when advanced Group C divers wish to compete on the 10&nbsp;m.\n\nPoints on pool depths in connection with safety:\n\n* most competition pools are 5m deep for 10&nbsp;m platform and 4m deep for 5m platform or 3m springboard.  These are currently the FINA recommended minimum depths.  Some are deeper, e.g. 6m for the diving pit at Sheffield, England.\n* diving from 10&nbsp;m and maintaining a downward streamlined position results in gliding to a stop at about 4.5 \u2013 5m.\n* high standard competition divers rarely go more than about 2.5m below the surface, as they roll in the direction of the dive's rotation. This is a technique to produce a clean entry.\n* attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries.\n* hitting the water flat from 10&nbsp;m brings the diver to rest in about 1&nbsp;ft. The extreme deceleration causes severe bruising both internal and external, strains to connective tissue securing the organs and possible minor hemorrhage to lungs and other tissue. This is very painful and distressing, but not life-threatening.\n\n==Dive groups==\n[[File:Reverse 5391.JPG|thumb|right|A male diver performs a reverse in the tuck position from a 3-meter springboard]]\nThere are six \"groups\" into which dives are classified: ''Forward, Back, Inward, Reverse, Twist,'' and ''Armstand''. The latter applies only to Platform competitions, whereas the other five apply to both Springboard and Platform.\n\n* in the Forward Group (Group 1), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates forward\n* in the Back Group (2), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates backward\n* in the Reverse Group (3), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates backward\n* in the Inward Group (4), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates forward\n* any dive incorporating an axial twisting movement is in the Twist group (5).\n* any dive commencing from a handstand is in the Armstand group (6). (Only on platform)\n{{anchor|Positions}}\n\n===Dive positions===\nDuring the flight of the dive, one of four positions is assumed:\n* straight \u2013 with no bend at the knees or hips (the hardest of the four)\n* pike \u2013 with knees straight but a tight bend at the hips (the median in difficulty of the four.) The open pike is a variant where the arms are reached to the side, and the legs are brought straight out with a bend in the hips.\n* tuck \u2013 body folded up in a tight ball, hands holding the shins and toes pointed (the easiest of the four.)\n* free \u2013 indicates a twisting dive, and a combination of other positions. In the transition between two positions the diver may for example bend their legs or curve at the waist, and points will not be deducted for doing so.\n\nThese positions are referred to by the letters A, B, C and D respectively.\n\nAdditionally, some dives can be started in a flying position. The body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side, and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive.\n\nDifficulty is rated according to the Degree of Difficulty of the dives. Some divers may find pike easier in a flip than tuck, and most find straight the easiest in a front/back dive, although it is still rated the most difficult because of the risk of overrotation.\n\nAn armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilize the equilibrium of the diver.\n\n===Dive numbers===\nIn competition, the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three- or four-digit numbers. The letter to indicate the position is appended to the end of the number.\n\nThe first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above.\n\nFor groups 1 to 4, the number consists of three digits and a letter of the alphabet. The third digit represents the number of half-somersaults. The second digit is either 0 or 1, with 0 representing a normal somersault, and 1 signifying a \"flying\" variation of the basic movement (i.e. the first half somersault is performed in the straight position, and then the pike or tuck shape is assumed).  No flying dive has been competed at a high level competition for many years.\n\nFor example:\n* 101A \u2013 forward Dive Straight\n* 203C \u2013 back one-and-a-half somersaults, tuck\n* 305C \u2013 reverse two-and-a-half somersaults, tuck\n* 113B \u2013 flying forward one-and-a-half somersaults, pike\n\nFor Group 5, the dive number has 4 digits. The first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive. The second digit indicates the group (1\u20134) of the underlying movement; the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth indicates the number of half-twists.\n\nFor example:\n* 5211A \u2013 back dive, half twist, straight position.\n* 5337D \u2013 reverse one and a half somersaults with three and a half twists, in the Free position.\n\nFor Group 6 \u2013 Armstand \u2013 the dive number has either three or four digits: Three digits for dives without twist and four for dives with twists.\n\nIn non-twisting armstand dives, the second digit indicates the direction of rotation (0 = no rotation, 1 = forward, 2 = backward, 3 = reverse, 4 = inward) and the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults. Inward-rotating armstand dives have never been performed, and are generally regarded as physically impossible.\n\nFor example:\n* 600A \u2013 armstand dive straight\n* 612B \u2013 armstand forward somersault pike\n* 624C \u2013 armstand back double somersault tuck\n\nFor twisting Armstand dives, the dive number again has 4 digits, but rather than beginning with the number 5, the number 6 remains as the first digit, indicating that the \"twister\" will be performed from an Armstand. The second digit indicates the direction of rotation \u2013 as above, the third is the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth is the number of half-twists:\n\ne.g. 6243D \u2013 armstand back double-somersault with one and a half twists in the free position\n\nAll of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult/complex a dive is. The score that the dive receives is multiplied by the DD (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score. Before a diver competes they must decide on a \"list\" this is a number of optional dives and compulsory dives. The optionals come with a DD limit. this means that a diver must select X number of dives and the combined DD limit must be no more than the limit set by the competition/organisation etc.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s the tariff was decided by the FINA diving committee, and divers could only select from the range of dives in the published tariff table.  Since then, the tariff is calculated by a formula based on various factors such as the number of twist and somersaults, the height, the group etc., and divers are free to submit new combinations.  This change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport.\n\n==Mechanics of diving==\n[[File:The Tomb of the Diver - Paestum - Italy.JPG|thumb|[[Tomb of the Diver]], [[Paestum]], [[Italy]], a Greek fresco dated 470 BC]]\nAt the moment of take-off, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution.  One is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum.\n\nThe speed of rotation \u2013 and therefore the total amount of rotation \u2013 may be varied from moment to moment by changing the shape of the body, in accordance with the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\nThe center of mass of the diver follows a parabolic path in free-fall under the influence of gravity (ignoring the effects of air resistance, which are negligible at the speeds involved).<ref>''Diving Complete'' George Rackham (1975)</ref>\n\n===Trajectory===\nSince the parabola is symmetrical, the travel away from the board as the diver passes it is twice the amount of the forward travel at the peak of the flight. Excessive forward distance to the entry point is penalized when scoring a dive, but obviously an adequate clearance from the diving board is essential on safety grounds.\n\nThe greatest possible height that can be achieved is desirable for several reasons:\n\n* the height attained is itself one of the factors that the judges will reward.\n* a greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers.\n* for any given clearance when passing the board, the forward travel distance to the entry point will be less for a higher trajectory.\n\n===Control of rotation===\nThe magnitude of [[angular momentum]] remains constant throughout the dive, but since\n\n::angular momentum = [[rotational velocity]] \u00d7 [[moment of inertia]],\n\nand the moment of inertia is larger when the body has an increased radius, the speed of rotation may be increased by moving the body into a compact shape, and reduced by opening out into a straight position.\n\nSince the tucked shape is the most compact, it gives the most control over rotational speed, and dives in this position are easier to perform.  Dives in the straight position are hardest, since there is almost no scope for altering the speed, so the angular momentum must be created at take-off with a very high degree of accuracy. (A small amount of control is available by moving the position of the arms and by a slight hollowing of the back).\n\nThe opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down. The vertical entry achieved by expert divers is largely an illusion created by starting the entry slightly short of vertical, so that the legs are vertical as they disappear beneath the surface.  A small amount of additional tuning is available by 'entry save' techniques, whereby underwater movements of the upper body and arms against the viscosity of the water affect the position of the legs.<ref>''Diving for Gold'' Ron O'Brien (1992)</ref>\n\n===Twisting===\n[[File:N657815313 2283069 8370.jpg|thumb|right|A twisting dive performed from a 10-meter platform.]]\nDives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements, as well as the most challenging to perform.\n\nThe rules state that twisting 'must not be generated manifestly on take-off'.  Consequently, divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements.  The physics of twisting can be explained by looking at the components of the [[angular momentum]] [[Euclidean vector|vector]].\n\nAs the diver leaves the board, the total angular momentum vector is horizontal, pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example.  For twisting rotation to exist, it is necessary to tilt the body sideways after takeoff, so that there is now a small component of this horizontal angular momentum vector along the body's long axis.  The tilt can be seen in the photo.\n\nThe tilting is done by the arms, which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist.  When one arm is moved up and the other is moved down (like turning a big steering wheel), the body reacts by tilting to the side, which then begins the twisting rotation.  At the completion of the required number of twist rotations, the arm motion is reversed (the steering wheel is turned back), which removes the body's tilt and stops the twisting rotation.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that the moving arms have [[precession]] [[torque]] on them which set the body into twisting rotation.  Moving the arms back produces opposite torque which stops the twisting rotation.\n\n===Entry===\nThe rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry.  Strictly speaking, it is physically impossible to achieve a literally vertical position throughout the entry as there will inevitably still be some rotational momentum while the body is entering the water.  Divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements. For back entries, one technique is to allow the upper body to enter slightly short of vertical so that the continuing rotation leaves the final impression of the legs entering vertically. This is called \"Pike save\".  Another is to use \"knee save\" movements of scooping the upper body underwater in the direction of rotation so as to counteract the rotation of the legs.\n\nThe arms must be beside the body for feet-first dives, which are typically competed only on the 1m springboard and only at fairly low levels of 3m springboard, and extended forwards in line for \"head-first\" dives, which are much more common competitively.  It used to be common for the hands to be interlocked with the fingers extended towards the water, but a different technique has become favoured during the last few decades.  Now the usual practice is for one hand to grasp the other with palms down to strike the water with a flat surface.  This creates a vacuum between the hands, arms and head which, with a vertical entry, will pull down and under any splash until deep enough to have minimal effect on the surface of the water (the so-called \"rip entry\").\n\nOnce a diver is completely under the water they may choose to roll or scoop in the same direction their dive was rotating to pull their legs into a more vertical position. Apart from aesthetic considerations, it is important from a safety point of view that divers reinforce the habit of rolling in the direction of rotation, especially for forward and inward entries.  Back injuries [[hyperextention]] are caused by attempting to re-surface in the opposite direction. Diving from the higher levels increases the danger and likelihood of such injuries.\n\n{{Globalize/Eng|date=November 2010}}\n\n==By country==\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:Diving Plongeon Canada.svg|right|100px|thumb|The DPC logo]]In Canada, elite competitive diving is regulated by DPC (Diving Plongeon Canada), although the individual provinces also have organizational bodies. The main competitive season runs from February to July, although some competitions may be held in January or December, and many divers (particularly international level athletes) will train and compete year round.\n\nMost provincial level competitions consist of events for 6 age groups (Groups A, B, C, D, E, and Open) for both genders on each of the three board levels.  These age groups roughly correspond to those standardized by FINA, with the addition of a youngest age group for divers 9 and younger, Group E, which does not compete nationally and does not have a tower event (although divers of this age may choose to compete in Group D).  The age group Open is so called because divers of any age, including those over 18, may compete in these events, so long as their dives meet a minimum standard of difficulty.\n\nAlthough Canada is internationally a fairly strong country in diving, the vast majority of Canadian high schools and universities do not have diving teams, and many Canadian divers accept athletic scholarships from American colleges.\n\nAdult divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving.  Typically, masters are either adults who never practiced the sport as children or teenagers, or former elite athletes who have retired but still seek a way to be involved in the sport.  Many diving clubs have masters teams in addition to their primary competitive ones, and while some masters dive only for fun and fitness, there are also masters competitions, which range from the local to world championship level.\n\n====National championships====\nDivers can qualify to compete at the age group national championships, or junior national championships, in their age groups as assigned by FINA up to the age of 18.  This competition is held annually in July.  Qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions in the season, although athletes who place very highly at a national championship will be automatically qualified to compete at the next.  Divers must qualify at two different competitions, at least one of which must be a level 1 competition, i.e. a competition with fairly strict judging patterns.  Such competitions include the Polar Bear Invitational in Winnipeg, the Sting in Victoria, and the Alberta Provincial Championships in Edmonton or Calgary. The qualifying scores are determined by DPC according to the results of the preceding year's national competition, and typically do not have much variation from year to year.\n\nDivers older than 18, or advanced divers of younger ages, can qualify for the senior national championships, which are held twice each year, once roughly in March and once in June or July.  Once again, qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions (in this case, within the 12 months preceding the national championships, and in an Open age group event), or high placements in previous national championships or international competitions.  It is no longer the case that divers may use results from age group events to qualify for senior nationals, or results from Open events to qualify for age group nationals.\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\nIn the Republic of Ireland facilities are limited to one pool at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin.\n\n====National championships====\nNational championships take place late in the year, usually during November. The competition is held at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin and consists of four events:\n* Irish Open Age Group Championships\n* Irish Open Senior Diving Championships\n* Novice Competition (8\u201316 yrs)\n* Novice Masters Competition (>25 yrs)\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom, diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year.  National Masters' Championships are held two or three times per year.\n\n===United States===\n\n====Summer diving====\nIn the United States, summer diving is usually limited to one meter diving at community or country club pools.  Some pools organize to form intra-pool competitions.  These competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school-age children.  One of the largest and oldest summer leagues in the United States is found in the [[Northern Virginia]] area where teams from 47 pools compete against each other every summer. NVSL-Dive annually holds the Wally Martin 3-Meter Championship and concludes the season with its Individual All Stars Championship. In addition, NVSL-Dive annually hosts the largest one-day dive meet in the world, with over 350 developmental divers in [[Northern Virginia Swim League|NVSL]]'s \"Cracker Jack\" Invitational! Champions from each of these events have gone on to compete at the collegiate and Olympic levels.\n\n====High school diving====\nIn the United States scholastic diving at the high school level is usually limited to one meter diving (but some schools use three meter springboards.). Scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team's overall score. High school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition. Depending on the state and the number of athletes competing in the state, certain qualifications must be achieved to compete in the state's championship meet. There are often regional championships and district championships which are necessary to compete in before reaching the state meet to narrow the field to only the most competitive athletes. Most state championship meets consist of eleven dives. The eleven dives are usually split up between two categories: five required (voluntary) dives and six optional dives.\n\n====Club diving====\nIn the United States, pre-college divers interested in learning one and three meter or platform diving should consider a club sanctioned by either [[USA Diving]] or [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU Diving]].  In USA Diving, Future Champions is the entry level or novice diver category with 8 levels of competition. From Future Champions, divers graduate to \"Junior Olympic\", or JO.  JO divers compete in age groups at inter-club competitions, at invitationals, and if qualified, at regional, zone and national competitions.  Divers over the age of 19 years of age cannot compete in these events as a JO diver.\n\nUSA Diving sanctions the Winter Nationals championship with one, three meter, and platform events.  In the summer USA Diving sanctions the Summer Nationals including all three events with both Junior and Senior divers. USA Diving is sanctioned by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] to select team representatives for international diving competitions including the World Championships and Olympic Games.\n\nAAU Diving sanctions one national event per year in the summer.  AAU competes on the one, three, and tower to determine the All-American team.\n\n====College diving====\n[[File:University of Houston Natatorium.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Houston]]'s CRWC Natatorium is home to the United States' largest collegiate swimming pool]]\nIn the United States scholastic diving at the college level requires one and three meter diving.  Scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team's overall meet score.  College divers interested in tower diving may compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] separate from swim team events.  NCAA Divisions II and III do not usually compete platform; if a diver wishes to compete platform in college, he or she must attend a Division I school.\n\nEach division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition.  Division II schools compete with 10 dives in competition whereas Division III schools compete with 11. Division I schools only compete with 6 dives in competition.  These 6 dives consist of either 5 optionals and 1 voluntary, or 6 optionals.  If the meet is a 5 optional meet, then the divers will perform 1 optional from each category (Front, Back, Inward, Reverse, and Twister) and then 1 voluntary from the category of their choice.  The voluntary in this type of meet is always worth a DD (Degree of Difficulty) of 2.0 even if the real DD is worth more or less on a DD sheet.  In a 6 optional meet, the divers will yet again perform one dive from each category, but this time they will perform a 6th optional from the category of their choosing, which is worth its actual DD from the DD sheet.\n\nThe highest level of collegiate competition is the NCAA Division 1 Swimming and Diving Championship.  Events at the championship include 1 meter springboard, 3 meter springboard, and platform, as well as various swimming individual and relay events.  The points scored by swimmers and divers are combined to determine a team swimming & diving champion.  To qualify for a diving event at the NCAA championships, a competitor must first finish in the top three at one of five zone championships, which are held after the various conference championship meets.  A diver who scores at least 310 points on the 3 meter springboard and 300 points on the 1 meter springboard in a 6 optional meet can participate in the particular zone championship corresponding to the geographic region in which his or her school lies.\n\nA number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills.  These scholarships are usually offered to divers with age-group or club diving experience.\n\nThe NCAA limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions.  The limit is four years, but could be less under certain circumstances.\n\n====Masters' Diving====\nDivers who continue diving past their college years can compete in Masters' Diving programs.  Masters' diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs.\n\nMasters' Diving events are normally conducted in age-groups separated by five or ten years, and attract competitors of a wide range of ages and experience (many, indeed, are newcomers to the sport); the oldest competitor in a Masters' Diving Championship was Viola Krahn, who at the age of 101 was the first person in any sport, male or female, anywhere in the world, to compete in an age-group of 100+ years in a nationally organized competition.\n\n==Famous divers==\n*Australia: [[Matthew Mitcham]], [[Mathew Helm]], [[Chantelle Newbery]], [[Robert Newbery]], [[Dean Pullar]], [[Melissa Wu (diver)|Melissa Wu]], [[Rebecca Gilmore]], [[Loudy Tourky]], [[Brittany Broben]], [[Jenny Donnet]] and [[Maddison Keeney]]\n*Canada: [[Myriam Boileau]], [[Alexandre Despatie]], [[Arturo Miranda]], [[Blythe Hartley]], [[\u00c9milie Heymans]], [[Anne Montminy]], [[Beverly Boys]], [[Irene MacDonald]] and [[Vincent Riendeau (diver)|Vincent Riendeau]]\n*China: [[Qiu Bo]], [[Fu Mingxia]], [[Gao Min (diver)|Gao Min]], [[Guo Jingjing]], [[Hu Jia (diver)|Hu Jia]], [[Lao Lishi]], [[Li Na (diver)|Li Na]], [[Li Ting (diver)|Li Ting]], [[Wu Minxia]], [[Peng Bo]], [[Sang Xue]], [[Tian Liang]], [[Xiao Hailiang]], [[Xiong Ni]], [[He Chong]], [[Chen Ruolin]], [[Huo Liang]], [[Wang Xin (diver)|Wang Xin]], [[Yang Jinghui]], and [[Liang Boxi]]\n*Colombia: [[Orlando Duque]]\n*Germany: [[Jan Hempel]], [[Patrick Hausding]], [[Sascha Klein]]\n*Italy: [[Klaus Dibiasi]], [[Giorgio Cagnotto]], [[Tania Cagnotto]]\n*Malaysia: [[Pandelela Rinong]], [[Ooi Tze Liang]], [[Leong Mun Yee]], [[Nur Dhabitah Sabri]], [[Cheong Jun Hoong]], [[Ahmad Amsyar Azman]]\n*Mexico: [[Joaqu\u00edn Capilla]], [[Carlos Gir\u00f3n]], [[Rommel Pacheco]], [[Fernando Platas]], [[Paola Espinosa]], [[Yahel Castillo]], [[Iv\u00e1n Garc\u00eda (diver)|Iv\u00e1n Garc\u00eda]], [[Germ\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez (diver)|Germ\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez]], [[Alejandra Orozco]], [[Jonathan Paredes (diver)|Jonathan Paredes]], [[Laura S\u00e1nchez (diver)|Laura S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Jahir Ocampo]]\n*New Zealand: [[Liam Stone]], [[Elizabeth Cui]]\n*The Netherlands: [[Edwin Jongejans]]\n*Russia: [[Alexander Dobroskok]], [[Gleb Galperin]], [[Vera Ilina]], [[Igor Lukashin]], [[Ioulia Pakhalina]], [[Dmitri Sautin]] and [[Ilya Zakharov]]\n* Sweden: [[Greta Johansson]], [[Anna Lindberg]], [[Ulrika Knape]]\n* Ukraine: [[Illya Kvasha]], [[Oleksiy Pryhorov]]\n*United Kingdom: [[Chris Snode]], [[Leon Taylor]], [[Peter Waterfield]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Tom Daley (diver)|Tom Daley]], [[Chris Mears (diver)|Chris Mears]], [[Grace Reid]], [[Brian Phelps (diver)|Brian Phelps]], [[Tonia Couch]], [[Sarah Barrow]], [[Jack Laugher]], [[Alicia Blagg]], [[Hannah Starling]], [[Monique Gladding]], [[Rebecca Gallantree]], [[Daniel Goodfellow]]\n*United States: [[Hobie Billingsley]], [[Phil Boggs]], [[David Boudia]], [[Lesley Bush]], [[Jennifer Chandler]], [[Mary Ellen Clark]], [[Scott Donie]], [[Troy Dumais]], [[Michael Galitzen]], [[Barbara Gilders-Dudeck|Barbara Gilders]], [[Fletcher Gilders]], [[Kristian Ipsen]], [[Bruce Kimball]], [[Micki King]], [[Dana Kunze]], [[Beatrice Kyle]], [[Sammy Lee (diver)|Sammy Lee]], [[Mark Lenzi]], [[Greg Louganis]], [[Pat McCormick (diver)|Pat McCormick]], [[Cynthia Potter]], [[Aileen Riggin]], [[Jeanne Stunyo]], [[Laura Wilkinson]], [[Wendy Wyland]]\n\n==Non-competitive diving==\n[[File:cliffjumping.jpg|thumb|right|Man and woman jumping off a cliff at [[Colliding Rivers]], [[Glide, Oregon]].]]\nDiving is also popular as a non-competitive activity. Such diving usually emphasizes the airborne experience, and the height of the dive, but does not emphasize what goes on once the diver enters the water.  The ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill, and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training. Entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity, as is underwater [[Human swimming|swimming]].\n\n[[File:ManDiving.jpg|thumb|left|A man diving into [[Lake Michigan]].]]\n\nSuch non-competitive diving can occur indoors and outdoors.  Outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water.  However, man-made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations.  Outdoor diving requires knowledge of the water depth and currents as conditions can be dangerous.\nOn occasion, the diver will inadvertently belly flop, entering the water horizontally or nearly so. The diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water.\n\n==High diving==\n{{Main article|High diving}}\nA recently developing section of the sport is ''High Diving'' (e.g. see [[2013 World Aquatics Championships]]), conducted in open air locations, usually from improvised platforms up to {{convert|27|m|sp=us}} high (as compared with {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} as used in Olympic and World Championship events). Entry to the water is invariably feet-first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head-first entry from that height. The final half-somersault is almost always performed backwards, enabling the diver to spot the entry point and control their rotation.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Swimming}}\n*[[Acrobatics]]\n*[[Aquatic timing system]]\n*[[Cannonball (diving)]]\n*[[Diving at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[La Quebrada Cliff Divers]]\n*[[List of Olympic medalists in diving]]\n*[[Scuba diving]]\n*[[swimming (sport)|Swimming]]\n*[[Shallow Diving]]\n*[[Digital camera#Waterproof|Waterproof digital camera]]\n*[[List of 10 meter diving platforms in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.FINA.org/ FINA]\n*[http://www.usadiving.org/ USA Diving]\n*[http://diveaau.org/ AAU Diving]\n*[http://www.NCAA.org/ NCAA]\n*[http://www.mastersdiving.org/ USA Masters' Diving].\n*[https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/sports+and+championship/swimming+and+diving/womens NCAA Woman's Swimming and Diving]\n*[http://www.nvsldive.nvblu.com/ Northern Virginia Swimming League \u2013 Diving]\n*[http://www.fina.org/H2O/docs/rules/DV%20RULES%20-%20APPENDIX%202.pdf FINA table of degree of difficulty (PDF)]\n*[http://www.usadiving.org/05redesign/coaches/CoachingTip_7.pdf Hobie Billingsly]\n*[http://www.usadiver.com/diving_articles/diving_bore_hobie_htm.htm Diving mentality]\n\n{{Summer Olympic sports}}\n{{Extreme Sports}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Competitive diving| ]]\n[[Category:Diving (acrobatics)| ]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympic sports]]\n[[Category:Aquatics]]\n[[Category:Acrobatic sports]]\n[[Category:Water sports]]", "sha1": "7o7bkgyzulbxx6zk1v80a962ka7alk2"}}, {"title": "Dative", "ns": "0", "id": "8405", "redirect": {"title": "Dative case"}, "revision": {"id": "308428654", "parentid": "293480462", "timestamp": "2009-08-17T05:43:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dekimasu", "id": "1893265"}, "comment": "redirecting; all links intend this meaning, and only \"dative case\" is referred to as simply \"dative\"", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Dative case]]", "sha1": "1x3bh60kkipnvobnhn2r0lrqcy9snb3"}}, {"title": "Dative case", "ns": "0", "id": "8406", "revision": {"id": "866493047", "parentid": "861274991", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T17:42:16Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2001:16B8:6492:2100:A1A2:4A3:C326:832A"}, "comment": "/* German */  Corrected translation: \"am Tage\" != \"in the afternon\"", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "The '''dative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{smallcaps|'''dat'''}}, or sometimes {{smallcaps|'''d'''}} when it is a [[core argument]]) is a [[grammatical case]] used in some languages to indicate, among other uses, the [[noun]] to which something is given, as in \"Maria <em>Jacobo</em> potum dedit\", Latin for \"Maria gave <em>Jacob</em> a drink\". In these examples, the dative marks what would be considered the [[indirect object]] of a [[verb]] in English.\n\nSometimes the dative has functions unrelated to giving. In [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], the term ''dative case'' is used in traditional grammars to refer to the [[prepositional case]]-marking of nouns following simple [[preposition]]s and the definite article. In [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the dative case also marks the subject of the sentence with some verbs and some tenses. This is called the [[dative construction]].\n\nThe dative was common among early [[Indo-European languages]] and has survived to the present in the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch and the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch, among others. It also exists in similar forms in several non-Indo-European languages, such as the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family of languages. In some languages, the dative case has assimilated the functions of other, now extinct cases. In [[Ancient Greek]], the dative has the functions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[locative case|locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]] as well as those of the original dative.\n\nUnder the influence of English, which uses the preposition \"to\" for (among other uses) both indirect objects (''give to'') and directions of movement (''go to''), the term \"dative\" has sometimes been used to describe cases that in other languages would more appropriately be called [[lative case|lative]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Dative\" comes from [[Latin]] ''c\u0101sus dat\u012bvus'' (\"case for giving\"), a translation of Greek \u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, ''dotik\u0113 pt\u00f4sis'' (\"inflection for giving\"),<ref>{{LSJ|dotiko/s|\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2|ref}}</ref> from its use with the verb ''did\u00f3nai'' \"to give\".<ref>{{LSJ|dido/nai|\u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9|shortref}}</ref> [[Dionysius Thrax]] in his [[Art of Grammar]] also refers to it as ''epistaltik\u0113&#769;'' \"for sending (a letter)\",<ref>Dionysius Thrax.

This conflation of case in Middle and Modern English has led most modern grammarians to discard the \"accusative\" and \"dative\" labels as obsolete in reference to English, often using the term \"objective\" for oblique.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grammar.about.com/od/mo/g/objcaseterm.htm |title=Objective case (grammar) |work=(about) education |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/personal-pronoun#personal-pronoun__5 |title=Personal pronoun |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Set expressions===\nThe dative case is rare in modern English usage, but it can be argued that it survives in a few set expressions. One example is the word \"methinks\", with the meaning \"it seems to me\". It survives in this fixed form from Old English (having undergone, however, phonetic changes with the rest of the language), in which it was constructed as \"[it]\" + \"me\" (the dative case of the personal pronoun) + \"thinks\" (i.e., \"seems\", < Old English \u00feyncan, \"to seem\", a verb closely related to the verb \u00feencan, \"to think\", but distinct from it in Old English; later it merged with \"think\" and lost this meaning).\n\n===Relic pronouns===\nThe modern objective case pronoun [[whom]] is derived from the dative case in Old English, specifically the Old English dative pronoun \"hw\u0101m\" (as opposed to the modern subjective \"who\", which descends from Old English \"hw\u0101\") \u2014 though \"whom\" ''also'' absorbed the functions of the Old English [[accusative case|accusative]] pronoun \"hwone\". It is also cognate to the word \"''wem''\" (the dative form of \"''wer''\") in German. The OED defines all classical uses of the word \"whom\" in situations where the indirect object ''is not known''{{clarify|date=September 2016}} \u2013 in effect, indicating the anonymity of the indirect object.\n\nLikewise, some of the object forms of personal pronouns are remnants of Old English datives. For example, \"him\" goes back to the Old English dative ''him'' (accusative was ''hine''), and \"her\" goes back to the dative ''hire'' (accusative was ''h\u012be''). These pronouns are not datives in modern English; they are also used for functions previously indicated by the accusative.\n\n===Modern English===\nA grammatical \"object\" is an object ''of something'', either an object ''of a preposition'' or an object ''of a verb''. Objects of verbs can be either ''direct'' or ''indirect'', while objects of prepositions are neither direct nor indirect. The indirect object of the verb is expressed between the verb and the direct object of the verb: \"he gave '''me''' a book\" or \"he wrote '''me''' a poem.\"\n\nAn indirect object can often be ''re-worded'' with a [[adpositional phrase|prepositional phrase]] using \"to\" or \"for\", but it is then no longer an indirect object. For example, \"He gave a book '''to me'''\" and \"He wrote a poem '''for me'''\" have the same meaning the examples above, but are now ''adverbial prepositional phrases''. Of course it is not unusual that two ''different grammatical structures'' can describe the ''same situation''; however referring to these ''prepositional objects'' mistakenly as ''indirect objects'' is a common error.\n\n==German==\nIn general, the dative (German: ''Dativ'') is used to mark the [[indirect object]] of a [[German language|German]] sentence.  For example:\n*''Ich schickte '''dem Mann(e)''' das Buch.''  (literally: I sent \"to the man\" the book.) \u2013 Masculine\n*''Ich gab '''der Frau''' den Stift zur\u00fcck.'' (literally: I gave \"to the woman\" the pencil back.) \u2013 Feminine\n*''Ich \u00fcberreiche '''dem Kind(e)''' ein Geschenk.'' (literally: I hand \"to the child\" a present.) \u2013 Neuter\n\nIn English, the first sentence can be rendered as \"I sent the book ''to the man''\" and as \"I sent ''the man'' the book\", where the indirect object is identified in English by standing in front of the direct object. The normal word order in German is to put the dative in front of the accusative (as in the example above). However, since the German dative is marked in form, it can also be put ''after'' the accusative: ''Ich schickte das Buch '''dem Mann(e)'''''. The '''''(e)''''' after ''Mann'' and ''Kind'' signifies a now largely archaic -e ending for certain nouns in the dative. It survives today almost exclusively in set phrases such as ''zu Hause'' (to the house, lit. going home), ''im Zuge'' (in the course of), and ''am Tage'' (on the day, during daytime), as well as in occasional usage in formal prose, poetry, and song lyrics.\n\nSome masculine nouns (and one neuter noun, ''Herz'' [heart]), referred to as ''[[Weak inflection#Germanic grammar|weak nouns]]'' or ''n-nouns'', take an -n or -en in the dative singular and plural. Many are masculine nouns ending in -e in the nominative (such as ''Name'' [name], ''Beamte'' [officer], and ''Junge'' [boy]), although not all such nouns follow this rule. Many also, whether or not they fall into the former category, refer to people, animals, professions, or titles; exceptions to this include the aforementioned ''Herz'' and ''Name'', as well as ''Buchstabe'' (letter), ''Friede'' (peace), ''Obelisk'' (obelisk), ''Planet'' (planet), and others.\n\nCertain German prepositions require the dative:  ''aus'' (from), ''au\u00dfer'' (out of), ''bei'' (at, near), ''entgegen'' (against), ''gegen\u00fcber'' (opposite), ''mit'' (with), ''nach'' (after, to), ''seit'' (since), ''von'' (from), and ''zu'' (at, in, to). Some other prepositions (''an'' [at], ''auf'' [on], ''entlang'' [along], ''hinter'' [behind], ''in'' [in, into], ''neben'' (beside, next to), ''\u00fcber'' [over, across], ''unter'' [under, below], ''vor'' [in front of], and ''zwischen'' [among, between]) may be used with dative (indicating current location), or accusative (indicating direction toward something).  ''Das Buch liegt auf '''dem''' Tisch(e)'' (dative: The book is lying on the table), but ''Ich lege das Buch auf '''den''' Tisch'' (accusative: I put the book onto the table).\n\nIn addition the four prepositions ''[an]statt'' (in place of), ''trotz'' (in spite of), ''w\u00e4hrend'' (during), and ''wegen'' (because of) which require the [[genitive]] in modern formal language, are most commonly used with the dative in colloquial German. For example, \"because of the weather\" is expressed as ''wegen dem Wetter'' instead of the formally correct ''wegen des Wetters''. Other prepositions requiring the genitive in formal language, are combined with ''von'' (\"of\") in colloquial style, e.g. ''au\u00dferhalb vom Garten'' instead of ''au\u00dferhalb des Gartens'' (\"outside the garden\").\n\nNote that the concept of an indirect object may be rendered by a prepositional phrase. In this case, the noun's or pronoun's case is determined by the preposition, NOT by its function in the sentence. Consider this sentence:\n*''Ich sandte das Buch zum Verleger.'' 'I sent the book to the editor.'\nHere, the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], ''Ich'', is in the [[nominative case]], the direct object, ''das Buch'', is in the [[accusative case]], and ''zum Verleger'' is in the dative case, since ''zu'' always requires the dative (''zum'' is a contraction of ''zu'' + ''dem'').  However:\n*''Ich habe das Buch an meinen Freund (''accusative'') weitergegeben.''  'I forwarded the book to my friend.' (''weitergeben'' = lit.: to give further).\nIn this sentence, ''Freund'' is the indirect object, but, because it follows ''an'' (direction), the accusative is required, not the dative.\n\nAll of the articles change in the dative case.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n! Plural\n|-\n| Definite article\n| dem\n| der\n| dem\n| den\n|-\n| Indefinite article\n| einem\n| einer\n| einem\n| \u00d8\n|-\n| Negative articles\n| keinem\n| keiner\n| keinem\n| keinen\n|}\n\nSome German verbs require the dative for their [[direct object]]s. Common examples are ''antworten'' (to answer), ''danken'' (to thank), ''gefallen'' (to please), ''folgen'' (to follow), ''glauben'' (to believe), ''helfen'' (to help), and ''raten'' (to advise). In each case, the direct object of the verb is rendered in the dative. For example:\n*Meine Freunde helfen ''mir''. (My friends help me.)\n\nThese verbs cannot be used in normal passive constructions, because German allows these only for verbs with accusative objects. It is therefore ungrammatical to say: *''Ich werde geholfen.'' \"I am helped.\" Instead a special construction called \"impersonal passive\" must be used: ''Mir wird geholfen'', literally: \"To me is helped.\" A colloquial (non-standard) and rarely used way to form the passive voice for dative verbs is the following: ''Ich kriege geholfen'', or: ''Ich bekomme geholfen'', literally: \"I '''get''' helped\". The use of the verb \"to get\" here reminds us that the dative case has something to do with giving and receiving. In German, help is not something you ''perform on'' somebody, but rather something you ''offer'' them.\n\nThe dative case is also used with reflexive (''sich'') verbs when specifying what part of the self the verb is being done to:\n*Ich wasche ''mich''. - accusative (I wash myself.)\n*Ich wasche ''mir die H\u00e4nde''. - dative (I wash my hands, literally \"I wash for myself the hands\")\nCf. the respective ''accord'' in [[French language|French]]: \"Les enfants se sont lav\u00e9'''''s'''''\" (''the children have washed themselves'') vs. \"Les enfants se sont lav\u00e9\" [uninflected] \"les mains\" (''... their hands'').\n\nGerman can use two datives to make sentences like: ''Sei mir meinem Sohn(e) gn\u00e4dig!'' \"For my sake, have mercy on my son!\" Literally: \"Be for me to my son merciful.\" The first dative ''mir'' (\"for me\") expresses the speaker's commiseration (much like the ''dativus ethicus'' in Latin, see below). The second dative ''meinem Sohn(e)'' (\"to my son\") names the actual object of the plea. Mercy is to be given ''to'' the son ''for'' or ''on behalf of'' his mother/father.\n\nAdjective endings also [[German adjectives#Weak and strong inflection|change]] in the dative case. There are three inflection possibilities depending on what precedes the adjective. They most commonly use ''weak inflection'' when preceded by a definite article (the), ''mixed inflection'' after an indefinite article (a/an), and ''strong inflection'' when a quantity is indicated (many green apples).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Otherwise, most of the functions of the dative have been subsumed in the [[Accusative case|accusative]].\n\n==Slavic languages==\nIn [[Russian language|Russian]], the dative case is used for indicating the indirect object of an action (that to which something is given, thrown, read, etc.). In the instance where a person is the goal of motion, dative is used instead of [[accusative case|accusative]] to indicate motion toward. This is usually achieved with the preposition ''\u03ba'' + destination in dative case; ''\u041a \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0443'', meaning \"to the doctor.\"\n\nDative is also the necessary case taken by certain [[prepositions]] when expressing certain ideas.  For instance, when the preposition ''\u043f\u043e'' is used to mean \"along,\" its object is always in dative case, as in ''\u041f\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043c'', meaning \"along the sides.\"\n\nOther Slavic languages apply the dative case (and the other cases) more or less the same way as does Russian; some languages may use the dative in other ways.

(I am especially interested in what it is)\") and Dativus auctoris (Izgleda '''mi''' okej \"It seems okay to me\").\n\nUnusual in other Indo-European branches but common among [[Slavic languages]], endings of nouns and adjectives are different based on grammatical function.  Other factors are gender and number.  In some cases, the ending may not be obvious, even when those three factors (function, gender, number) are considered.  For example, in Polish, ''''syn'''' (\"son\") and ''''ojciec'''' (\"father\") are both masculine singular nouns, yet appear as ''syn \u2192 syn'''owi''''' and ''ojciec \u2192 ojc'''u''''' in the dative.\n\n==Baltic languages==\nBoth Lithuanian and Latvian have a distinct dative case in the system of nominal declensions.\n\nLithuanian nouns preserve Indo-European inflections in the dative case fairly well: (o-stems) vaikas -> sg. vaikui, pl. vaikams; (\u0101-stems) ranka -> sg. rankai, pl. rankoms; (i-stems) viltis -> sg. vil\u010diai, pl. viltims; (u-stems) s\u016bnus -> sg. s\u016bnui, pl. s\u016bnums; (consonant stems) vanduo -> sg. vandeniui, pl. vandenims.\n\nAdjectives in the dative case receive pronominal endings (this might be the result of a more recent development): tas geras vaikas -> sg. t'''am''' ger'''am''' vaikui, pl. t'''iems''' ger'''iems''' vaikams.\n\nThe dative case in Latvian underwent further simplifications - the original masculine endings of ''both'' nouns and adjectives have been replaced with pronominal inflections: tas v\u012brs -> sg. tam v\u012bram, pl. {{Not a typo|tiem}} v\u012briem. Also, the final \"s\" in all Dative forms has been dropped. The only exception is personal pronouns in the plural: mum'''s''' (to us), jum'''s''' (to you). Note that in colloquial Lithuanian the final \"s\" in the dative is often omitted, as well: time geriem vaikam.\n\nIn both Latvian and Lithuanian, the main function of the dative case is to render the indirect object in a sentence: (lt) a\u0161 duodu vyrui knyg\u0105; (lv) es dodu [duodu] v\u012bram gr\u0101matu - ''I am giving a book to the man''.\n\nThe dative case can also be used with gerundives to indicate an action preceding or simultaneous with the main action in a sentence: (lt) jam \u012f\u0117jus, visi atsistojo - ''when he walked in, everybody stood up'', lit. ''to him having walked in, all stood up''; (lt) jai miegant, visi dirbo - ''while she slept, everybody was working'', lit. ''to her sleeping, all were working''.\n\nIn modern standard Lithuanian, Dative case is not required by prepositions, although in many dialects it is done frequently: (dial.) iki (+D) \u0161iai dienai, (stand.) iki (+G) \u0161ios dienos - ''up until this day''.\n\nIn Latvian, the dative case is taken by several prepositions in the singular and '''all'''  prepositions in the plural (due to peculiar historical changes): sg. bez (+G) tevis ''(without thee)'' ~ pl. bez (+D) jums ''(without you)''; sg. pa (+A) ce\u013cu ''(along the road)'' ~ pl. pa (+D) ce\u013ciem ''(along the roads)''.\n\n==Armenian==\n{{clarify|transcriptions needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn modern Eastern Armenian, the dative is attained by adding any article to the genitive:\n\n''dog'' = \u0577\u0578\u0582\u0576\n\nGEN > \u0577\u0561\u0576 ''(of the dog; dog's)'' with no articles\n\nDAT > \u0577\u0561\u0576'''\u0568''' or \u0577\u0561\u0576'''\u0576''' ''(to the dog)'' with definite articles (-\u0576 if preceding a vowel)\n\nDAT > '''\u0574\u056b''' \u0577\u0561\u0576 ''(to a dog)'' with indefinite article\n\nDAT > \u0577\u0561\u0576'''\u057d''' ''(to my dog)'' with 1st person possessive article\n\nDAT > \u0577\u0561\u0576'''\u0564''' ''(to your dog)'' with 2nd person possessive article\n\nThere is a general tendency to view -\u056b\u0576 as the standard dative suffix, but only because that is its most productive (and therefore common) form. The suffix -\u056b\u0576 as a dative marker is nothing but the standard, most common, genitive suffix -\u056b accompanied by the definite article -\u0576. But the dative case encompasses indefinite objects as well, which will not be marked by -\u056b\u0576:\n\nDefinite DAT > \u0535\u057d \u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584\u0568 \u057f\u057e\u0565\u0581\u056b '''\u057f\u0572\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576''': ''(I gave the book '''to the boy''')''\n\nIndefinite DAT> \u0535\u057d \u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584\u0568 \u057f\u057e\u0565\u0581\u056b '''\u0574\u056b \u057f\u0572\u0561\u0575\u056b''': ''(I gave the book '''to a boy''')''\n\nThe main function of the dative marking in Armenian is to indicate the receiving end of an action, more commonly the indirect object which in English is preceded by the preposition ''to''. In the use of \"giving\" verbs like ''give, donate, offer, deliver, sell, bring...'' the dative marks the recipient. With communicative verbs like ''tell, say, advise, explain, ask, answer...'' the dative marks the listener. Other verbs whose indirect objects are marked by the dative case in Armenian are ''show, reach, look, approach...''\n\nEastern Armenian also uses the dative case to mark the time of an event, in the same way English uses the preposition ''at'', as in ''Meet me at nine o' clock.''\n\n==Sanskrit==\nThe dative case is known as the \"fourth case\" (chaturthi-vibhakti) in the usual procedure in the declension of nouns. Its use is mainly for the indirect object.\n\n==Non-Indo-European languages==\n\n===Hungarian===\nAs with many other languages, the dative case is used in Hungarian to show the indirect object of a verb. For example, '''''D\u00e1nielnek''' adtam ezt a k\u00f6nyvet'' (I gave this book '''to D\u00e1niel''').\n\nIt has two suffixes, ''-nak'' and ''-nek''; the correct one is selected by [[vowel harmony]]. The personal dative pronouns follow the ''-nek'' version:  ''nekem'', ''neked'', etc.\n\nThis case is also used to express \"for\" in certain circumstances, such as \"I bought a gift for Mother\".\n\nIn possessive constructions the nak/nek endings are also used but this is NOT the dative form (rather, the [[Hungarian noun phrase#Possessive construction with 2 nouns|attributive or possessive case]])<ref>[[Ignatius Singer]], 'Simplified Grammar of the Hungarian Language', 1882.</ref>\n\n===Finnish===\n\nFinnish does not have a separate dative case. However, the [[allative]] case can fulfill essentially the same role as dative, beyond its primary meaning of directional movement (that is, going somewhere or approaching someone). For example: ''He lahjoittivat kaikki rahansa '''k\u00f6yhille''' (They donated all their money '''to the poor'''.)\n\n===Tsez===\nIn the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as [[Tsez language|Tsez]], the dative also takes the functions of the [[lative case]] in marking the direction of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages, although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb \"show\" (literally: \"make see\") is given below:\n:{| style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"\n| colspan = 4 align=\"center\"|'''\u041a\u0438\u0434\u0431\u0101 \u0443\u0436\u0438\u0445\u044a\u043e\u0440 \u043aI\u0435\u0442I\u0443 \u0431\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e.'''\n|-\n|''kidb-\u0101''||''u\u017ei-qo-r''||''k\u02bcet\u02bcu''||''b-ik\u02b7a-r-xo''\n|-\n|girl<small>:OBL-[[Ergative case|ERG]]</small>||boy<small>-[[Tsez language#Locative case suffixes|POSS]]-DAT/LAT</small>||cat<small>:[[Grammatical gender|&#91;III&#93;]]:[[Absolutive case|ABS]]</small>||[[Grammatical gender|III]]-see<small>-[[Causative|CAUS]]-[[Present tense|PRES]]</small>\n|-\n| colspan = 4 align=\"center\"|\"The girl shows the cat to the boy.\"\n|}\n\nThe dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below, because there is no such verb as \"to have\".\n:{| style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"\n| colspan = 4 align=\"center\"|'''\u041a\u0438\u0434\u0431\u0435\u0445\u044a\u043e\u0440 \u043aI\u0435\u0442I\u0443 \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0438.'''\n|-\n|''kidbe-qo-r''||''k\u02bcet\u02bcu''||''zow-si''\n|-\n|girl<small>:OBL-[[Tsez language#Locative case suffixes|POSS]]-DAT/LAT</small>||cat<small>:[[Absolutive case|ABS]]</small>||be<small>:PST-[[Past tense|PST]]</small>\n|-\n| colspan = 3 align=\"center\"|\"The girl had a cat.\"\n|}\nAs in the examples above, the dative/lative case usually occurs in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; this should not be regarded as a separate case, however, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically; hence, they are, in fact, a combination of two case suffixes. See [[Tsez language#Locative case suffixes]] for further details.\n\nVerbs of perception or emotion (like \"see\", \"know\", \"love\", \"want\") also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case.

All of these have [[icosahedral symmetry]], order 120.\n\nThe [[#Pyritohedron|pyritohedron]], a common crystal form in [[pyrite]], is an irregular pentagonal dodecahedron, having the same topology as the regular one but [[pyritohedral symmetry]] while the [[#Tetartoid|tetartoid]] has [[tetrahedral symmetry]].

Like the [[regular dodecahedron]], it has twelve identical [[pentagon]]al faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices.{{cn|date=July 2016|reason=the term 'pyritohedron' for this structure needs reliably sourcing}} However, the pentagons are not constrained to be regular, and the underlying atomic arrangement has no true fivefold symmetry axes. Its 30 edges are divided into two sets \u2013 containing 24 and 6 edges of the same length. The only axes of [[rotational symmetry]] are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes and four threefold axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the  pyritohedron form occurs in the crystals of the mineral [[pyrite]], and it may be an inspiration for the discovery of the regular [[Platonic solid]] form. Note that the true regular dodecahedron can occur as a shape for [[quasicrystal]]s with [[icosahedral symmetry]], which includes true fivefold rotation axes.\n\n{|\n|\n{{multiple image |align=left |perrow=4  |total_width=400\n| image1 = Polyhedron pyritohedron from yellow max.png\n| image2 = Polyhedron pyritohedron from red max.png\n| image3 = Polyhedron pyritohedron from blue max.png\n| footer = Orthogonal projections \u2015 The wedge height of this pyritohedron is 1/4 of the cube edge length.\n}}\n|\n{{multiple image |align=left |perrow=4  |total_width=260\n| image1 = Polyhedron pyritohedron max.png\n| image2 = Polyhedron 12 pyritohedral max.png\n| footer = Same example pyritohedron and regular dodecahedron.\n}}\n|}\n\n==== Crystal pyrite ====\nIts name comes from one of the two common [[crystal habit]]s shown by [[pyrite]], the other one being the [[cube]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:300px;\"\n|-\n|[[File:Pyriteespagne.jpg|150px]]<br>Cubic pyrite\n|[[Image:Pyrite cristal.jpg|150px]]<br>Pyritohedral\n|}\n\n====Cartesian coordinates====\n[[File:Pyritohedron animation.gif|200px|left]]\nThe coordinates of the eight vertices of the original cube are:\n: (\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b11)\n\nThe coordinates of the 12 vertices of the cross-edges are:\n: (0, \u00b1(1 + ''h''), \u00b1(1 \u2212 ''h''<sup>2</sup>))\n: (\u00b1(1 + ''h''), \u00b1(1 \u2212 ''h''<sup>2</sup>), 0)\n: (\u00b1(1 \u2212 ''h''<sup>2</sup>), 0, \u00b1(1 + ''h''))\n\nwhere ''h'' is the height of the [[wedge (geometry)|wedge-shaped \"roof\"]] above the faces of the cube. When ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the six cross-edges degenerate to points and a  [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is formed. When ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, the cross-edges are absorbed in the facets of the cube, and the pyritohedron reduces to a cube. When ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|\u22121 + {{sqrt|5}}|2}}, the multiplicative inverse of the [[golden ratio]], the result is a regular dodecahedron.

Like the [[regular dodecahedron]], it has twelve identical [[pentagon]]al faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not regular and the figure has no fivefold symmetry axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the tetartoid form does. The name tetartoid comes from the Greek root for one-fourth because it has one fourth of full octahedral symmetry, and half of pyritohedral symmetry.<ref>Dutch, Steve.

It has D<sub>3d</sub> symmetry, order 12. It has 2 sets of 3 identical pentagons on the top and bottom, connected 6 pentagons around the sides which alternate upwards and downwards. This form has a hexagonal cross-section and identical copies can be connected as a partial hexagonal honeycomb, but all vertices will not match.\n:[[File:Dual_triangular_gyrobianticupola.png|160px]]\n\n==Rhombic dodecahedron==\n[[File:Rhombicdodecahedron.jpg|160px|thumb|Rhombic dodecahedron]]\nThe ''[[rhombic dodecahedron]]'' is a [[zonohedron]] with twelve rhombic faces and octahedral symmetry. It is dual to the [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasiregular]] [[cuboctahedron]] (an [[Archimedean solid]]) and occurs in nature as a crystal form. The rhombic dodecahedron packs together to fill space.\n\nThe ''rhombic dodecahedron'' can be seen as a degenerate [[pyritohedron]] where the 6 special edges have been reduced to zero length, reducing the pentagons into rhombic faces.\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron has several [[stellation]]s, the [[First stellation of rhombic dodecahedron|first of which]] is also a [[rhombic dodecahedron#Parallelohedron|parallelohedral spacefiller]].\n\nAnother important rhombic dodecahedron, the [[Bilinski dodecahedron]], has twelve faces congruent to those of the [[rhombic triacontahedron]], i.e. the diagonals are in the ratio of the [[golden ratio]]. It is also a [[zonohedron]] and was described by [[Stanko Bilinski|Bilinski]] in 1960.<ref>Hafner, I. and Zitko, T.

A state which is ruled by a dictator is called a [[dictatorship]]. The word originated as the title of a [[Roman dictator|magistrate]] in the [[Roman Republic]] appointed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to rule the republic in times of emergency (see [[Roman dictator]] and ''[[justitium]]'').<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictator\n|title=dictator \u2013  Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n|publisher=www.merriam-webster.com\n|accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref>\n\nLike the term \"[[tyrant]]\" (which was originally a respectable Ancient Greek title), and to a lesser degree \"[[Autocracy|autocrat]]\", \"dictator\" came to be used almost exclusively as a non-titular term for oppressive, even abusive rule, yet it had rare modern titular use.\n\nIn modern usage, the term \"dictator\" is generally used to describe a leader who holds and/or abuses an extraordinary amount of [[Superiority complex|personal power]]. Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following traits: suspension of [[election]]s and [[civil liberties]]; proclamation of a [[state of emergency]]; [[rule by decree]]; [[political repression|repression of political opponents]] without abiding by the [[rule of law]] procedures; these include [[one-party state]], and [[cult of personality]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Papaioannou|first=Kostadis|date=2015|title=The Dictator Effect: How long years in office affect economic development|url= http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1744137414000356|journal=Journal of Institutional Economics|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S1744137414000356|pmid=|access-date=|via=|author2=vanZanden, Jan Luiten}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|last = Olson|first = Mancur|date = 1993|journal =[[American Political Science Review]] |volume=87 |issue=3|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nThe term \"dictator\" is comparable to{{sndash}} but not synonymous with{{sndash}} the ancient concept of a tyrant; initially \"tyrant\", like \"dictator\", did not carry negative connotations. A wide variety of leaders coming to power in a number of different kinds of regimes, such as [[military junta]]s, [[one-party state]]s and civilian governments under a personal rule, have been described as dictators. They, in a sense, may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or they may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main article|Roman dictator}}\n[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Julius Caesar]], dictator of Rome.]]\n\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|align=right|image1=2017 Freedom House world map.png|image2=EIU Democracy Index 2017.svg|caption1=Country ratings from Freedom House's ''Freedom in the World 2017'' survey, concerning the state of world freedom in 2016.<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf Freedom in The World 2017 - Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy] by ''Freedom House'', January 31, 2017</ref>\n<center>{{legend inline|#16A983|Free (86)}} {{legend inline|#E5B63B|Partly Free (59)}} {{legend inline|#6973A5|Not Free (50)}}</center>|caption2=[[Democracy Index]] by the [[UK]] based magazine [[The Economist]], 2017.

For example, when creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. \n   \nPast that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''\".<ref name=\"guardian_obit\">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London}}</ref> In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nThe association between a dictator and the [[military]] is a common one; many dictators take great pains to emphasize their connections with the military and they often wear military uniforms. In some cases, this is perfectly legitimate; [[Francisco Franco]] was a lieutenant general in the Spanish Army before he became [[Head of state|Chief of State]] of [[Spain]]; [[Manuel Noriega]] was officially commander of the [[Panama]]nian Defense Forces. In other cases, the association is mere pretense.\n\nSome dictators have been masters of [[crowd manipulation]], such as Mussolini and Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Stalin and Franco.  Typically the dictator's people seize control of all media, censor or destroy the opposition, and give strong doses of [[propaganda]] daily, often built around a [[cult of personality]].<ref>Fritz Morstein Marx, et al.

This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].\n* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].\nNote that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion. [[Monarch]]s and [[Military dictatorship|military dictators]] are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the [[nobility]] or the [[army]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dictator novel]]\n* [[Authoritarian personality]]\n* [[Emergency powers]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup

a logarithmic scale. It can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a reference value; when used in this way, the decibel symbol should be appended with a suffix that indicates the reference value, or some other property. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nThere are two different scales used when expressing a ratio in decibels depending on the nature of the quantities: [[Field, power, and root-power quantities|field, power, and root-power]]. When expressing power quantities, the number of decibels is ten times the [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]] of the ratio of two power quantities.<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |ISBN=0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]]. When expressing field quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The extra factor of two is due to the logarithm of the quadratic relationship between power and amplitude. The decibel scales differ so that direct comparisons can be made between related power and field quantities when they are expressed in decibels.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a [[unit of measurement]] for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the  [[logarithm]] of the ratio of [[Field, power, and root-power quantities|power- or field-type quantities]].<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally ''Miles of Standard Cable'' (MSC). 1&nbsp;MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1&nbsp;[[mile]] (approximately 1.6&nbsp;km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000&nbsp;[[radian]]s per second (795.8&nbsp;Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88&nbsp;Ohms per loop-mile and uniformly distributed [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitance]] of 0.054&nbsp;[[microfarad]]s per mile\" (approximately corresponding to 19&nbsp;[[wire gauge|gauge]] wire).<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Kenneth Simonds |title=Transmission Circuits for Telephonic Communication: Methods of analysis and design |date=1944 |publisher=[[D.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, C.

In spite of their widespread use, [[#Suffixes and reference values|suffixes]] (such as in [[A-weighting|dBA]] or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.\n\n==Definition==\nISO 80000-3 describes definitions for quantities and units of space and time. The decibel for use in acoustics is defined in ISO 80000-8. The major difference from the article below is that for acoustics the decibel has no absolute value.\n\nThe ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-3:2006]] defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: {{nobreak|1=1 dB = 0.1 B}}. The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nobreak|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nobreak|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nobreak|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[\u2026] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times [\u2026]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=206 |isbn=0-12-772690-X |quote=[\u2026] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB [\u2026]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''<sub>0</sub> (reference power) is represented by ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>, that ratio expressed in decibels,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}</ref> which is calculated using the formula:<ref name=\"standardization2006\"/>\n\n:<math>\nL_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nobreak|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\mathrm{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Field, power, and root-power quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and it is desirable for the two decibel formulations to give the same result in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\mathrm{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is held constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation:\n:<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V}{V_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V'' is the voltage being measured, ''V''<sub>0</sub> is a specified reference voltage, and ''G''<sub>dB</sub> is the power gain expressed in decibels. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Conversions===\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

The unit dBW is often used to denote a ratio for which the reference is 1 W, and similarly dBm for a {{nobreak|1 mW}} reference point.\n* Calculating the ratio of {{nobreak|1 kW}} (one kilowatt, or 1000 watts) to {{nobreak|1 W}} in decibels yields:\n::<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{1000~\\mathrm{W}}{1~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) = 30.\n</math>\n* The ratio of {{nobreak|1={{radic|1000}} V \u2248 31.62 V}} to {{nobreak|1 V}} in decibels is\n::<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{31.62~\\mathrm{V}}{1~\\mathrm{V}}\\right) = 30.\n</math>\n{{nobreak|1=(31.62 V/1 V)<sup>2</sup> \u2248 1 kW/1 W}}, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that ''G''<sub>dB</sub> has the same value, 30, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.\n* The ratio of {{nobreak|1 mW}} (one milliwatt) to {{nobreak|10 W}} in decibels is obtained with the formula\n::<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{0.001~\\mathrm{W}}{10~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) = -40.\n</math>\n* The power ratio corresponding to a {{nobreak|3 dB}} change in level is given by\n::<math>\nG = 10^\\frac{3}{10} \\times 1 = 1.99526... \\approx 2.\n</math>\n\nA change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of {{nobreak|10 dB}}. A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is \u00b13.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nobr|{{sqrt|2}} \u2248 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than \u00b16.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.00&nbsp;dB is a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.00&nbsp;dB is the power ratio is {{nobr|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> \u2248 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a similar manner to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See [[Bode plot]] and [[semi-log plot]].  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, log(''A''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''C'') = log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is approximately 26% power gain, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (10<sup>12</sup>).<ref>{{citation |publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509092930/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |archive-date=9 May 2016 |date=2008}}</ref> Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in [[logarithmic scale]]: the base-10 logarithm of 10<sup>12</sup> is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120&nbsp;dB re 20&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|\u03bcPa]].\n\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4&nbsp;[[hertz|kHz]], are factored more heavily into some measurements using [[frequency weighting]]. (See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\nThe main instrument used for measuring sound levels in the environment and in the workplace is the [[Sound level meter|Sound Level Meter]]. Most sound level meters provide readings in A, C, and Z-weighted decibels and must meet international standards such as [[IEC 61672|IEC 61672 - 2013]]. \n\nAccording to Hickling, \"Decibels are a useless affectation, which is impeding the development of noise control as an engineering discipline\".<ref name=\"Hickling\"/>\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios ([[Gain (electronics)|gains]]), in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a suffix to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;\u03a9 }} \u2248 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121 B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20 log of the ratio, even when the represented optical power is directly proportional to the voltage, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n==Suffixes and reference values{{anchor|Suffixes}}==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.

And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's \"Researches on Development,\" thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.<ref name=\"westminster\" />}}\n\nThese are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:\n\n# More individuals are produced each generation that can survive.\n# Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable.\n# Those individuals with heritable traits better suited to the environment will survive.\n# When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form.\n\nAnother important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] who, in his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and [[Sociology|sociological]] arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as the core of evolution, which provided a [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:\n\n{{quotation|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense\u2014not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.<ref>{{harvnb|Kropotkin|1902|p=293}}</ref>|Peter Kropotkin|Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion}}\n\n==19th-century usage==\n\"Darwinism\" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] in 1859. What is now called \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" was, in its day, synonymous with \"Darwinism\"\u2014the application of Darwinian principles of \"struggle\" to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that \"Darwinism\" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on \"civilized\" people, it was possible for \"inferior\" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the [[gene pool]]) to overwhelm the \"superior\" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable\u2014the foundation of [[eugenics]].\n\n{{anchor|Darwinismus}}\nIn Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term \"Darwinism\", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as ''Darwinismus'' in Germany, although, like Spencer's \"evolution\", Haeckel's \"Darwinism\" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection.<ref>Schmitt S.

The story revolves around a robotic cat named [[Doraemon (character)|Doraemon]], who [[time travel|travels back in time]] from the 22nd century to aid a boy named {{nihongo|[[Nobita Nobi]]|\u91ce\u6bd4\u306e\u3073\u592a|Nobi Nobita}}.\n\nThe Doraemon manga series was first published in December 1969 in six different magazines. A total of 1,345 stories were created in the original series, which are published by [[Shogakukan]]. The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an English-language release in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/japan/travel/prefectures/kanagawa/doraemon_museum.shtml |title=Fujiko F.

In March 2008, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's Foreign Ministry]] appointed Doraemon as the nation's first \"anime ambassador.\" A Ministry spokesperson explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other countries understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in [[Japanese culture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/431177|title=Doraemon named 'anime ambassador'|last=AFP|first=|date=March 15, 2008|website=[[Japan Today]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318231731/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/431177|archive-date=March 18, 2008|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Foreign Ministry action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese cultural icon.

Many years in the future, one of his descendants sends the robotic cat [[Doraemon (character)|Doraemon]] back in time to protect and guide Nobita. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket in which he stores innumerable items known as ''gadgets'', which range from toys and medicine, to technology from the future. Examples include the ''Bamboo-Copter'' (Japanese: ''Take-Koputa''), a small piece of headgear that allows flight and the ''Anywhere Door'' (Japanese: ''Doko Demo Doa''), a door that opens up to any place the user wishes.\n\nNobita's closest friend is [[Shizuka Minamoto]], who also serves as his romantic interest and eventually becomes his wife. Nobita is usually tormented by the bullying [[Takeshi Goda]] (nicknamed \"Gian\"), and the cunning and arrogant [[Suneo Honekawa]]. A typical story consists of Doraemon using one of his gadgets in order to assist Nobita in various ways, often causing more trouble than he was trying to solve.\n\n==Media==\n{{See|List of non-Japanese Doraemon versions}}\n\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of Doraemon chapters|List of Doraemon Plus chapters}}\n[[File:Doraemon first appearance.jpg|thumb|250px|The first appearance of Doraemon, who came via the [[time machine]].]]\nIn December 1969 the ''Doraemon'' manga appeared in six different children's monthly magazines published by [[Shogakukan]].

Unlike the anime and manga (some based on the stories in select volumes), they are more action-adventure oriented and have more of a [[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]] demographic, taking the familiar characters of ''Doraemon'' and placing them in a variety of exotic and perilous settings. Nobita and his friends have visited the age of the [[dinosaur]]s, the far reaches of the [[galaxy]], the heart of darkest Africa (where they encountered a race of sentient bipedal dogs), the depths of the ocean, and a world of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Some of the films are based on [[legend]]s such as [[Atlantis]], and on literary works including ''[[Journey to the West]]'' and ''[[Arabian Nights]].'' Some films also have serious themes, especially on environmental topics and the use of technology. Overall, the films have a somewhat darker tone in their stories, unlike the manga and anime.\n\n===Video games===\n{{details|List of Doraemon video games}}\nThere are a total of 63 Japanese-only video games ranging from platformer games to RPG games, which began with the Emerson's [[Arcadia 2001]] system. Doraemon can also be seen in [[Namco]]'s popular ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'' rhythm game series like ''Taiko no Tatsujin'' (11 \u2013 [[Taiko no Tatsujin 14|14]] only), ''[[Metcha!

This was to be a relay from a transmitting station at Wenvoe, South Wales. The DPA objected to this threat and sought expert opinion, offered alternative solutions, pressed for a public enquiry, engaged a lawyer, held public meetings, distributed pamphlets, wrote to the press and petitioned parliament.<ref name=\"Kelly\" />{{rp|p.233}} Eventually, a public enquiry was announced.<ref name=\"Kelly\" />{{rp|p.238}} When the decision was made to permit the mast, there were a number of conditions, included among them was that the development was built near the tor, leaving it still intact, and that its new approach road should not be fenced.  During the process of obtaining land for the transmitter, one MP asked in the House of Commons: \"Will the Assistant Postmaster-General bear in mind that we have no desire to hinder the provision of this station but that it is felt that ancient common rights such as these, that have existed for a thousand years, should be adequately protected or properly extinguished by due process of law?\"<ref>Hayman, 1954.

In 1956, permission was granted to rebuild the station as part of the [[Gee (navigation)|\"Gee\" radio navigation system]], to be occupied for ten years. There followed delay in leaving and a proposal was made in 1970 by [[Devon and Cornwall Police|Devon & Cornwall Police]] to use the mast, which was rejected. Then later that year Plymouth Corporation wanted to use the exposed site for housing juvenile offenders. This was also rejected, but Plymouth appealed. At a public enquiry in June 1973 [[Sylvia Sayer|Lady Sylvia Sayer]] represented the DPA and permission for development on the site was refused. A few years later, DPA fought successfully in support of South West Water (SWW) against renewed calls for a new reservoir at Swincombe. To mark the victory, Sylvia Sayer asked SWW if DPA could purchase the rocky outcrop of Sharpitor. The DPA purchased 32 acres in February 1984.<ref name = \"Brewer\"/>{{rp|p.253}}<ref>[http://www.dartmoorpreservation.com/about-the-dpa/land/285-the-sharpitor-story] \"The Sharpitor Story\" - Dartmoor Preservation Association website</ref>\n\n===Okehampton bypass===\nOkehampton lies on the A30 main road, the shortest route from London to west Devon and Cornwall.

In August 1976, the Department of the Environment announced the preferred route was through the National Park. A major event on the timeline of this project was a 96-day public enquiry from 1 May 1979 to 4 February 1980 held in Okehampton.

The earliest record of a china clay pit refers to Hook Lake in 1502.<ref name=\"Wade\">Wade, E.A. ''The Redlake Tramway & China Clay Works''. Twelveheads Press, Truro, 2004. {{ISBN|0906294096}}.</ref>{{rp|p.7}} The area was surveyed around 1827 by Cornishmen with thirty years experience in the clay industry. They obtained a 21-year lease in 1830, from the [[Earl of Morley]] who owned the land, to work the area between Lee Moor and Shaugh Moor. A rival pit was opened at Leftlake in about 1850 and at Hemerdon and Broomage in about 1855. Further pits were opened at Cholwichtown, Whitehill Yeo and Wigford Down/Brisworthy (circa 1860). Others followed at Smallhanger and Headon in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Wade\"/>{{rp|p.9}} Redlake started working in 1910.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>{{rp|p.96}} China clay pits are open cast mines that result in large holes in the ground accompanied by large waste tips. Over time, the pits become larger and more ground is needed for the waste, changing the landscape: the effect of this can be seen from space.<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=z0ikR9Wtiea0.kR5DL_24GeFw] Google Satellite map of china clay sites on Dartmoor</ref>\n\nThe DPA argues that this is an activity that does not agree with the ethos of a National Park, whose purpose is to protect landscape from unsuitable development. In 1994, the National Park boundaries were changed to include common land at Shaugh Moor and exclude china clay worked land at Lee Moor.<ref>Lord Brougham and Vaux. 1994.

Both organisations funded an invited number of upland hill farmers to attend.<ref>Paxman, James. \"DPA News\". Dartmoor Matters, No. 168, Winter 2008. p.3.

It was run by the DPA at Exeter Racecourse in October 2012, with 150 delegates. Speakers came from the Foundation for Common Land, the Forest of Dartmoor Commoners, the University of Gloucestershire, the [[National Farmers Union of England and Wales]] and the [[Open Spaces Society]]. The CEO raised sponsorship from Dartmoor National Park, Exmoor National Park, Natural England, Duchy of Cornwall and the Exmoor Society - this reflecting the standing of the DPA with those bodies.<ref name=\"primocat.bl.uk\"/><ref>Cowling, Norman. \"South West Uplands Federation Conference\".

The two schemes on Holne Moor and Walkhampton Common between them remove nearly 6&nbsp;km of overhead line from open moorland. At nearly 5&nbsp;km, the Walkhampton scheme is the largest to be undertaken in the South West region by Western Power Distribution. The old overhead line was readily visible from the B3212 Princetown to Yelverton Road, strung across Walkhampton Common from Devil\u2019s Elbow to just above Horseyeatt at Peek Hill. The works to provide the new underground supply were mainly undertaken on the highway to minimise the impact on the sensitive moorland landscape, its archaeology, wildlife and livestock. The DPA has supported the undergrounding of these visually intrusive power lines for many years.<ref>[http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Eyesore-poles-power-cables-removed-Walkhampton/story-22714290-detail/story.html] \"'Eyesore' of poles and power cables removed from Walkhampton Common and Holne Moor on Dartmoor</ref>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:DPA pylons BEFORE.jpg|thumb|Walkhampton Common pylons and power cables before undergrounding]]\n| [[File:DPA pylons DURING.jpg|thumb|Walkhampton Common pylons during undergrounding, posing with a cross-cut saw for the local press]]\n| [[File:DPA pylons AFTER.jpg|thumb|Walkhampton Common after undergrounding of the power cables]]\n|}\n\n===The Dartmoor Conservation Garden===\nThe Dartmoor Conservation Garden is a joint project between DPA and [[Dartmoor National Park Authority]] (DNPA) and is located in the Jack Wigmore Garden behind the High Moorland Centre in Princetown:<ref>[http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/visiting/vi-planningyourvisit/vi-infocentres/vi-highmoorlandcentre \"National Park Visitor Centre - Princetown\"]</ref> this is a memorial garden to a former Chair of the Authority. It is planted with a cross-section of typical native Dartmoor plants. It also houses some typical Dartmoor archaeological features, such as a 4,000-year-old [[Bronze Age]] burial [[kistvaen]] (or cist) and a Medieval granite cross from Ter Hill. This marked the Monk's Path but was constantly being pushed over by cattle. The purpose of the Garden is to illustrate the biodiversity on Dartmoor. The project came online in June 2015.<ref>Fleming, Pat. \"The Dartmoor Conservation Garden\". ''Dartmoor Magazine'', Issue 119 Summer 2015.

Friends of Dartmoor projects a more modern image of preservation where several years of diplomacy have achieved good relations with the partner agencies that operate in the Dartmoor arena. This is due mainly to the efforts of the previous CEO, James Paxman<ref>http://www.dartmoorpreservation.com/news-a-publications/dpa-news-items1</ref> and his successor, Phil Hutt.<ref name=\"dartmoorpreservation.com\"/>\n\n===Constitution, objectives and policies===\nThe DPA Constitution, objectives and policies are published on the DPA web site.<ref>[http://www.dartmoorpreservation.com/about-the-dpa/policies \"DPA Policies\" - Dartmoor Preservation Association website]</ref>\n\nThe objectives enshrined in the constitution are the protection, preservation and enhancement in the public interest of the landscape, antiquities, flora and fauna, natural beauty, cultural heritage and scientific interest of Dartmoor. Also the protection and preservation of public access to and on Dartmoor subject to the ancient rights of commoners. Co-operation with the commoners and any organisation in achieving DPA objectives, also the study of and the recording and publication of information upon the antiquities, history and natural history of Dartmoor. There is also an interest in the acquisition of land and rights to further DPA objectives, concomitant with being a charity.\n\nThe DPA has twenty-two policies listed on its web site: regarding access and rights of way, fencing, protecting monuments, diverse habitats, bracken, china clay quarrying, military training and live firing, hill farming and small scale traditional local industries, quarrying, television and telephone masts, wind farms, planning applications, housing developments, woodlands and forestry, ponies, swaling, and recreational activities.<ref>[http://www.dartmoorpreservation.com/about-the-dpa/policies \"Policies of the DPA\" - Dartmoor Preservation website]</ref>\n\n===Logo===\nThe DPA logo incorporates a representation of a Dartmoor rock feature known as [[Bowerman's Nose]]. The logo that includes a representation of Nun\u2019s Cross appeared on the DPA Dartmoor Newsletter No. 48, October 1966, with a comment that designs based on the initial letters DPA had been exhausted. The simpler logo appeared in November 1969, when Newsletter 52 carried the logo with \"DPA\" on it. This was replaced in 2004 with the multicoloured logo.<ref>[http://dartmoorpreservation.com/about-the-dpa/who-we-are/223-the-dpa-emblem \"The DPA Emblem\" - on the Dartmoor Preservation website]</ref>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:1966 logo with Nuns Cross.jpg|thumb|DPA logo from 1966, with Nun's Cross incorporated]]\n| [[File:1969 logo.jpg|thumb|DPA logo from 1969]]\n| \n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brewer, Dave.

Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with [[Mohegan]] Indian [[Samson Occom]]. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to [[Long Island]] to preach to the [[Montaukett|Montauks]].<ref name=\"history-lesson\"/>\n\nWheelock founded [[Moor's Charity School|Moor's Indian Charity School]] in 1755.<ref name=\"Eleazar Wheelock's Two Schools\"/> The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by Dr. [[John Phillips (educator)|John Phillips]] in 1762, who would go on to found [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.<ref name=\"history-lesson\"/> The head of the trust was a [[Methodist]] named [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]].\n\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-02 03 - Charter.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in [[Baker Memorial Library]]. The charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]].]]\nAlthough the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, [[Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet|John Wentworth]], provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a [[royal charter]] in the name of [[King George III]] establishing the College. That charter created a college \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others.\" The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds.

Woodward|Dartmouth College case]], which challenged [[New Hampshire]]'s 1816 attempt to amend the college'  charter to make the school a public university. An institution called [[Dartmouth University]] occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.<ref name=\"history-lesson\"/> [[Daniel Webster]], an [[alumnus]] of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an [[Contract Clause|illegal impairment of a contract]] by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his [[peroration]] with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"<ref name=\"history-lesson\"/>\n\nIn 1866, the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to [[Durham, New Hampshire]], in 1891, and later became known as the [[University of New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unh.edu/main/brief-history |title=University Chronology &#124; University of New Hampshire Library |publisher=Unh.edu |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century.

Of those admitted students who reported class rank, a record 46.3% were valedictorian or salutatorian, with 97% ranking in the top decile of their class. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1497, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33. More than 51% identified as being students of color, 15% are among the first generation in their families to matriculate to college, 11% are international students, and 9% are legacies.<ref name=\"dartmouth6\"/>\n\nAdditionally, for the 2016\u20132017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85.<ref name=\"dartmouth.edu\"/> Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the College, and currently admits all students, with the exception of internationals, on a [[Need-blind admission|need-blind basis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2015/09/18/college-ends-need-blind-admission-for-international-students/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 28, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929223025/https://thedartmouth.com/2015/09/18/college-ends-need-blind-admission-for-international-students/ |archivedate=September 29, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n=== Financial aid ===\nDartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth practices need-blind admissions for all applicants who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented students in the U.S. These applicants are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. For international students, financial need is taken into consideration as one of many factors at the time of admission. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $100,000 or less and possessing typical assets. In 2015, $88.8 million in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.\n\n=== The Dartmouth Plan ===\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-06 Baker Memorial Library 08 - Tower Room.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1|Tower Room in [[Baker Memorial Library]]]]\nDartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week [[academic term]]s. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.<ref name=\"d-plan-admin\"/> However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during their freshman, senior, or sophomore summer terms.<ref name=\"Petition for Change\">{{cite web|title=Petition for Change in Enrollment Pattern |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/docs/change_in_enrollment_pattern.pdf |publisher=Dartmouth |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}</ref>  During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.<ref name=\"d-plan-admin\"/> The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.<ref name=\"Working Rules and Procedures\"/>\n\nThe D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as \"a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds.\"<ref name=\"trd-wheelock\"/> Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.\n\n=== Board of Trustees ===\n[[File:Dartmouth Hall, Dartmouth College - general view.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Dartmouth Hall was reconstructed in 1906.]]\n{{Main|Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College}}\nDartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the college president (''ex officio''), the [[governor of New Hampshire|state governor]] (''ex officio''), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called \"charter trustees\"), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (\"alumni trustees\").<ref name=\"Dartmouth Trustees vote to expand size of board\"/> The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.\n\nAlthough the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,<ref name=\"Board of trustees vote to change how Dartmouth College is run\"/> the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.<ref name=\"Board adds 8 seats, ends century-old parity\"/> In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.<ref name=\"Divided Association of Alumni sues College\"/><ref name=\"thedartmouth2\"/> In 2008, the Board added five new charter trustees.<ref name=\"Dartmouth College's Board of Trustees Elects Five Alumni as New Trustees\"/>\n\n== Campus ==\n{{Main|List of Dartmouth College buildings}}\n{{quote box | width=30% | align=right | quote=This is what a college is supposed to look like.|source= \u2014U.S. President [[Dwight D.

It lies within the [[South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and [[South Hams]] district, and had a population of 5,512 in 2001,<ref>[http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=03070&productId=779&$ph=60_61&datasetInstanceId=3070&startColumn=1&numberOfColumns=8&containerAreaId=790363 Office for National Statistics : ''Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : South Hams''] Retrieved 27 January 2010</ref> reducing to 5,064 at the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-southwestengland.php?cityid=E35000831|title=Parish population 2011|accessdate= 19 February 2015}}</ref> There are two [[electoral wards]] in the ''Dartmouth'' area ([[Townstal]] & Kingswear).

It was held by Walter of Douai. It paid tax on half a hide, and had two plough teams, two slaves, five villagers and four smallholders. There were six cattle, 40 sheep and 15 goats. At this time Townstal (as the name became) was apparently a purely agricultural settlement, centred around the church. Walter of Douai rebelled against William II, and his lands were confiscated and added to the honour of Marshwood (Dorset), which sublet Townstal and Dartmouth to the FitzStephens.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Ray|title=Dartmouth and its Neighbours 1st Ed|date=1990|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester|isbn=0 85033 697 X|pages=17 - 18}}</ref> It was probably during the early part of their proprietorship that Dartmouth began to grow as a port, as it was of strategic importance as a deep-water port for sailing vessels. The port was used as the sailing point for the [[Crusades]] of 1147 and 1190, and [[Warfleet Creek]], close to [[Dartmouth Castle]] is supposed by some to be named for the vast fleets which assembled there.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's in A Name - Warfleet Creek|url=http://www.bythedart.co.uk/things-to-do-in-dartmouth/what's-in-a-name---july-2011/|publisher=By The Dart|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref> Dartmouth was a home of the [[Royal Navy]] from the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and was twice surprised and sacked during the [[Hundred Years' War]], after which the mouth of the estuary was closed every night with a great chain. The narrow mouth of the Dart is protected by two fortified castles, [[Dartmouth Castle]] and [[Kingswear Castle]]. Originally Dartmouth's only wharf was Bayard's Cove, a relatively small area protected by a fort at the southern end of the town.\n\nIn 1373 [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] visited and among the pilgrims in his [[Canterbury Tales]]\n:''A [[The Shipman's Tale|schipman]] was ther, wonyng fer by weste;''\n:''For ought I wost, he was of Dertemouthe.''\n\nNotwithstanding Dartmouth's connections with the crown and respectable society, it was a major base for [[privateer]]ing in [[medieval]] times. [[John Hawley (died 1408)|John Hawley]] or Hauley,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devonperspectives.co.uk/johnhawley.html |title=John Hawley of Dartmouth |publisher=Devonperspectives.co.uk |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> a licensed privateer and sometime mayor of Dartmouth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth-history.org.uk/content_images/upload/Town_Mayors.htm |title=Roll Of Mayoralty |publisher=Dartmouth-history.org.uk |date= |accessdate=25 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229093014/http://www.dartmouth-history.org.uk/content_images/upload/Town_Mayors.htm |archivedate=29 February 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> is reputed to be a model for Chaucer's \"schipman\".\n\nThe earliest street in Dartmouth to be recorded by name (in the 13th century) is Smith Street. Several of the houses on the street are originally late 16th century or early 17th century and probably rebuilt on the site of earlier medieval dwellings. The street name undoubtedly derives from the smiths and shipwrights who built and repaired ships here when the tidal waters reached as far as this point. Smith Street was also the site of the town [[pillory]] in medieval times.\n\nThe first church in the parish was St Clement's, Townstal, which may have existed in some form before the 1190s. It was granted by the FitzStephens to [[Torre Abbey]] in about 1198, the Abbey having been founded in 1196, and the present stone-built church was probably started shortly after this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Ray|title=Dartmouth and its Neighbours|date=1990|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester|isbn=0 85033 697 X|pages=19 - 21|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nManorial transactions are first recorded in 1220, when the manor house was at Norton, about half a mile west of Townstal. Names of occupations also started to appear, including taverner, tailor, coggar, korker, goldsmith, glover, skinner and baker. The \"Fosse\", now Foss Street, a dam across the creek known later as The Mill Pool, was first mentioned in 1243. The flow of water out of the pool through the Mill Gullet powered a tidal mill. The dam was used as an unofficial footpath linking Clifton, to the south, with Hardness, to the north. Before this it was necessary to go westwards to the head of the creek at Ford to travel between the two settlements. The lord of the manor was given the rights to hold a weekly market and an annual fair in 1231. In 1281, a legal case proved that the Lord of Totnes had the right to charge tolls on ships using the river, and this right was bought by Nicholas of Tewkesbury in 1306, who conveyed the town, river and port to the king in 1327, so making Dartmouth a Royal Borough. The king gave the river to the Duchy of Cornwall in 1333, who still own the \"fundus\" or bed of the river.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Ray|title=Dartmouth and its Neighbours|date=1990|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester|isbn=0 85033 697 X|pages=23 - 24|edition=1}}</ref> In 1335 Edward III granted Dartmouth to Joan of Carew, whose husband was Lord of Stoke Fleming, and almost immediately she obediently passed the lordship to Guy de Bryan, one of the king's leading ministers. In 1341, the town was granted a Royal Charter, which allowed for the election of a mayor. The borough was required to provide two ships for forty days per year. After 1390, no more is heard of lordship rights, and the borough became effectively independent of any lord.\n\n[[File:St Saviour, Dartmouth, Devon - Door - geograph.org.uk - 1727469.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval church door of St Saviour's]]\n\nSt Saviour's Church was constructed in 1335 and consecrated in 1372. It contains a pre-Reformation oak [[rood screen]] built in 1480 and several monuments including the tomb of John Hawley (d. 1408) and his two wives, covered with a large brass plate effigy of all three. A large medieval ironwork door is decorated with two leopards of the [[Plantagenet]]s and is possibly the original portal. Although it is dated \"1631\", this is thought to be the date of a subsequent refurbishment coincidental with major renovations of the church in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughwood.net/ChurchAlbum/Devon/Dartmouth/Dartmouth-St-Saviour.htm |title=St Saviour, Dartmouth, Devon - Church |publisher=Roughwood.net |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> The gallery of the church is decorated with the heraldic crests of prominent local families and is reputed to be constructed of timbers from ships captured during the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Robert|title=The Rough Guide to Devon & Cornwall|date=2013|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=9781409364863|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Biwnm1Zm1JsC&pg=PT147&lpg=PT147&dq=St+Saviour%27s+Church+Dartmouth+spanish+Armada+timber&source=bl&ots=6Z2t4fA06c&sig=HoSfEf4PK2Hs4SlOqehvLwvlCxw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj73Mvc5OjNAhVMK8AKHWMyCvMQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&q=St%20Saviour's%20Church%20Dartmouth%20spanish%20Armada%20timber&f=false}}</ref> although this has not been categorically substantiated. An engraving of the interior of the church and showing the screen provided the inspiration for [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poetical illustration ''Dartmouth Church'' in Fisher's Drawing Room scrap Book, 1833.\n{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833/Dartmouth Church|'Dartmouth Church',<br>a poem by L. E. L.}}\n\nIn mediaeval times, land access from the Totnes direction passed the manor at Norton and the parish church at Townstal before falling steeply along what are now Church Road, Mount Boone and Ridge Hill to the river at Hardness. There were steeper routes via Townstal Hill and Clarence Street and also via Brown's Hill. These were all too steep for vehicles, so the only land access was by packhorse. In 1671 there is the first mention of the building of the \"New Ground\". A previously existing sandbank was built up using ships' ballast, and a quay wall was built around it to provide more mooring space. The area proved too unstable to be built on, and is now the Royal Avenue Gardens. It was originally linked to the corner of the Quay by a bridge, opposite Duke Street. At the other end of The Quay, Spithead extended into the river for a few yards. \nIn 1592 the ''[[Madre de Deus]]'', a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] treasure ship [[Battle of Flores (1592)|captured by the English]] in the [[Azores]], docked at [[Dartmouth Harbour]]. It attracted all manner of traders, dealers, cutpurses and thieves and by the time Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] arrived to reclaim the Crown's share of the loot, a cargo estimated at half a million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] had been reduced to \u00a3140,000.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDermott|first1=James|title=Martin Frobisher: Elizabethan Privateer|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300083804|pages=397\u2013398|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YeMcPYIKNYUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780300083804&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDlsfZ5ejNAhUGNxQKHSpjCB0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=Dartmouth&f=false}}</ref> Still, ten freighters were needed to carry the treasure to London.\n\n[[Henry Hudson]] put into Dartmouth on his return from North America, and was arrested for sailing under a [[flag state|foreign flag]]. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] put into Dartmouth's Bayard's Cove, en route from [[Southampton]] to America. They rested a while before setting off on their journey in the ''[[Mayflower]]'' and the ''[[Speedwell (1577 ship)|Speedwell]]'' on 20 August 1620. About 300 miles west of [[Land's End]], upon realising that the ''Speedwell'' was unseaworthy, it returned to [[Plymouth]]. The ''Mayflower'' departed alone to complete the crossing to [[Cape Cod]]. Dartmouth's sister city is [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts]].\n\n[[File:Butterwalk hdr.jpg|thumb|left|The Butterwalk]]\n\nThe town contains many medieval and [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] streetscapes and is a patchwork of narrow lanes and stone stairways. A significant number of the historic buildings are listed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Good Stuff IT Services |url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/england/devon/dartmouth |title=Listed Buildings in Dartmouth, Devon, England |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date= |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> One of the most obvious is the Butterwalk, built 1635 to 1640. Its intricately carved wooden fascia is supported on granite columns. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] held court in the Butterwalk whilst sheltering from storms in 1671 in a room which now forms part of [[Dartmouth Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The King's Room at Dartmouth Museum|url=http://dartmouthmuseum.org/collections/kings-room/index.html|publisher=Dartmouth Museum|accessdate=29 July 2011|quote=It was in this magnificent room that King Charles II was entertained in July 1671, when storms forced him to seek shelter in Dartmouth.}}</ref> Much of the interior survives from that time.\n\nThe Royal Castle Hotel was built in 1639 on the then new quay. The building was re-fronted in the 19th century, and as the new frontage is itself listed, it is not possible to see the original which lies beneath. A claimant for the oldest building is a former merchant's house in Higher Street, now a [[Good Beer Guide]] listed public house called ''the Cherub'', built circa 1380. Agincourt House (next to the Lower Ferry) is also 14th century.\n\nDartmouth sent numerous ships to join the English fleet that attacked the [[Spanish Armada]], including the Roebuck, Crescent and Hart.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.dartmouth-history.org.uk/content_images/upload/Russells_Dartmouth.pdf |title=Ancient Dartmouth |last=Russell |first=Percy |publisher= |date=September 1946 |accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> The Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario, the Spanish Armada's \"payship\" commanded by Admiral Pedro de Vald\u00e9s, was captured along with all its crew by [[Sir Francis Drake]]. It was reportedly anchored in the River Dart for more than a year and the crew were used as labourers on the nearby [[Greenway Estate]] which was the home of [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]] and his half-brother [[Sir Walter Raleigh]]. Greenway was later the home of [[Dame Agatha Christie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/DestinationsUK/Dartmouth.htm |title=Dartmouth, Devon - Destinations UK |publisher=Historic-uk.com |date=4 June 1944 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe remains of a fort at Gallants Bower just outside the town are some of the best preserved remains of a [[English Civil War|Civil War]] defensive structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gallants Bower|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/little-dartmouth/features/gallants-bower|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref> The fort was built by [[Royalist]] occupation forces in c. 1643 to the south east of the town, with a similar fort at Mount Ridley on the opposite slopes of what is now [[Kingswear]]. The [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] [[General Fairfax]] attacked from the north in 1646, taking the town and forcing the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] to surrender, after which Gallants Bower was demolished.\n\n===19th century===\nBefore 1671, what is now the town centre was almost entirely tidal mud flats. The New Road (now Victoria Road) was constructed across the bed of the (silted up) Mill Pool and up the Ford valley after 1823. Spithead was extended in 1864 when the [[Dartmouth and Torbay Railway]] arrived in [[Kingswear]] and a pontoon was constructed, linked to Spithead by a bridge. The railway directors and others formed the Dartmouth Harbour Commissioners. \nAt this time, all the roads in those parts of Dartmouth which were not land reclamations were very narrow. In 1864-7 Higher Street was widened into Southtown and linked to Lower Street, which was also widened, with the northern part renamed Fairfax Place. Some of the buildings were rebuilt further back with decorative frontages.\nIn 1881 the Harbour Commissioners produced a scheme for an embankment or esplanade from near the Lower Ferry to Hardness, across the remains of The Pool, to provide an attraction for tourists and further mooring space. It was completed in 1885 after much disagreement between the Borough, the Commissioners and the Railway (now the [[Great Western Railway]]). A new station was also built at this time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Ray|title=Dartmouth and its Neighbours|date=1990|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester|isbn=0 85033 697 X|pages=166 - 168}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Potts|first1=C.R.|title=The Newton Abbot to Kingswear Railway|date=2014|publisher=Oakwood Press|location=Usk|isbn=978 0 85361 733 4|pages=92, 335 - 339|edition=2}}</ref> The building of the Embankment left a section of river isolated between Spithead and the New Ground, which is known as The Boatfloat, and is linked to the river by a bridge for small vessels under the road.\n\nThe coming of steam ships led to Dartmouth being used as a [[bunkering]] port, with coal being brought in by ship or train. Coal lumpers were members of gangs, who competed to bunker the ships by racing to be first to a ship. This led to the men living as close as possible to the river, and their tenements became grossly overcrowded, with the families living in slum conditions, with up to 15 families in one house, one family to a room.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Ray|title=Dartmouth and its Neighbours|date=1990|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester|isbn=0 85033 697 X|pages=178-180}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] opened the [[Dart Lifeboat Station]] at the Sand Quay in 1878, but it was closed in 1896. In all this time only one effective rescue was made by the [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]].<ref name=Lifeboats>{{cite book |last= Leach |first= Nicholas |title= Devon's Lifeboat Heritage |year= 2009 |publisher= Twelveheads Press |location= Chacewater |isbn= 978-0-906294-72-7 |pages= 19\u201320 }}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe area to the north of Ridge Hill was a shallow and muddy bay (\"Coombe Mud\") with a narrow road running along the shore linking with the Higher Ferry. The mud was a dumping ground for vessels, including a submarine. The reclamation was completed in 1937 by the extension of the Embankment and the reclamation of the mud behind it, which became Coronation Park. [[File:smithstreet.jpg|thumb|right|Smith Street circa 1930]]\n\nIn the 1920s, aided by government grants, the council made a start on clearing the slums. This was aided by the decline in the use of coal as a fuel for ships. The slums were demolished, and the inhabitants were rehoused in new houses in the Britannia Avenue area, to the west of the old village or hamlet of Townstal. The process was interrupted by the second world war, but was resumed with the construction of many [[Prefabricated home|prefab]]s, and later more houses. Community facilities were minimal at first, but a central area was reserved for a church, which was used by the [[Baptists]] and opened in 1954<ref>{{cite web|title=Dartmouth Baptist Church|url=http://www.dartmouthbaptistchurch.co.uk/about-us/|accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref>, together with a speedway track. The latter was later used for housing, but a new community centre was opened nearby<ref>{{cite web|title=Townstal Community Hall| url=https://www.bythedart.co.uk/living-in-dartmouth/local-services/townstal-community-hall/|website=By the Dart|accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref>, together with a leisure centre, an outdoor swimming pool, and later an indoor pool<ref>{{cite web|title=Dartmouth and District Indoor Pool|url=http://www.dartmouthpool.co.uk/|accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref>, and supermarkets. There are also light industrial units.\n\nIn the latter part of the [[World War II|Second World War]] the town was a base for American forces and one of the departure points for [[Utah Beach]] in the [[Normandy landings|D Day landings]]. Slipways and harbour improvements were also constructed. Much of the surrounding countryside and notably Slapton Sands was closed to the public while it was used by US troops for practise landings and manoeuvres. \nBetween 1985 and 1990 the Embankment was widened by 6 metres and raised to prevent flooding at spring tides. A tidal lock gate was provided at the Boatfloat bridge, which could be closed at such times.\n\n===21st century===\n[[Dart Lifeboat Station]] was reopened in 2007, the first time that a lifeboat had been stationed in the town since 1896. It has initially been kept in a temporary building in Coronation Park.<ref name=Lifeboats/>\n\nIn 2010, a fire seriously damaged numerous historical properties in Fairfax Place and Higher Street. Several were Tudor and Grade I or Grade II [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/devon/10189310.stm | publisher= BBC News | title= Dartmouth's Tudor buildings destroyed by chip shop fire | date= 29 May 2010 | accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe town was an ancient [[borough]], incorporated by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], known formally as '''Clifton-Dartmouth-Hardness''', and consisting of the three parishes of ''St Petrox'', ''St Saviour'' and ''[[Townstal]]'', and incorporating the hamlets of Ford, Old Mill and Norton.<ref>[http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Dartmouth/Dartmouth1830.html ''Pigot & Co.'s Devonshire'' (1830)] GenUKi</ref> It was reformed under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].

As a result of shortage of capital, a deviation from the original scheme to run the line from Churston to Greenway with a steamer service to Dartmouth was proposed, but defeated in Parliament.

The location of his house in Lower Street is marked with a plaque, although the building itself was demolished (and elements incorporated into local architect Thomas Lidstone's house on Ridge Hill) in the 19th century to make way for a new road which was named after Newcomen. An 18th-century working [[Newcomen steam engine]] is on display in the town.\n\nThe town was home to the [[civil engineer]] and [[calculating prodigy]] [[George Parker Bidder]] (1806\u20131878), who is notable for his work on railways over much of the world, as well as the docks of the [[East End]] in the [[Port of London]]. Bidder served on the town council, and his expertise was instrumental in draining the area which is now the centre of the town. He also undertook pioneering work with [[Samuel Lake]] on steam trawling whilst living in the town. Bidder died at his home at Paradise Point near [[Warfleet Creek]] and is buried at nearby Stoke Fleming.\n\n[[Flora Thompson]] lived in Above Town between 1928 and 1940, writing ''[[Lark Rise]]'' and ''[[Over to Candleford]]'' during this time. The books were later combined into a single volume with ''[[Candleford Green]]'' and published as ''[[Lark Rise to Candleford]]''. She is buried at Longcross Cemetery.\n\nThe stage and film actress [[Rachel Kempson]] (1910\u20132003) was born in Dartmouth. She was the wife of Sir [[Michael Redgrave]] and mother of [[Vanessa Redgrave|Vanessa]], [[Lynn Redgrave|Lynn]] and [[Corin Redgrave|Corin]], and published her autobiography, ''Life Among the Redgraves'', in 1988.\n\n[[Gordon Onslow Ford]] (1912\u20132003), a leading British [[surrealist]] painter, attended the Royal Naval College.\n\n[[Sir John Harvey Jones]] (1924-2008), Businessman and television presenter, attended the Royal Naval College.\n\n[[Christopher Robin Milne]], son of [[A.

The dodo's closest [[genetic distance|genetic relative]] was the also extinct [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the two forming the [[taxonomic rank|subfamily]] [[Raphinae]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] of [[Columbidae|pigeons and doves]]. The closest [[extant taxon|living]] relative of the dodo is the [[Nicobar pigeon]]. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of [[R\u00e9union]], but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the [[R\u00e9union ibis]] and paintings of white dodos.\n\n[[Subfossil]] remains show the dodo was about {{convert|1|m|ftin}} tall and may have weighed {{convert|10.6|-|17.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. Because these vary considerably, and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, its exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and little is known about its behaviour. Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy, it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem. It has been depicted with brownish-grey [[plumage]], yellow feet, a tuft of tail feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used [[gizzard stone]]s to help [[digestion|digest]] its food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main [[habitat]] is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius.\n\nThe first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and [[invasive species]], while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately noticed, and some considered it to be a mythical creature. In the 19th century, research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century. Among these is a dried head, the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today. Since then, a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius, mostly from the [[Mare aux Songes]] swamp. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire [[species]]. The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', and it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a [[Bird extinction|symbol of extinction]] and [[obsolescence]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Copenhagen dodo.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Skull and lower jaw of a dodo in a box|Skull in the [[Zoological Museum of Copenhagen]], examination of which led to the dodo being classified as a pigeon in 1842]]\nThe dodo was variously declared a small [[ostrich]], a [[Rallidae|rail]], an [[albatross]], or a [[vulture]], by early scientists.{{sfn|Hume|Cheke|McOran-Campbell|2009}} In 1842, Danish zoologist [[Johannes Theodor Reinhardt]] proposed that dodos were ground [[columbidae|pigeons]], based on studies of a dodo skull he had discovered in the collection of the [[Natural History Museum of Denmark]].{{sfn|Reinhardt|1842\u20131843}} This view was met with ridicule, but was later supported by English naturalists [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] and [[Alexander Gordon Melville]] in their 1848 [[monograph]] ''The Dodo and Its Kindred'', which attempted to separate myth from reality.{{sfn|Baker|Bayliss|2002}} After [[dissection|dissecting]] the [[embalming|preserved]] head and foot of the specimen at the [[Oxford University Museum]] and comparing it with the few remains then available of the extinct [[Rodrigues solitaire]] (''Pezophaps solitaria'') they concluded that the two were closely related. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones, otherwise known only in pigeons.{{sfn|Strickland|Melville|1848|pp=4\u2013112}}\n[[File:Dodo head.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the Oxford head made before it was dissected in 1848]]\nStrickland and Melville established that the dodo was [[anatomy|anatomically]] similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short [[keratinous]] portion of the [[beak]], with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high in relation to the beak, and the [[beak#Nares|nostril]] was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] pigeons than of other birds, both in their [[bird anatomy#Scales|scales]] and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small [[clutch (eggs)|clutches]], and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the [[vomer]] and [[septum]] of the nostrils, and it shared details in the [[mandible]], the [[zygomatic bone]], the [[palate]], and the [[hallux]]. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion to the rest of the [[cranium]].{{sfn|Strickland|Melville|1848|pp=4\u2013112}}\n\nThroughout the 19th century, several species were classified as [[conspecificity|congeneric]] with the dodo, including the Rodrigues solitaire and the [[R\u00e9union solitaire]], as ''Didus solitarius'' and ''Raphus solitarius'', respectively (''Didus'' and ''Raphus'' being names for the dodo genus used by different authors of the time). An atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire, led [[Abraham Dee Bartlett]] to name a new species, ''Didus nazarenus'', in 1852.{{sfn|Newton|1865}} Based on solitaire remains, it is now a synonym of that species.{{sfn|Lydekker|1891|p=128}} Crude drawings of the [[red rail]] of [[Mauritius]] were also misinterpreted as dodo species; ''Didus broeckii'' and ''Didus herberti''.{{sfn|Milne-Edwards|1869}}\n\nFor many years the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire were placed in a [[family (biology)|family]] of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved.

Nevertheless, some sources still state that the word ''dodo'' derives from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''doudo'' (currently ''doido''), meaning \"fool\" or \"crazy\".

The upper bill was nearly twice as long as the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated along the length of the beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the [[frontal bone]] formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The [[sclerotic rings]] inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single [[Fenestra (anatomy)|fenestra]] (opening), as in other pigeons.<ref name=\"Morphology 2016\"/>\n\nThe dodo had about nineteen presynsacral vertebrae (those of the neck and [[thorax]], including three fused into a [[notarium]]), sixteen [[synsacral]] vertebrae (those of the [[lumbar region]] and [[sacrum]]), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a [[pygostyle]]. The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the [[sternum]] through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small in relation to the body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly [[pneumatic]], broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the [[pectoral girdle]], shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The [[carpometacarpus]] of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.<ref name=\"Morphology 2016\"/>\n\nMany of the skeletal features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons have been attributed to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] region and the small wings were [[neoteny|paedomorphic]], meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and [[pelvic]] limbs were [[peramorphic]], meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded [[skull roof]], and smaller [[orbits]]. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists.{{sfn|Livezey|1993}}\n\n=== Contemporary descriptions ===\n[[File:Saftleven dodo.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a dodo head from the chest up|upright|Painting of a dodo head by [[Cornelis Saftleven]] from 1638, the last known original depiction]]\nMost contemporary descriptions of the dodo are found in [[ship's logs]] and journals of the Dutch East India Company vessels that docked in Mauritius when the [[Dutch Empire]] ruled the island. These records were used as guides for future voyages.{{sfn|Hume|2012}} Few contemporary accounts are reliable, as many seem to be based on earlier accounts, and none were written by scientists.{{sfn|Hume|2006}} One of the earliest accounts, from van Warwijck's 1598 journal, describes the bird as follows:\n{{quotation |Blue parrots are very numerous there, as well as other birds; among which are a kind, conspicuous for their size, larger than our swans, with huge heads only half covered with skin as if clothed with a hood. These birds lack wings, in the place of which 3 or 4 blackish feathers protrude. The tail consists of a few soft incurved feathers, which are ash coloured. These we used to call 'Walghvogel', for the reason that the longer and oftener they were cooked, the less soft and more insipid eating they became. Nevertheless their belly and breast were of a pleasant flavour and easily masticated.{{sfn|Rothschild|1907|p=172}}}}\nOne of the most detailed descriptions is by Sir Thomas Herbert in ''A Relation of Some Yeares Travaille into Afrique and the Greater Asia'' from 1634:\n{{quotation|First here only and in Dygarrois [Rodrigues] is generated the Dodo, which for shape and rareness may antagonize the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] of Arabia: her body is round and fat, few weigh less than fifty pound.

Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.{{sfn|Hume|Steel|2013}}\n[[File:Gelderland1601-1603 Mauritius de Nassauw 1601.jpg|thumb|alt=Old map showing a Mauritian bay, with a D indicating where dodos were found|1601 map of a bay on Mauritius; the small D on the far right side marks where dodos were found]]\nThe preferred habitat of the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions suggest that it inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius.

Its feeding habits must have been versatile, since captive specimens were probably given a wide range of food on the long sea journeys.{{sfn|Cheke|Hume|2008|pp=37\u201338}} Oudemans suggested that as Mauritius has marked dry and wet seasons, the dodo probably fattened itself on ripe fruits at the end of the wet season to survive the dry season, when food was scarce; contemporary reports describe the bird's \"greedy\" appetite. [[France Staub]] suggested that they mainly fed on [[palm (plant)|palm]] fruits, and he attempted to correlate the fat-cycle of the dodo with the fruiting regime of the palms.{{sfn|Staub|1996}}\n\nSkeletal elements of the upper jaw appear to have been [[rhynchokinetic]] (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as [[frugivorous]] (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic [[premaxillae]] help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears to have been able to withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food.<ref name=\"Morphology 2016\"/> In 2016, the first 3D [[endocast]] was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large [[olfactory bulb]].

The English writer Sir [[Hamon L'Estrange]] witnessed a live bird in London and described it as follows:\n{{quotation |About 1638, as I walked London streets, I saw the picture of a strange looking fowle hung out upon a clothe and myselfe with one or two more in company went in to see it.

The keeper called it a Dodo, and in the ende of a chymney in the chamber there lay a heape of large pebble stones, whereof hee gave it many in our sight, some as big as nutmegs, and the keeper told us that she eats them (conducing to digestion), and though I remember not how far the keeper was questioned therein, yet I am confident that afterwards she cast them all again.{{sfn|Fuller|2002|p=69}}}}\nIt is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide [[crop milk]]. Contemporary depictions show a large crop, which was probably used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk.

There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. [[Stanley Temple]] hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation, and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract. He claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly [[coextinct]] because of the disappearance of the dodo.{{sfn|Temple|1977}} Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being [[abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] during digestion.{{sfn|Hill|1941}} Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated, or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' [[tortoise]]s, [[fruit bat]]s or the broad-billed parrot.{{sfn|Herhey|2004}} According to Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in the [[ecology]] of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while rare, has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence discrediting Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.{{sfn|Witmer|Cheke|1991}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and ''Cylindraspis'' tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots.

The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred [[moulted]] after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed at the end of July, in time for the next breeding season.

[[Philip Burnard Ayres]] found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian [[Bishop]] [[Vincent Ryan (bishop)|Vincent Ryan]] to spread word that he should be informed if any dodo bones were found.{{sfn|Hume|Cheke|McOran-Campbell|2009}} In 1865, George Clark, the government [[schoolmaster]] at [[Mah\u00e9bourg]], finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph.{{sfn|Hume|2006}} In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to ''[[The Ibis]]'', an ornithology journal: he had sent his [[coolies]] to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils.{{sfn|Clark|1866}} The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of [[moa]] remains in [[New Zealand]] marshes.{{sfn|Hume|2005}} Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.{{sfn|Meijer|Gill|de Louw|van den Hoek Ostende|2012|pp=177\u2013184}}\n\nClark's reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird. Sir Richard Owen and [[Alfred Newton]] both wanted to be first to describe the [[post-cranial]] anatomy of the dodo, and Owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for Newton, which led to rivalry between the two. Owen described the bones in ''Memoir on the Dodo'' in October 1866, but erroneously based his reconstruction on the ''Edwards's Dodo'' painting by Savery, making it too squat and obese. In 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance, making it more upright. Newton moved his focus to the R\u00e9union solitaire instead. The remaining bones not sold to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums.{{sfn|Hume|Cheke|McOran-Campbell|2009}} In 1889, Th\u00e9odor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the \"historical souvenirs\" of Mauritius and find more dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes.

The confusion began when [[Willem Ysbrandtsz. Bontekoe|Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe]], who visited R\u00e9union around 1619, mentioned fat, flightless birds that he referred to as \"Dod-eersen\" in his journal, though without mentioning their colouration. When the journal was published in 1646, it was accompanied by an engraving of a dodo from Savery's \"Crocker Art Gallery sketch\".{{sfn|Cheke|Hume|2008|p=30}} A white, stocky, and flightless bird was first mentioned as part of the R\u00e9union fauna by Chief Officer J. Tatton in 1625. Sporadic mentions were subsequently made by [[Sieur Dubois]] and other contemporary writers.{{sfn|Rothschild|1907|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nBaron [[Edmond de S\u00e9lys Longchamps]] coined the name ''Raphus solitarius'' for these birds in 1848, as he believed the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between the paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic.{{sfn|Rothschild|1919}} Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.{{sfn|Cheke|Hume|2008|pp=30\u201331}}\n[[File:White dodo.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a white dodo with yellow wings|[[Pieter Holsteyn]]'s painting of a white dodo, mid-1600s]]\nThe Pieter Withoos painting, which was discovered first, appears to be based on an earlier painting by Pieter Holsteyn, three versions of which are known to have existed. According to Hume, Cheke, and Valledor de Lozoya, it appears that all depictions of white dodos were based on Roelant Savery's painting ''Landscape with Orpheus and the animals'', or on copies of it. The painting has generally been dated to 1611, though a post-1614, or even post-1626, date has also been proposed. The painting shows a whitish specimen and was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in Prague; a ''walghvogel'' described as having a \"dirty off-white colouring\" was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II]], to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607\u20131611). Savery's several later images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen another specimen. Cheke and Hume believe the painted specimen was white, owing to [[albinism]].{{sfn|Hume|Cheke|2004}}<ref name=\"early depiction\"/> Valledor de Lozoya has instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply artistic license.{{sfn|de Lozoya|2003}}\n\nIn 1987, scientists described fossils of a recently extinct species of [[ibis]] from R\u00e9union with a relatively short beak, ''Borbonibis latipes'', before a connection to the solitaire reports had been made.{{sfn|Mourer-Chauvir\u00e9|Moutou|1987}} Cheke suggested to one of the authors, Francois Moutou, that the fossils may have been of the R\u00e9union solitaire, and this suggestion was published in 1995. The ibis was reassigned to the genus ''[[Threskiornis]]'', now combined with the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''{{lang|la|solitarius}}'' from the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''R. solitarius''.{{sfn|Mourer-Chauvir\u00e9|Bour|Ribes|1995}} Birds of this genus are also white and black with slender beaks, fitting the old descriptions of the R\u00e9union solitaire.

It is valued for its timber.\n\nThe ''Sideroxylon grandiflorum'' fruit is analogous to the [[peach]]. They are both termed [[drupes]] because both have a hard [[endocarp]], or pit, surrounding the seed, with the endocarp naturally splitting along a fracture line during germination.\n[[File:DodoTree-Naturalis-PeterMaas2009.jpg|248px|thumb|left|Preserved seeds.]]\nIn 1973, it was thought that this species was dying out. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. The true age could not be determined because tambalacoque has no [[growth ring]]s. [[Stanley Temple]] hypothesized that the [[dodo]], which became extinct in the 17th century, ate tambalacoque fruits, and only by passing through the digestive tract of the dodo could the seeds germinate. Temple (1977) force-fed seventeen tambalacoque fruits to [[wild turkey]]s. Seven of the fruits were crushed by the bird's gizzard. The remaining ten were either regurgitated or passed with the bird's feces. Temple planted the remaining ten fruits and three germinated. Temple did not try to germinate any seeds from control fruits not fed to turkeys so the effect of feeding fruits to turkeys was unclear. Reports made on tambalacoque seed germination by Hill (1941) and King (1946) found the seeds germinated without abrading.\n\nTemple's hypothesis that the tree required the dodo has been contested. Others have suggested the decline of the tree was exaggerated, or that other extinct animals may also have been distributing the seeds, such as [[tortoise]]s, [[fruit bat]]s or the [[broad-billed parrot]]. Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] [[ecology]], claim that while a rare tree, it has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers a few hundred, not 13.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The difference in numbers is because young trees are not distinct in appearance and may easily be confused with similar species. The decline of the tree may possibly be due to [[introduced species|introduction]] of [[domestic pig]]s and [[crab-eating macaque]]s and competition with introduced plants. Catling (2001) in a summary cites Owadally and Temple (1979), and Witmer (1991). Hershey (2004) reviewed the flaws in Temple's dodo-tambalacoque hypothesis.\n\nIn 2004, [[Botanical Society of America|Botanical Society of America's]] Plant Science Bulletin disputed Dr. Temple's research as flawed which published evidence as to why the dodo's extinction did not directly cause the increasing disappearance of young trees including suggestion that [[tortoises]] would have been more likely to disperse the seeds than dodo hence discrediting Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.botany.org/PlantScienceBulletin/psb-2004-50-4.php#Dodo |title=The Widespread Misconception that the Tambalacoque or ''Calvaria'' Tree Absolutely Required the Dodo Bird for its Seeds to Germinate |first=David R |last=Herhey |journal=Plant Science Bulletin |year=2004 |volume=50 |issue=4 |issn=0032-0919}}</ref>\n\nThis dodo tree is highly valued for its wood in Mauritius, which has led some foresters to scrape the pits by hand to make them sprout and grow.<ref name=\"EllisNTB\">{{cite book| last = Ellis| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Ellis (biologist) | title = No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species| publisher = Harper Perennial | year = 2004| location = New York| pages = 164| isbn =0-06-055804-0 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Sideroxylon majus]]'', a species native to [[R\u00e9union]], that has been confounded with ''Sideroxylon grandiflorum'' (particularly under its synonym ''Calvaria major'')\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* '''Catling''', P.

The symbol most often used for density is ''\u03c1'' (the lower case Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]]), although the Latin letter ''D'' can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/fluden.html | title =Gas Density Glenn research Center | author =''[[National Aeronautic and Space Administration|The National Aeronautic and Atmospheric Administration's]]'' ''[[Glenn Research Center]]'' | publisher =grc.nasa.gov | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130414132531/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/fluden.html | archivedate =April 14, 2013 | df =mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\rho = \\frac{m}{V}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is the density, ''m'' is the mass, and ''V'' is the volume.

[[Osmium]] and [[iridium]] are the densest known elements at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] but certain chemical compounds may be denser.\n\nTo simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the [[dimensionless]] quantity \"[[relative density]]\" or \"[[specific gravity]]\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\nThe density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in [[convection]] of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material.\n\nThe reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its [[specific volume]], a term sometimes used in [[thermodynamics]]. Density is an [[intensive property]] in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, [[Archimedes]] was given the task of determining whether [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero]]'s [[goldsmith]] was embezzling [[gold]] during the manufacture of a golden [[wreath]] dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another, cheaper [[alloy]].<ref>[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/archimedes.htm Archimedes, A Gold Thief and Buoyancy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827113533/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/archimedes.htm |date=August 27, 2007 }} \u2013 by Larry \"Harris\" Taylor, Ph.D.</ref> Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled, Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the [[Displacement (fluid)|displacement]] of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, \"Eureka! Eureka!\" (\u0395\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1! Greek \"I have found it\"). As a result, the term \"[[Eureka (word)|eureka]]\" entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.\n\nThe story first appeared in written form in [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura|books of architecture]]'', two centuries after it supposedly took place.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html Vitruvius on Architecture, Book IX], paragraphs 9\u201312, translated into English and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html in the original Latin].</ref> Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.305.5688.1219e|title=EXHIBIT: The First Eureka Moment|year=2004|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5688|pages=1219e }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=5F1935E9-E7F2-99DF-3F1D1235AF1D2CD1 Fact or Fiction?: Archimedes Coined the Term \"Eureka!\" in the Bath], ''Scientific American'', December 2006.</ref>\n\nFrom the equation for density (''\u03c1'' = ''m''/''V''), mass density has units of mass divided by volume. As there are many units of mass and volume covering many different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use. The [[SI]] unit of [[kilogram]] per [[cubic metre]] (kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and the [[cgs]] unit of [[gram]] per [[cubic centimetre]] (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) are probably the most commonly used units for density. One g/cm<sup>3</sup> is equal to one thousand kg/m<sup>3</sup>.  One cubic centimetre (abbreviation cc) is equal to one millilitre. In industry, other larger or smaller units of mass and or volume are often more practical and [[US customary units]] may be used. See below for a list of some of the most common units of density.\n\n== Measurement of density ==\nA number of techniques as well as standards exist for the measurement of density of materials. Such techniques include the use of a hydrometer (a buoyancy method for liquids), Hydrostatic balance (a buoyancy method for liquids and solids), immersed body method (a buoyancy method for liquids), pycnometer (liquids and solids), air comparison pycnometer (solids), oscillating densitometer (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-109-density-of-liquids-and-solids_9789264123298-en|title=OECD Test Guideline 109 on measurement of density|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> However, each individual method or technique measures different types of density (e.g. bulk density, skeletal density, etc.), and therefore it is necessary to have an understanding of the type of density  being measured as well as the type of material in question. \n\n===Homogeneous materials===\nThe density at all points of a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] object equals its total [[mass]] divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a [[weighing scale|scale or balance]]; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a [[hydrometer]], a [[dasymeter]] or a [[Coriolis flow meter]] may be used, respectively. Similarly, [[hydrostatic weighing]] uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.\n\n===Heterogeneous materials===\nIf the body is not homogeneous, then its density varies between different regions of the object. In that case the density around any given location is determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location. In the limit of an infinitesimal volume the density of an inhomogeneous object at a point becomes: <math>\\rho(\\vec{r}) = dm/dV</math>, where <math>dV</math> is an elementary volume at position <math>r</math>. The mass of the body then can be expressed as\n\n:<math>\n m = \\int_V \\rho(\\vec{r})\\,dV.\n</math>\n\n=== Non-compact materials ===\nIn practice, bulk materials such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. Many materials exist in nature as flakes, pellets, or granules.\n\nVoids are regions which contain something other than the considered material.  Commonly the void is air, but it could also be vacuum,  liquid, solid, or a different gas or gaseous mixture.\n\nThe bulk volume of a material\u2014inclusive of the void fraction\u2014is often obtained by a simple measurement (e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup) or geometrically from known dimensions.\n\nMass divided by ''bulk'' volume determines [[bulk density]].  This is not the same thing as volumetric mass density.\n\nTo determine volumetric mass density, one must first discount the volume of the void fraction. Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning.  For the [[close-packing of equal spheres]] the non-void fraction can be at most about 74%.  It can also be determined empirically.  Some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a ''variable'' void fraction which depends on how the material is agitated or poured. It might be loose or compact, with more or less air space depending on handling.\n\nIn practice, the void fraction is not necessarily air, or even gaseous.  In the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantageous for measurement as the void fraction for sand saturated in water\u2014once any air bubbles are thoroughly driven out\u2014is potentially more consistent than dry sand measured with an air void.\n\nIn the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample. If the material is under pressure (commonly ambient air pressure at the earth's surface) the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was conducted. In the case of dry sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyancy effect is commonly neglected (less than one part in one thousand).\n\nMass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction, if the difference in density of the two voids materials is reliably known.\n\n== Changes of density ==\n{{Main article|Compressibility|Thermal expansivity}}\n\nIn general, density can be changed by changing either the [[pressure]] or the [[temperature]]. Increasing the pressure always increases the density of a material. Increasing the temperature generally decreases the density, but there are notable exceptions to this generalization. For example, the density of [[water]] increases between its melting point at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and 4&nbsp;\u00b0C; similar behavior is observed in [[silicon]] at low temperatures.\n\nThe effect of pressure and temperature on the densities of liquids and solids is small. The [[compressibility]] for a typical liquid or solid is 10<sup>\u22126</sup>&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]]<sup>\u22121</sup> (1&nbsp;bar = 0.1&nbsp;MPa) and a typical [[thermal expansivity]] is 10<sup>\u22125</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]<sup>\u22121</sup>. This roughly translates into needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure to reduce the volume of a substance by one percent. (Although the pressures needed may be around a thousand times smaller for sandy soil and some clays.) A one percent expansion of volume typically requires a temperature increase on the order of thousands of degrees [[Celsius]].\n\nIn contrast, the density of gases is strongly affected by pressure. The density of an [[ideal gas]] is\n:<math>\\rho = \\frac {MP}{RT},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|M}} is the [[molar mass]], {{math|P}} is the pressure, {{math|R}} is the [[Gas constant|universal gas constant]], and {{math|T}} is the [[absolute temperature]]. This means that the density of an ideal gas can be doubled by doubling the pressure, or by halving the absolute temperature.\n\nIn the case of volumic thermal expansion at constant pressure and small intervals of temperature the temperature dependence of density is :\n:<math>\\rho = \\frac{\\rho_{T_0}}{1 + \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta T}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho_{T_0}</math> is the density at a reference temperature, <math>\\alpha</math> is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material at temperatures close to <math>T_0</math>.\n\n== Density of solutions ==\nThe density of a [[solution]] is the sum of [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass (massic) concentrations]] of the components of that solution.\n\nMass (massic) concentration of each given component \u03c1<sub>i</sub> in a solution sums to density of the solution.\n:<math>\\rho = \\sum_i \\varrho_i \\,</math>\n\nExpressed as a function of the densities of pure components of the mixture and their [[volume concentration|volume participation]], it allows the determination of [[excess molar quantity|excess molar volumes]]:\n:<math>\\rho = \\sum_i \\rho_i \\frac{V_i}{V}\\, = \\sum_i \\rho_i \\varphi_i = \\sum_i \\rho_i \\frac{V_i}{\\sum_i V_i + \\sum_i {V^E}_i}</math>\nprovided that there is no interaction between the components.\n\nKnowing the relation between excess volumes and activity coefficients of the  components, one can determine the activity coefficients.\n:<math>\\overline{V^E}_i = RT \\frac{\\partial\\ln\\gamma_i}{\\partial P}</math>\n\n== Densities ==\n\n=== Various materials ===\n{{Further|Orders of magnitude (density)}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Densities of various materials covering a range of values\n|-\n!

Liquid [[water]] has a density of about 1&nbsp;kg/dm<sup>3</sup>, making any of these SI units numerically convenient to use as most [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s have densities between 0.1 and 20&nbsp;kg/dm<sup>3</sup>.\n* kilogram per cubic decimetre (kg/dm<sup>3</sup>)\n* gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)\n** 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> = 1000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>\n* megagram (metric ton) per cubic metre (Mg/m<sup>3</sup>)\n\nIn [[US customary units]] density can be stated in:\n* [[Avoirdupois ounce]] per [[cubic inch]] (1 g/cc \u2248 0.578036672 oz/cu&nbsp;in)\n* [[Avoirdupois ounce]] per [[fluid ounce]] (1 g/cc \u2248 1.04317556 oz/fl. oz = 1.04317556 lbs/pint)\n* [[Pound (mass)|Avoirdupois pound]] per cubic inch (1 g/cc \u2248 0.036127292 lb/cu&nbsp;in)\n* pound per [[cubic foot]] (1 g/cc \u2248 62.427961 lb/cu&nbsp;ft)\n* pound per [[cubic yard]] (1 g/cc \u2248 1685.5549 lb/cu&nbsp;yd)\n* pound per [[US liquid gallon]] (1 g/cc \u2248 8.34540445 lb/gal)\n* pound per US [[bushel]] (1 g/cc \u2248 77.6888513 lb/bu)\n* [[slug (unit)|slug]] per cubic foot\n\n[[Imperial units]] differing from the above (as the Imperial gallon and bushel differ from the US units) in practice are rarely used, though found in older documents. The Imperial gallon was based on the concept that an [[Imperial fluid ounce]] of water would have a mass of one Avoirdupois ounce, and indeed 1&nbsp;g/cc \u2248 1.00224129 ounces per Imperial fluid ounce = 10.0224129 pounds per Imperial gallon.

Barry's honors include the [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary]] (1988) and the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism]] (2005).\n\n==Early life and education==\nBarry was born in [[Armonk, New York]], where his father, David,<!-- his father did not have the same middle name, and therefore it's not a Jr/Sr thing. This is as per Barry's assistant} --> was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. He was educated at Wampus Elementary School, Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School (both in Armonk), and [[Pleasantville High School (New York)|Pleasantville High School]], where he was elected \"Class Clown\" in 1965.

He covered local government and civic events and was promoted to City Editor after about two years. He also started writing a weekly humor column for the paper and began to develop his unique style. He remained at the newspaper through 1974. He then worked briefly as a [[copy editor]] at the [[Associated Press]]'s Philadelphia bureau before joining Burger Associates, a consulting firm.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Dave Barry | title=2008ish bio | url=http://www.davebarry.com/dave-barry-other-bio.php | access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt Burger, he taught effective writing to business people.

Weingarten hired Barry as a humor columnist in 1983. Barry's column was syndicated nationally. Barry won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary]] in 1988 for \"his consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulitzer Prize Winners 1988|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1988|accessdate=May 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBarry's first novel, ''[[Big Trouble (novel)|Big Trouble]]'', was published in 1999. The book was adapted into a [[Big Trouble (2002 film)|motion picture]] directed by [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] and starring [[Tim Allen]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Patrick Warburton]], with a cameo by Barry (deleted in [[post-production]]). The movie was originally due for release in September 2001 but was postponed following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] because the story involved smuggling a [[nuclear weapon]] onto an airplane. The film was released in April 2002.\n\nIn response to a column in which Barry mocked the cities of [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]], and [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota]], for calling themselves the \"Grand Cities\", Grand Forks named a sewage pumping station after Barry in January 2002. Barry traveled to Grand Forks for the dedication ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|title=Idling in the Grand Cities|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-03-17/features/0203170453_1_cars-with-remote-control-devices-grand-forks-international-airport-grand-cities|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nArticles written by Barry have appeared in publications such as ''Boating'', ''Home Office Computing'', and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', in addition to the ''[[Chicken Soup for the Soul]]'' inspirational book series. Two of his articles have been included in the ''Best American Sportswriting'' series. One of his columns was used as the introduction to the book ''Pirattitude!: So You Wanna Be a Pirate? Here's How!'' ({{ISBN|0-451-21649-0}}), a follow-up to Barry's role in publicizing [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]]. His books have frequently appeared on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]].\n\nOn October 31, 2004, Barry announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence of at least a year from his weekly column in order to spend more time with his family. In December 2005, Barry said in an interview with ''Editor and Publisher'' that he would not resume his weekly column, although he would continue such features as his yearly gift guide, his year-in-review feature, and his blog, as well as an occasional article or column.\n\nIn 2005, Barry won the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arizona State University|title=Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication|url=https://cronkite.asu.edu/about/walter-cronkite-and-asu/walter-cronkite-award|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, September 22, 2013, the opening night of the 15th annual Fall for the Book festival in Fairfax, Virginia, Barry was awarded the event's highest honor, the Fairfax Prize,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Barry Named 2013 Fairfax Prize Winner |url=http://fallforthebook.org/2013/05/31/dave-barry-named-2013-fairfax-prize-winner/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000858/http://fallforthebook.org/2013/05/31/dave-barry-named-2013-fairfax-prize-winner/ |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fallforthebook.org/book-prizes/the-fairfax-prize/|title=Fairfax PRize|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120123705/http://fallforthebook.org/book-prizes/the-fairfax-prize|archivedate=January 20, 2014|df=mdy}}</ref> honoring outstanding literary achievement, presented by the [[Fairfax Library Foundation]].\n\n==''Dave's World'' television series==\nFrom 1993 to 1997, [[CBS]] broadcast the sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'' based on the books ''[[Dave Barry Turns 40]]'' and ''Dave Barry's Greatest Hits''.

The band's road tour resulted in the book ''Mid-Life Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America with Three Chords and an Attitude''.

He substantially extended and revised the work of [[Carl Meinhof]], his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof's theories only implicitly. Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern [[Africa]]n linguistics. \n\nHe carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile. His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the [[Gbe languages]], [[Nuer language|Nuer]], [[Kpelle language|Kpelle]], [[Shilluk language|Shilluk]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], and [[Guang language|Guang]]. \n\nWestermann's comparative work, begun in 1911, initially brought together much of today's [[Niger\u2013Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan]] language phyla under the name [[Sudanic languages]]. His most important later publication ''Die westlichen Sudansprachen'' [[1927a]] divided these into East and West [[Sudanic languages]] and laid the basis for what would become Niger\u2013Congo. In this book and a series of associated articles between 1925 and 1928, Westermann both identified a large number of roots that form the basis of our understanding of Niger\u2013Congo and set out the evidence for the coherence of many of the families that constitute it. Much of the classification of African languages associated with Joseph Greenberg actually derives from the work of Westermann.\n \nIn 1927 Westermann published a ''[[Africa Alphabet|Practical Orthography]] of [[African Languages]]'' which became later known as the ''Westermann script''. Subsequently he published the influential and oft-reprinted ''[[Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages]]'' in collaboration with [[Ida C. Ward]] (1933).\n\nHe was born in [[Baden, Lower Saxony|Baden]] near [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and also died there.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Westermann, Diedrich H.

The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} (''diakritik\u00f3s'', \"distinguishing\"), from {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9}} (''diakr\u012b\u0301n\u014d'', \"to distinguish\"). ''Diacritic'' is primarily an [[adjective]], though sometimes used as a [[noun]], whereas ''diacritical'' is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the [[acute accent|acute]] (&thinsp;\u00b4&thinsp;) and [[grave accent|grave]] (&thinsp;`&thinsp;), are often called ''accents''. Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.\n\nThe main use of diacritical marks in the [[Latin script]] is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Examples are the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaereses]] in the borrowed French words ''na\u00efve'' and ''No\u00ebl'', which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding [[vowel]]; the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced, as in ''[[sak\u00e9]]'' and poetic ''breath\u00e8d''; and the [[cedilla]] under the \"c\" in the borrowed French word ''fa\u00e7ade'', which shows it is pronounced {{IPAslink|s}} rather than {{IPAslink|k}}. In other [[Latin-script alphabet]]s, they may distinguish between [[homonym]]s, such as the [[French language|French]] ''l\u00e0'' (\"there\") versus ''la'' (\"the\") that are both pronounced {{IPA|/la/}}. In [[Gaelic type]], a dot over a consonant indicates [[lenition]] of the consonant in question.\n\nIn other [[Alphabet#Types|alphabetic systems]], diacritical marks may perform other functions. [[Vowel pointing (disambiguation)|Vowel pointing]] systems, namely the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[Arabic diacritics|harakat]] (&thinsp;{{lang|ar|\u0640\u0650&nbsp;,\u0640\u064f&nbsp;,\u0640\u064e,}}&nbsp;etc.) and the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[niqqud]] (&thinsp;{{lang|he|\u05b7\u25cc, \u05b6\u25cc, \u05b4\u25cc, \u05b9\u25cc, \u05bb\u25cc,}} etc.) systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The [[Indic script|Indic]] [[virama]] (&thinsp;\u094d etc.) and the Arabic [[suk\u016bn]] (&thinsp;{{lang|ar|\u0640\u0652\u0640|rtl=yes}}&thinsp;) mark the absence of vowels. [[Cantillation mark]]s indicate [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Other uses include the [[Early Cyrillic]] [[titlo]] stroke (&thinsp;\u25cc\u0483&thinsp;) and the Hebrew [[gershayim]] (&thinsp;{{lang|he|\u05f4|rtl=yes}}&thinsp;), which, respectively, mark [[abbreviation]]s or [[acronym]]s, and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as [[Greek numerals|numerals]]. In the [[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]] official romanization system for Chinese, diacritics are used to mark the [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|tones]] of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.\n\nIn [[orthography]] and [[collation]], a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter\u2013diacritic combination. This varies from language to language, and may vary from case to case within a language.

In the [[Wali language (Gur)|Wali language]] of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects ''\u2019Bulengee'' and ''\u2019Dolimi''. Because of [[vowel harmony]], all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In [[abugida]] scripts, like those used to write [[Hindi]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.\n\nThe tittle (dot) on the letter ''i'' of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish ''i'' from the [[Minim (palaeography)|minim]]s (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence ''ii'' (as in ''ingen\u00ed\u00ed)'', then spread to ''i'' adjacent to ''m, n, u'', and finally to all lowercase ''i'''s. The ''j'', originally a variant of ''i'', inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of [[Roman type]] it was reduced to the round dot we have today.<ref>[[OED]]</ref>\n\n==Diacritics specific to non-Latin alphabets==\n\n===Arabic===\n{{further information|Arabic diacritics}}\n* (\u0626 \u0624 \u0625 \u0623 and stand alone \u0621) ''[[hamza]]'': indicates a [[glottal stop]].\n* (\u0640\u0640\u064b\u0640\u0640\u064d\u0640\u0640\u064c\u0640) ''tanw\u012bn'' (\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0646) symbols: Serve a grammatical role in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

''Grammatica Syriaca''.</ref>\n\n==Non-alphabetic scripts==\nSome non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.\n* Non-pure [[abjad]]s (such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script) and [[abugida]]s use diacritics for denoting [[vowel]]s. Hebrew and Arabic also indicate consonant doubling and change with diacritics; Hebrew and [[Devanagari]] use them for foreign sounds. Devanagari and related abugidas also use a diacritical mark called a ''[[virama]]'' to mark the absence of a vowel. In addition, Devanagari uses the moon-dot ''[[chandrabindu]]'' (''' \u0901 ''').\n* [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]] use several types of diacritics, including the diacritics with alphabetic properties known as Medials and Finals. Although long vowels originally were indicated with a negative line through the Syllabic glyphs, making the glyph appear broken, in the modern forms, a [[dot above]] is used to indicate vowel length. In some of the styles, a [[ring above]] indicates a long vowel with a [j] off-glide. Another diacritic, the \"inner ring\" is placed at the glyph's head to modify [p] to [f] and [t] to [\u03b8]. Medials such as the \"w-dot\" placed next to the Syllabics glyph indicates a [w] being placed between the syllable onset consonant and the nucleus vowel. Finals indicate the syllable coda consonant; some of the syllable coda consonants in word medial positions, such as with the \"h-tick\", indicate the fortification of the consonant in the syllable following it. \n* The Japanese ''[[hiragana]]'' and ''[[katakana]]'' [[syllabary|syllabaries]] use the [[dakuten|''dakuten'' (\u25cc\u309b) and ''handakuten'' (\u25cc\u309c)]] (in Japanese: \u6fc1\u70b9 and \u534a\u6fc1\u70b9) symbols, also known as ''nigori'' (\u6fc1 \"muddying\") or ''ten-ten'' (\u70b9\u3005 \"dot dot\") and ''maru'' (\u4e38 \"circle\"), to indicate [[voiced consonant]]s or other phonetic changes.\n* [[Emoticons]] are commonly created with diacritic symbols, especially [[Japan]]ese emoticons on popular [[imageboards]].\n\n==Alphabetization or collation==\n{{main article|Collation}}\nDifferent languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in [[alphabet]]ical order. French treats letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries.\n\nThe [[Scandinavian languages]], by contrast, treat the characters with diacritics ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00e5'' as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after ''z''. Usually ''\u00e4'' is sorted as equal to ''\u00e6'' (ash) and ''\u00f6'' is sorted as equal to ''\u00f8'' (o-slash). Also, ''aa'', when used as an alternative spelling to ''\u00e5'', is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that ''\u00fc'' is frequently sorted as ''y''.\n\nLanguages that treat accented letters as variants of the underlying letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. ''schon'' and then ''sch\u00f6n'', or ''fallen'' and then ''f\u00e4llen''). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed ''e''; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).\n\nIn Spanish, the grapheme ''\u00f1'' is considered a new letter different from ''n'' and collated between ''n'' and ''o'', as it denotes a different sound from that of a plain ''n''. But the accented vowels ''\u00e1'', ''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa'' are not separated from the unaccented vowels ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] within the word or denotes a distinction between [[homonym]]s, and does not modify the sound of a letter.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of the collating orders in various languages, see [[Collating sequence]].\n\n==Generation with computers==\nModern computer technology was developed mostly in English-speaking countries, so data formats, keyboard layouts, etc. were developed with a bias favoring English, a language with an alphabet without diacritical marks. This has led some to theorize that the marks and accents may be made obsolete to facilitate the worldwide exchange of data.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Efforts have been made to create [[internationalized domain names]] that further extend the English alphabet (e.g., \"pok\u00e9mon.com\").\n\nDepending on the [[keyboard layout]], which differs amongst countries, it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Some have their own keys; some are created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark followed by the letter to place it on. Such a key is sometimes referred to as a [[dead key]], as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.\n\nIn modern Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, the keyboard layouts ''US International'' and ''UK International'' feature [[dead key]]s that allow one to type Latin letters with the acute, grave, circumflex, di\u00e6resis, tilde, and cedilla found in Western European languages (specifically, those combinations found in the [[ISO Latin-1]] character set) directly: ''\u00a8+e'' gives ''\u00eb'', ''~+o'' gives ''\u00f5'', etc. On [[Apple Macintosh]] computers, there are keyboard shortcuts for the most common diacritics; Option-''e'' followed by a vowel places an acute accent, Option-''u'' followed by a vowel gives an umlaut, option-''c'' gives a cedilla, etc. Diacritics can be [[Compose key|compose]]d in most [[X Window System]] keyboard layouts, as well as other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, using additional software.\n\nOn computers, the availability of [[code page]]s determines whether one can use certain diacritics.  [[Unicode]] solves this problem by assigning every known character its own code; if this code is known, most modern computer systems provide a [[Unicode#Input methods|method to input it]]. With Unicode, it is also possible to [[Combining diacritical mark|combine diacritical marks]] with most characters.\n\n==Languages with letters containing diacritics==\nThe following languages have letters that contain diacritics that are considered independent letters distinct from those without diacritics.\n\n; Baltic\n:* [[Latvian alphabet|Latvian]] has the following letters: ''[[\u0101]], [[\u0113]], [[\u012b]], [[\u016b]], [[\u010d]], [[\u0123]], [[\u0137]], [[\u013c]], [[\u0146]], [[\u0161]], [[\u017e]]''\n:* [[Lithuanian alphabet|Lithuanian]]. In general usage, where letters appear with the caron (''\u010d, \u0161'' and ''\u017e''), they are considered as separate letters from ''c, s'' or ''z'' and collated separately; letters with the [[ogonek]] (''[[\u0105]], [[\u0119]], [[\u012f]]'' and ''[[\u0173]]''), the [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''[[\u016b]]'') and the [[anunaasika|superdot]] (''[[\u0117]]'') are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique collation order.\n;Celtic\n:* [[Welsh language|Welsh]] uses the [[circumflex]], [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], acute, and [[grave accent|grave]] on its seven vowels ''a, e, i, o, u, w, y'' (\u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4, \u00fb, \u0175, \u0177, \u00e4, \u00eb, \u00ef, \u00f6, \u00fc, \u1e85, \u00ff, \u00e0, \u00e8, \u00ec, \u00f2, \u00f9, \u1e81, \u1ef3, \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa, \u1e83, \u00fd)\n:* Following spelling reforms since the 1970s, [[Scottish Gaelic]] uses graves only, which can be used on any vowel (''[[\u00e0]], [[\u00e8]], [[\u00ec]], [[\u00f2]], [[\u00f9]]''). Formerly acute accents could be used on ''\u00e1, \u00f3'' and ''\u00e9'', which were used to indicate a specific vowel quality. With the elimination of these accents, the new orthography relies on the reader having prior knowledge of pronunciation of a given word.\n:* [[Manx language|Manx]] uses the single diacritic [[\u00e7]] combined with h to give the digraph {{angle bracket|\u00e7h}} (pronounced {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}) to mark the distinction between it and the digraph {{angle bracket|ch}} (pronounced {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/x/}}). Other diacritics used in Manx included \u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ef, etc. to mark the distinction between two similarly spelled words but with slightly differing pronunciation.\n:* [[Irish language|Irish]] uses only acute accents to mark long vowels, following the 1948 spelling reform.\n:* [[Breton orthography|Breton]] does not have a single orthography (spelling system), but uses diacritics for a number of purposes. The diaresis is used to mark that two vowels are pronounced separately and not as a diphthong/digraph. The circumflex is used to mark long vowels, but usually only when the vowel length is not predictable by phonology. Nasalization of vowels may be marked with a tilde, or following the vowel with the letter <\u00f1>. The plural suffix -o\u00f9 is used as a unified spelling to represent a suffix with a number of pronunciations in different dialects, and to distinguish this suffix from the digraph <ou> which is pronounced as /u:/. An apostrophe is used in the to distinguish c'h, pronounced /x/ as the digraph <ch> is used in other Celtic languages, from the French-influenced digraph ch, pronounced /\u0283/.\n; [[Cyrillic alphabets]]\n:* [[Belarusian alphabet|Belarusian]] has a letter ''[[Short U (Cyrillic)|\u045e]]''.\n:* Belarusian, [[Bulgarian language#Alphabet|Bulgarian]], Russian and Ukrainian have the letter ''[[Short I|\u0439]]''.\n:* Belarusian and [[Russian alphabet|Russian]] have the letter ''[[Yo (Cyrillic)|\u0451]]''. In Russian, this letter is usually replaced by ''[[Ye (Cyrillic)|\u0435]]'', although it has a different pronunciation. The use of ''\u0435'' instead of ''\u0451'' does not affect the pronunciation. ''\u0401'' is always used in children's books and in dictionaries. A [[minimal pair]] is \u0432\u0441\u0435 (''vs'e'', \"everybody\" pl.) and \u0432\u0441\u0451 (''vs'o'', \"everything\" n. sg.). In Belarusian the replacement by ''\u0435'' is a mistake, in Russian, it is permissible to use either ''\u0435'' or ''\u0451'' for ''\u0451'' but the former is more common in everyday writing (as opposed to instructional or juvenile writing).\n:* The [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[Ukrainian alphabet]] has the letters ''[[\u0491]]'', ''[[\u0439]]'' and ''[[\u0457]]''. Ukrainian [[Latynka]] has many more.\n:* [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] has the letters ''[[kje|\u045c]]'' and ''[[gje|\u0453]]''.\n;* In Bulgarian and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] the possessive pronoun \u045d (''\u00ec'', \"her\") is spelled with a grave accent in order to distinguish it from the conjunction \u0438 (''i'', \"and\").\n:* The acute accent \"&nbsp;\u0301\" above any vowel in Cyrillic alphabets is used in dictionaries, books for children and foreign learners to indicate the word stress, it also can be used for disambiguation of similarly spelled words with different lexical stresses.\n; Finno-Ugric\n:* [[Estonian alphabet|Estonian]] has a distinct letter ''[[\u00f5]]'', which contains a tilde. Estonian \"dotted vowels\" ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'', ''\u00fc'' are similar to German, but these are also distinct letters, not like German umlauted letters. All four have their own place in the alphabet, between ''w'' and ''x''. Carons in ''\u0161'' or ''\u017e'' appear only in foreign proper names and [[loanwords]]. Also these are distinct letters, placed in the alphabet between ''s'' and ''t''.\n:* [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]] uses dotted vowels (''\u00e4'' and ''\u00f6''). As in Swedish and Estonian, these are regarded as individual letters, rather than vowel + umlaut combinations (as happens in German). It also uses the characters ''\u00e5'', ''\u0161'' and ''\u017e'' in foreign names and loanwords. In the Finnish and Swedish alphabets, ''\u00e5'', ''\u00e4'' and ''\u00f6'' collate as separate letters after ''z'', the others as variants of their base letter.\n:* [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian]] uses the umlaut, the acute and double acute accent (unique to Hungarian): ''\u00f6 \u00fc'', ''\u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa'' and ''\u0151 \u0171''. The acute accent indicates the long form of a vowel (in case of ''i/\u00ed'', ''o/\u00f3'', ''u/\u00fa'') while the double acute performs the same function for ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc''. The acute accent can also indicate a different sound (more open, like in case of ''a/\u00e1'', ''e/\u00e9''). Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the [[Hungarian alphabet]], but members of the pairs ''a/\u00e1, e/\u00e9, i/\u00ed, o/\u00f3, \u00f6/[[\u0151]], u/\u00fa'' and ''\u00fc/[[\u0171]]'' are collated in dictionaries as the same letter.\n:* [[Livonian language|Livonian]] has the following letters: ''\u0101, \u00e4, [[\u01df]], [[\u1e11]], \u0113, \u012b, \u013c, \u0146, \u014d, [[\u022f]], [[\u0231]], [[\u00f5]], [[\u022d]], \u0157, \u0161, \u021b, \u016b, \u017e''.\n; Germanic\n:* [[Faroese alphabet|Faroese]] uses [[acute accent|acute]]s and other special letters. All are considered separate letters and have their own place in the alphabet: ''[[\u00e1]]'', ''[[\u00ed]]'', ''[[\u00f3]]'', ''[[\u00fa]]'', ''[[\u00fd]]'' and ''[[\u00f8]]''.\n:* [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic]] uses acutes and other special letters. All are considered separate letters, and have their own place in the alphabet: ''[[\u00e1]]'', ''[[\u00e9]]'', ''[[\u00ed]]'', ''[[\u00f3]]'', ''[[\u00fa]]'', ''[[\u00fd]]'', and ''[[\u00f6]]''.\n:* [[Danish alphabet|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] use additional characters like the o-slash ''[[\u00f8]]'' and the a-overring ''[[\u00e5]]''. These letters come after ''z'' and ''[[\u00e6]]'' in the order ''\u00f8, \u00e5''. Historically, the ''\u00e5'' has developed from a ligature by writing a small superscript ''a'' over a lowercase ''a''; if an ''\u00e5'' character is unavailable, some Scandinavian languages allow the substitution of a doubled ''a''. The Scandinavian languages collate these letters after z, but have different [[collation]] standards.\n:* [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] uses a-diaeresis (''[[\u00e4]]'') and o-diaeresis (''[[\u00f6]]'') in the place of ash (''\u00e6'') and slashed o (''[[\u00f8]]'') in addition to the a-overring (''\u00e5''). Historically, the diaeresis for the Swedish letters ''\u00e4'' and ''\u00f6'', like the [[German umlaut]], developed from a small Gothic ''e'' written above the letters. These letters are collated after ''z'', in the order ''\u00e5, \u00e4, \u00f6''.\n; Romance\n:* In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]], the character ''[[\u00f1]]'' is a letter and collated between ''n'' and ''o''.\n:* [[Asturian language|Asturian]] uses [[\u1e36]] ([[lower case]] [[\u1e37]]), and [[Voiceless glottal fricative|\u1e24]] ([[lower case]] [[Voiceless glottal fricative|\u1e25]])<ref>Academia de la Llingua Asturiana, ''Gram\u00e1tica de la Llingua Asturiana'', tercera edici\u00f3n, Oviedo: Academia de la Llingua Asturiana (2001), {{ISBN|84-8168-310-8}}, {{cite web|url=http://www.academiadelallingua.com/diccionariu/gramatica_llingua.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525120027/http://www.academiadelallingua.com/diccionariu/gramatica_llingua.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }} (page 16, section 1.2)</ref>\n:* [[Leonese language|Leonese]]: could use ''[[\u00f1]]'' or ''[[List of Latin digraphs#N|nn]]''.\n:* [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian]] uses a [[breve]] on the letter ''a'' (''[[\u0103]]'') to indicate the sound [[schwa]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, as well as a circumflex over the letters ''a'' (''[[\u00e2]]'') and ''i'' (''[[\u00ee]]'') for the sound {{IPA|/\u0268/}}. Romanian also writes a [[comma]] below the letters ''s'' (''[[\u0219]]'') and ''t'' (''[[\u021b]]'') to represent the sounds {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}, respectively. These characters are collated after their non-diacritic equivalent.\n:* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] uses the circumflex and the acute accent to indicate stress and vowel height whenever it is in an unpredictable location within the word. They can also function as a way to distinguish a few homographs. The former is used over the stressed high vowels ''\u00e2'' /\u0250/, ''\u00ea'' /e/, and ''\u00f4'' /o/ in contrast with the latter, which is used over stressed low vowels ''\u00e1'' /a/, ''\u00e9'' /\u025b/, and ''\u00f3'' /\u0254/ and in ''\u00ed'' /i/ and ''\u00fa'' /u/. The tilde is used to indicate nasalization, such as in ''\u00e3'' /\u0250\u0303/ and ''\u00f5'' /\u00f5/. The grave accent is used to indicate [[crasis]], when two identical vowels are merged into one, thus affecting neither vowel quality nor stress, it is only used over a (''\u00e0''). The [[cedilha]] is used under c (''\u00e7'') when it is pronounced as /s/ instead of /k/ before ''a'', ''o'' and ''u''. In total, [[\u00e1]], [[\u00e2]], [[\u00e3]], [[\u00e0]], [[\u00e7]], [[\u00e9]], [[\u00ea]], [[\u00ed]], [[\u00f3]], [[\u00f4]], [[\u00f5]] and [[\u00fa]] can be found in Portuguese orthography. None of these are considered separate letters.\n; Slavic\n:* [[Bosnian alphabet|Bosnian]], [[Croatian alphabet|Croatian]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] Latin alphabet have the symbols ''[[\u010d]]'', ''[[\u0107]]'', ''[[\u0111]]'', ''[[\u0161]]'' and ''[[\u017e]]'', which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. They also have one [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] including a diacritic, ''[[d\u017e]]'', which is also alphabetized independently, and follows ''[[d]]'' and precedes ''[[\u0111]]'' in the alphabetical order. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has no diacritics, instead it has a grapheme ([[glyph]]) for every letter of its Latin counterpart (including Latin letters with diacritics and the digraphs d\u017e, ''[[Lje|lj]]'' and ''[[Nj (digraph)|nj]]'').\n:* The [[Czech alphabet]] uses the acute (\u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa \u00fd), caron ([[\u010d]] [[\u010f]] [[\u011b]] [[\u0148]] [[\u0159]] [[\u0161]] [[\u0165]] [[\u017e]]), and for one letter ([[\u016f]]) the ring. (Note that in \u010f and \u0165 the caron is modified to look lither like an apostrophe.)\n:* [[Polish alphabet|Polish]] has the following letters: ''[[\u0105]] [[\u0107]] [[\u0119]] [[\u0142]] [[\u0144]] [[\u00f3]] [[\u015b]] [[\u017a]] [[\u017c]]''. These are considered to be separate letters: each of them is placed in the alphabet immediately after its Latin counterpart (e.g. ''\u0105'' between ''a'' and ''b''), ''\u017a'' and ''\u017c'' are placed after ''z'' in that order.\n:* The [[Slovak alphabet]] uses the acute (\u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa \u00fd [[\u013a]] [[\u0155]]), caron (\u010d \u010f \u013e \u0148 \u0161 \u0165 \u017e), umlaut (\u00e4) and circumflex accent (\u00f4).<ref name=\"PSP2000\">http://www.juls.savba.sk/ediela/psp2000/psp.pdf page 12, section I.2</ref>\n:* The basic [[Slovenian alphabet]] has the symbols ''[[\u010d]]'', ''[[\u0161]]'', and ''[[\u017e]]'', which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. Letters with a [[caron]] are placed right after the letters as written without the diacritic. The letter ''\u0111'' may be used in non-transliterated foreign words, particularly names, and is placed after ''\u010d'' and before ''d''.\n; Turkic\n:* [[Azerbaijani alphabet|Azerbaijani]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[\u00c7]], [[\u011e]], [[Dotted and dotless I|I, \u0130]], [[\u00d6]], [[\u015e]] and [[\u00dc]].\n:* [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[\u00c7]], [[\u011e]], I, \u0130, [[\u00d6]], [[\u015e]] and [[\u00dc]].  Unlike Standard Turkish (but like [[Cypriot Turkish]]), Crimean Tatar also has the letter [[\u00d1]].\n:* [[Gagauz alphabet|Gagauz]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[\u00c7]], [[\u011e]], [[Dotted and dotless I|I, \u0130]], [[\u00d6]] and [[\u00dc]].  Unlike Turkish, Gagauz also has the letters [[\u00c4]], [[\u00ca]] [[\u0218]] and [[\u021a]].  [[\u0218]] and [[\u021a]] are derived from the [[Romanian alphabet]] for the same sounds. Sometime the Turkish [[\u015e]] may be used instead of [[\u0218]].\n:* [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] uses a ''G'' with a breve (''[[\u011e]]''), two letters with an umlaut (''[[\u00d6]]'' and ''[[\u00dc]]'', representing two rounded front vowels), two letters with a cedilla (''[[\u00c7]]'' and ''[[S-cedilla|\u015e]]'', representing the affricate {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and the fricative {{IPA|/\u0283/}}), and also possesses a dotted capital ''\u0130'' (and a dotless lowercase ''\u0131'' representing a high unrounded back vowel). In Turkish each of these are separate letters, rather than versions of other letters, where dotted capital ''\u0130'' and lower case ''i'' are the same letter, as are dotless capital ''I'' and lowercase ''\u0131''. [[Typeface|Typographically]], ''\u00c7'' and ''\u015e'' are often rendered with a subdot, as in ''\u1e62''; when a hook is used, it tends to have more a comma shape than the usual cedilla.  The new Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, and Gagauz alphabets are based on the Turkish alphabet and its same diacriticized letters, with some additions.\n:* [[Turkmen alphabet|Turkmen]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[\u00c7]], [[\u00d6]], [[\u015e]] and [[\u00dc]]. In addition, Turkmen uses A with diaeresis (''[[\u00c4]]'') to represent {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, N with caron (''[[\u0147]]'') to represent the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, Y with acute (''[[\u00dd]]'') to represent the [[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|/j/}}, and Z with caron (''[[\u017d]]'') to represent {{IPA|/\u0292/}}.\n\n; Other\n:* [[Albanian alphabet|Albanian]] has two special letters [[\u00c7]] and [[\u0401]] upper and lowercase. They are placed next to the most similar letters in the alphabet, c and e correspondingly.\n:* [[Esperanto alphabet|Esperanto]] has the symbols ''[[\u016d]]'', ''[[\u0109]], [[\u011d]], [[\u0125]], [[\u0135]]'' and ''[[\u015d]]'', which are included in the alphabet, and considered separate letters.\n:* Hawaiian uses the kahak\u00f4 ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]) over vowels, although there is some disagreement over considering them as individual letters. The kahak\u00f4 over a vowel can completely change the meaning of a word that is spelled the same but without the kahak\u00f4.\n:* [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]] uses the symbols [[\u00c7]], [[\u00ca]], [[\u00ce]], [[\u015e]] and [[\u00db]] with other 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.\n:* [[Lakota language|Lakota]] alphabet uses the [[caron]] for the letters ''\u010d'', ''\u021f'', ''\u01e7'', ''\u0161'', and ''\u017e''. It also uses the [[acute accent]] for stressed vowels \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa, \u00e1\u014b, \u00ed\u014b, \u00fa\u014b.\n:* [[Maltese alphabet|Maltese]] uses a C, G, and Z with a dot over them (\u010a, \u0120, \u017b), and also has an H with an extra horizontal bar. For uppercase H, the extra bar is written slightly above the usual bar. For lowercase H, the extra bar is written crossing the vertical, like a ''t'', and not touching the lower part ([[\u0126]], \u0127). The above characters are considered separate letters. The letter 'c' without a dot has fallen out of use due to redundancy. '\u010a' is pronounced like the English 'ch' and 'k' is used as a hard c as in 'cat'. '\u017b' is pronounced just like the English 'Z' as in 'Zebra', while 'Z' is used to make the sound of 'ts' in English (like 'tsunami' or 'maths'). '\u0120' is used as a soft 'G' like in 'geometry', while the 'G' sounds like a hard 'G' like in 'log'.  The digraph 'g\u0127' (called ''g\u0127ajn'' after the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] letter name ''\u02bbayn'' for \u063a) is considered separate, and sometimes ordered after 'g', whilst in other volumes it is placed between 'n' and 'o' (the Latin letter 'o' originally evolved from the shape of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] ''\u02bbayin'', which was traditionally collated after Phoenician ''n\u016bn'').\n:* The [[Syriac Latin alphabet]] uses the altered letters of ''[[\u0100]], [[\u010c]], [[\u1e0e]], [[\u0112]], [[\u00cb]], [[\u0120]], [[\u1e24]], [[\u014c]], [[\u0160]], [[\u1e62]], [[\u1e6c]], [[\u016a]], [[\u017d]]'' alongside the 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.<ref>S.P.

Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from [[French language|French]] and, increasingly, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include ''caf\u00e9'', ''r\u00e9sum\u00e9'' or ''resum\u00e9'' (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb ''resume''), ''[[souffl\u00e9]]'', and ''na\u00efvet\u00e9'' (see ''[[English terms with diacritical marks]]''). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers) one may see examples such as ''\u00e9lite'', ''m\u00eal\u00e9e'' and ''r\u00f4le.''\n\nEnglish speakers and writers once used the diaeresis more often than now in words such as ''co\u00f6peration'' (from Fr. ''coop\u00e9ration''), ''zo\u00f6logy'' (from Grk. ''zoologia''), and ''see\u00ebr'' (now more commonly ''see-er ''or simply'' seer''), but this practice has become far less common. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine is a major publication that continues to use the diaresis in place of a dash for clarity and economy of space.<ref>{{cite web|last=Norris|first=Mary|title=The Curse of the Diaeresis|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/04/the-curse-of-the-diaeresis.html|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nA few English words, out of context, can only be distinguished from others by a diacritic or modified letter, including [[wikt:expos\u00e9#English|expos\u00e9]], [[lam\u00e9 (disambiguation)|lam\u00e9]], [[mat\u00e9 (disambiguation)|mat\u00e9]], [[\u00f6re]], [[\u00f8re]], [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]], and [[ros\u00e9]]'.  The same is true of ''[[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]],'' alternately ''{{sic|hide=y|res|um\u00e9,}}'' but nevertheless it is regularly spelled ''resume''.  In a few words, diacritics that did not exist in the original have been added for disambiguation, as in [[mat\u00e9]] (from Sp. and Port. ''mate''), [[sak\u00e9]] (the standard Romanization of the Japanese has no accent mark), and [[Mal\u00e9]] (from Dhivehi \u0789\u07a7\u078d\u07ac), to clearly distinguish them from the English words \"mate\", \"sake\", and \"male\".\n\nThe acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (''r\u00e9bel'' vs. ''reb\u00e9l'') or nonstandard for metrical reasons (''cal\u00e9ndar''), the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (''warn\u00e8d,'' ''parl\u00ecament'').\n\nIn certain personal names such as ''[[Ren\u00e9e]]'' and ''[[Zoe (name)|Zo\u00eb]]'', often two spellings exist, and the preference will be known only to those close to the person themselves. Even when the name of a person is spelled with a diacritic, like Charlotte Bront\u00eb, this may be dropped in English language articles and even official documents such as [[passport]]s either due to carelessness, the typist not knowing how to enter letters with diacritical marks, or for technical reasons - [[California]], for example, does not allow names with diacritics as the computer system cannot process such characters. They also appear in some worldwide company names and/or trademarks such as [[Nestl\u00e9]] or [[Citro\u00ebn]].\n\n===Other languages===\nThe following languages have letter-diacritic combinations that are not considered independent letters.\n* [[Afrikaans]] uses a diaeresis to mark vowels that are pronounced separately and not as one would expect where they occur together, for example ''voel'' (to feel) as opposed to ''vo\u00ebl'' (bird). The circumflex is used in ''\u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4'' and ''\u00fb'' generally to indicate long [[Close-mid vowel|close-mid]], as opposed to [[Open-mid vowel|open-mid]] vowels, for example in the words ''w\u00eareld'' (world) and ''m\u00f4re'' (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis in the same way as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example ''Dit is j\u00f3\u00fa boek'' (It is '''your''' book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example ''appel'' (apple) and ''app\u00e8l'' (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings ''\u00f2f... \u00f2f'' (either... or) and ''n\u00f2g... n\u00f2g'' (neither... nor) to distinguish them from ''of'' (or) and ''nog'' (again, still).\n* [[Aymara language|Aymara]] uses a diacritical horn over ''p, q, t, k, ch''.\n* [[Catalan alphabet|Catalan]] has the following composite characters: ''\u00e0, \u00e7, \u00e9, \u00e8, \u00ed, \u00ef, \u00f3, \u00f2, \u00fa, \u00fc, l\u00b7l''. The acute and the grave indicate [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[vowel height]], the cedilla marks the result of a historical [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], the diaeresis indicates either a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], or that the letter ''u'' is pronounced when the graphemes ''g\u00fc, q\u00fc'' are followed by ''e'' or ''i'', the [[interpunct]] (\u00b7) distinguishes the different values of ''ll/l\u00b7l''.\n* Some orthographies of [[Cornish language|Cornish]] such as [[Kernowek Standard]] and [[Unified Cornish]] use diacritics, while others such as [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] and the [[Standard Written Form]] do not (or only use them optionally in teaching materials).\n* [[Dutch alphabet|Dutch]] uses the diaeresis. For example, in ''ru\u00efne'' it means that the ''u'' and the ''i'' are separately pronounced in their usual way, and not in the way that the combination ''ui'' is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the ''i''. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (''\u00e9rg koud'' for ''very'' cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (''\u00e9\u00e9n appel'' = one apple, ''een appel'' = an apple; ''v\u00f3\u00f3rkomen'' = to occur, ''voork\u00f3men'' = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords. The \u00e7 also appears in some loanwords.<ref>{{cite book|author=van Geloven, Sander|title=Diakritische tekens in het Nederlands|url=http://hellebaard.nl/publicaties/poster/poster-diakritische-tekens-in-het-nederlands-4-stuks/|location=Utrecht|publisher=Hellebaard|year=2012|language=nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192341/http://hellebaard.nl/publicaties/poster/poster-diakritische-tekens-in-het-nederlands-4-stuks/|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}</ref>\n* [[Faroese alphabet|Faroese]]. Non-Faroese accented letters are not added to the Faroese alphabet. These include ''\u00e9'', ''\u00f6'', ''\u00fc'', ''\u00e5'' and recently also letters like ''\u0161'', ''\u0142'', and ''\u0107''.\n*[[Filipino alphabet|Filipino]] has the following composite characters: ''\u00e1, \u00e0, \u00e2, \u00e9, \u00e8, \u00ea, \u00ed, \u00ec, \u00ee, \u00f3, \u00f2, \u00f4, \u00fa, \u00f9, \u00fb''. The actual use of diacritics for Filipino is, however, uncommon, meant only to distinguish between [[homonym]]s with different stresses and meanings that either occur near each other in a text or to aid the reader in ascertaining its otherwise ambiguous meaning. The letter e\u00f1e is due to the Spanish alphabet and too, is considered a separate letter. The diacritics appears in [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Spanish|loanwords]] and [[Filipino name|names]] if Spanish orthography is observed.\n* [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]]. Carons in ''\u0161'' and ''\u017e'' appear only in foreign proper names and [[loanwords]], but may be substituted with ''sh'' or ''zh'' if and only if it is technically impossible to produce accented letters in the medium. Contrary to Estonian, ''\u0161'' and ''\u017e'' are not considered distinct letters in Finnish.\n* [[French alphabet|French]] uses five diacritics. The grave (''accent grave'') marks the sound /\u025b/ when over an e, as in ''p\u00e8re'' (\"father\") or is used to distinguish words that are otherwise homographs such as ''a''/''\u00e0'' (\"has\"/\"to\") or ''ou''/''o\u00f9'' (\"or\"/\"where\"). The [[acute accent|acute]] (''accent aigu'') is only used in \"\u00e9\", modifying the \"e\" to make the sound /e/, as in ''\u00e9toile'' (\"star\"). The [[circumflex]] (''accent circonflexe'') generally denotes that an S once followed the vowel in Old French or Latin, as in ''f\u00eate'' (\"party\"), the Old French being ''feste'' and the Latin being ''festum''. Whether the circumflex modifies the vowel's pronunciation depends on the dialect and the vowel. The [[cedilla]] (''c\u00e9dille'') indicates that a normally hard \"c\" (before the vowels \"a\", \"o\", and \"u\") is to be pronounced /s/, as in ''\u00e7a'' (\"that\"). The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''tr\u00e9ma'') indicates that two adjacent vowels that would normally be pronounced as one are to be pronounced separately, as in ''No\u00ebl'' (\"Christmas\").\n* [[Galician language|Galician]] vowels can bear an acute (''\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa'') to indicate stress or difference between two otherwise same written words (''\u00e9'', 'is' vs. ''e'', 'and'), but the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''trema'') is only used with ''\u00ef'' and ''\u00fc'' to show two separate vowel sounds in pronunciation. Only in foreign words may Galician use other diacritics such as ''\u00e7'' (common during the Middle Ages), ''\u00ea'', or ''\u00e0''.\n* [[German alphabet|German]] uses the three umlauted characters ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc''. These diacritics indicate vowel changes. For instance, the word ''Ofen'' {{IPA-de|\u02c8o\u02d0f\u0259n|}} \"oven\" has the plural ''\u00d6fen'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u00f8\u02d0f\u0259n]}}. The mark originated as a superscript ''e''; a handwritten blackletter ''e'' resembles two parallel vertical lines, like a diaeresis. Due to this history, \"\u00e4\", \"\u00f6\" and \"\u00fc\" can be written as \"ae\", \"oe\" and \"ue\" respectively, if the umlaut letters are not available.\n* [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] has many various diacritic marks known as ''[[niqqud]]'' that are used above and below script to represent vowels. These must be distinguished from [[cantillation]], which are keys to pronunciation and syntax.\n* The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses diacritic symbols and characters to indicate phonetic features or secondary articulations.\n* [[Irish alphabet|Irish]] uses the acute to indicate that a vowel is [[vowel length|long]]: ''\u00e1'', ''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa''. It is known as ''s\u00edneadh fada'' \"long sign\" or simply ''fada'' \"long\" in Irish. In the older [[Gaelic type]], [[overdot]]s are used to indicate [[lenition]] of a consonant: ''\u1e03'', ''\u010b'', ''\u1e0b'', ''\u1e1f'', ''\u0121'', ''\u1e41'', ''\u1e57'', ''\u1e61'', ''\u1e6b''.\n* [[Italian alphabet|Italian]] mainly has the [[acute accent|acute]] and the [[grave accent|grave]] (''\u00e0'', ''\u00e8''/''\u00e9'', ''\u00ec'', ''\u00f2''/''\u00f3'', ''\u00f9''), typically to indicate a stressed syllable that would not be stressed under the normal rules of pronunciation but sometimes also to distinguish between words that are otherwise spelled the same way (e.g. \"e\", and; \"\u00e8\", is). Despite its rare use, Italian orthography allows the circumflex (\u00ee) too, in two cases: it can be found in old literary context (roughly up to 19th century) to signal a [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] (f\u00earo\u2192fecero, they did), or in modern Italian to signal the contraction of \u2033-ii\u2033 due to the plural ending -i whereas the root ends with another -i; e.g., [[Grammatical number|s.]] demonio, [[plural|p.]] demonii\u2192demon\u00ee; in this case the circumflex also signals that the word intended is not demoni, plural of \"demone\" by shifting the accent (dem\u00f2n\u00ee, \"devils\"; d\u00e8moni, \"demons\").\n* [[Lithuanian alphabet|Lithuanian]] uses the [[Acute accent|acute]], [[Grave accent|grave]] and [[tilde]] in dictionaries to indicate stress types in the language's [[pitch accent]] system.\n* [[Maltese alphabet|Maltese]] also uses the grave on its vowels to indicate stress at the end of a word with two syllables or more: lowercase letters - \u00e0, \u00e8, \u00ec, \u00f2, \u00f9 | capital letters - \u00c0, \u00c8, \u00cc, \u00d2, \u00d9\n* [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] makes use of macrons to mark long vowels.\n* [[Occitan alphabet|Occitan]] has the following composite characters: ''\u00e1, \u00e0, \u00e7, \u00e9, \u00e8, \u00ed, \u00ef, \u00f3, \u00f2, \u00fa, \u00fc, n\u00b7h, s\u00b7h''. The acute and the grave indicate [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[vowel height]], the cedilla marks the result of a historical [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], the diaeresis indicates either a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], or that the letter ''u'' is pronounced when the graphemes ''g\u00fc, q\u00fc'' are followed by ''e'' or ''i'', and the [[interpunct]] (\u00b7) distinguishes the different values of ''nh/n\u00b7h'' and ''sh/s\u00b7h'' (i.e., that the letters are supposed to be pronounced separately, not combined into \"ny\" and \"sh\").\n* [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]] has the following composite characters: ''\u00e0, \u00e1, \u00e2, \u00e3, \u00e7, \u00e9, \u00ea, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00f4, \u00f5, \u00fa''. The acute and the circumflex indicate stress and vowel height, the grave indicates crasis, the tilde represents nasalization, and the cedilla marks the result of a historical palatalization.\n* Acutes are also used in [[Slavic language]] dictionaries and textbooks to indicate [[lexical stress]], placed over the vowel of the stressed syllable. This can also serve to disambiguate meaning (e.g., in Russian \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0301\u0442\u044c (''pis\u00e1\u0165'') means \"to write\", but \u043f\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c (''p\u00edsa\u0165'') means \"to piss\"), or \"\u0431\u043e\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\" (the biggest part) vs \"\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u0301\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\" (the big part).\n* [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]] uses the acute and the diaeresis. The acute is used on a vowel in a stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to \"break up\" a [[diphthong]] as in ''t\u00edo'' (pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8ti.o]}}, rather than {{IPA|[\u02c8tjo]}} as it would be without the accent). Moreover, the acute can be used to distinguish words that otherwise are spelled alike, such as ''si'' (\"if\") and ''s\u00ed'' (\"yes\"), and also to distinguish interrogative and exclamatory pronouns from homophones with a different grammatical function, such as ''donde/\u00bfd\u00f3nde?'' (\"where\"/\"where?\") or ''como/\u00bfc\u00f3mo?'' (\"as\"/\"how?\"). The acute may also used be used to avoid typographical ambiguity, as in ''1 \u00f3 2'' (\"1 or 2\"; without the acute this might be interpreted as \"1 0 2\".  The diaeresis is used only over ''u'' (''\u00fc'') for it to be pronounced {{IPA|[w]}} in the combinations ''gue'' and ''gui,'' where ''u'' is normally silent, for example ''ambig\u00fcedad.'' In poetry, the diaeresis may be used on ''i'' and ''u'' as a way to force a hiatus. As foreshadowed above, in nasal ''\u00f1'' the [[tilde]] (squiggle) is not considered a diacritic sign at all, but a composite part of a distinct glyph, with its own chapter in the dictionary: a glyph that denotes the 15th letter of the Spanish alphabet.\n* [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] uses the [[acute accent|acute]] to show non-standard stress, for example in {{lang|sv|kaf\u00e9}} (caf\u00e9) and {{lang|sv|resum\u00e9}} (r\u00e9sum\u00e9). This occasionally helps resolve ambiguities, such as ''ide'' (hibernation) versus ''id\u00e9'' (idea). In these words, the acute is not optional. Some proper names use non-standard diacritics, such as [[Carolina Kl\u00fcft]] and [[Sta\u00ebl von Holstein]]. For foreign loanwords the original accents are strongly recommended, unless the word has been infused into the language, in which case they are optional. Hence ''cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche'' but ''ampere''.  Swedish also has the letters ''\u00e5'', ''\u00e4'', and ''\u00f6'', but these are considered distinct letters, not ''a'' and ''o'' with diacritics.\n* [[Tamil alphabet|Tamil]] does not have any diacritics in itself, but uses the [[Arabic numerals]]<!-- Please confirm it is not using Indian or other numerals--> 2, 3 and 4 as diacritics to represent aspirated, voiced, and voiced-aspirated consonants when Tamil script is used to write long passages in [[Sanskrit]].\n* [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] has its [[Thai script#Diacritics|own system of diacritics]] derived from [[Indian numerals]], which denote different [[tone (linguistics)|tones]].\n* [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] uses the acute (''d\u1ea5u s\u1eafc''), the grave (''d\u1ea5u huy\u1ec1n''), the tilde (''d\u1ea5u ng\u00e3''), the underdot (''d\u1ea5u n\u1eb7ng'') and the hoi (''d\u1ea5u h\u1ecfi'') on vowels as [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] indicators.\n* [[Welsh alphabet|Welsh]] uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave on its seven vowels ''a, e, i, o, u, w, y''. The most common is the circumflex (which it calls ''to bach'', meaning \"little roof\", or ''acen grom'' \"crooked accent\", or ''hirnod'' \"long sign\") to denote a long vowel, usually to disambiguate it from a similar word with a short vowel. The rarer grave accent has the opposite effect, shortening vowel sounds that would usually be pronounced long. The acute accent and diaeresis are also occasionally used, to denote stress and vowel separation respectively. The ''w''-circumflex and the ''y''-circumflex are among the most commonly accented characters in Welsh, but unusual in languages generally, and were until recently very hard to obtain in word-processed and HTML documents.\n\n==Transliteration==\nSeveral languages that are not written with the Roman alphabet are [[transliteration|transliterated]], or romanized, using diacritics. Examples:\n* [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has several [[Arabic romanization#Comparison table|romanisation]]s, depending on the type of the application, region, intended audience, country, etc. many of them extensively use diacritics, e.g., some methods use an underdot for rendering [[emphatic consonant]]s (\u1e63, \u1e6d, \u1e0d, \u1e93, \u1e25). The macron is often used to render long vowels. \u0161 is often used for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, \u0121 for {{IPA|/\u0263/}}.\n* [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has several [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]]s that use the umlaut, but only on ''u'' (''\u00fc''). In [[Pinyin#Usage|Hanyu Pinyin]], the four [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] are denoted by the macron (first tone), acute (second tone), caron (third tone) and grave (fourth tone) diacritics. Example: ''\u0101, \u00e1, \u01ce, \u00e0''.\n* Romanized [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[Romaji]]) occasionally uses macrons to mark long vowels. The [[Hepburn romanization]] system uses [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s to mark [[long vowels]], and the [[Kunrei-shiki romanization|Kunrei-shiki]] and [[Nihon-shiki]] systems use a [[circumflex]].\n* [[Sanskrit]], as well as many of its descendants, like [[Hindi]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], uses a lossless [[transliteration|romanization]] system. This includes several letters with diacritical markings, such as the macron (\u0101, \u012b, \u016b), over- and underdots (\u1e5b, \u1e25, \u1e43, \u1e47, \u1e63, \u1e6d, \u1e0d) as well as a few others (\u015b, \u00f1).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Latin-script alphabets]]\n* [[Alt code]]\n* [[:Category:Specific letter-diacritic combinations]]\n* [[Collating sequence]]\n* [[Combining character]]\n* [[Compose key]]\n* [[English terms with diacritical marks]]\n* [[Heavy metal umlaut]]\n* [[ISO/IEC 8859]] 8-bit extended-Latin-alphabet European character encodings\n* [[Latin alphabet]]\n* [[List of Latin letters]]\n* [[List of precomposed Latin characters in Unicode]]\n* [[List of U.S. cities with diacritics]]\n* [[Romanization]]\n* [[Wiktionary:Appendix:English words with diacritics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://urtd.net/projects/cod/ Context of Diacritics | A research project]\n* [http://diacritics.typo.cz/ Diacritics Project]\n* [https://www.unicode.org/ Unicode]\n* [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/dia/diacritics-revised.htm Orthographic diacritics and multilingual computing, by J.

They are usually made from [[hardwood]]s, especially the various [[eucalyptus]] species that are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the region.<ref>Taylor R., Cloake J, and Forner J.

Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Service, Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Environment, Palmerston, NT.</ref> Generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested, though a substantial branch may be used instead. Aboriginal didgeridoo craftsmen hunt for suitably hollow live trees in areas with obvious [[termite]] activity. Termites attack these living eucalyptus trees, removing only the dead heartwood of the tree, as the living sapwood contains a chemical that repels the insects.<ref>McMahon, Charlie. (2004) The Ecology of Termites and Didjeridus, ''The Didgeridoo: From Ancient Times to the Modern Age'' (ed. David Lindner) Sch\u00f6nau: Traumzeit-Verlag</ref>  Various techniques are employed to find trees with a suitable hollow, including knowledge of landscape and termite activity patterns, and a kind of tap or knock test, in which the bark of the tree is peeled back, and a fingernail or the blunt end of a tool, such as an axe is knocked against the wood to determine if the hollow produces the right resonance.<ref>{{cite web |title=How is a Yidaki Made? |url=http://www.yirrkala.com/yidaki/dhawu/08howmade.html |work=Yidaki Dhawu Miwatjnurunydja |publisher=Buku Larrngay Mulka Centre |accessdate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214193750/http://www.yirrkala.com/yidaki/dhawu/08howmade.html |archivedate=14 February 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nOnce a suitably hollow tree is found, it is cut down and cleaned out, the bark is taken off, the ends trimmed, and the exterior is shaped; this results in a finished instrument. This instrument may be painted or left undecorated. A rim of [[beeswax]] may be applied to the [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] end. Traditional instruments made by Aboriginal craftsmen in Arnhem Land are sometimes fitted with a \"[[Australian Aboriginal sweet foods|sugarbag]]\" mouthpiece. This black beeswax comes from wild bees and has a distinctive aroma.\n\nNon-traditional didgeridoos can also be made from PVC piping, non-native hard woods (typically split, hollowed and rejoined), glass, fiberglass, metal, agave, clay, hemp (in the form of a bioplastic named [[zelfo]]), and even carbon fibre. These didges typically have an upper inside diameter of around 1.25\" down to a bell end of anywhere between two and eight inches and have a length corresponding to the desired key. The mouthpiece can be constructed of beeswax, hardwood or simply sanded and sized by the craftsman. In PVC, an appropriately sized rubber stopper with a hole cut into it is equally acceptable, or to finely sand and buff the end of the pipe to create a comfortable mouthpiece.\n\n[[Modern didgeridoo designs]] are distinct from the traditional Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] didgeridoo, and are innovations recognized by [[musicologist]]s.<ref name=Max1>Wade-Matthews, M., Thompson, W., ''The Encyclopedia of Music'', 2004, pp184\u2013185. {{ISBN|0-7607-6243-0}}</ref><ref name=Max2>Wade-Matthews, M., ''An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments'', 2003, Lorenz Books, p95. {{ISBN|978-0-7548-1182-4}}</ref> Didgeridoo design innovation started in the late 20th century using non-traditional materials and non-traditional shapes.\n\n==Decoration==\nMany didgeridoos are painted using traditional or modern paints by either their maker or a dedicated artist; however, it is not essential that the instrument be decorated.  It is also common to retain the natural wood grain with minimal or no decoration. Some modern makers deliberately avoid decoration if they are not of Indigenous Australian descent, or leave the instrument blank for an Indigenous Australian artist to decorate it at a later stage.\n\n==Playing the didgeridoo==\n[[File:Didgeridoo (Imagicity 1070).jpg|thumb|An Aboriginal man playing the didgeridoo]]\nThe didgeridoo is played with continuously vibrating lips to produce the drone while using a special breathing technique called [[circular breathing]]. This requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously expelling stored air out of the mouth using the tongue and cheeks. By use of this technique, a skilled player can replenish the air in their lungs, and with practice can sustain a note for as long as desired. Recordings exist of modern didgeridoo players playing continuously for more than 40 minutes; [[Mark Atkins (musician)|Mark Atkins]] on ''Didgeridoo Concerto'' (1994) plays for over 50 minutes continuously.\n\nFellow of the British Society [[Anthony Baines]] wrote that the didgeridoo functions \"...as an aural kaleidoscope of timbres\"<ref name=\"baines\">A Baines, The Oxford Companion to Musical Instruments OUP 1992</ref> and that \"the extremely difficult virtuoso techniques developed by expert performers find no parallel elsewhere.\"<ref name=\"baines\" />\n\nMore modern approaches to playing the didgeridoo are starting to show up in performances and lessons around the World. One of these techniques involves combining [[beatboxing]] with playing the didgeridoo. It was featured on the British children's TV series ''[[Blue Peter]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/didgeridoo-beat-boxing/10171.html|title=Didgeridoo Beat-boxing|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=[[Blue Peter]]|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Physics and operation ==\n{{further|Frequency spectrum}}\n[[File:Didgeridoo street player-2.jpg|thumb|Didgeridoo street player in Spain]]\n\nA termite-bored didgeridoo has an irregular shape that, overall, usually increases in diameter towards the lower end. This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies that are not harmonically spaced in frequency. This contrasts with the [[harmonic]] spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical plastic pipe, whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1:3:5 etc. The second resonance of a didgeridoo (the note sounded by overblowing) is usually around an [[eleventh|11th]] higher than the fundamental frequency (a frequency ratio somewhat less than 3:1).\n\nThe vibration produced by the player's lips has harmonics, i.e., it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1:2:3 etc. However, the non-harmonic spacing of the instrument's resonances means that the harmonics of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument resonances, as is usually the case for Western wind instruments (e.g., in the low range of the [[clarinet]], the 1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonics of the reed are assisted by resonances of the bore).\n\nSufficiently strong resonances of the vocal tract can strongly influence the [[timbre]] of the instrument.\nAt some frequencies, whose values depend on the position of the player's tongue, resonances of the vocal tract inhibit the oscillatory flow of air into the instrument.\nBands of frequencies that are not thus inhibited produce [[formants]] in the output sound.\nThese formants, and especially their variation during the inhalation and exhalation phases of circular breathing, give the instrument its readily recognizable sound.\n\nOther variations in the didgeridoo's sound can be made by adding vocalizations to the drone. Most of the vocalizations are related to sounds emitted by Australian animals, such as the [[dingo]] or the [[kookaburra]]. To produce these sounds, the players simply have to use their vocal folds to produce the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument. The results range from very high-pitched sounds to much lower sounds involving interference between the lip and vocal fold vibrations.  Adding vocalizations increases the complexity of the playing.\n\n== Cultural significance ==\n[[File:Australia Aboriginal Culture 009.jpg|thumb|upright|An Indigenous Australian man playing a didgeridoo]]\n[[File:Reticulated Didjeridoo 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Musician playing a Travel or Reticulated Didgeridoo]]\nTraditionally and originally, the didgeridoo was primarily played as an accompaniment to ceremonial dancing and singing. However, it was also common for didgeridoos to be played for solo or recreational purposes outside of ceremonial gatherings. For surviving Aboriginal groups of northern Australia, the didgeridoo is still an integral part of ceremonial life, as it accompanies singers and dancers in cultural ceremonies that continue. Today, the majority of didgeridoo playing is for recreational purposes in both Indigenous Australian communities and elsewhere around the world.\n\nPair sticks, sometimes called ''[[clapstick]]s'' or ''bilma'', establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies. The rhythm of the didgeridoo and the beat of the clapsticks are precise, and these patterns have been handed down for many generations. In the [[Wangga]] genre, the song-man starts with vocals and then introduces ''blima'' to the accompaniment of didgeridoo.<ref name=\"Elkin\">[[A. P. Elkin|Elkin, A. P.]] (1979) [1938].

Female didgeridoo players do exist, but their playing takes place in an informal context and is not specifically encouraged by Aboriginal elders. Linda Barwick, an [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]], says that though traditionally women have not played the didgeridoo in ceremony, in informal situations there is no prohibition in the [[Dreamtime|Dreaming Law]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bushcrafts.com.au/Info_pages/Can_women_play_didgeridoo.html |title=Women can play didgeridoo \u2013 taboo incites sales<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=25 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604181534/http://www.bushcrafts.com.au/Info_pages/Can_women_play_didgeridoo.html |archive-date=4 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For example, Jemima Wimalu, a Mara woman from the Roper River is very proficient at playing the didgeridoo and is featured on the [[Gramophone record|record]] ''Aboriginal Sound Instruments'' released in 1978.

In 2008, however, publisher [[Harper Collins]] apologized for its book ''The Daring Book for Girls'', which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument after Aboriginal academics described such encouragement as \"extreme cultural insensitivity\" and \"an extreme faux pas{{nbsp}}... part of a general ignorance that mainstream Australia has about Aboriginal culture.\"<ref name=\"PBP\">''The Didjeridu: From Arnhemland to the Internet'' Perfect Beat Publishers Pg. 89\u201398 {{ISBN|1-86462-003-X}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7595515.stm Didgeridoo book upsets Aborigines, BBC]</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/daring-book-for-girls-breaks-didgeridoo-taboo-in-australia-917751.html 'Daring Book for Girls' breaks didgeridoo taboo in Australia]</ref>\n\nWhile there is no prohibition in the area of the didgeridoo's origin, such restrictions have been applied by other Indigenous communities. The didgeridoo was introduced to the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberleys]] almost a century ago but it is only in the last decade that Aboriginal men have shown adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibitions are especially evident in the South East of Australia. The belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non-Aboriginal people and is also common among Aboriginal communities in Southern Australia; some ethnomusicologists believe that the dissemination of the ''Taboo'' belief and other misconceptions is a result of commercial agendas and marketing. Tourists generally rely on shop employees for information when purchasing a didgeridoo. Additionally, the majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-Aboriginals playing a [[New Age]] style of music with [[liner notes]] promoting the instrument's spirituality which misleads consumers about the didgeridoo's secular role in traditional Aboriginal culture.<ref name=\"PBP\"/>\n\nThe Taboo belief is particularly strong among many Indigenous groups in the South East of Australia, where it is forbidden and considered \"cultural theft\" for non-Indigenous women, and especially performers of ''New Age'' music regardless of sex, to play or even touch a didgeridoo.<ref name=\"PBP\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Day 3 Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone 17.JPG|thumb|A protester at [[Occupy Wall Street]] playing the instrument, September 2011]] \n[[File:Occupy Eugene and the Didgeridoo (Eugene, Oregon).ogv|thumb|The instrument at [[Occupy Eugene]]]]\nThe didgeridoo also became a role playing instrument in the experimental and avant-garde music scene. Industrial music bands like [[Test Department]] generated sounds from this instrument and used them in their industrial performances, linking ecology to industry, influenced by ethnic music and culture.\n\nIt is very often used in the music project [[Naakhum]] which combines Extreme Metal and Ethnic music.\n\nThe acid jazz band [[Jamiroquai]] were known for their didgeridoo player [[Wallis Buchanan]]. In the early days of the band, many songs explored the theme of ecology and those of native cultures marginalized by colonisation. A notable song featuring a didgeridoo is the band's first single \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\", which features prominent didgeridoo playing in both the introduction and solo sections. When Wallis Buchanan left the band in 1999, the band chose not to replace him, and simply abandoned the use of the instrument in their music.\n\nThe instrument is commonly used by ambient artist [[Steve Roach (musician)|Steve Roach]] as a complement to his produced soundscapes, in both live and recorded formats.  It features prominently in his collaborative work ''[[Australia: Sound of the Earth]]'' (with Australian Aboriginal artist [[David Hudson (musician)|David Hudson]] and cellist Sarah Hopkins) as well as ''Dreamtime Return''.\n\nIt is used in the Indian song \"[[Jaane Kyon]]\" from the film ''[[Dil Chahta Hai]]''.\n\nChris Brooks, lead singer of the New Zealand [[hard rock]] band [[Like a Storm]] uses the didgeridoo in some of the band's songs including \"Love the Way You Hate Me\" from their album ''[[Chaos Theory: Part 1]]''.\n\n[[Kate Bush]] made extensive use of the didgeridoo (played by Australian musician [[Rolf Harris]]) on her album ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'', which was written and recorded after a holiday in Australia.\n\n==Health benefits==\nA 2005 study in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' found that learning and practising the didgeridoo helped reduce [[snoring]] and [[obstructive sleep apnea]] by strengthening muscles in the upper airway, thus reducing their tendency to collapse during sleep. In the study, intervention subjects were trained in and practiced didgeridoo playing, including [[circular breathing]] and other techniques. Control subjects were asked not to play the instrument. Subjects were surveyed before and after the study period to assess the effects of intervention.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Puhan MA, Suarez A, Lo Cascio C | title=Didgeridoo playing as alternative treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: randomised controlled trial | journal=BMJ | year=2005 | volume=332 | pages=266\u201370 | doi=10.1136/bmj.38705.470590.55 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/332/7536/266 | pmid=16377643 | issue=7536 | pmc=1360393|display-authors=etal}}</ref> A small 2010 study noted improvements in the asthma management of Aboriginal teens when incorporating didgeridoo playing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eley|first1=Robert|last2=Gorman|first2=Don|title=Didgeridoo Playing and Singing to Support Asthma Management in Aboriginal Australians|journal=The Journal of Rural Health|volume=26|issue=1|year=2010|pages=100\u2013104|issn=0890-765X|pmid=20105276|doi=10.1111/j.1748-0361.2009.00256.x|url=http://eprints.usq.edu.au/3551/3/Eley_Gorman_JRH_v26n1_SV.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts]] \n* [[Alphorn]]\n* [[Erke]]\n* [[Indigenous Australian music]]\n* [[List of didgeridoo players]]\n* [[Maya_music#Trumpets|Mayan trumpet]]\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Ah Chee Ngala, P., Cowell C.

Developmental biology also encompasses the biology of regeneration, [[asexual reproduction]], [[metamorphosis]], and the growth and differentiation of stem cells in the adult organism.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the discipline largely transformed into [[evolutionary developmental biology]].\n\n== Perspectives ==\nThe main processes involved in the [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] of animals are: [[regional specification]], [[morphogenesis]], [[cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]], [[Cell growth|growth]], and the overall control of timing explored in [[evolutionary developmental biology]]:\n\n* [[Regional specification]] refers to the processes that create spatial pattern in a ball or sheet of initially similar cells. This generally involves the action of [[cytoplasmic determinant]]s, located within parts of the fertilized egg, and of inductive signals emitted from signaling centers in the embryo. The early stages of [[regional specification]] do not generate functional differentiated cells, but cell populations committed to develop to a specific region or part of the organism. These are defined by the expression of specific combinations of [[transcription factors]]. \n* [[Morphogenesis]] relates to the formation of three-dimensional shape. It mainly involves the orchestrated movements of cell sheets and of individual cells. Morphogenesis is important for creating the three germ layers of the early embryo ([[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]]) and for building up complex structures during organ development. \n* [[Cell differentiation]] relates specifically to the formation of functional cell types such as nerve, muscle, secretory epithelia etc. Differentiated cells contain large amounts of specific proteins associated with the cell function. \n* [[Cell growth|Growth]] involves both an overall increase in size, and also the differential growth of parts ([[allometry]]) which contributes to morphogenesis. Growth mostly occurs through cell division but also through changes of cell size and the deposition of extracellular materials. \n* The control of timing of events and the integration of the various processes with one another is the least well understood area of the subject. It remains unclear whether animal embryos contain a master clock mechanism or not.\n\nThe development of plants involves similar processes to that of animals. However plant cells are mostly immotile so morphogenesis is achieved by differential growth, without cell movements. Also, the inductive signals and the genes involved are different from those that control animal development.\n\n== Developmental processes ==\n=== Cell differentiation ===\n[[File:Slack Essential Dev Biol Fig 14.12a.jpg|thumb|left|The Notch-delta system in neurogenesis.(Slack Essential Dev Biol Fig 14.12a)]][[Cell differentiation]] is the process whereby different functional cell types arise in development. For example, neurons, muscle fibers and hepatocytes (liver cells) are well known types of differentiated cell. Differentiated cells usually produce large amounts of a few proteins that are required for their specific function and this gives them the characteristic appearance that enables them to be recognized under the light microscope. The genes encoding these proteins are highly active.

This occurs in various types of animal. Well-known are the examples of the frog, which usually hatches as a tadpole and metamorphoses to an adult frog, and certain insects which hatch as a larva and then become remodeled to the adult form during a pupal stage.\n\nAll the developmental processes listed above occur during metamorphosis.

Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues. By contrast, an animal [[embryo]] will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature.\n\nThe properties of organization seen in a plant are [[emergence|emergent properties]] which are more than the sum of the individual parts.  \"The assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable on the basis of examination of the separate parts.\"<ref>Leopold, A. C. ''Plant Growth and Development'', page 183. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964).</ref>\n\n=== Growth ===\nA [[vascular plant]] begins from a single celled [[zygote]], formed by [[fertilisation]] of an egg cell by a sperm cell.  From that point, it begins to divide to form a plant [[embryo]] through the process of [[embryogenesis]].  As this happens, the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root, while the other end forms the tip of the shoot.  In [[seed]] plants, the embryo will develop one or more \"seed leaves\" ([[cotyledon]]s).  By the end of embryogenesis, the young plant will have all the parts necessary to begin in its life.\n\nOnce the embryo [[germination|germinates]] from its seed or parent plant, it begins to produce additional organs (leaves, stems, and roots) through the process of [[organogenesis]].  New roots grow from root [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the root, and new stems and leaves grow from shoot [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the shoot.<ref>{{Cite journal|pages=134\u201341|pmid=11169586|year=2001|last1=Brand|first1=U|last2=Hobe|first2=M|last3=Simon|first3=R|title=Functional domains in plant shoot meristems|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200102)23:2<134::AID-BIES1020>3.0.CO;2-3|journal=BioEssays}} Review.</ref>  Branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem, and which have not yet undergone [[cellular differentiation]] to form a specialized tissue, begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot.  Growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed [[primary growth]] and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot. [[Secondary growth]] results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a [[Cambium (botany)|cambium]].<ref>{{Cite journal|pages=533\u201341|pmid= 15832381|year=2005|last1=Barlow|first1=P|title=Patterned cell determination in a plant tissue: The secondary phloem of trees|volume=27|issue=5|doi=10.1002/bies.20214|journal=BioEssays}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to growth by [[cell (biology)|cell]] division, a plant may grow through '''cell elongation'''. This occurs when individual cells or groups of cells grow longer. Not all plant cells will grow to the same length.  When cells on one side of a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem will bend to the side of the slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus, such as light ([[phototropism]]), gravity ([[gravitropism]]), water, ([[hydrotropism]]), and physical contact ([[thigmotropism]]).\n\nPlant growth and development are mediated by specific [[plant hormone]]s and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (Ross et al. 1983).<ref name=\"ross\">Ross, S.D.; Pharis, R.P.; Binder, W.D. 1983.

Vol. 2, CRC Press, Boca Raton FL.</ref> Endogenous hormone levels are influenced by plant age, cold hardiness, dormancy, and other metabolic conditions; photoperiod, drought, temperature, and other external environmental conditions; and exogenous sources of PGRs, e.g., externally applied and of rhizospheric origin.\n\n=== Morphological variation ===\nPlants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure.  While all organisms vary from individual to individual, plants exhibit an additional type of variation.  Within a single individual, parts are repeated which may differ in form and structure from other similar parts.  This variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant, though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation.  There are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects, environmental effects, and juvenility.\n\n=== Evolution of plant morphology ===\nTranscription factors and transcriptional regulatory networks play key roles in plant morphogenesis and their evolution. During plant landing, many novel transcription factor families emerged and are preferentially wired into the networks of multicellular development, reproduction, and organ development, contributing to more complex morphogenesis of land plants.<ref name=\"MBE_1767\">{{cite journal |last1=Jin JP, et al. |title=An Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory map reveals distinct functional and evolutionary features of novel transcription factors |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=July 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msv058 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |pmid=25750178 |pmc=4476157 |pages=1767\u20131773 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602063847/http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |archivedate=2016-06-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Developmental model organisms ==\n\nMuch of developmental biology research in recent decades has focused on the use of a small number of [[model organisms]]. It has turned out that there is much conservation of developmental mechanisms across the animal kingdom. In early development different vertebrate species all use essentially the same inductive signals and the same genes encoding regional identity. Even invertebrates use a similar repertoire of signals and genes although the body parts formed are significantly different. Model organisms each have some particular experimental advantages which have enabled them to become popular among researchers. In one sense they are \"models\" for the whole animal kingdom, and in another sense they are \"models\" for human development, which is difficult to study directly for both ethical and practical reasons. Model organisms have been most useful for elucidating the broad nature of developmental mechanisms.

The term is not recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) and is therefore not an official classification.  At its 2006 General Assembly, the International Astronomical Union considered a proposal that [[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] be reclassified as a double planet,<ref name=\"Draft Resolution 5\">{{cite web|title=The IAU draft definition of \"planet\" and \"plutons\"|url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0601/|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|date=2006-08-16|accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref> but the proposal was abandoned in favor of the current definition of [[IAU definition of planet|planet]]. In promotional materials advertising the [[SMART-1]] mission and pre-dating the IAU planet definition, the [[European Space Agency]] once referred to the [[Earth]]\u2013[[Moon]] system as a double planet.<ref name=\"esa-double\">{{cite web  |date=2003-10-05 |title=Welcome to the double planet |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/SMART-1/SEMO1VMKPZD_0.html |accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref>\n\nSome [[binary asteroid]]s with components of roughly equal mass are sometimes informally referred to as double [[minor planet]]s.  These include binary asteroids [[69230 Hermes]] and [[90 Antiope]] and binary [[Kuiper belt object]]s (KBOs) [[79360 Sila\u2013Nunam]] and {{mpl|1998 WW|31}}.\n\n== Definition of \"double planet\" ==\n{{multiple image\n |direction =vertical\n |align     =right\n |width     =235\n |image1    =NH-PlutoCharon-Color-NewHorizons-20150711.jpg\n |image2    =Moon, Earth size comparison.jpg\n |caption1  =The [[Pluto]]\u2013[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] system is closer to binary than the Earth\u2013Moon system ''(distance not to scale)''.\n |caption2  =The [[Earth]]\u2013[[Moon]] system is sometimes informally referred to as a double planet ''(masses are roughly proportional to volumes, not surface area).''<ref name=\"esa-double\" />\n}}\n\nThere is debate as to what criteria should be used to distinguish \"double planet\" from a \"planet\u2013moon system\". The following are considerations.\n\n=== Both bodies satisfy planet criterion ===\n\nA definition proposed in the Astronomical Journal calls for both bodies to individually satisfy an orbit-clearing criterion in order to be called a double planet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Margot|first1=J.L.|title=A Quantitative Criterion for Defining Planets|journal=Astronomical Journal|volume=150|pages=185|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1538-3881/150/i=6/a=185|arxiv=1507.06300|bibcode = 2015AJ....150..185M |doi = 10.1088/0004-6256/150/6/185 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mass ratios closer to 1 ===\n\nOne important consideration in defining \"double planet\" is the ratio of the masses of the two bodies. A mass ratio of 1 would indicate bodies of equal mass, and bodies with mass ratios closer to 1 are more attractive to label as \"doubles\". Using this definition, the satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune can all easily be excluded; they all have masses less than 0.00025 ({{frac|4000}}) of the planets around which they revolve. Some [[dwarf planet]]s, too, have satellites substantially less massive than the dwarf planets themselves.\n\nThe most notable exception is the Pluto\u2013Charon system. The Charon-to-Pluto mass ratio of 0.117 (\u2248 {{frac|2|17}}) is close enough to 1 that Pluto and Charon have frequently been described by many scientists as \"double dwarf planets\" (\"double planets\" prior to the 2006 definition of \"planet\"). The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) currently calls Charon a satellite of Pluto, but has explicitly expressed a willingness to reconsider the bodies double dwarf planets at a future time.\n\nThe Moon-to-Earth mass ratio of 0.01230 (\u2248 {{frac|81}}) is also notably close to 1 when compared to all other satellite-to-planet ratios. Consequently, some scientists view the Earth-Moon system as a double planet as well, though this is a minority view. [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]'s lone satellite, [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]], has a radius somewhere around {{frac|1|4}} that of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]; assuming similar densities (Dysnomia's compositional make-up may or may not differ substantially from Eris's), the mass ratio would be near {{frac|40}}, a value intermediate to the Moon\u2013Earth and Charon\u2013Pluto ratios.\n\nThe next criteria both attempt to answer the question \"How close to 1 must the mass ratio be?\"\n\n[[File:Barycentric view of Pluto and Charon 29 May-3 June by Ralph in near-true colours.gif|thumb|left|200px|[[Pluto]]\u2013[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] system: the [[barycenter]] lies outside of Pluto.]]\n\n=== Center-of-mass position ===\n\nCurrently, the most commonly proposed definition for a double-planet system is one in which the [[barycenter]], around which both bodies orbit, lies outside both bodies. Under this definition, Pluto and Charon are double (dwarf) planets, since they orbit a point clearly outside of Pluto, as visible in animations created from images of the ''[[New Horizons]]'' space probe in June 2015.\n\nUnder this definition, the Earth\u2013Moon system is not currently a double planet; although the Moon is massive enough to cause the Earth to make a noticeable revolution around this center of mass, this point nevertheless lies well within Earth. However, the Moon migrates outward from Earth at a rate of approximately {{convert|1.5|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} per year; in a few hundred million years, the Earth\u2013Moon system's center of mass will lie outside Earth, which would make it a double-planet system.\n\nThe center of mass of the Jupiter\u2013Sun system lies outside the surface of the Sun, though arguing that Jupiter is a double star is ''not'' analogous to arguing Charon is a double planet.  The problem is that Jupiter is not even a [[star]], or even a [[brown dwarf]], and due to its low mass it is unable to achieve any form of [[fusion]].<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Herbst, T.

Avon. Formula derived on p. 89 of book. p. 55 of .pdf file. Retrieved 2012-01-20.</ref> This quantity is simply the ratio of the force exerted on the smaller body by the larger (primary) body to the force exerted on the smaller body by the Sun. This [[Tug of war (astronomy)#Law of universal gravitation|can be shown]] to equal\n\n:<math>\\text{tug-of-war value} = \\frac{m_p}{m_s} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{d_s}{d_p} \\right)^2</math>\n\nwhere m<sub>p</sub> is the mass of the primary (the larger body), m<sub>s</sub> is the mass of the Sun, d<sub>s</sub> is the distance between the smaller body and the Sun, and d<sub>p</sub> is the distance between the smaller body and the primary.<ref name=\"Asimov\"/> Note that the tug-of-war value does not rely on the mass of the satellite (the smaller body).\n\nThis formula actually reflects the relation of the [[gravitation]]al effects on the smaller body from the larger body and from the Sun. The tug-of-war figure for Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is 380, which means that Saturn's hold on Titan is 380 times as strong as the Sun's hold on Titan. Titan's tug-of-war value may be compared with that of Saturn's moon [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], which has a tug-of-war value of just 3.5. So Saturn's hold on Phoebe is only 3.5 times as strong as the Sun's hold on Phoebe.\n\nAsimov calculated tug-of-war values for several satellites of the planets. He showed that even the largest gas giant, Jupiter, had only a slightly better hold than the Sun on its outer captured satellites, some with tug-of-war values not much higher than one. In nearly every one of Asimov's calculations the tug-of-war value was found to be greater than one, so in those cases the Sun loses the tug-of-war with the planets. The one exception was Earth's Moon, where the Sun wins the tug-of-war with a value of 0.46, which means that Earth's hold on the Moon is less than half that of the Sun's. Asimov included this with his other arguments that Earth and the Moon should be considered a binary planet.<ref name=\"Asimov\"/>\n\n{{quote|We might look upon the Moon, then, as neither a true satellite of the Earth nor a captured one, but as a planet in its own right, moving about the Sun in careful step with the Earth. From within the Earth\u2013Moon system, the simplest way of picturing the situation is to have the Moon revolve about the Earth; but if you were to draw a picture of the orbits of the Earth and Moon about the Sun exactly to scale, you would see that the Moon's orbit is everywhere concave toward the Sun. It is always \"falling toward\" the Sun. All the other satellites, without exception, \"fall away\" from the Sun through part of their orbits, caught as they are by the superior pull of their primary planets{{spaced ndash}}but not the Moon.<ref name=\"Asimov\"/><ref name=\"Aslaksen\">{{Cite web |title=The Orbit of the Moon around the Sun is Convex! |last=Aslaksen |first=Helmer |url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/convex.html |year=2010 |location=National University of Singapore |publisher=Department of Mathematics |postscript=. |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref><ref name=\"PoV\" group=\"Footnote\">Asimov uses the term \"[[Wikt:concave|concave]]\" to describe the Earth\u2013Moon orbital pattern around the Sun, whereas Aslaksen uses \"[[Wikt:convex|convex]]\" to describe the exact same pattern. Which term one uses relies solely upon the perspective of the observer. From the point-of-view of the Sun, the Moon's orbit is concave; from outside the Moon's orbit, say, from planet Mars, it is convex.</ref>| Isaac Asimov}}\nSee the [[Orbit of the Moon#Path of Earth and Moon around Sun|Path of Earth and Moon around Sun]] section in the \"Orbit of the Moon\" article for a more detailed explanation.\n\nNote that this definition of double planet depends on the pair's distance from the Sun. If the Earth\u2013Moon system happened to orbit farther away from the Sun than it does now, then Earth would win the tug of war.  For example, at the orbit of Mars, the Moon's tug-of-war value would be 1.05. Also, several tiny moons discovered since Asimov's proposal would qualify as double planets by this argument. Neptune's small outer moons [[Neso (moon)|Neso]] and [[Psamathe (moon)|Psamathe]], for example, have tug-of-war values of 0.42 and 0.44, less than that of Earth's Moon. Yet their masses are tiny compared to Neptune's, with an estimated ratio of 1.5{{e|-9}} ({{frac|700,000,000}}) and 0.4{{e|-9}} ({{frac|2,500,000,000}}).\n\n=== Formation of the system ===\n\nA final consideration is the way in which the two bodies came to form a system. Both the Earth-Moon and Pluto-Charon systems are thought to have been formed as a result of [[giant impact hypothesis|giant impacts]]: one body was impacted by a second body, resulting in a debris disk, and through accretion, either two new bodies formed or one new body formed, with the larger body remaining (but changed). However, a giant impact is not a sufficient condition for two bodies being \"double planets\" because such impacts can also produce tiny satellites, such as the four, small, outer satellites of Pluto.\n\nA now-abandoned hypothesis for the [[origin of the Moon]] was actually called the \"double-planet hypothesis\"; the idea was that the Earth and the Moon formed in the same region of the [[solar system]]'s proto-planetary disk, forming a system under gravitational interaction. This idea, too, is a problematic condition for defining two bodies as \"double planets\" because planets can \"capture\" moons through gravitational interaction. For example, the [[moons of Mars]] ([[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]) are thought to be asteroids captured long ago by [[Mars]]. Such a weak definition would also deem Neptune-Triton a double planet, since [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] was a [[Kuiper belt]] body the same size and of similar composition to Pluto, later captured by [[Neptune]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Portal|Astronomy}}\n{{cmn|colwidth=20em|\n* [[2006 definition of planet]]\n* [[3753 Cruithne]]\n* [[Co-orbital configuration]]\n* [[Definition of planet|Definition of a planet]]\n* [[Ecliptic]]\n* [[Hill sphere]]\n* [[Natural satellite]]\n* [[Orbit of the Moon]]\n}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"Footnote\"}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*  {{Cite journal\n| last1 = Stern | first =  S.

A protein is created by [[ribosome]]s that \"read\" RNA that is encoded by [[codon]]s in the gene and assemble the requisite amino acid combination from the [[DNA|genetic]] instruction, in a process known as [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. The newly created protein strand then undergoes [[posttranslational modification]], in which additional [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s are added, for example [[copper]], [[zinc]], or [[iron]]. Once this post-translational modification process has been completed, the protein begins to fold (sometimes spontaneously and sometimes with [[enzymatic]] assistance), curling up on itself so that [[hydrophobic]] elements of the protein are buried deep inside the structure and [[hydrophilic]] elements end up on the outside. The final shape of a protein determines how it interacts with its environment.\n\nProtein folding consists of a balance between a substantial amount of weak intra-molecular interactions within a protein (Hydrophobic, electrostatic, and Van Der Waals Interactions) and protein-solvent interactions.<ref name=\":01\">{{Cite journal|last=Bondos|first=Sarah|date=2014|title=Protein folding |journal=Access Science|language=en|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.801070}}</ref> As a result, this process is heavily reliant on environmental state that the protein resides in.<ref name=\":01\" /> These environmental conditions include, and are not limited to, [[temperature]], [[salinity]], [[pressure]], and the solvents that happen to be involved.<ref name=\":01\" /> Consequently, any exposure to extreme stresses (e.g. heat or radiation, high inorganic salt concentrations, strong acids and bases) can disrupt a protein's interaction and inevitably lead to denaturation.<ref name=\"test\">{{Cite journal|date=2006-04-03|title= Denaturation|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CV2431500175/SCIC?u=cuny_hunter&sid=SCIC&xid=fc5b75c9|journal=Science in Context|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen a protein is denatured, secondary and tertiary structures are altered but the [[peptide bond]]s of the primary structure between the amino acids are left intact.

For example, denaturation of DNA due to high temperatures results in the disruption of [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|Watson and Crick]] base pairs and the separation of the double stranded helix into two single strands.

His father, Edwin J. Moody (1800\u20131841), was a small farmer and stonemason. His mother was Betsey Moody (n\u00e9e Holton; 1805\u20131896). They had five sons and a daughter before Dwight's birth. His father died when Dwight was age four; fraternal twins, a boy and a girl, were born one month after the father's death. Their mother struggled to support the nine children, but had to send some off to work for their room and board. Dwight too was sent off, where he received cornmeal, porridge, and milk three times a day.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=George|title=What Will A Man Give In Exchange For His Soul?|year=2011|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1465380981|pages=113\u2013115}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}</ref> He complained to his mother, but when she learned that he was getting all he wanted to eat, she sent him back.

One of the uncle's requirements was that Moody attend the [[Mount Vernon Church, Boston|Congregational Church of Mount Vernon]], where [[Edward Norris Kirk|Dr. Edward Norris Kirk]] served as the [[pastor]]. In April 1855 Moody was converted to [[evangelical]] Christianity when his Sunday school teacher, Edward Kimball, talked to him about how much God loved him. His conversion sparked the start of his career as an evangelist. Moody was not received by the church when he first applied in May 1855. He was not received as a church member until May 4, 1856.\n\nAccording to Moody's memoir, his teacher, Edward Kimball, said:\n\n{{quote|I can truly say, and in saying it I magnify the infinite grace of God as bestowed upon him, that I have seen few persons whose minds were spiritually darker than was his when he came into my [[Sunday School]] class; and I think that the committee of the Mount Vernon Church seldom met an applicant for membership more unlikely ever to become a Christian of clear and decided views of Gospel truth, still less to fill any extended sphere of public usefulness.<ref>Moody (1900), 21</ref>}}\n\n==Civil War==\n[[File:Portrait of Dwight Lyman Moody (4669848).jpg|thumb|upright|Dwight Lyman Moody c.1870]]\n{{quote|The first meeting I ever saw him at was in a little old shanty that had been abandoned by a saloon-keeper.

Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2\u201312&nbsp;months' duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of {{convert|3.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} over habitual eating.<ref name=Strychar/>\n\n===Low-carbohydrate===\n{{Main article|Low-carbohydrate diet}}\nLow-carbohydrate diets such as [[Atkins diet|Atkins]] and Protein Power are relatively high in protein and fats. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ''[[ketogenic diet|ketogenic]]'' (i.e., they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause [[ketosis]]).\n\n===Low-calorie===\n{{Main article|Calorie restriction}}\nLow-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500\u20131,000 calories per day, which can result in a {{convert|0.5|to|1|kg|lb|abbr=off}} weight loss per week. One of the most commonly used low-calorie diets is [[Weight Watchers]]. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 [[randomized controlled trial]]s to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3\u201312 months.<ref name=Strychar/> Women doing low-calorie diets should have at least 1,000 calories per day and men should have approximately 1,200 calories per day. These caloric intake values vary depending on additional factors, such as age and weight.<ref name=\"Strychar\" />\n\n===Very low-calorie===\n{{Main article|Very low calorie diet}}\nVery low calorie diets provide 200\u2013800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to [[starvation]] and produce an average loss of {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per week. \"2-4-6-8\", a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally [[fasting]], after which the cycle repeats. These diets are not recommended for general use as they are associated with [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effect]]s such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of [[gout]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]]s. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.<ref name=Strychar/>\n\n===Detox===\n{{Main article|Detox diet}}\nDetox diets claim to eliminate \"toxins\" from the human body rather than claiming to cause weight loss.

Examples include [[Lent]] in [[Christianity]]; [[Yom Kippur]], [[Tisha B'av]], [[Fast of Esther]], [[Fast of Gedalia|Tzom Gedalia]], the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz|Seventeenth of Tamuz]], and the [[Tenth of Tevet]] in [[Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al-mawrid.org/pages/articles_english_detail.php?rid=196&cid=330&search=fasting |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227090756/http://www.al-mawrid.org/pages/articles_english_detail.php?rid=196&cid=330&search=fasting |archivedate=27 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Muslims]] refrain from eating during the hours of daytime for one month, [[Ramadan]], every year.\n\nDetails of fasting practices differ.  [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] fast during specified fasting seasons of the year, which include not only the better-known [[Great Lent]], but also fasts on every Wednesday and Friday (except on special holidays), together with extended fasting periods before Christmas (the [[Nativity Fast]]), after Easter (the [[Apostles Fast]]) and in early August (the [[Dormition Fast]]). Members of [[Latter Day Saint movement|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormon]]s) generally fast for 24 hours on the first Sunday of each month. Like Muslims, they refrain from all drinking and eating unless they are children or are physically unable to fast. Fasting is also a feature of [[ascetic]] traditions in religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Mahayana traditions that follow the Brahma's Net Sutra may recommend that the laity fast \"during the six days of fasting each month and the three months of fasting each year\" [Brahma's Net Sutra, minor precept 30]. Members of the [[Baha'i Faith]] observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast]] from sunrise to sunset during March each year.\n\n==Nutrition==\nWeight loss diets that manipulate the proportion of macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.) have been shown to be more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. low-fat milk, or less salad dressing).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030201/cochrane.html|title=Cochrane for Clinicians: Are Low-Fat Diets Better than Other Weight-Reducing Diets in Achieving Long-Term Weight Loss? - American Family Physician|publisher=}}</ref> Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.\n\nNutritionists also agree on the importance of avoiding fats, especially saturated fats, to reduce weight and to be healthier. They also agree on the importance of reducing [[salt]] intake because foods including [[snacks]], [[biscuits]], and [[bread]] already contain ocean-salt, contributing to an excess of salt daily intake.<ref name=\"E\">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.case.edu/health/medical/nutrition.html |title=Why is Proper Nutrition Important?|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]] is a set of recommendations about a healthy diet written for policy makers, nutrition scientists, and dieticians and other clinicians, produced by the [[US Department of Agriculture]], in concert with the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] and quintannually-revised.  The current guidelines are written for the period 2015 - 2020 and were used to produce the [[MyPlate]] recommendations on a healthy diet for the general public.\n\nOne of the most important things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal.

The first source to which the body turns is [[glycogen]] (by [[glycogenolysis]]). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 [[kcal]] in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested [[nutrients|macronutrients]], mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins [[lipolysis]], the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process, fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or [[fat cells]], are broken down into [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]], which can be used to generate energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Rourke|first=Brian|last2=Cortassa|first2=Sonia|last3=Aon|first3=Miguel A.|date=2005-10-01|title=Mitochondrial Ion Channels: Gatekeepers of Life and Death|url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/20/5/303|journal=Physiology|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=303\u2013315|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2005|issn=1548-9213|pmc=2739045|pmid=16174870}}</ref> The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.\n\n==Weight loss groups==\nSome weight loss groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include [[Weight Watchers]] and [[Peertrainer]]. The latter include [[Overeaters Anonymous]] and groups run by local organizations.\n\nThese organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on [[twelve-step program]]s, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.\n\n==Food diary==\nA 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] showed that dieters who kept a daily food [[Personal journal|diary]] (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if you record your eating, you would be more aware of what you eat and, therefore you wouldn't eat as many calories.<ref>{{cite news| title= Using food diaries doubles weight loss, study shows | url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2008-07-08-food-diaries%5FN.htm | date= 8 July 2008 | work=USA Today | first=Nanci | last=Hellmich | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Possible weight loss effects of drinking water prior to meals==\n{{Main article | Weight loss effects of water}}\nA 2009 review found that existing limited evidence suggested that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages (i.e., reducing caloric intake) may facilitate weight management. A 2009 article found that drinking 500&nbsp;ml of water prior to meals for a 12-week period resulted in increased long-term weight reduction. (References given in [[Weight loss effects of water|main article]].)\n\n==Fasting==\n{{Main article|Fasting}}\nFasting is when there is a long time interval between the meals. In dieting, fasting is not recommended, instead, having small portions of food after small intervals is encouraged. Lengthy fasting can also be dangerous due to the risk of [[malnutrition]] and should be carried out only under medical supervision. During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diets the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the [[Human brain|brain]], causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting, although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of [[intermittent fasting]] have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent this issue.\n\n==Side effects==\nWhile there are studies that show the health and medical benefits of weight loss, a study in 2005 of around 3000 Finns over an 18-year period showed that weight loss from dieting can result in increased mortality, while those who maintained their weight fared the best.<ref name=\"weight science\" /><ref name=\"nature2007\" /><ref>{{cite journal |author= S\u00f8rensen TI, Rissanen A, Korkeila M, Kaprio J |title= Intention to Lose Weight, Weight Changes, and 18-y Mortality in Overweight Individuals without Co-Morbidities |journal= PLoS Medicine |year=2005 |volume=2|issue=6; e171|pmc=1160579 |pmid=15971946 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020171 |pages=e171|last2= Rissanen |last3= Korkeila |last4= Kaprio }}</ref> Similar conclusion is drawn by other studies,<ref name=\"weight science\">{{cite journal |title= Weight science: evaluating the evidence for a paradigm shift |author= Bacon L, Aphramor L. |journal=Nutr J |year=2011 |volume=10|pmc=3041737 |pmid=21261939 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-10-9 |pages=9|last2= Aphramor }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ingram DD, Mussolino ME. |title=Weight loss from maximum body weight and mortality: the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File |journal=Int J Obes |year=2010|volume=34|pages=1044\u20131050|pmid=  20212495 |doi=10.1038/ijo.2010.41 |issue=6|last2=Mussolino }}</ref> and although other studies suggest that intentional weight loss has a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy, it is associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals and the slightly overweight but not obese.<ref name=\"harrington\">{{cite journal |author= Harrington M, Gibson S, Cottrell RC |title= A review and meta-analysis of the effect of weight loss on all-cause mortality risk |journal=Nutr Res Rev. |year=2009 |volume=22|issue=1|pages=93\u2013108 |pmid=19555520 |doi=10.1017/S0954422409990035|last2= Gibson |last3= Cottrell }}</ref> This may reflect the loss of subcutaneous fat and beneficial mass from organs and muscle in addition to [[visceral fat]] when there is a sudden and dramatic weight loss.<ref name=\"nature2007\">{{cite journal |url=|title=The Two Faces of Fat|author=Kendall Powell|journal=Nature|volume=447|issue=7144|pages=525\u20137|date=31 May 2007|pmid=17538594|doi=10.1038/447525a}}</ref>\n\n==Low carbohydrate versus low fat==\n{{Main article|Medical research related to low-carbohydrate diets}}\nMany studies have focused on diets that reduce calories via a low-carbohydrate ([[Atkins diet]], [[Scarsdale diet]], [[Zone diet]]) diet versus a low-fat diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet).

Dubnium is highly radioactive: the most stable known [[isotopes of dubnium|isotope]], dubnium-268, has a [[half-life]] of about 28 hours. This greatly limits the extent of research on dubnium.\n\nDubnium does not occur naturally on Earth and is produced artificially.  The Soviet [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) claimed the first discovery of the element in 1968, followed by the American [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] in 1970. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party]], resulting in credit for the discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was formally named ''dubnium'' in 1997 after the town of [[Dubna]], the site of the JINR.\n\nTheoretical research establishes dubnium as a member of [[group 5 element|group 5]] in the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s, placing it under [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], and [[tantalum]]. Dubnium should share most properties, such as its valence [[electron configuration]] and having a dominant +5 oxidation state, with the other group 5 elements, with a few anomalies due to [[relativistic effects]]. A limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has confirmed this. Solution chemistry experiments have revealed that dubnium often behaves more like niobium rather than tantalum, breaking [[periodic trends]].\n\n== Discovery ==\n===Background===\n[[Uranium]], element 92, is the heaviest element to occur in significant quantity in nature; heavier elements can only be produced practically by synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element\u2014[[neptunium]], element 93\u2014was achieved in 1940 by a team of researchers in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Radiochemistry and Nuclear Chemistry|last=Choppin|first=G.

The scientists bombarded [[americium-243|<sup>243</sup>Am]] with a beam of [[neon-22|<sup>22</sup>Ne]] ions, and reported 9.4&nbsp;MeV (with a half-life of 0.1\u20133 seconds) and 9.7&nbsp;MeV (''t''<sub>1/2</sub>&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;s) [[alpha decay|alpha activities]] followed by alpha activities similar to those of either <sup>256</sup>103 or <sup>257</sup>103. Based on prior theoretical predictions, the two activity lines were assigned to <sup>261</sup>105 and <sup>260</sup>105, respectively.<ref name=\"1993 report\" />\n\n:{{nuclide|americium|243}} + {{nuclide|neon|22}} \u2192 <sup>265\u2212''x''</sup>105 + ''x'' {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}} (''x'' = 4, 5)\n\nAfter observing the alpha decays of element 105, the researchers aimed to observe [[spontaneous fission]] (SF) of the element and study the resulting fission fragments. They published a paper in February 1970, reporting multiple examples of two such activities, with half-lives of 14&nbsp;ms and {{val|2.2|0.5|u=s}}. They assigned the former activity to <sup>242mf</sup>Am{{efn|This notation signifies that the nucleus is a [[nuclear isomer]] that decays via spontaneous fission.}} and ascribed the latter activity to an isotope of element 105. They suggested that it was unlikely that this activity could come from a transfer reaction instead of element 105, because the yield ratio for this reaction was significantly lower than that of the <sup>242mf</sup>Am-producing transfer reaction, in accordance with theoretical predictions. To establish that this activity was not from a (<sup>22</sup>Ne,''x''n) reaction, the researchers bombarded a <sup>243</sup>Am target with <sup>18</sup>O ions; reactions producing <sup>256</sup>103 and <sup>257</sup>103 showed very little SF activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier <sup>258</sup>103 and <sup>259</sup>103 produced no SF activity at all, in line with theoretical data. The researchers concluded that the activities observed came from SF of element 105.<ref name=\"1993 report\" />\n\nIn April 1970, a team at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] (LBL), in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], United States, claimed to have synthesized element 105 by bombarding [[californium-249]] with [[nitrogen-15]] ions, with an alpha activity of 9.1&nbsp;MeV. To ensure this activity was not from a different reaction, the team attempted other reactions: bombarding <sup>249</sup>Cf with <sup>14</sup>N, Pb with <sup>15</sup>N, and Hg with <sup>15</sup>N. They stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei matched those of <sup>256</sup>103, implying that the parent nuclei were of <sup>260</sup>105.<ref name=\"1993 report\" />\n\n:{{nuclide|californium|249}} + {{nuclide|nitrogen|15}} \u2192 <sup>260</sup>105 + 4 {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}\n\nThese results did not confirm the JINR findings regarding the 9.4&nbsp;MeV or 9.7&nbsp;MeV alpha decay of <sup>260</sup>105, leaving only <sup>261</sup>105 as a possibly produced isotope.<ref name=\"1993 report\" />\n\nJINR then attempted another experiment to create element 105, published in a report in May 1970. They claimed that they had synthesized more nuclei of element 105 and that the experiment confirmed their previous work. According to the paper, the isotope produced by JINR was probably <sup>261</sup>105, or possibly <sup>260</sup>105.<ref name=\"1993 report\" /> This report included an initial chemical examination: the thermal gradient version of the gas-chromatography method was applied to demonstrate that the chloride of what had formed from the SF activity nearly matched that of [[Niobium(V) chloride|niobium pentachloride]], rather than [[hafnium tetrachloride]]. The team identified a 2.2-second SF activity in a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, and inferred that the source of the SF activity must have been element 105.<ref name=\"1993 report\" />\n\nIn June 1970, JINR made improvements on their first experiment, using a purer target and reducing the intensity of transfer reactions by installing a [[collimator]] before the catcher. This time, they were able to find 9.1&nbsp;MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either <sup>256</sup>103 or <sup>257</sup>103, implying that the original isotope was either <sup>260</sup>105 or <sup>261</sup>105.<ref name=\"1993 report\" />\n\n=== Naming controversy ===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Danish nuclear physicist [[Niels Bohr]] and German nuclear chemist [[Otto Hahn]]\n| align = left\n| direction =\n| width =\n| width1 = 125\n| width2 = 125\n| image1 = Niels Bohr.jpg\n| alt1 = Photo of Niels Bohr\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = Otto Hahn (Nobel).jpg\n| alt2 = Photo of Otto Hahn\n| caption2 =\n}}\n\nJINR did not propose a name after their first report claiming synthesis of element 105, which would have been the usual practice.

Secondly, elements 104 and 105 were given names favored by JINR, despite earlier recognition of LBL as an equal co-discoverer for both of them. Thirdly and most importantly, IUPAC rejected the name ''seaborgium'' for element 106, having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person, even though the 1993 report had given the LBL team the sole credit for its discovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/seaborgium-dispute.html|title=Naming of element 106 disputed by international committee|last=Yarris|first=L.|year=1994|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=no|access-date=September 7, 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, IUPAC abandoned the controversial rule and established a committee of national representatives aimed at finding a compromise.

Several studies have investigated the properties of element 105 and found that they generally agreed with the predictions of periodic law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to [[relativistic effects]],{{Efn|Relativistic effects arise when an object moves at velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.}} which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. These properties have remained challenging to measure for several reasons: the difficulties of production of superheavy atoms, the low rates of production, which only allows for microscopic scales, requirements for a radiochemistry laboratory to test the atoms, short half-lives of those atoms, and the presence of many unwanted activities apart from those of synthesis of superheavy atoms. So far, studies have only been performed on single atoms.<ref name=Haire />\n\n=== Atomic and physical ===\n\n[[File:7s electrons dubnium relativistic vs nonrelativistic.svg|thumb|Relativistic (solid line) and nonrelativistic (dashed line) radial distribution of the 7s valence electrons in dubnium.]]\nA direct relativistic effect is that as the atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus as a result of an increase of [[electromagnetic attraction]] between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for the outermost s [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] (and p<sub>1/2</sub> ones, though in dubnium they are not occupied): for example, the 7s orbital contracts by 25% in size and is stabilized by 2.6&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]].<ref name=Haire />\n\nA more indirect effect is that the contracted s and p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals [[shielding effect|shield]] the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move in larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are slightly more difficult to extract than its 6d electrons.<ref name=Haire />\n\n[[File:Atomic orbitals dubnium.svg|thumb|Relativistic stabilization of the ''n''s orbitals, the destabilization of the {{nobreak|(''n''-1)d}} orbitals and their spin\u2013orbit splitting for the group 5 elements.]]\nAnother effect is the [[spin\u2013orbit interaction]], particularly spin\u2013orbit splitting, which splits the 6d subshell\u2014the [[azimuthal quantum number]] \u2113 of a d&nbsp;shell is 2\u2014into two subshells, with four of the ten orbitals having their \u2113 lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2. All ten energy levels are raised; four of them are lower than the other six. (The three 6d electrons normally occupy the lowest energy levels, 6d<sub>3/2</sub>.)<ref name=Haire />\n\nA singly ionized atom of dubnium (Db<sup>+</sup>) should lose a 6d electron compared to a neutral atom; the doubly (Db<sup>2+</sup>) or triply (Db<sup>3+</sup>) ionized atoms of dubnium should eliminate 7s electrons, unlike its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, dubnium is still expected to have five valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db<sup>3+</sup> is expected to have two 6d, rather than 7s, electrons remaining, the resulting +3 oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum +5 oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry.<ref name=Haire />\n\nAtoms of dubnium in the solid state should arrange themselves in a [[body-centered cubic]] configuration, like the previous group 5 elements.<ref name=bcc /> The predicted density of dubnium is 29&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref name=Haire />\n\n=== Chemical ===\n[[File:Radiochem 104+ Transactinide.svg|thumb|left|Relativistic (rel) and nonrelativistic (nr) values of the effective charge (Q<sub>M</sub>) and overlap population (OP) in MCl<sub>5</sub>, where M = V, Nb, Ta, and Db]]\n\nComputational chemistry is simplest in [[gas-phase chemistry]], in which interactions between molecules may be ignored as negligible. Multiple authors<ref name=Haire /> have researched dubnium pentachloride; calculations show it to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting the properties of a compound of a group 5 element. For example, the [[molecular orbital]] levels indicate that dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. Compared to its tantalum analog, dubnium pentachloride is expected to show increased [[covalent bond|covalent]] character: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).<ref name=Haire />\n\nCalculations of [[Aqueous solution|solution]] chemistry indicate that the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, will be more stable than those of niobium and tantalum and the +3 and +4 states will be less stable. The tendency towards [[hydrolysis]] of cations with the highest oxidation state should continue to decrease within group 5 but is still expected to be quite rapid. [[Complexation]] of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have shown a reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.<ref name=Haire />\n\n== Experimental chemistry ==\nExperimental results of the chemistry of dubnium date back to 1974 and 1976. JINR researchers used a [[wikt:thermochromatography|thermochromatographic]] system and concluded that the volatility of dubnium bromide was less than that of niobium bromide and about the same as that of hafnium bromide. It is not certain that the detected fission products confirmed that the parent was indeed element 105. These results may imply that dubnium behaves more like [[hafnium]] than niobium.<ref name=Haire />\n\nThe next studies on the chemistry of dubnium were conducted in 1988, in Berkeley. They examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated [[nitric acid]]; [[sorption]] of dubnium on glass [[cover slip]]s was then compared with that of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces; the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. Surprisingly, the behavior on extraction from mixed nitric and [[hydrofluoric acid]] solution into [[methyl isobutyl ketone]] differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that complexing behavior could not be predicted purely from simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.<ref name=Haire />\n\nThis prompted further exploration of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Various labs jointly conducted thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and [[protactinium]] were extracted from concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]; after mixing with lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed behavior different from that of tantalum but similar to that of niobium and its pseudohomolog protactinium at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 [[Molar concentration|moles per liter]]. This similarity to the two elements suggested that the formed complex was either {{chem|DbOX|4|-}} or {{chem|[Db(OH)|2|X|4|]|-}}. After extraction experiments of dubnium from [[hydrobromic acid|hydrogen bromide]] into [[diisobutyl carbinol]] (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than either protactinium or niobium. This was explained as an increasing tendency to form non\u2010extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation\u2010exchange columns with \u03b1\u2010hydroxyisobutyrate, like the group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested that dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.<ref name=Haire />\n\nThe first isothermal gas chromatography experiments were performed in 1992 with <sup>262</sup>Db (half-life 35 seconds). The volatilities for niobium and tantalum were similar within error limits, but dubnium appeared to be significantly less volatile. It was postulated that traces of oxygen in the system might have led to formation of {{chem|DbOBr|3}}, which was predicted to be less volatile than {{chem|DbBr|5}}. Later experiments in 1996 showed that group 5 chlorides were more volatile than the corresponding bromides, with the exception of tantalum, presumably due to formation of {{chem|TaOCl|3}}. Later volatility studies of chlorides of dubnium and niobium as a function of controlled partial pressures of oxygen showed that formation of oxychlorides and general volatility are dependent on concentrations of oxygen. The oxychlorides were shown to be less volatile than the chlorides.<ref name=Haire />\n\nIn 2004\u201305, researchers from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, <sup>268</sup>Db, as a fivefold alpha decay product of the newly created [[moscovium|element 115]]. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow further chemical experimentation, with a half-life of over a day. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer with dubnium was removed from the surface of the target and dissolved in [[aqua regia]] with tracers and a [[lanthanum]] carrier, from which various +3, +4, and +5 species were precipitated on adding [[ammonium hydroxide]]. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, where it converted to nitrate form and was then dried on a film and counted. Mostly containing a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, it also had a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further in both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and never in niobium-only fractions. It was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.<ref>{{cite report |first1=N. J. |last1=Stoyer |first2=J.

Like monosaccharides, disaccharides are [[solubility|soluble]] in water. Three common examples are [[sucrose]], [[lactose]],<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=disaccharides|file=D01776}}</ref> and [[maltose]].\n\nDisaccharides are one of the four chemical groupings of [[carbohydrate]]s  ([[monosaccharide]]s, disaccharides, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s).

Breaking apart a double sugar into its two simple sugars is accomplished by [[hydrolysis]] with the help of a type of [[enzyme]] called a [[disaccharidase]]. As building the larger sugar ejects a water molecule, breaking it down consumes a water molecule. These reactions are vital in [[metabolism]]. Each disaccharide is broken down with the help of a corresponding disaccharidase ([[sucrase]], [[lactase]], and [[maltase]]).\n\n==Classification==\nThere are two functionally different classes of disaccharides: \n*[[Reducing sugar|Reducing disaccharides]], in which one monosaccharide, the [[reducing sugar]] of the pair, still has a free [[hemiacetal]] unit that can perform as a reducing [[aldehyde]] group; [[cellobiose]] and [[maltose]] are examples of reducing disaccharides, each with one hemiacetal unit, the other occupied by the [[Glycoside|glycosidic]] bond, which prevents it from acting as a [[reducing agent]]. \n*[[Reducing sugar|Non-reducing disaccharides]], in which the component monosaccharides bond through an [[acetal]] linkage between their [[Anomer|anomeric]] centers. This results in neither monosaccharide being left with a hemiacetal unit that is free to act as a [[reducing agent]].  [[Sucrose]] and [[trehalose]] are examples of non-reducing disaccharides because their glycosidic bond is between their respective hemiacetal carbon atoms. The reduced chemical reactivity of the non-reducing sugars in comparison to reducing sugars, may be an advantage where stability in storage is important. \n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nomenclature of Carbohydrates (Recommendations 1996)2-Carb-36 Disaccharides.|url= http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/2carb/36.html}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Disaccharides and Oligosaccharides|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/mcgarveylab/Carbsyn/Carblist/html/disacch.html|accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\nThe formation of a disaccharide molecule from two [[monosaccharide]] molecules proceeds by displacing a [[hydroxyl]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] from one molecule and a [[Hydrogen atom|hydrogen nucleus]] (a [[proton]]) from the other, so that the now vacant bonds on the monosaccharides join the two [[monomer]]s together. The vacant bonds on the hydroxyl radical and the proton unite in their turn, forming a molecule of water, that then goes free. Because of the removal of the water molecule from the product, the term of convenience for such a process is \"[[dehydration reaction]]\" (also \"[[condensation reaction]]\" or \"[[Dehydration reaction|dehydration synthesis]]\"). For example, milk sugar ([[lactose]]) is a disaccharide made by condensation of one molecule of each of the monosaccharides [[glucose]] and [[galactose]], whereas the disaccharide [[sucrose]] in sugar cane and sugar beet, is a condensation product of [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. [[Maltose]], another common disaccharide, is condensed from two glucose molecules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=Ellie|title=Understanding Nutrition|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=California|isbn=0-538-73465-5|pages=100|edition=Twelfth|author2=Sharon Rady Rolfes|editor=Peggy Williams}}</ref> \n\nThe dehydration reaction that bonds monosaccharides into disaccharides (and also bonds monosaccharides into more complex [[polysaccharide]]s) forms what are called [[glycosidic bond]]s.<ref name=\"ochempal\">{{cite web |url=http://science.uvu.edu/ochem/index.php/alphabetical/g-h/glycosidic-link/ |title=Glycosidic Link |website=OChemPal |publisher=Utah Valley University |accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nThe glycosidic bond can be formed between any hydroxyl group on the component monosaccharide.

It is traditionally associated with the quantitative meter of classical [[epic poetry]] in both [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and was consequently considered to be ''the'' grand style of Western classical poetry. Some premier examples of its use are [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. Hexameters also form part of elegiac poetry in both languages, alternating with dactylic pentameters.\n\n== Structure ==\nA dactylic hexameter has six (in Greek \u1f15\u03be, ''hex'') [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]. In strict dactylic hexameter, each foot would be a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] (a long and two short syllables), but classical meter allows for the substitution of a [[spondee]] (two long syllables) in place of a dactyl in most positions. Specifically, the first four feet can either be dactyls or spondees more or less freely. The fifth foot is usually a dactyl (around 95% of the time in Homer).\n\nThe sixth foot can be filled by either a [[trochee]] (a long then short syllable) or a spondee. Thus the dactylic line most normally looks as follows:\n\n:\u2014 <u>u u</u> | \u2014 <u>u u</u> | \u2014 <u>u u</u> | \u2014 <u>u u</u> | \u2014 u u | \u2014 X\n\n(Note that '''\u2014''' = a [[long syllable]], '''u''' = a short syllable, '''<u>u u</u>''' = either one long or two shorts, and '''X''' = [[anceps]] syllable.)\n\nHexameters also have a primary [[caesura]]&mdash;a break between words, sometimes (but not always) coinciding with a break in sense&mdash;at one of several normal positions: After the first syllable of the second foot; after the first syllable in the third foot (the \"masculine\" caesura); after the second syllable in the third foot if the third foot is a dactyl (the \"feminine\" caesura); after the first syllable of the fourth foot (the hephthemimeral caesura).\n\nHexameters are frequently [[Enjambment|enjambed]]\u2014the meaning runs over from one line to the next, without terminal punctuation\u2014which helps to create the long, flowing narrative of epic. They are generally considered the most grandiose and formal meter.\n\nAn English-language example of the dactylic hexameter, in quantitative meter:\n\n: Down in a | deep dark | dell sat an | old cow | munching a | bean stalk\n\nQuantitative meter is extremely difficult to use for most English speakers. Here is an example in normal stress meter (the first line of Longfellow's \"[[Evangeline]]\"):\n\n: This is the | forest pri | meval.  The | murmuring | pines and the | hemlocks\n\nThe \"foot\" is often compared to a musical measure and the long and short syllables to [[half note]]s (minims) and quarter notes (crotchets), respectively.\n\n==Homer\u2019s meter==\n\nThe hexameter was first used by early Greek poets of the oral tradition, and the most complete extant examples of their works are the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', which influenced the authors of all later classical epics that survive today.  Early epic poetry was also accompanied by music, and [[Pitch accent|pitch changes]] associated with the accented Greek must have highlighted the melody, though the exact mechanism is still a topic of discussion.<ref>Cf. Alan Shaw's 1997 essay [http://electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/accentual Some Questions on Greek Poetry and Music]. Electronic Book Review. 1 March 1997. Retrieved 19 May 2017. </ref>\n\nThe Homeric poems arrange words so as to create an interplay between the metrical ictus\u2014the first syllable of each foot\u2014and the natural, spoken accent of words.  If the ictus and accent coincide too frequently the hexameter becomes \"sing-songy\". Thus in general, word breaks occur in the middle of metrical feet, while ictus and accent coincide more often near the end of the line.\nThe first line of Homer\u2019s ''Iliad''\u2014\"Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus\u2019 son Achilles\"\u2014provides an example:\n\n:{{lang|grc|\u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b9\u03bd \u1f04\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5, \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac, \u03a0\u03b7\u03bb\u03b7\u03ca\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bf\u03c2}}\n\nDividing the line into metrical units:\n\n:{{lang|grc|\u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b9\u03bd \u1f04 {{!}} \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5, \u03b8\u03b5 {{!}} \u03ac, \u03a0\u03b7 {{!}} \u03bb\u03b7\u03ca\u03ac {{!}} \u03b4\u03b5\u03c9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b9 {{!}} \u03bb\u1fc6\u03bf\u03c2}}<br>{{grc-tr|\u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b9\u03bd \u1f04 {{!}} \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5, \u03b8\u03b5 {{!}} \u03ac, \u03a0\u03b7 {{!}} \u03bb\u03b7\u03ca\u03ac {{!}} \u03b4\u03b5\u03c9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b9 {{!}} \u03bb\u1fc6\u03bf\u03c2}}<br>dactyl, dactyl, spondee, dactyl, dactyl, spondee.\n\nNote how the word endings do not coincide with the end of a metrical foot; for the early part of the line this forces the accent of each word to lie in the middle of a foot, playing against the ictus.\n\nThis line also includes a masculine caesura after {{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03b5\u03ac}}, a break that separates the line into two parts.  Homer employs a feminine caesura more commonly than later writers: an example occurs in ''Iliad'' I.5 \"...and every bird; thus the plan of Zeus came to fulfillment\":\n\n:{{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03af \u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9, \u0394\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4\u2019 \u1f10\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae,}}\n:{{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03c9 {{!}} \u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03af \u03c4\u03b5 {{!}} \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9, \u0394\u03b9 {{!}} \u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4\u2019 \u1f10\u03c4\u03b5 {{!}} \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf {{!}} \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae,}}\n:{{grc-tr|\u03bf\u1f30\u03c9 {{!}} \u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03af \u03c4\u03b5 {{!}} \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9, \u0394\u03b9 {{!}} \u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4\u2019 \u1f10\u03c4\u03b5 {{!}} \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf {{!}} \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae,}}\n\nHomer\u2019s hexameters contain a higher proportion of dactyls than later hexameter poetry. They are also characterised by a laxer following of verse principles than later epicists almost invariably adhered to. For example, Homer allows spondaic fifth feet (albeit not often), whereas many later authors virtually never did.  \n\nHomer also altered the forms of words to allow them to fit the hexameter, typically by using a [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialectal]] form: ''ptolis'' is an epic form used instead of the Attic ''polis'' as necessary for the meter. Proper names sometimes take forms to fit the meter, for example ''Pouludamas'' instead of the metrically unviable ''Poludamas''.\n \nNote also that some lines require a knowledge of the digamma for their scansion, e.g. ''Iliad'' I.108 \"you have not yet spoken a good word nor brought one to pass\":\n\n:{{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c3\u03b8\u03bb\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u2019 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c4\u03ad \u03c4\u03af \u03c0\u03c9 \u03b5\u1f36\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u2019 \u1f10\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2}}\n\nHere the word {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}} was originally {{lang|grc|\u03dd\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}} in Ionian; the digamma, later lost, lengthened the last syllable of the preceding {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f36\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2}} and removed the apparent defect in the meter. A digamma also saved the hiatus in the third foot. This example demonstrates the oral tradition of the Homeric epics that flourished before they were written down sometime in the 7th century BC.\n\nIn spite of the occasional exceptions in early epic, most of the later rules of hexameter composition have their origins in the methods and practices of Homer.\n\n==Latin hexameter==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe hexameter came into Latin as an adaptation from Greek long after the practice of singing the epics had faded.  Consequentially, the properties of the meter were learned as specific \"rules\" rather than as a natural result of musical expression.  Also, because the Latin language generally has a higher proportion of long syllables than Greek, it is by nature more spondaic.  Thus the Latin hexameter took on characteristics of its own.\n\nThe earliest example of hexameter in Latin poetry is the ''Annales'' of [[Ennius]], which established it as the standard for later Latin epics. Later Republican writers, such as [[Lucretius]], [[Catullus]] and even [[Cicero]], wrote hexameter compositions, and it was at this time that many of the principles of Latin hexameter were firmly established, and followed by later writers such as [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]], and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]]. [[Virgil]]'s opening line for the ''[[Aeneid]]'' is a classic example::\n\n \u2013  u  u|\u2013  u   u|\u2013    \u2013|\u2013   \u2013 |  \u2013 u  u| \u2013 \u2013\n {{lang|la|Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris}} \n:\"I sing of arms and the man, who first from the shores of Troy...\"\n\nAs in Greek, lines were arranged so that the metrically long syllables\u2014those occurring at the beginning of a foot\u2014often avoided the natural stress of a word. In the earlier feet of a line, meter and stress were expected to clash, while in the later feet they were expected to resolve and coincide\u2014an effect that gives each line a natural \"dum-ditty-dum-dum\" (\"shave and a haircut\") rhythm to close. Such an arrangement is a balance between an exaggerated emphasis on the metre\u2014which would cause the verse to be sing-songy\u2014and the need to provide some repeated rhythmic guide for skilled recitation.\n\nIn the following example of Ennius's early Latin hexameter composition, metrical weight (''{{lang|la|ictus}}'') falls on the first and last syllables of ''{{lang|la|certabant}}''; the ictus is therefore opposed to the natural stress on the second syllable when the word is pronounced.  Similarly, the second syllable of the words ''{{lang|la|urbem}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Romam}}'' carry the metrical ictus even though the first is naturally stressed in typical pronunciation.  In the closing feet of the line, the natural stress that falls on the third syllable of ''{{lang|la|Remoramne}}'' and the second syllable of ''{{lang|la|vocarent}}'' coincide with the metrical ictus and produce the characteristic \"shave and a haircut\" ending:\n\n  \u2013  \u2013|\u2013   \u2013| \u2013   \u2013|\u2013   u u|\u2013  u  u|\u2013 \u2013\n {{lang|la|certabant urbem Romam Remoramne vocarent.}} (Ennius, ''Annales'' 1.86)\n:\"they were disputing whether they should call the city 'Roma' or 'Remora'.\"\n\nLike their Greek predecessors, classical Latin poets avoided a large number of word breaks at the ends of foot divisions except between the fourth and fifth, where it was encouraged.  In order to preserve the rhythmic close, Latin poets avoided the placement of a single syllable or four-syllable word at the end of a line.  The caesura is also handled far more strictly, with Homer's feminine caesura becoming exceedingly rare, and the second-foot caesura always paired with one in the fourth.\n\nOne example of the evolution of the Latin verse form can be seen in a comparative analysis of the use of spondees in Ennius' time vs. the Augustan age.  The repeated use of the heavily spondaic line came to be frowned upon, as well as the use of a high proportion of spondees in both of the first two feet. The following lines of Ennius would not have been felt admissible by later authors since they both contain repeated spondees at the beginning of consecutive lines:\n\n  \u2013   \u2013| \u2013    \u2013 | \u2013 u   u|\u2013  \u2013 | \u2013  u  u|\u2013  \u2013\n {{lang|la|his verbis: \"o gnata, tibi sunt ante ferendae}}\n \u2013  \u2013| \u2013    \u2013 | \u2013    u u|\u2013 \u2013| \u2013 u  u|\u2013  \u2013\n {{lang|la|aerumnae, post ex fluvio fortuna resistet.\"}} (''Annales'' 1.42f)\n:\"with these words: 'o daughter, tribulations must first be borne by you;\n:later your fortune will rise again from the river.'\"\n\nHowever, it is from Virgil that the following famous, heavily spondaic line comes:\n\n  \u2013        \u2013| \u2013      \u2013| \u2013     \u2013| \u2013     \u2013|  \u2013 u  u|\u2013   \u2013\n {{lang|la|monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.}} (''Aeneid'' III.658)\n:\"a huge, shapeless, horrendous monster, whose light [i.e., its eye] had been removed\"\n\n==Virgil and the Augustan poets==\n\nBy the age of Augustus, poets like Virgil closely followed the rules of the meter and approached it in a highly rhetorical way, looking for effects that can be exploited in skilled recitation.  For example, the following line from the ''Aeneid'' (VIII.596) describes the movement of rushing horses and how \"a hoof shakes the crumbling field with a galloping sound\":\n\n   \u2013  u u|\u2013  u  u| \u2013   u u|\u2013   u u| \u2013  u u| \u2013  \u2013 \n {{lang|la|quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum}}\n\nThis line is made up of five dactyls and a closing spondee, an unusual rhythmic arrangement that imitates the described action.  A similar effect is found in VIII.452, where Virgil describes how the blacksmith sons of Vulcan \"lift their arms with great strength one to another\" in forging Aeneas' shield:\n\n \u2013    \u2013| \u2013   \u2013|\u2013  \u2013| \u2013  \u2013|  \u2013   uu| \u2013  \u2013\n {{lang|la|illi inter sese multa vi bracchia tollunt}}\n\nThe line consists of all spondees except for the usual dactyl in the fifth foot, and is meant to mimic the pounding sound of the work.  A third example that mixes the two effects comes from I.42, where Juno pouts that Athena was allowed to use Jove's thunderbolts to destroy Ajax (\"she hurled Jove's quick fire from the clouds\"):\n\n \u2013  u  u|\u2013   u u|\u2013   u u|\u2013   \u2013| \u2013 u u| \u2013  \u2013\n {{lang|la|ipsa Iovis rapidum iaculata e nubibus ignem}}\n\nThis line is nearly all dactyls except for the spondee at ''-lata e''.  This change in rhythm paired with the harsh elision is intended to emphasize the crash of Athena's thunderbolt.\n\nVirgil will occasionally deviate from the strict rules of the meter to produce a special effect.  One example from I.105 describing a ship at sea during a storm has Virgil violating metrical standards to place a single-syllable word at the end of the line:\n\n {{lang|la|...et undis}}\n  \u2013   u u | \u2013  u  u|\u2013   u u|\u2013   \u2013| \u2013  u  u | \u2013  \u2013\n {{lang|la|dat latus; insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons.}}\n\nThe boat \"gives its side to the waves; there comes next in a heap a steep mountain of water.\"  By placing the monosyllable ''mons'' at the end of the line, Virgil interrupts the usual \"shave and a haircut\" pattern to produce a jarring rhythm, an effect that echoes the crash of a large wave against the side of a ship.  The Roman poet [[Horace]] uses a similar trick to highlight the comedic irony that \"Mountains will be in labor, and bring forth a ridiculous mouse\" in this famous line from his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (line 139):\n\n  -  u u|-   -| -    -| - -|  - u u|-   -\n {{lang|la|Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus,}}\n\nAnother amusing example that comments on the importance of these verse rules comes later in the same poem (line 263):\n\n  \u2013    \u2013|\u2013   u u| \u2013  u u|\u2013 u u|\u2013 u u| \u2013 \u2013\n {{lang|la|Non quivis videt inmodulata poemata iudex,}}\n\nThis line, which lacks a proper caesura, is translated \"Not every critic sees an inharmonious verse.\"\n\n==Silver Age and later heroic verse==\n\nThe verse innovations of the Augustan writers were carefully imitated by their successors in the Silver Age of [[Latin literature]]. The verse form itself then was little changed, as the quality of a poet's hexameter was judged against the standard set by Virgil and the other Augustan poets, a respect for literary precedent encompassed by the Latin word ''{{lang|la|aemulatio}}''.<ref>E.g., the younger Pliny, in referring to an orator who prided himself on not attempting to rival Cicero, replied, ''{{lang|la|Est enim ... mihi cum Cicerone aemulatio, nec sum contentus eloquentia saeculi nostri; nam stultissimum credo ad imitandum non optima quaeque proponere.}}'' (\"I do attempt to emulate Cicero, as I am not content with the eloquence of our age; I think it's idiotic not to imitate the best examples.\") \u2013''Letters'' I.5.12\u20133</ref>  Deviations were generally regarded as idiosyncrasies or hallmarks of personal style, and were not imitated by later poets. [[Juvenal]], for example, was fond of occasionally creating verses that placed a sense break between the fourth and fifth foot (instead of in the usual caesura positions), but this technique\u2014known as the bucolic diaeresis\u2014did not catch on with other poets.\n\nIn the late empire, writers experimented again by adding unusual restrictions to the standard hexameter.  The rhopalic verse of [[Ausonius]] is a good example; besides following the standard hexameter pattern, each word in the line is one syllable longer than the previous, e.g.:\n\n:{{lang|la|Spes, deus, aeternae stationis conciliator,}}\n:{{lang|la|si castis precibus veniales invigilamus,}}\n:{{lang|la|his, pater, oratis placabilis adstipulare.}}\n\nAlso notable is the tendency among late grammarians to thoroughly dissect the hexameters of Virgil and earlier poets.  A treatise on poetry by [[Diomedes Grammaticus]] is a good example, as this work (among other things) categorizes dactylic hexameter verses in ways that were later interpreted under the [[golden line]] rubric.  Independently, these two trends show the form becoming highly artificial\u2014more like a puzzle to solve than a medium for personal poetic expression.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, some writers adopted more relaxed versions of the meter. [[Bernard of Cluny]], for example, employs it in his ''De Contemptu Mundi'', but ignores classical conventions in favor of accentual effects and predictable rhyme both within and between verses, e.g.:\n\n:{{lang|la|Hora novissima, tempora pessima sunt &mdash; vigilemus.<br>Ecce minaciter imminet arbiter ille supremus.<br>Imminet imminet ut mala terminet, aequa coronet,<br>Recta remuneret, anxia liberet, aethera donet.}}\n::(I.1-4:  These are the last days, the worst of times: let us keep watch.<br>Behold the menacing arrival of the supreme Judge.<br>He is coming, he is coming to end evil, crown the just,<br>Reward the right, set the worried free and give the skies.)\n\nNot all medieval writers are so at odds with the Virgilian standard, and with the rediscovery of classical literature, later Medieval and Renaissance writers are far more orthodox, but by then the form had become an academic exercise. [[Petrarch]], for example, devoted much time to his ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', a dactylic hexameter epic on [[Scipio Africanus]], but this work was unappreciated in his time and remains little read today.  In contrast, [[Dante]] decided to write his epic, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' in Italian\u2014a choice that defied the traditional epic choice of Latin dactylic hexameters\u2014and produced a masterpiece beloved both then and now.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nWith the [[New Latin]] period, the language itself came to be regarded as a medium only for \"serious\" and learned expression, a view that left little room for Latin poetry.  The emergence of [[Recent Latin]] in the 20th century restored classical orthodoxy among Latinists and sparked a general (if still academic) interest in the beauty of Latin poetry.  Today, the modern Latin poets who use the dactylic hexameter are generally as faithful to Virgil as Rome's Silver Age poets.\n\n==Hip-hop and rap==\nIn addition to modern Latin poets, examples of dactylic hexameter in modern use can frequently be found in hip-hop and rap lyrics, though it is not definitively researched enough to declare whether it is derived from the ephemeral notion of \"flow\" (such as in the music of [[Jay Z|Jay-Z]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Chris-childs-dont-disrespect-the-flow-homer-annotated|title=Chris Childs \u2013 Don't Disrespect the Flow: Homer|website=Genius|access-date=2016-08-31}}</ref>) or more intentionally employed by major artists in the poetic creation of their lyrics. The relationship between dactylic hexameter and hip-hop/rap has been notably used in teaching classic poetry to young students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/hip-hop_hexameter_/|title=\"Hip-Hop Hexameter\" Gives Virgil The Beat  {{!}}  New Haven Independent|date=2013-11-18|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-31}}</ref> Dactylic hexameter in rap/hip-hop is most frequently mentioned in discussions of the song \"[[Bring the Noise]]\" by the musical artists [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. \"Bring the Noise\"   has been sampled and remixed by other artists, and both the original song and cover versions have performed well on industry trackers such as the [[Billboard charts]] \u2013 across musical genres and different countries/linguistic groups \u2013 which may anecdotally indicate the strength of dactylic hexameter in conveying lyrical quality to the human ear, particularly when it is considered that the meter has had enduring success for artists from the time of Homer through the modern day.\n\n==Other languages==\n''[[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]'' (''Metai'') by [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]] is a famous [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] poem in quantitative dactylic hexameters. Because of the nature of Lithuanian, more than half of the lines of the poem consist entirely of spondees save for the mandatory dactyl in the fifth foot.\n\n[[Jean-Antoine de Ba\u00eff]] elaborated a system which used original graphemes for regulating French versification by [[Syllable weight|quantity]] on the Greco-Roman model, a system which came to be known as ''[[Musique mesur\u00e9e#History|vers mesur\u00e9s]]'', or ''vers mesur\u00e9s \u00e0 l'antique'', which the French language of the Renaissance permitted.

Its name refers to the [[Coryphaena|dolphinfish]] (''Coryphaena hippurus''), which is known as ''dorado'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], although it has also been depicted as a [[swordfish]]. Dorado contains most of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], the remainder being in the constellation [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]]. The South [[Ecliptic pole]] also lies within this constellation.\n\nEven though the name Dorado is not [[Latin]] but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin [[genitive]] form ''Doradus'' when naming its stars; it is treated (like the adjacent asterism [[Argo Navis]]) as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -\u014d (like ''Io'' or ''Callisto'' or ''Argo''), which have a genitive ending ''-\u016bs''.\n\n==History==\nDorado was one of twelve constellations named by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]],{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=142\u2013143}}.

The determinant of a matrix {{math|''A''}} is denoted {{math|det(''A'')}}, {{math|det ''A''}}, or {{math|{{abs|''A''}}}}. Geometrically, it can be viewed as the scaling factor of the [[Linear map|linear transformation]] described by the matrix.\n\nIn the case of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix the determinant may be defined as:\n:<math>\\begin{align}|A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b\\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix}=ad - bc .\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, for a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ''A'', its determinant is:\n::<math>\\begin{align}|A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c\\\\d & e & f\\\\g & h & i \\end{vmatrix} = \na\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ \\Box & e & f \\\\ \\Box & h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \nb\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & \\Box & f \\\\ g & \\Box & i \\end{vmatrix} + \nc\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & e & \\Box \\\\ g & h & \\Box \\end{vmatrix}\n&= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \nb\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + \nc\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix}\\\\ &= aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh.\\end{align}</math>\nEach determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix in this equation is called a \"[[minor (linear algebra)|minor]]\" of the matrix {{math|''A''}}.  This procedure can be extended to give a recursive definition for the determinant of an {{nowrap|n \u00d7 n}} matrix, the ''minor expansion formula''.\n\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the [[coefficient]]s in a [[system of linear equations]], and the determinant can be used to [[Cramer's rule|solve]] those equations, although other methods of solution are much more computationally efficient. In linear algebra, a matrix (with entries in a [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is [[inverse matrix|invertible]] if and only if its determinant is non-zero, and correspondingly the matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is zero. This leads to the use of determinants in defining the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a matrix, whose roots are the [[eigenvalue]]s. In analytic geometry, determinants express the signed ''n''-dimensional volumes of ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]]s. This leads to the use of determinants in [[calculus]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] in the [[change of variables]] rule for integrals of functions of several variables. Determinants appear frequently in algebraic identities such as the [[Vandermonde identity]].\n\nDeterminants possess many algebraic properties, including that the determinant of a [[matrix multiplication|product of matrices]] is equal to the product of determinants. Special types of matrices have special determinants; for example, the determinant of an [[orthogonal matrix]] is always plus or minus one, and the determinant of a complex [[Hermitian matrix]] is always [[real number|real]].\n\n==Geometric meaning==\nIf an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[Real number|real]] matrix ''A'' is written in terms of its column vectors <math>A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\ \\ \\bold{a}_1 \\!\\!&|&\\!\\! \\bold{a}_2 \\!\\!&|&\\!\\! \\cdots \\!\\!&|&\\!\\! \\bold{a}_n\\ \\ \\end{bmatrix}</math> then \n:<math>A\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\\\vdots\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}=\\bold{a}_1, \\quad A\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix}=\\bold{a}_2, \\ldots, \\quad  A\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\\\vdots\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}=\\bold{a}_n. \n</math>\n\nThis means that <math>A</math> maps the unit [[n-cube]] to the ''n''-dimensional [[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] defined by the vectors <math>\\bold{a}_1, \\bold{a}_2, \\ldots,  \\bold{a}_n</math>, the region <math>P = \\{ c_1 \\bold{a}_1 +\\cdots+c_n\\bold{a}_n \\mid 0 \\leq c_i\\leq 1 \\ \\forall i \\}.</math>\nThe determinant gives the [[Orientation (vector space)|signed]] n-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, <math>\\det(A) = \\pm \\text{vol}(P)</math>, and hence describes more generally the ''n''-dimensional volume scaling factor of the [[linear transformation]] produced by ''A''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/determinants-volumes.html|title=Determinants and Volumes|author=|date=|website=textbooks.math.gatech.edu|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]].) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully ''n''-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of ''A'' is less than ''n''. This [[Rank\u2013nullity theorem|means]] that ''A'' produces a linear transformation which is neither [[surjective function|onto]] nor [[Injective function|one-to-one]], and so is not invertible.\n\n== Definition ==\nThere are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a [[square matrix]] ''A'', i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns.  Perhaps the simplest way to express the determinant is by considering the elements in the top row and the respective [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]]; starting at the left, multiply the element by the minor, then subtract the product of the next element and its minor, and alternate adding and subtracting such products until all elements in the top row have been exhausted.  For example, here is the result for a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix:\n::<math>\\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c & d\\\\e & f & g & h\\\\i & j & k & l\\\\m & n & o & p \\end{vmatrix}=a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} f & g & h\\\\j & k & l\\\\n & o & p \\end{vmatrix}-b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & g & h\\\\i & k & l\\\\m & o & p \\end{vmatrix}+c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & h\\\\i & j & l\\\\m & n & p \\end{vmatrix}-d\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & g\\\\i & j & k\\\\m & n & o \\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\nAnother way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix.  If we write an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'' in terms of its column vectors\n\n: <math>A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1, & a_2, & \\ldots, & a_n \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the <math>a_j</math> are vectors of size ''n'', then the determinant of ''A'' is defined so that\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1, & \\ldots, & b a_j + c v, & \\ldots, a_n \\end{bmatrix} = b \\det(A) + c \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1, & \\ldots, & v, & \\ldots, a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n& \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1, & \\ldots, & a_j, & a_{j+1}, & \\ldots, a_n \\end{bmatrix} = - \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1, & \\ldots, & a_{j+1}, & a_j, & \\ldots, a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n& \\det(I) = 1\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' are scalars, ''v'' is any vector of size ''n'' and ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n''.  These equations say that the determinant is a linear function of each column, that interchanging adjacent columns reverses the sign of the determinant, and that the determinant of the identity matrix is 1. These properties mean that the determinant is an alternating multilinear function of the columns that maps the identity matrix to the underlying unit scalar.  These suffice to uniquely calculate the determinant of any square matrix. Provided the underlying scalars form a field (more generally, a commutative ring with unity), the definition below shows that such a function exists, and it can be shown to be unique.<ref>[[Serge Lang]], ''Linear Algebra'', 2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1971, pp 173, 191.</ref>\n\nEquivalently, the determinant can be expressed as a sum of products of entries of the matrix where each product has ''n'' terms and the coefficient of each product is \u22121 or 1 or 0 according to a given rule: it is a [[polynomial expression]] of the matrix entries. This expression grows rapidly with the size of the matrix (an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix contributes [[Factorial|''n''!]] terms), so it will first be given explicitly for the case of {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrices and {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrices, followed by the rule for arbitrary size matrices, which subsumes these two cases.\n\nAssume ''A'' is a square matrix with ''n'' rows and ''n'' columns, so that it can be written as\n:<math>\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\na_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n,1} & a_{n,2} & \\dots & a_{n,n} \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nThe entries can be numbers or expressions (as happens when the determinant is used to define a [[characteristic polynomial]]); the definition of the determinant depends only on the fact that they can be added and multiplied together in a [[Commutativity|commutative]] manner.\n\nThe determinant of ''A'' is denoted by det(''A''), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets:\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\na_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n,1} & a_{n,2} & \\dots & a_{n,n} \\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\n=== 2 \u00d7 2 matrices ===\n[[File:Area parallellogram as determinant.svg|thumb|right|The area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors representing the parallelogram's sides.]]\nThe [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix} a & b\\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix}=ad - bc .</math>\n\nIf the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix ''A'' can be used to represent two [[linear map]]s:  one that maps the [[standard basis]] vectors to the rows of ''A'', and one that maps them to the columns of ''A''.  In either case, the images of the basis vectors form a [[parallelogram]] that represents the image of the [[unit square]] under the mapping.  The parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}, {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'')}}, and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}, as shown in the accompanying diagram.\n\nThe absolute value of {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by ''A''. (The parallelogram formed by the columns of ''A'' is in general a different parallelogram, but since the determinant is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, the area will be the same.)\n\nThe absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the ''oriented area'' of the parallelogram. The oriented area is the same as the usual [[area (geometry)|area]], except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the [[identity matrix]]).\n\nTo show that {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors {{nowrap|1='''a''' = (''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|1='''b''' = (''c'', ''d'')}} representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}sin''\u03b8''}} for the angle ''\u03b8'' between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the [[sine]] this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the [[cosine]] of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. {{nowrap|1='''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup> = (''-b'', ''a'')}}, such that {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup>{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}cos''\u03b8' ''}}, which can be determined by the pattern of the [[scalar product]] to be equal to {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}:\n\n: <math>\\text{Signed Area} = |\\boldsymbol a||\\boldsymbol b|\\sin\\theta = |\\boldsymbol a^{\\perp}||\\boldsymbol b|\\cos\\theta' = \\begin{pmatrix} -b \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} = ad - bc.</math>\n\nThus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by ''A''. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is [[Equiareal map|equi-areal]] and orientation-preserving.\n\nThe object known as the ''[[bivector]]'' is related to these ideas. In 2D, it can be interpreted as an ''oriented plane segment'' formed by imagining two vectors each with origin {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, and coordinates {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}. The bivector magnitude (denoted by {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'') \u2227 (''c'', ''d'')}}) is the ''signed area'', which is also the determinant {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XghF70fqkY WildLinAlg episode 4], Norman J Wildberger, Univ. of New South Wales, 2010, lecture via youtube</ref>\n\n=== 3 \u00d7 3 matrices ===\n[[File:Determinant parallelepiped.svg|300px|right|thumb|The volume of this [[parallelepiped]] is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the rows constructed from the vectors r1, r2, and r3.]]\n\nThe [[Laplace expansion|Laplace formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\d&e&f\\\\g&h&i\\end{vmatrix} & = a\\begin{vmatrix}e&f\\\\h&i\\end{vmatrix}-b\\begin{vmatrix}d&f\\\\g&i\\end{vmatrix}+c\\begin{vmatrix}d&e\\\\g&h\\end{vmatrix} \\\\\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nthis can be expanded out to give\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\d&e&f\\\\g&h&i\\end{vmatrix}  & = a(ei-fh)-b(di-fg)+c(dh-eg) \\\\\n& = aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nwhich is the [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix.\n\n[[File:Sarrus rule.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''Sarrus' rule'': The determinant of the three columns on the left is the sum of the products along the solid diagonals minus the sum of the products along the dashed diagonals]]\n\nThe [[rule of Sarrus]] is a mnemonic for the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration.

The value in the ''i''th position after the reordering \u03c3 is denoted by \u03c3<sub>''i''</sub>. For example, for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, the original sequence 1, 2, 3 might be reordered to {{nowrap|1=\u03c3 = [2, 3, 1]}}, with {{nowrap|1=\u03c3<sub>1</sub> = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=\u03c3<sub>2</sub> = 3}}, and {{nowrap|1=\u03c3<sub>3</sub> = 1}}.  The set of all such permutations (also known as the [[symmetric group]] on ''n'' elements) is denoted by S<sub>''n''</sub>. For each permutation \u03c3, sgn(\u03c3) denotes the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of \u03c3, a value that is +1 whenever the reordering given by \u03c3 can be achieved by successively interchanging two entries an even number of times, and \u22121 whenever it can be achieved by an odd number of such interchanges.\n\nIn any of the <math>n!</math> summands, the term\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma_i}</math>\n\nis notation for the product of the entries at positions {{nowrap|(''i'', \u03c3<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, where ''i'' ranges from 1 to ''n'':\n\n:<math>a_{1, \\sigma_1} \\cdot a_{2, \\sigma_2} \\cdots  a_{n, \\sigma_n}.</math>\n\nFor example, the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix ''A'' ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}) is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\sgn(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma_i}\n\n= {} & \\sgn([1,2,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} + \\sgn([1,3,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} + \\sgn([2,1,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} \\\\ & {} + \\sgn([2,3,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\sgn([3,1,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} + \\sgn([3,2,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i}\n\n\\\\\n\n= {} & \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i}\n\n\\\\\n\n= {} & a_{1,1}a_{2,2}a_{3,3}-a_{1,1}a_{2,3}a_{3,2}-a_{1,2}a_{2,1}a_{3,3}+a_{1,2}a_{2,3}a_{3,1} \\\\\n& {} +a_{1,3}a_{2,1}a_{3,2}-a_{1,3}a_{2,2}a_{3,1}.\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==== Levi-Civita symbol ====\nIt is sometimes useful to extend the Leibniz formula to a summation in which not only permutations, but all sequences of ''n'' indices in the  range {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}} occur, ensuring that the contribution of a sequence will be zero unless it denotes a permutation. Thus the totally antisymmetric [[Levi-Civita symbol]] <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n}</math> extends the signature of a permutation, by setting <math>\\varepsilon_{\\sigma(1),\\cdots,\\sigma(n)}=\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)</math> for any permutation \u03c3 of ''n'', and <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n}=0</math> when no permutation \u03c3 exists such that <math>\\sigma(j)=i_j</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math> (or equivalently, whenever some pair of indices are equal).

To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a [[standard basis]] vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property&nbsp;9) or else \u00b11 (by properties 1 and&nbsp;12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear. For matrices over non-commutative rings, properties 8 and 9 are incompatible for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 2}},<ref>In a non-commutative setting left-linearity (compatibility with left-multiplication by scalars) should be distinguished from right-linearity.

There is no useful notion of multi-linear functions over a non-commutative ring.</ref> so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.\n\nProperty 2 above implies that properties for columns have their counterparts in terms of rows:\n# <li value=\"11\">Viewing an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix as being composed of ''n'' rows, the determinant is an ''n''-linear function.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an alternating form: whenever two rows of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0.\n# Interchanging any pair of columns or rows of a matrix multiplies its determinant by&nbsp;\u22121. This follows from properties 8 and 10 (it is a general property of multilinear alternating maps). More generally, any permutation of the rows or columns multiplies the determinant by the [[parity of a permutation|sign]] of the permutation. By permutation, it is meant viewing each row as a vector '''R'''<sub>''i''</sub> (equivalently each column as '''C'''<sub>''i''</sub>) and reordering the rows (or columns) by interchange of '''R'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''R'''<sub>''k''</sub> (or '''C'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''C'''<sub>''k''</sub>), where ''j'',''k'' are two indices chosen from 1 to ''n'' for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} square matrix.\n# Adding a scalar multiple of one column to ''another'' column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of properties 8 and 10 in the following way: by property&nbsp;8 the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property&nbsp;10. Similarly, adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row leaves the determinant unchanged.\n</li>\n\nProperty 5 says that the determinant on {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices is [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree ''n''. These properties can be used to facilitate the computation of determinants by simplifying the matrix to the point where the determinant can be determined immediately. Specifically, for matrices with coefficients in a [[field (mathematics)|field]], properties 13 and 14 can be used to transform any matrix into a triangular matrix, whose determinant is given by property&nbsp;7; this is essentially the method of [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nFor example, the determinant of\n\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}-2&2&-3\\\\\n-1& 1& 3\\\\\n2 &0 &-1\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\ncan be computed using the following matrices:\n\n:<math>B = \\begin{bmatrix}-2&2&-3\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4.5\\\\\n2 &0 &-1\\end{bmatrix},\n\\quad\nC = \\begin{bmatrix}-2&2&-3\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4.5\\\\\n0 & 2 &-4\\end{bmatrix},\n\\quad\nD = \\begin{bmatrix}-2&2&-3\\\\\n0 & 2 &-4\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4.5\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nHere, ''B'' is obtained from ''A'' by adding \u22121/2\u00d7the first row to the second, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = det(''B'')}}. ''C'' is obtained from ''B'' by adding the first to the third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''C'') = det(''B'')}}. Finally, ''D'' is obtained from ''C'' by exchanging the second and third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''D'') = \u2212det(''C'')}}. The determinant of the (upper) triangular matrix ''D'' is the product of its entries on the [[main diagonal]]: {{nowrap|1=(\u22122) \u00b7 2 \u00b7 4.5 = \u221218}}. Therefore, {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = \u2212det(''D'') = +18}}.\n\n=== Schur complement ===\nThe following identity holds for a [[Schur complement]] of a square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:\n\nThe Schur complement arises as the result of performing a block [[Gaussian elimination]] by multiplying the matrix ''M'' from the right with the \"block lower triangular\" matrix\n\n:<math>L=\\left[\\begin{matrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{matrix}\\right].</math>\n\nHere ''I''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes a ''p''&#xD7;''p'' [[identity matrix]]. After multiplication with the matrix ''L'' the Schur complement appears in the upper ''p''&#xD7;''p'' block. The product matrix is\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nML &= \\left[\\begin{matrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{matrix}\\right]\\left[\\begin{matrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix} A-BD^{-1}C & B \\\\ 0 & D \\end{matrix}\\right] \\\\\n&= \\left[\\begin{matrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{matrix}\\right] \\left[\\begin{matrix} A-BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{matrix}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThat is, we have effected a Gaussian decomposition\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\left[\\begin{matrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{matrix}\\right] &= \\left[\\begin{matrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{matrix}\\right] \\left[\\begin{matrix} A-BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\left[ \\begin{matrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{matrix}\\right],\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe first and last matrices on the RHS have determinant unity,  so we have\n\n:<math>\n{\\rm det}\\left|\\begin{matrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{matrix}\\right| = {\\rm det}|D|\\,{\\rm det} |A-BD^{-1} C|.\n</math>\n\nThis is Schur's determinant identity.\n=== Multiplicativity and matrix groups ===\nThe determinant of a [[matrix product]] of square matrices equals the product of their determinants:\n\n:<math>\\det(AB) = \\det (A) \\det (B).</math>\n\nThus the determinant is a ''multiplicative map''. This property is a consequence of the characterization given above of the determinant as the unique ''n''-linear alternating function of the columns with value&nbsp;1 on the identity matrix, since the function {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} that maps {{nowrap|''M'' \u21a6 det(''AM'')}} can easily be seen to be ''n''-linear and alternating in the columns of ''M'', and takes the value det(''A'') at the identity. The formula can be generalized  to (square) products of rectangular matrices, giving the [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]], which also provides an independent proof of the multiplicative property.\n\nThe determinant det(''A'') of a matrix ''A'' is non-zero if and only if ''A'' is invertible or, yet another equivalent statement, if its [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] equals the size of the matrix. If so, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by\n:<math>\\det (A^{-1}) = \\frac 1 {\\det (A)}.</math>\n\nIn particular, products and inverses of matrices with determinant one still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size ''n'') form a group known as the [[special linear group]]. More generally, the word \"special\" indicates the subgroup of another [[matrix group]] of matrices of determinant one. Examples include the [[special orthogonal group]] (which if ''n'' is 2 or 3 consists of all [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]]), and the [[special unitary group]].\n\n=== Laplace's formula and the adjugate matrix ===\n[[Laplace expansion|Laplace's formula]] expresses the determinant of a matrix in terms of its [[minor (matrix)|minors]]. The minor ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is defined to be the determinant of the {{nowrap|(''n''\u22121) \u00d7 (''n''\u22121)}}-matrix that results from ''A'' by removing the ''i''-th row and the ''j''-th column. The expression {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''i''+''j''</sup>''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} is known as a [[cofactor (linear algebra)|cofactor]]. The determinant of ''A'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{i,j} M_{i,j}</math> (for a fixed <math>i</math>) <math>= \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{i,j} M_{i,j}</math> (for a fixed <math>j</math>)\n\nCalculating det(''A'') by means of this formula is referred to as expanding the determinant along a row, the ''i''-th row using the first form with fixed ''i'', or expanding along a column, using the second form with fixed ''j''. For example, the Laplace expansion of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}-2&2&-3\\\\\n-1& 1& 3\\\\\n2 &0 &-1\\end{bmatrix},</math>\nalong the second column ({{nowrap|1=''j'' = 2}} and the sum runs over ''i'') is given by,\n{| border=\"0\"\n|-\n|<math>\\det(A)</math>\n|<math>=</math>\n|<math>(-1)^{1+2}\\cdot 2 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-1&3\\\\ 2 &-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{2+2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\ 2&-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{3+2}\\cdot 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\ -1&3\\end{vmatrix} </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>=</math>\n|<math>(-2)\\cdot((-1)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot3)+1\\cdot((-2)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot(-3))</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>=</math>\n|<math>(-2)\\cdot(-5)+8 = 18.</math>\n|-\n|\n|}\nHowever, Laplace expansion is efficient for small matrices only.\n\nThe [[adjugate matrix]] adj(''A'') is the transpose of the matrix consisting of the cofactors, i.e.,\n:<math>(\\operatorname{adj}(A))_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{j,i}.</math>\nIn terms of the adjugate matrix, Laplace's expansion can be written as<ref>\u00a7&nbsp;0.8.2 of R.

(Here it is understood that an eigenvalue with [[algebraic multiplicity]]  {{mvar|\u03bc}} occurs {{mvar|\u03bc}} times in this list.)

Thus, for complex matrices {{mvar|A}},\n:<math>\\det(\\exp(A)) = \\exp(\\operatorname{tr}(A))</math>\nor, for real matrices   {{mvar|A}},\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}(A) = \\log(\\det(\\exp(A))). </math>\nHere exp({{mvar|A}}) denotes the [[matrix exponential]] of   {{mvar|A}}, because every eigenvalue {{mvar|\u03bb}} of {{mvar|A}} corresponds to the eigenvalue exp({{mvar|\u03bb}}) of exp({{mvar|A}}). In particular, given any [[matrix logarithm|logarithm]] of  {{mvar|A}}, that is, any matrix {{mvar|L}} satisfying\n:<math>\\exp(L) = A</math>\nthe determinant of   {{mvar|A}} is given by\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\exp(\\operatorname{tr}(L)). </math>\n\nFor example, for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}},  and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}, respectively,\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\bigl( (\\operatorname{tr}A)^2 - \\operatorname{tr}(A^2)\\bigr )/2 ,</math>\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\Bigl((\\operatorname{tr}A)^3 - 3 \\operatorname{tr}A ~ \\operatorname{tr}(A^2) + 2 \\operatorname{tr}(A^3)\\Bigr)/6 ,</math>\n:<math>\\det(A)= \\Bigl( (\\operatorname{tr}A)^4 - 6 \\operatorname{tr}(A^2)(\\operatorname{tr}A)^2+3(\\operatorname{tr}(A^2))^2 +8\\operatorname{tr}(A^3)~\\operatorname{tr}A -6\\operatorname{tr}(A^4)\\Bigr)/24 .</math>\ncf.

The determinant of a [[linear transformation]]\n:<math>T : V \\rightarrow V</math>\nfor some finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in ''V''. By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for ''V'' and therefore only depends on the endomorphism ''T''.\n\n=== Exterior algebra ===\n{{See also|Exterior algebra#Linear algebra}}\n\nThe determinant of a linear transformation {{nowrap|''A'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''V''}} of an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the ''n''th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' of ''V''.

This scalar coincides with the determinant of ''A'', that is to say\n:<math>(\\Lambda^n A)(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n) = \\det(A) \\cdot v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n.</math>\nThis definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. This follows from the characterization of the determinant given above. For example, switching two columns changes the sign of the determinant; likewise, permuting the vectors in the exterior product {{nowrap|''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}} to {{nowrap|''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, say, also changes its sign.\n\nFor this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>(''V'') is sometimes also called the determinant of ''V'' and similarly for more involved objects such as [[vector bundle]]s or [[chain complex]]es of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms \u039b<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' with {{nowrap|''k'' < ''n''}}.\n\n==== Transformation on alternating multilinear ''n''-forms ====\nThe vector space ''W'' of all alternating multilinear ''n''-forms on an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' has dimension one.  To each linear transformation ''T'' on ''V'' we associate a linear transformation ''T''\u2032 on ''W'', where for each ''w'' in ''W'' we define {{nowrap|1=(''T''\u2032''w'')(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) = ''w''(''Tx''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''Tx''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}.  As a linear transformation on a one-dimensional space, ''T''\u2032 is equivalent to a scalar multiple.  We call this scalar the determinant of ''T''.\n\n=== Square matrices over commutative rings and abstract properties ===\nThe determinant can also be characterized as the unique function\n:<math>D: M_n(K) \\to K</math>\nfrom the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in a field ''K'' to this field satisfying the following three properties: first, ''D'' is an [[Multilinear map|''n''-linear]] function: considering all but one column of ''A'' fixed, the determinant is linear in the remaining column, that is\n:<math>D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, a v_i + b w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) = a D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, v_i, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) + b D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n)</math>\nfor any column vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>, and ''w'' and any scalars (elements of ''K'') ''a'' and ''b''. Second, ''D'' is an [[alternating form|alternating]] function: for any matrix ''A'' with two identical columns, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''A'') = 0}}. Finally, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''I''<sub>''n''</sub>) = 1}}, where ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is the identity matrix.\n\nThis fact also implies that every other ''n''-linear alternating function {{nowrap|''F'': M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} satisfies\n:<math>F(M)=F(I)D(M).</math>\n\nThis definition can also be extended where ''K'' is a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', in which case a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is an [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]] in ''R''. For example, a matrix ''A'' with entries in '''Z''', the integers, is invertible (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or \u22121. Such a matrix is called [[unimodular matrix|unimodular]].\n\nThe determinant defines a mapping\n:<math>\\operatorname{GL}_n(R) \\rightarrow R^\\times, </math>\nbetween the group of invertible {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''R'' and the [[multiplicative group]] of units in ''R''. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a [[group homomorphism]]. Secondly, given a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' \u2192 ''S''}}, there is a map {{nowrap|''GL<sub>n</sub>(f)'': GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') \u2192 GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''S'')}} given by replacing all entries in ''R'' by their images under ''f''. The determinant respects these maps, i.e., given a matrix {{nowrap|1=''A'' = (''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>)}} with entries in ''R'', the identity\n:<math>f(\\det((a_{i,j}))) = \\det ((f(a_{i,j})))</math>\nholds. In other words, the following diagram commutes:\n\n:[[Image:Determinant as a natural transformation.svg|300px]]\n\nFor example, the determinant of the [[complex conjugate]] of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo&nbsp;''m'' of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo&nbsp;''m'' (the latter determinant being computed using [[modular arithmetic]]). In the language of [[category theory]], the determinant is a [[natural transformation]] between the two functors GL<sub>''n''</sub> and (\u22c5)<sup>\u00d7</sup> (see also [[Natural transformation#Determinant]]).<ref>{{Citation | first = Saunders | last = Mac Lane | authorlink = Saunders Mac Lane | year = 1998 | title = [[Categories for the Working Mathematician]] | series = Graduate Texts in Mathematics '''5''' | edition = (2nd ed.) | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 0-387-98403-8}}</ref> Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of [[algebraic group]]s, from the general linear group to the [[multiplicative group]],\n:<math>\\det: \\operatorname{GL}_n \\rightarrow \\mathbb G_m.</math>\n\n== Generalizations and related notions ==\n\n=== Infinite matrices ===\nFor matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. [[Functional analysis]] provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.\n\nThe [[Fredholm determinant]] defines the determinant for operators known as [[trace class operator]]s by an appropriate generalization of the formula\n:<math>\\det(I+A) = \\exp(\\operatorname{tr}(\\log(I+A))). </math>\n\nAnother infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the [[functional determinant]].\n\n===Operators in von Neumann algebras===\nFor operators in a finite [[von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]], one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the [[Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant]] using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every [[State (functional analysis)#tracial state|tracial state]] on a [[von Neumann algebra]] there is a notion of Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant.\n\n=== Related notions for non-commutative rings ===\nFor square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other ways to define the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, for instance the multiplicative property or the fact that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero {{clarify span|text=bilinear form|explain=What exactly is meant by this term must be specified.  This statement is valid only if the bilinear form is required to be linear on the same side for both arguments; in contrast, Bourbaki defines a bilinear form B as having the property B(ax,yb) = aB(x,y)b, i.e., left-linear in the left argument and right-linear in the other.|date=October 2017}} with a [[Regular element (ring theory)|regular element]] of ''R'' as value on some pair of arguments implies that ''R'' is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated, which preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably [[quasideterminant]]s and the [[Dieudonn\u00e9 determinant]]. It may be noted that if one considers certain specific classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, then there are examples where one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include quantum groups and ''q''-determinant, Capelli matrix and [[Capelli determinant]], super-matrices and [[Berezinian]]; [[Manin matrices]] is the class of matrices which is most close to matrices with commutative elements.\n\n=== Further variants ===\nDeterminants of matrices in [[superring]]s (that is, Z<sub>2</sub>-[[graded ring]]s) are known as [[Berezinian]]s or superdeterminants.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=sZ1-G4hQgIIC&pg=PA116&dq=Berezinian#v=onepage&q=Berezinian&f=false | title = Supersymmetry for mathematicians: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-8218-3574-6 | author1 = Varadarajan | first1 = V.

The [[immanant of a matrix|immanant]] generalizes both by introducing a [[character theory|character]] of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> in Leibniz's rule.\n\n== Calculation ==\nDeterminants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in [[numerical linear algebra]], where for applications like checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques.<ref name=Trefethen>L. N. Trefethen and D. Bau, ''Numerical Linear Algebra'' (SIAM, 1997). e.g. in Lecture 1: \"... we mention that the determinant, though a convenient notion theoretically, rarely finds a useful role in numerical algorithms.\"</ref> [[Computational geometry]], however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.<ref>\nA survey of state-of-the-art algorithms for computing determinants and their advantages and disadvantages including results of performance tests, is included in\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Fisikopoulos | first1 = Vissarion\n | last2 = Pe\u00f1aranda | first2 = Luis\n | title = Faster geometric algorithms via dynamic determinant computation\n | journal = Computational Geometry\n | volume = 54\n | pages = 1\u201316\n | publisher = Elsevier B.

Both these approaches are extremely inefficient for large matrices, though, since the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is [[Big O notation|of order]] ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M''. For example, Leibniz's formula requires calculating ''n''! products. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.\n\n=== Decomposition methods ===\nGiven a matrix ''A'', some methods compute its determinant by writing ''A'' as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the [[LU decomposition]], the [[QR decomposition]] or the [[Cholesky decomposition]] (for [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite matrices]]). These methods are of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), which is a significant improvement over O(''n''!)\n\nThe LU decomposition expresses ''A'' in terms of a lower triangular matrix ''L'', an upper triangular matrix ''U'' and a [[permutation matrix]] ''P'':\n:<math> A = PLU. </math>\nThe determinants of ''L'' and ''U'' can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries.  The determinant of ''P'' is just the sign <math>\\varepsilon</math> of the corresponding permutation (which is +1 for an even number of permutations and is \u22121 for an uneven number of permutations). The determinant of ''A'' is then\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon \\det(L)\\cdot\\det(U). </math>\n\n(See [[determinant identities]].) Moreover, the decomposition can be chosen such that ''L'' is a [[unitriangular matrix]] and therefore has determinant&nbsp;1, in which case the formula further simplifies to\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon\\det(U).</math>\n\n=== Further methods ===\nIf the determinant of ''A'' and the inverse of ''A'' have already been computed, the [[matrix determinant lemma]] allows rapid calculation of the determinant of {{nowrap|''A'' + ''uv''<sup>T</sup>}}, where ''u'' and ''v'' are column vectors.\n\nSince the definition of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions? This is especially interesting for matrices over rings. Indeed, algorithms with run-time proportional to ''n''<sup>4</sup> exist. An algorithm of Mahajan and Vinay, and Berkowitz<ref>http://page.inf.fu-berlin.de/~rote/Papers/pdf/Division-free+algorithms.pdf</ref> is based on [[closed ordered walk]]s (short ''clow''). It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently. The final algorithm looks very much like an iterated product of triangular matrices.\n\nIf two matrices of order ''n'' can be multiplied in time ''M''(''n''), where {{nowrap|''M''(''n'') \u2265 ''n''<sup>''a''</sup>}} for some {{nowrap|''a'' > 2}}, then the determinant can be computed in time O(''M''(''n'')).<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.\n\nAlgorithms can also be assessed according to their [[bit complexity]], i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the [[Gaussian elimination]] (or LU decomposition) method is of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long.<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first1 = Xin Gui\n  | last1 = Fang\n  | first2 = George\n  | last2 = Havas\n  | title = On the worst-case complexity of integer Gaussian elimination\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 1997 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation\n  | conference = ISSAC '97\n  | pages = 28\u201331\n  | publisher = ACM\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States\n  | url = http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | doi = 10.1145/258726.258740\n  | isbn = 0-89791-875-4}}</ref> The [[Bareiss Algorithm]], on the other hand, is an exact-division method based on [[Sylvester's determinant theorem|Sylvester's identity]] is also of order ''n''<sup>3</sup>, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times ''n''.<ref>{{citation|first=Erwin|last=Bareiss|title= Sylvester's Identity and Multistep Integer-Preserving Gaussian Elimination|pages=565\u2013578|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1968-22-103/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0.pdf|journal=Mathematics of Computation|year=1968|volume=22|issue=102|doi=10.2307/2004533|jstor=2004533}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, determinants were used long before matrices: originally, a determinant was defined as a property of a [[system of linear equations]]. \nThe determinant \"determines\" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero). \nIn this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (\u4e5d\u7ae0\u7b97\u8853, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). \nIn Europe, {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} determinants were considered by [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]] at the end of the 16th century and larger ones by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref name=\"Eves\">Eves, H: \"An Introduction to the History of Mathematics\", pages 405, 493\u2013494, Saunders College Publishing, 1990.</ref><ref>A Brief History of Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory : {{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910034016/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}</ref><ref>Cajori, F.

Immediately following, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of [[elimination theory]]; he proved many special cases of general identities.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the [[theory of numbers]]. He introduced the word '''''determinant''''' (Laplace had used ''resultant''), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the [[discriminant]] of a [[algebraic form|quantic]]. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.\n\nThe next contributor of importance is [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet|Binet]] (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of ''m'' columns and ''n'' rows, which for the special case of {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, [[Cauchy]] also presented one on the subject. (See [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]].) In this he used the word '''''determinant''''' in its present sense,<ref>The first use of the word \"determinant\" in the modern sense appeared in: Cauchy, Augustin-Louis \"Memoire sur les fonctions qui ne peuvent obtenir que deux valeurs \u00e9gales et des signes contraires par suite des transpositions oper\u00e9es entre les variables qu'elles renferment,\" which was first read at the Institute de France in Paris on November 30, 1812, and which was subsequently published in the ''Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique'', Cahier 17, Tome 10, pages 29\u2013112 (1815).</ref><ref>Origins of mathematical terms: http://jeff560.tripod.com/d.html</ref> summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's.<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref>History of matrices and determinants: http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Matrices_and_determinants.html</ref> With him begins the theory in its generality.\n\nThe next important figure was [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]]<ref name=\"Eves\" /> (from 1827). He early used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]], and in his memoirs in ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called ''alternants''. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] (1839) and [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] began their work.<ref>The first use of vertical lines to denote a determinant appeared in: Cayley, Arthur \"On a theorem in the geometry of position,\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'', vol. 2, pages 267\u2013271 (1841).</ref><ref>History of matrix notation: http://jeff560.tripod.com/matrices.html</ref>\n\nThe study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by [[Lebesgue]], [[Otto Hesse|Hesse]], and Sylvester; [[persymmetric]] determinants by Sylvester and [[Hermann Hankel|Hankel]]; [[circulant]]s by [[Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan|Catalan]], [[William Spottiswoode|Spottiswoode]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and Scott; skew determinants and [[Pfaffian]]s, in connection with the theory of [[orthogonal transformation]], by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; [[Wronskian]]s (so called by [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Muir]]) by [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel|Christoffel]] and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]]; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and [[Hessian matrix|Hessians]] by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by [[Trudi]]. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Linear independence ===\nAs mentioned above, the determinant of a matrix (with real or complex entries, say) is zero if and only if the column vectors (or the row vectors) of the matrix are linearly dependent. Thus, determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors. For example, given two linearly independent vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub> in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, a third vector ''v''<sub>3</sub> lies in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[Linear span|spanned]] by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of [[differential equation]]s: given ''n'' functions ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''), \u2026, ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') (supposed to be {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} times differentiable), the [[Wronskian]] is defined to be\n:<math>\nW(f_1, \\ldots, f_n) (x)=\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nf_1(x) & f_2(x) & \\cdots & f_n(x) \\\\\nf_1'(x) & f_2'(x) & \\cdots & f_n' (x)\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nf_1^{(n-1)}(x)& f_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & f_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\nIt is non-zero (for some ''x'') in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order ''n''\u22121 are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of [[analytic function]]s, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See [[Wronskian#The Wronskian and linear independence|the Wronskian and linear independence]].\n\n=== Orientation of a basis ===\n{{Main|Orientation (vector space)}}\nThe determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every [[sequence]] of ''n'' vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. For instance, an [[orthogonal matrix]] with entries in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> represents an [[orthonormal basis]] in [[Euclidean space]]. The determinant of such a matrix determines whether the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the [[standard basis]]. If the determinant is +1, the basis has the same orientation. If it is \u22121, the basis has the opposite orientation.\n\nMore generally, if the determinant of ''A'' is positive, ''A'' represents an orientation-preserving [[linear transformation]] (if ''A'' is an orthogonal {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} or {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix, this is a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]), while if it is negative, ''A'' switches the orientation of the basis.\n\n=== Volume and Jacobian determinant ===\nAs pointed out above, the [[absolute value]] of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if {{nowrap|''f'': '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the linear map represented by the matrix ''A'', and ''S'' is any [[Lebesgue measure|measurable]] [[subset]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then the volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by |det(''A'')| times the volume of ''S''.

He advanced  a [[labor theory of value]]:<ref>Ricardo, David (1817) On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. Piero Sraffa (Ed.) Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo, Volume I, Cambridge University Press, 1951, p. 11.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not on the greater or less compensation  which is paid for that labour.</blockquote>\n\nRicardo's note to Section VI:<ref>Ricardo, David (1817) On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. Piero Sraffa (Ed.) Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo, Volume I, Cambridge University Press, 1951, p. 47.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Mr. Malthus appears to think that it is a part of my doctrine, that the cost and value of a thing be the same;\u2014it is, if he means by cost, \"cost of production\" including profit.</blockquote>\n\n===Rent===\n{{Main article|Law of rent}}\nRicardo contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits. He defined [[Economic rent|rent]] as \"the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labor.\"  Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land utilization and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, principally benefited landowners.  According to Ricardo, such premium over \"real social value\" that is reaped due to ownership constitutes value to an individual but is at best<ref>On The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation London: John Murray, Albemarle-Street, by David Ricardo, 1817 (third edition 1821) \u2013 Chapter 6, On Profits: paragraph 28, \"Thus, taking the former . . .\" and paragraph 33, \"There can, however....\"</ref> a paper monetary return to \"society\". The portion of such purely individual benefit that accrues to scarce resources Ricardo labels \"rent\".\n\n===Ricardo's theories of wages and profits===\nIn his ''Theory of Profit'', Ricardo stated that as [[real wages]] increase, real profits decrease because the revenue from the sale of manufactured goods is split between profits and wages. He said in his ''Essay on Profits'', \"Profits depend on high or low wages, wages on the price of necessaries, and the price of necessaries chiefly on the price of food.\"\n\n=== Comparative advantage ===\nBetween 1500 and 1750 most economists advocated [[Mercantilism]] which promoted the idea of international trade for the purpose of earning bullion by running a trade surplus with other countries.  Ricardo challenged the idea that the purpose of trade was merely to accumulate gold or silver.  With \"comparative advantage\" Ricardo argued in favour of industry specialisation and [[free trade]].  He suggested that industry specialization combined with free international trade always produces positive results. This theory expanded on the concept of [[absolute advantage]].\n\nRicardo suggested that there is mutual national benefit from trade even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart and that a nation should concentrate resources only in industries where it has a comparative advantage,<ref>{{citation |title=The Trade Question |last=Roberts |first=Paul Craig |periodical=Washington Times |publication-date=2003-08-28}}</ref> that is in those industries in which it has the greatest competitive edge.  Ricardo suggested that national industries which were, in fact, profitable and internationally competitive should be jettisoned in favour of the most competitive industries, the assumption being that subsequent economic growth would more than offset any economic dislocation which would result from closing profitable and competitive national industries.\n\nRicardo attempted to prove theoretically that international trade is always beneficial.<ref>Ricardo, David (1817) On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. Piero Sraffa (Ed.) Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo, Volume I, Cambridge University Press, 1951, p. 135.</ref> [[Paul Samuelson]] called the numbers used in Ricardo's example dealing with trade between England and Portugal the \"four magic numbers\".<ref>Samuelson, Paul A. (1972), \"The Way of an Economist.\" Reprinted in ''The Collected Papers of Paul A. Samuelson''. Ed. R. C. Merton. Cambridge: Cambridge MIT Press. p. 378.</ref> \"In spite of the fact that the Portuguese could produce both cloth and wine with less amount of labor, Ricardo suggested that both countries would benefit from trade with each other\".\n\n====Criticism====\nAs [[Joan Robinson]] pointed out, following the opening of free trade with England, Portugal endured centuries of economic underdevelopment: \"the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of the industrial revolution\". Robinson argued that Ricardo's example required that economies were in static equilibrium positions with full employment and that there could not be a trade deficit or a trade surplus. These conditions, she wrote, were not relevant to the real world. She also argued that Ricardo's math did not take into account that some countries may be at different levels of development and that this raised the prospect of 'unequal exchange' which might hamper a country's development, as we saw in the case of Portugal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=Joan |title=Aspects of Development and Underdevelopment |date=1979 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521226376 |page=103}}</ref>\n\n==== Protectionism ====\nLike Adam Smith, Ricardo was an opponent of [[protectionism]] for national economies, especially for agriculture. He believed that the British \"[[Corn Laws]]\"\u2014tariffs on agricultural products\u2014ensured that less-productive domestic land would be harvested and rents would be driven up {{harv|Case|Fair|1999|pp=812, 813}}. Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists. Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest. He believed the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy.<ref>Letter of Mill http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=213&chapter=61555&layout=html&Itemid=27</ref> In 1846, his nephew [[John Ricardo|John Lewis Ricardo]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Stoke-upon-Trent (UK Parliament constituency)|Stoke-upon-Trent]], advocated [[free trade]] and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]].\n\nModern empirical analysis of the Corn Laws yield mixed results.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0014-4983(90)90007-L |title=The impact of the Corn Laws just prior to repeal |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=27 |issue=2 |page=123 |year=1990 |last1=Williamson |first1=J. G.}}</ref> Parliament repealed the Corn Laws in 1846.\n\n== Criticism of the Ricardian theory of trade ==\nRicardo himself was the first to recognize that comparative advantage is a domain-specific theory, meaning that it only applies when certain conditions are met. Ricardo noted that the theory only applies in situations where capital is immobile. Regarding his famous example, he wrote:<blockquote>''it would undoubtedly be advantageous to the capitalists [and consumers] of England\u2026 [that] the wine and cloth should both be made in Portugal [and that] the capital and labour of England employed in making cloth should be removed to Portugal for that purpose.''<ref name=\"Ricardo 1821 7.19\">{{Cite book |title=On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation |last=Ricardo |first=David |publisher=John Murray |year=1821 |isbn= |location= |pages=7.19 |quote= |via=}}</ref></blockquote>Ricardo recognized that applying his theory in situations where capital was mobile would result in [[offshoring]], and therefore economic decline and job loss. To correct for this, he argued that (i) ''most men of property [will be] satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek[ing] a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations,'' and (ii) that capital was functionally immobile.<ref name=\"Ricardo 1821 7.19\"/>\n\nRicardo's argument in favour of [[free trade]] has also been attacked by those who believe trade restriction can be necessary for the economic development of a nation. [[Utsa Patnaik]] claims that Ricardian theory of [[international trade]] contains a logical fallacy. Ricardo assumed that in both countries two goods are producible and actually are produced, but developed and underdeveloped countries often trade those goods which are not producible in their own country.  In these cases, one cannot define which country has comparative advantage.<ref>{{cite book |first=Uta |last=Patnaik |year=2005 |chapter=Ricardo's Fallacy/ Mutual Benefit from Trade Based on Comparative Costs and Specialization? |editor-last=Jomo |editor-first=K. S. |title=The Pioneers of Development Economics: Great Economists on Development |publisher=Zed books |location=London and New York |pages=31\u201341 |isbn=81-85229-99-6}}</ref>\n\nCritics also argue that Ricardo's theory of [[comparative advantage]] is flawed in that it assumes production is continuous and absolute. In the real world, events outside the realm of human control (e.g. natural disasters) can disrupt production. In this case, specialisation could cripple a country that depends on imports from foreign, naturally disrupted countries. For example, if an industrially based country trades its manufactured goods with an [[agrarian country]] in exchange for agricultural products, a natural disaster in the agricultural country (e.g. drought) may cause an industrially based country to starve.\n\nThe development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] challenges the argument that free trade benefits every country:\n<blockquote><div>\nRicardo\u2019s theory is absolutely right\u2014within its narrow confines. His theory correctly says that, ''accepting their current levels of technology as given'', it is better for countries to specialize in things that they are relatively better at. One cannot argue with that.  His theory fails when a country wants to acquire more advanced technologies\u2014that is, when it wants to develop its economy. It takes time and experience to absorb new technologies, so technologically backward producers need a period of protection from international competition during this period of learning. Such protection is costly, because the country is giving up the chance to import better and cheaper products. However, it is a price that has to be paid if it wants to develop advanced industries. Ricardo\u2019s theory is, thus seen, for those who accept the ''status quo'' but not for those who want to change it.<ref>Chang, Ha-Joon (2007), \"Bad Samaritans\", Chapter 2, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n</div></blockquote>\n\n==Ricardian equivalence==\nAnother idea associated with Ricardo is [[Ricardian equivalence]], an argument suggesting that in some circumstances a government's choice of how to pay for its spending (''i.e.,'' whether to use tax revenue or issue debt and run a deficit) might have no effect on the economy. This is due to the fact the public saves its excess money to pay for expected future tax increases that will be used to pay off the debt. Ricardo notes that the proposition is theoretically implied in the presence of intertemporal optimisation by rational tax-payers: but that since tax-payers do not act so rationally, the proposition fails to be true in practice. Thus, while the proposition bears his name, he does not seem to have believed it. Economist [[Robert Barro]] is responsible for its modern prominence.\n\n==Influence and intellectual legacy==\nDavid Ricardo's ideas had a tremendous influence on later developments in economics. US economists rank Ricardo as the second most influential economic thinker, behind Adam Smith, prior to the twentieth century.<ref>Davis, William L., Bob Figgins, David Hedengren, and Daniel B. Klein. \"Economics Professors' Favorite Economic Thinkers, Journals and Blogs (along with Party and Policy Views),\" ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 126\u201346, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/economics-professors-favorite-economic-thinkers-journals-and-blogs-along-with-party-and-policy-views].</ref>\n\nRicardo became the theoretical father of classical political economy. However, [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] coined an expression ''Ricardian vice'', which indicates that rigorous logic does not provide a good economic theory.<ref>Schumpeter, ''History of Economic Analysis'', (published posthumously, ed. Elisabeth Boody Schumpeter), 1954. pp. 569, 1171. Schumpeter also criticized J. M. Keynes for committing the same Ricardian vice.</ref> This criticism applies also to most neoclassical theories, which make heavy use of mathematics, but are, according to him, theoretically unsound, because the conclusion being drawn does not logically follow from the theories used to defend it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Ricardian socialists===\n{{main|Ricardian socialism}}\n\nRicardo's writings fascinated a number of early socialists in the 1820s, who thought his value theory had radical implications. They argued that, in view of labor theory of value, labor produces the entire product, and the profits capitalists get are a result of exploitations of workers.<ref>Landreth Colander 1989 ''History of Economic Thought'' Second Edition, p.137.</ref> These include [[Thomas Hodgskin]], [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]], [[John Francis Bray]], and [[Percy Ravenstone]].\n\n===Georgists===\nGeorgists believe that rent, in the sense that Ricardo used, belongs to the community as a whole. [[Henry George]] was greatly influenced by Ricardo, and often cited him, including in his most famous work, [[Progress and Poverty]] from 1879. In the preface to the fourth edition, he wrote: ''\"What I have done in this book, if I have correctly solved the great problem I have sought to investigate, is, to unite the truth perceived by the school of Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the school of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams of socialism; to identify social law with moral law, and to disprove ideas which in the minds of many cloud grand and elevating perceptions.\"''<ref>[[Henry George|George, Henry]], [[Progress and Poverty]]. Preface to the 4th Edition, November 1880.</ref>\n\n===Neo-Ricardians===\nAfter the rise of the 'neoclassical' school, Ricardo's influence declined temporarily. It was [[Piero Sraffa]], the editor of the Collected Works of David Ricardo<ref>Piero Sraffa and M.H. Dobb, editors (1951\u20131973). ''The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo''. Cambridge University Press, 11 volumes.</ref> and the author of seminal ''Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities'',<ref>Sraffa, Piero 1960, ''Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities: Prelude to a Critique of Economic Theory''. Cambridge University Press.</ref> who resurrected Ricardo as the originator of another strand of economics thought, which was effaced with the arrival of the neoclassical school. The new interpretation of Ricardo and Sraffa's criticism against the marginal theory of value gave rise to a new school, now named neo-Ricardian or Sraffian school. Major contributors to this school includes [[Luigi Pasinetti]] (1930\u2013), [[Pierangelo Garegnani]] (1930\u20132011), [[Ian Steedman]] (1941\u2013), [[Geoffrey Harcourt]] (1931\u2013), [[Heinz Kurz]] (1946\u2013), [[Neri Salvadori]] (1951\u2013), [[Pier Paolo Saviotti]] (\u2013) among others. See also [[Neo-Ricardianism]]. The Neo-Ricardian school is sometimes seen to be a component of [[Post-Keynesian economics]].\n\n====Neo-Ricardian trade theory====\nInspired by [[Piero Sraffa]], a new strand of trade theory emerged and was named neo-Ricardian trade theory. The main contributors include [[Ian Steedman]] and [[Stanley Metcalfe]]. They have criticised neoclassical international trade theory, namely the [[Heckscher\u2013Ohlin model]] on the basis that the notion of capital as primary factor has no method of measuring it before the determination of profit rate (thus trapped in a logical vicious circle).<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Steedman |editor-first=Ian |year=1979 |title=Fundamental Issues in Trade Theory |location=London |publisher=MacMillan |isbn=0-333-25834-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Steedman |first=Ian |title=Trade Amongst Growing Economies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1979 |pages={{Page needed |date=April 2011}} |isbn=0-521-22671-6 }}</ref> This was a second round of the [[Cambridge capital controversy]], this time in the field of international trade.<ref>{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Edwards |year=1985 |title=The Fragmented World: Competing Perspectives on Trade, Money, and Crisis |location=London and New York |publisher=Methuen & Co. |chapter=\u00a7&nbsp;3.2\u3000The 'Sraffian' Approach to Trade Theory |pages=48\u201351 |isbn=0-416-73390-5}}</ref> Depoort\u00e8re and Ravix judge that neo-Ricardian contribution failed without giving effective impact on neoclassical trade theory, because it could not offer \u201ca genuine alternative approach from a classical point of view.\u201d<ref>Christophe Depoort\u00e8re, Jo\u00ebl Thomas Ravix 2015 The classical theory of international trade after Sraffa.

It is bordered (clockwise from north) by [[Vulpecula]] the fox, [[Sagitta]] the arrow, [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] the eagle, [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] the water-carrier, [[Equuleus]] the foal and [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] the flying horse.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[Image:DelphinusCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Delphinus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]\n\n===Stars===\nDelphinus lacks stars above fourth [[apparent magnitude|(apparent) magnitude]]; its brightest star is of magnitude 3.8. The main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] in Delphinus is '''Job's Coffin''', nearly a 45\u00b0-apex [[lozenge]] diamond of the four brightest stars: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Delphini. Delphinus is in a rich Milky Way star field. Alpha and Beta Delphini have 19th century names Sualocin and Rotanev, read backwards: Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized name of a [[Palermo Astronomical Observatory|Palermo Observatory]] director, [[Niccol\u00f2 Cacciatore]] (d. 1841).{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=140-141}}\n\n[[Alpha Delphini]] is a blue-white hued [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 3.8, 241 light-years from Earth. \n\n[[Beta Delphini]], called Rotanev. The gap between its close [[binary star|binary]] stars is visible from large amateur telescopes. To the unaided eye, it appears to be a white star of magnitude 3.6. It has a period of 27 years and is 97 light-years from Earth. \n\n[[Gamma Delphini]] is a celebrated binary star among amateur astronomers. The primary is orange-gold of magnitude 4.3; the secondary is a light yellow star of magnitude 5.1. The pair form a true binary with an estimated orbital period of over 3,000 years. 125 light-years away, the two components are visible in a small amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=140-141}} The secondary, also described as green, is 10 arcseconds from the primary. [[Struve 2725]], called the \"Ghost Double\", is a pair that appears similar but dimmer. Its components of magnitudes 7.6 and 8.4 are separated by 6 arcseconds and are 15 arcminutes from Gamma Delphini itself.<ref name=\"S&T\"/>\n\n[[Delta Delphini]] is a type [[A-type main sequence star|A7&nbsp;IIIp]] star of magnitude 4.43. \n\n[[Epsilon Delphini]], Deneb Dulfim ([[Arab astrology|lit.]] \"tail [of the] Dolphin\"), or Aldulfin, is a star of [[stellar classification|stellar class]] B6&nbsp;III and magnitude 4, at 330 ly.<ref name=ug>http://www.universeguide.com/starsearch</ref>\n\nIn Delphinus, in extremes of distance, '''[[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars|Gliese]] 795''' is the closest known star at 54.95 ly and rapidly moves east over a period of centuries (863\u00b13 [[arcsecond]]s per year); whereas the giant of blue colour, W Delphini is at 2203.81 ly at 9.76 magnitude.<ref name=ug>http://www.universeguide.com/starsearch</ref> Its brightness ranges from a magnitude of 12.3 to a magnitude of 9.7 over its variable period as it is a [[Beta Persei star]]-type semi-detached system.

A '''disk drive''' is a device implementing such a storage mechanism. Notable types are the [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) containing a non-removable disk, the [[floppy disk| floppy disk drive]] (FDD) and its removable [[floppy disk]], and various [[optical disc drive]]s (ODD) and associated [[optical disc]] media.\n\n(The [[Spelling of disc|spelling '''disk''' and '''disc''']] are used interchangeably except where trademarks preclude one usage, e.g. the Compact Disc logo. The choice of a particular form is frequently historical, as in IBM's usage of the ''disk'' form beginning in 1956 with the \"[[IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#IBM_350|IBM 350 disk storage unit]]\").\n\n[[File:SixHardDriveFormFactors.jpg|thumb|Six hard disk drives]]\n[[File:Floppy Disk Drives 8 5 3.jpg|thumb|Three floppy disk drives]]\n[[File:ASUS CD-ROM CD-S520-A4 20080821.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM (optical) disc drive]]\n\n== Background ==\n[[Sound|Audio]] information was originally recorded by analog methods (see [[Sound recording and reproduction]]). Similarly the [[Laserdisc|first video disc]] used an analog recording method. In the music industry, analog recording has been mostly replaced by digital [[optical]] technology where the data is recorded in a digital format with optical information.\n\nThe first commercial digital disk storage device was the [[IBM 350]] which shipped in 1956 as a part of the [[IBM 305 RAMAC]] computing system. The [[random access memory|random-access]], low-density storage of disks was developed to complement the already used [[sequential access|sequential-access]], high-density storage provided by [[tape drive]]s using [[magnetic tape]]. Vigorous innovation in disk storage technology, coupled with less vigorous innovation in tape storage, has reduced the difference in acquisition cost per [[terabyte]] between disk storage and tape storage; however, the total cost of ownership of data on disk including power and management remains larger than that of tape.<ref>{{cite web \n|url= http://users.sdsc.edu/~mcdonald/content/papers/dt_cost.pdf\n|title= Disk and Tape Storage Cost Models \n|last= Richard L.

Gross disk drive capacity is simply the number of disk surfaces times the number of blocks/surface times the number of bytes/block.  In certain [[Count_key_data#IBM.27s_CKD_DASD_subsystems |legacy IBM CKD drives]] the data was stored on magnetic disks with variable length blocks, called records; record length could vary on and between disks.  Capacity decreased as record length decreased due to the necessary gaps between blocks.\n\n== Access methods ==\n<!--\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"135px\" perrow=\"2\" align=\"right\">\nImage:Samsung_HD753LJ_01-Top.jpg|<center>A typical hard disk drive</center>\nImage:Samsung_HD753LJ_02-Bottom.jpg|<center>Translation hardware on circuit board</center>\nImage:Samsung_HD753LJ_03-Opened.jpg|<center>Top cover removed</center>\nImage:Hard_disk_platters_and_head.jpg|<center>Disks (2) and actuator arms (4)</center>\nImage:Samsung_HD753LJ_05-Head.jpg|<center>The head and disk</center>\nImage:Hard_disk_head.jpg|<center>Head on the disk platter</center>\n</gallery>\nToo HDD specific, putting better images in intro-->\n\nDigital disk drives are [[Computer data storage|block storage devices]]. Each disk is divided into logical [[Block (data storage)|blocks]] (collection of sectors). Blocks are addressed using their [[Logical block addressing|logical block addresses]] (LBA). Read from or writing to disk happens at the granularity of blocks.\n\nOriginally the disk capacity was quite low and has been improved in one of several ways. Improvements in mechanical design and manufacture allowed smaller and more precise heads, meaning that more tracks could be stored on each of the disks. Advancements in data compression methods permitted more information to be stored in each of the individual sectors.\n\nThe drive stores data onto [[Cylinder-head-sector|cylinders, heads, and sectors]]. The sectors unit is the smallest size of data to be stored in a hard disk drive and each file will have many sectors units assigned to it. The smallest entity in a CD is called a frame, which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples (two bytes \u00d7 two channels \u00d7 six samples = 24 bytes). The other nine bytes consist of eight CIRC error-correction bytes and one [[Compact disc subcode|subcode]] byte used for control and display.\n\nThe information is sent from the computer processor to the BIOS into a chip controlling the data transfer. This is then sent out to the hard drive via a multi-wire connector. Once the data is received onto the circuit board of the drive, they are translated and compressed into a format that the individual drive can use to store onto the disk itself. The data is then passed to a chip on the circuit board that controls the access to the drive. The drive is divided into sectors of data stored onto one of the sides of one of the internal disks. An HDD with two disks internally will typically store data on all four surfaces.\n\nThe hardware on the drive tells the actuator arm where it is to go for the relevant track and the compressed information is then sent down to the head which changes the physical properties, optically or magnetically for example, of each byte on the drive, thus storing the information. A file is not stored in a linear manner, rather, it is held in the best way for quickest retrieval.\n\n{{anchor|CAV-CLV}}\n\n==Rotation speed and track layout==\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br /><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\nMechanically there are two different motions occurring inside the drive. One is the rotation of the disks inside the device. The other is the side-to-side motion of the head across the disk as it moves between tracks.\n\nThere are two types of disk rotation methods:\n*[[constant linear velocity]] (used mainly in optical storage) varies the rotational speed of the optical disc depending upon the position of the head, and\n*[[constant angular velocity]] (used in HDDs, standard FDDs, a few optical disc systems, and [[Gramophone record|vinyl audio records]]) spins the media at one constant speed regardless of where the head is positioned.\n\nTrack positioning also follows two different methods across disk storage devices. Storage devices focused on holding computer data, e.g., HDDs, FDDs, Iomega [[zip drive]]s, use concentric tracks to store data. During a sequential read or write operation, after the drive accesses all the sectors in a track it repositions the head(s) to the next track. This will cause a momentary delay in the flow of data between the device and the computer. In contrast, optical audio and video discs use a single [[spiral]] track that starts at the inner most point on the disc and flows continuously to the outer edge. When reading or writing data there is no need to stop the flow of data to switch tracks. This is similar to vinyl records except vinyl records started at the outer edge and spiraled in toward the center.\n\n== Interfaces ==\nThe disk drive interface is the mechanism/protocol of communication between the rest of the system and the disk drive itself. Storage devices intended for desktop and mobile computers typically use [[AT Attachment|ATA]] ([[Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment|PATA]]) and [[Serial ATA|SATA]] interfaces. Enterprise systems and high-end storage devices will typically use [[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]], and [[Fibre Channel|FC]] interfaces in addition to some use of SATA.\n<!-- Move to HDD article ? : ==Disk crashes==\nSince a [[magnetic dipole]] field decreases rapidly with distance from the magnetic material, the space between the head and medium must be controlled with more precision than the thermal expansion of parts of the disk drive. The head therefore ''flies'' or glides on a layer of air by means of hydrodynamical [[lubrication]]. That is, the air pulled along by the disk forces the head away from the disk surface. When the disk stops, the head must either \"land\" or be pulled away.\nDefects, wear or foreign objects such as dust, can distort the disk and head surfaces, so they make contact and damage each other further. When these elements build up over time, there is a chance that a \"[[head crash]]\" will occur. This results in lost data and an inoperable device.\nHead crashes are one of the reasons that important data must be backed up on some other device (often audio or video media).\nWhen removable hard disks were used, disc damage was contagious, since either the head or the disk could propagate the damage.\n-->\n\n== Basic terminology ==\n<!-- This should be NOT specific to hard drives, there is a separate page for that! Please keep it general (hard disk, floppy, optical, ...). -->\n* Disk - Generally refers to magnetic media and devices.\n* Disc - Required by trademarks for certain optical media and devices. \n* Platter \u2013 An individual recording disk. A hard disk drive contains a set of platters. Developments in optical technology have led to multiple recording layers on [[Comparison of high definition optical disc formats|DVD]]s.\n* [[Spindle (hard disk drive)|Spindle]] \u2013 the spinning [[axle]] on which the platters are mounted.\n* Rotation \u2013 Platters rotate; two techniques are common:\n** [[Constant angular velocity]] (CAV) keeps the disk spinning at a fixed rate, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). This means the heads cover more distance per unit of time on the outer tracks than on the inner tracks. This method is typical with computer hard drives.\n**[[Constant linear velocity]] (CLV) keeps the distance covered by the heads per unit time fixed. Thus the disk has to slow down as the arm moves to the outer tracks. This method is typical for [[Compact disc|CD]] drives.\n* Track \u2013 The circle of recorded data on a single recording surface of a platter.\n<!--  too much HDD specific \n* Cylinder \u2013 In a multi-head drive, all the tracks under the heads for a given arm position can be read without seek delay.

Technically, this would more accurately be entitled the [[Bit_rate#Gross_bit_rate|\"gross\" data transfer rate]]. \n<!--- Obsolete, even for floppies\n* Interleave \u2013 The spacing between sectors. Sequential sectors were spaced on the media to enable the next sector to be in the correct position under the head once the host was ready to read it.

His victory against [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815 puts him in the first rank of Britain's military heroes.\n\nWellesley was born in [[Dublin]] into the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. He was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[British Army]] in 1787, serving in Ireland as [[aide-de-camp]] to two successive [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He was also elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]]. He was a colonel by 1796, and saw action in the [[Flanders Campaign|Netherlands]] and in India, where he fought in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Battle of Seringapatam]]. He was appointed governor of [[Seringapatam]] and [[Mysore]] in 1799 and, as a newly appointed major-general, won a decisive victory over the [[Maratha Empire#The Confederacy era (1761\u20131818)|Maratha Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of Assaye]] in 1803.\n\nWellesley rose to prominence as a general during the [[Peninsular War|Peninsular campaign]] of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and was promoted to the rank of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] after leading the allied forces to victory against the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] in 1813. Following [[Napoleon]]'s exile in 1814, he served as the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|ambassador to France]] and was granted a dukedom. During the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815, he commanded the [[Seventh Coalition|allied]] army which, together with a [[Prussian Army|Prussian army]] under [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]], defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. Wellington's [[Military career of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|battle record]] is exemplary; he ultimately participated in some 60 battles during the course of his military career.\n\nWellington is famous for his adaptive defensive style of warfare, resulting in several victories against numerically superior forces while minimising his own losses. He is regarded as one of the greatest defensive commanders of all time, and many of his tactics and battle plans are still studied in military academies around the world.\n\nAfter the end of his active military career, Wellington returned to politics. He was twice [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] as part of the [[Tories (political faction)|Tory]] party: from 1828 to 1830, and for a little less than a month in 1834. He oversaw the passage of the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]], but opposed the [[Reform Act 1832]]. He continued as one of the leading figures in the [[House of Lords]] until his retirement and remained [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief of the British Army]] until his death.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Dangan Castle, Co Meath, Ireland, 1840.jpg|thumb|left|Wellesley spent much of his early childhood at his family's [[ancestral home]], [[Dangan Castle]] (engraving, 1842).]]\n\nWellesley was born into an aristocratic [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] family in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] as [[The Honourable|The Hon.]] Arthur Wesley,<ref name=\"Wellesley, p. 16\">Wellesley (2008). p. 16.</ref> the third of five surviving sons (fourth otherwise) of Anne and [[Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington]].

In June 1794, Wellesley with the 33rd regiment set sail from [[Cork Harbour|Cork]] bound for [[Ostend]] as part of an expedition bringing reinforcements for the army in Flanders. They arrived too late and joined the Duke of York as he was pulling back towards the Netherlands. On 15 September 1794, at the [[Battle of Boxtel]],<ref name=\"Holmes30\"/> east of [[Breda]], Wellington, in temporary command of his brigade, had his first experience of battle. During General Abercromby\u2019s withdrawal in the face of superior French forces, the 33rd held off enemy cavalry, allowing neighbouring units to retreat safely.

He reported to the office of the Secretary for War to request a new assignment. In the waiting room he met Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]], already a legendary figure after his victories at the Nile and Copenhagen, who was briefly in England after months chasing the French Toulon fleet to the West Indies and back.

At the same time, he was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy counsellor]].<ref name=\"Neillands38\"/> While in Ireland, he gave a verbal promise that the remaining [[Penal Laws]] would be enforced with great moderation, perhaps an indication of his later willingness to support [[Catholic Emancipation]].<ref name=\"Longford 1971 174\">Longford (1971) p.174</ref>\n\n=== War on Denmark ===\nWellesley was in Ireland in May 1807 when he heard of the British expedition to [[Denmark]]. He decided to go, stepping down from his political appointments and was appointed to command an infantry brigade in the [[Second Battle of Copenhagen]] which took place in August. He fought at the [[Battle of K\u00f8ge|K\u00f8ge]], during which the men under his command took 1,500 prisoners, with Wellesley later present during the surrender.<ref name=\"Neillands38\"/>\n\nBy 30 September, he had returned to England and was raised to the rank of [[lieutenant general]] on 25 April 1808.<ref name=\"Neillands38\"/> In June 1808 he accepted the command of an expedition of 9,000 men. Preparing to sail for an attack on the Spanish colonies in [[South America]] (to assist the Latin American patriot [[Francisco de Miranda]]) his force was instead ordered to sail for [[Portugal]], to take part in the Peninsular Campaign and rendezvous with 5,000 troops from [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"Neillands39\">Neillands (2003). p. 39.</ref><ref>Holmes (2002). pp. 102\u2013103.</ref>\n\n===Peninsular War===\n{{main|Peninsular War}}\n{{further|British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Anglo-Portuguese Army}}\n\nReady for battle, Wellesley left Cork on 12 July 1808 to participate in the war against French forces in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with his skills as a commander tested and developed.<ref name=\"Neillands39\" /> According to the historian [[Robin Neillands]], \"Wellesley had by now acquired the experience on which his later successes were founded. He knew about command from the ground up, about the importance of logistics, about campaigning in a hostile environment.

[[Sir Hew Whiteford Dalrymple, 1st Baronet|General Dalrymple]] then signed the controversial [[Convention of Sintra]], which stipulated that the [[Royal Navy]] transport the [[French army]] out of [[Lisbon]] with all their loot, and insisted on the association of the only available government minister, Wellesley.<ref>Longford (1971). pp. 155\u2013157.</ref>\nDalrymple and Wellesley were recalled to Britain to face a Court of Enquiry. Wellesley had agreed to sign the preliminary armistice, but had not signed the convention, and was cleared.<ref>Holmes (2002). p. 124.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon himself entered Spain with his veteran troops to put down the revolt; the new commander of the British forces in the Peninsula, [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]], died during the [[Battle of Corunna]] in January 1809.<ref>Longford (1971). p. 171.</ref>\n\nAlthough overall the land war with France was not going well from a British perspective, the Peninsula was the one theatre where they, with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], had provided strong resistance against France and her allies. This contrasted with the disastrous [[Walcheren expedition]], which was typical of the mismanaged British operations of the time. Wellesley submitted a memorandum to [[Lord Castlereagh]] on the defence of Portugal. He stressed its mountainous frontiers and advocated Lisbon as the main base because the Royal Navy could help to defend it. Castlereagh and the cabinet approved the memo, appointed him head of all British forces in Portugal.<ref>Longford (1971). p. 172.</ref>\n\n====1809====\nWellesley arrived in Lisbon on 22 April 1809 on board [[French frigate Surveillante (1802)|HMS ''Surveillante'']],<ref>Longford (1971). p. 117.</ref> after narrowly escaping shipwreck.<ref>Griffiths (1897).</ref> Reinforced, he took to the offensive.

The combined allied force prepared for an assault on [[Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno|Marshal Victor]]'s [[I Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|I&nbsp;Corps]] at Talavera, 23 July. Cuesta, however, was reluctant to agree, and was only persuaded to advance on the following day.<ref>Gates (2002). p. 177.</ref> The delay allowed the French to withdraw, but Cuesta sent his army headlong after Victor, and found himself faced by almost the entire French army in New Castile\u2014Victor had been reinforced by the Toledo and Madrid garrisons.

He struck through the hills north of Burgos, the [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes (region)|Tras os Montes]], and switched his supply line from Portugal to [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] on Spain's north coast; this led to the French abandoning Madrid and Burgos.

The British troops broke ranks to loot the abandoned French wagons instead of pursuing the beaten foe.

After a barrage of 80 cannons the first French infantry attack was launched by [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|Comte D'Erlon]]'s I Corps. D'Erlon's troops advanced through the Allied centre, resulting in Allied troops in front of the ridge retreating in disorder through the main position. D'Erlon's corps stormed the most fortified Allied position, [[La Haye Sainte]], but failed to take it. An Allied division under [[Thomas Picton]] met the remainder of D'Erlon's corps head to head, engaging them in an infantry duel in which Picton fell. During this struggle [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Lord Uxbridge]] launched two of his cavalry brigades at the enemy, catching the French infantry off guard, driving them to the bottom of the slope, and capturing two [[French Imperial Eagle]]s. The charge, however, over-reached itself, and the British cavalry, crushed by fresh French horsemen hurled at them by Napoleon, were driven back, suffering tremendous losses.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Waterloo Campaign |volume=28 |pages=371\u2013381}}</ref>\n\nA little before 16:00, Marshal Ney noted an apparent exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Ney at this time had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with a cavalry charge alone.<ref name=\"Siborne439\">Siborne (1990). p. 439.</ref>\n\n[[File:Waterloo-French cavalry.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval''.

Commanded by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|Freiherr von B\u00fclow]], IV Corps arrived as the French cavalry attack was in full spate. B\u00fclow sent the 15th Brigade to link up with Wellington's left flank in the [[Frichermont]]\u2013[[La Haie, Lasne|La Haie]] area while the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support.<ref name=\"Hofschroer-117\">Hofschr\u00f6er (1999). p. 117</ref> Napoleon sent [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]]'s corps to intercept the rest of B\u00fclow's IV Corps proceeding to [[Plancenoit]]. The 15th Brigade sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area. Von Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit. Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed by the enemy. Napoleon's Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out.<ref name=\"Hofschroer-122\">Hofschr\u00f6er (1999). p. 122.</ref> Napoleon then resorted to sending two battalions of the Middle and Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious fighting they recaptured the village.<ref name=\"Hofschroer-122\"/>\nThe French cavalry attacked the British infantry squares many times, each at heavy cost to the French but with few British casualties. Ney himself was displaced from his horse four times.<ref>Chandler (1987), p. 373.</ref> Eventually it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks.<ref name=\"Adkin361\">Adkin (2001). p. 361..</ref>\n\n[[File:Knotel - The storming of La Haye Sainte.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The storming of La Haye Sainte by Kn\u00f6tel|The storming of La Haye Sainte, by [[Richard Kn\u00f6tel]]]]\nMeanwhile, at approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, Napoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sainte at whatever the cost. Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00. Ney then moved [[horse artillery]] up towards Wellington's centre and began to destroy the infantry squares at short-range with [[canister shot|canister]].<ref name=\"Siborne439\"/> This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square. Wellington's centre was now on the verge of collapse and wide open to an attack from the French. Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand. Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre. Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support B\u00fclow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot. The value of this reinforcement at this particular moment can hardly be overestimated.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:The Battle of Waterloo, June 18th 1815 - The wars of Wellington, a narrative poem (1819), before 169 - BL.jpg|thumb|left|Wellington at the battle of Waterloo]]\nThe French army now fiercely attacked the Coalition all along the line with the culminating point being reached when Napoleon sent forward the Imperial Guard at 19:30. The attack of the Imperial Guards was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the Grenadiers or Chasseurs of the Old Guard. Marching through a hail of canister and [[skirmisher]] fire and severely outnumbered, the 3,000 or so Middle Guardsmen advanced to the west of La Haye Sainte and proceeded to separate into three distinct attack forces. One, consisting of two battalions of Grenadiers, defeated the Coalition's first line and marched on. [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9|Chass\u00e9]]'s relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them and Allied artillery fired into the victorious Grenadiers' flank. This still could not stop the Guard's advance, so Chass\u00e9 ordered his first brigade to charge the outnumbered French, who faltered and broke.<ref name=\"Chesney-178\">Chesney (1907). pp. 178\u2013179.</ref>\n\n[[File:Plas Newydd (Anglesey) - Waterloo 1.jpg|thumb|right|British 10th Hussars of Vivian's Brigade (red shakos \u2013 blue uniforms) attacking mixed French troops, including a square of Guard grenadiers (left, middle distance) in the final stages of the battle]]\n\nFurther to the west, 1,500 British Foot Guards under [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland]] were lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery. As two battalions of Chasseurs approached, the second prong of the Imperial Guard's attack, Maitland's guardsmen rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The Chasseurs deployed to counter-attack, but began to waver. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke them. The third prong, a fresh Chasseur battalion, now came up in support. The British guardsmen retreated with these Chasseurs in pursuit, but the latter were halted as the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]] wheeled in line onto their flank and poured a devastating fire into them and then charged.<ref name=\"Chesney-178\"/><ref name=\"Parry-70\">Parry (1900). p. 70.</ref> Under this onslaught they too broke.<ref name=\"Parry-70\"/>\n\nThe last of the Guard retreated headlong. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines as the astounding news spread: \"''La Garde recule. Sauve qui peut!''\" (\"The Guard retreats. Save yourself if you can!\"). Wellington then stood up in [[Copenhagen (horse)|Copenhagen]]'s stirrups, and waved his hat in the air to signal an advance of the Allied line just as the Prussians were overrunning the French positions to the east. What remained of the French army then abandoned the field in disorder. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher met at the inn of La Belle Alliance, on the north-south road which bisected the battlefield, and it was agreed that the Prussians should pursue the retreating French army back to France.<ref name=\"Chesney-178\"/> The [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 20 November 1815.<ref>{{cite book | author=Great Britain.

Detail of a painting by [[Jan Willem Pieneman]]]]\nThe campaign led to numerous other controversies, especially concerning the Prussians. For example: Were Wellington's troop dispositions prior to Napoleon's invasion of Belgium sound? Did Wellington somehow mislead or betray Bl\u00fccher by promising, then failing, to come directly to Bl\u00fccher's aid at Ligny? Who deserved the lion's share of credit for the victory\u2014Wellington or the Prussians? These and other such issues concerning Bl\u00fccher's, Wellington's, and Napoleon's decisions during the campaign were the subject of a major strategic-level study by the famous Prussian political-military theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], ''Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815'',<ref>Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815, in Carl von Clausewitz, Schriften\u2014Aufs\u00e4tze\u2014Studien\u2014Briefe, 2 volumes in 3, edited by Werner Hahlweg (G\u00f6ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1966\u201390), volume 2, part 2: 936\u20131118.</ref> English title: ''The Campaign of 1815: Strategic Overview of the Campaign''.

Christopher Bassford, Daniel Moran, and Gregory W. Pedlow (Clausewitz.com, 2010). {{ISBN|1453701508}}</ref> It attracted the attention of Wellington's staff, who prompted the Duke to write his only published essay on the campaign (other than his immediate, official after-action report, \"The Waterloo Dispatch\"), his 1842 \"Memorandum on the Battle of Waterloo\". While Wellington disputed Clausewitz on several points, the Prussian writer largely absolved Wellington of accusations levelled against him by nationalistic German axe-grinders. This exchange with Clausewitz was quite famous in Britain in the 19th century (it was heavily discussed in, for example, Chesney's ''Waterloo Lectures'' (1868).) It seems, however, to have been systematically ignored by British historians writing since 1914, which is odd considering that it was one of only two discussions of the battle that Wellington wrote. The explanation, unfortunately, is probably that it drew too much attention to the decisive German role in Wellington's victory\u2014which Wellington himself was perfectly happy to acknowledge, but which became an awkward subject given Anglo-German hostilities in the 20th century.<ref>Christopher Bassford, \"[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/one.htm Introduction],\" in Carl von Clausewitz and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellesley, ''On Waterloo: Clausewitz, Wellesley, and the Campaign of 1815'', ed./trans.

The change was prompted by the landslide [[by-election]] win of [[Daniel O'Connell]], an Irish Catholic proponent of emancipation, who was elected despite not being legally allowed to sit in Parliament. In the [[House of Lords]], facing stiff opposition, Wellington spoke for Catholic Emancipation, and according to some sources, gave one of the best speeches of his career.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/religion/cespeech.htm\n |title= The Peel Web-Wellington's speeches on Catholic Emancipation\n |last=Bloy\n |first=Marjorie\n |work=A Web of English History\n |year= 2011\n |accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> He was born in Ireland and so had some understanding of the grievances of the Catholic communities there; as Chief Secretary, he had given an undertaking that the remaining Penal Laws would only be enforced as \"mildly\" as possible.<ref name=\"Longford 1971 174\"/> In 1811 Catholic soldiers were given freedom of worship<ref>Hansard XIX, 11 March 1811. cc.350\u2013356.</ref> and 18 years later the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]] was passed with a majority of 105.

The Duke fired wide to the right. Accounts differ as to whether he missed on purpose, an act known in dueling as a ''[[delope]]''. Wellington claimed he did. However, he was noted for his poor aim and reports more sympathetic to Winchilsea claimed he had aimed to kill. Winchilsea did not fire, a plan he and his second had almost certainly decided upon before the duel.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/archives/wellington/duel10.htm\n |title=The Duel: Wellington versus Winchilsea\n |publisher=[[King's College London]]\n |accessdate=4 September 2008}}</ref> Honour was saved and Winchilsea wrote Wellington an apology.<ref name=\"Holmes275\"/>\n\nThe nickname \"Iron Duke\" originates from this period, when he experienced a high degree of personal and political unpopularity.

The Whigs could not get the bill past its second reading in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], and the bill failed. An election followed in direct response, and the Whigs were returned with a landslide majority. A second Reform Act was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but was defeated in the Tory-controlled House of Lords. Another wave of near insurrection swept the country. During this time, Wellington was greeted by a hostile reaction from the crowds at the [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. The Whig Government fell in 1832 and Wellington was unable to form a Tory Government partly because of a run on the [[Bank of England]]. This left King William IV no choice but to restore [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] to the premiership. Eventually the bill passed the House of Lords after the King threatened to fill that House with newly created Whig peers if it were not.

When the Tories were returned to power in 1834, Wellington declined to become Prime Minister because he thought membership in Commons had become essential. The king reluctantly approved Peel, who was in Italy. So for three weeks in November and December 1834, Wellington acted as interim leader, taking the responsibilities of Prime Minister and most of the other ministries.<ref name=\"Holmes289\">Holmes (2002). p. 289.</ref> In Peel's first cabinet (1834\u20131835), Wellington became [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], while in the second (1841\u20131846) he was a [[Minister without Portfolio]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]].<ref>Holmes (2002). pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> Wellington was also re-appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on 15 August 1842 following the resignation of [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Lord Hill]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=20130|page=2217|date=16 August 1842}}</ref>\n\nWellington served as the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Lords, 1828\u20131846. Some historians have belittled him as a befuddled reactionary, but a consensus in the late 20th century depicts him as a shrewd operator who hid his cleverness behind the facade of a poorly informed old soldier. Wellington worked to transform the Lords from unstinting support of the Crown to an active player in political maneuvering, with a commitment to the landed aristocracy. He used his London residence as a venue for intimate dinners and private consultations, together with extensive correspondence that kept him in close touch with party leaders in the Commons, and the main persona in the Lords. He gave public rhetorical support to [[Ultra-Tory]] anti-reform positions, but then deftly changed positions toward the party's center, especially when Peel needed support from the upper house. Wellington's success was based on the 44 Elected peers from Scotland and Ireland, whose election he controlled.<ref>Richard W. Davis, \"Wellington\" ''Parliamentary History'' (2003) 22#1 pp 43-55.</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nUpon his return from the Hanover Expedition in 1805, Wellesley received good news; owing to his new title and status, [[Kitty Pakenham]]'s family had consented to his marrying her. Wellesley and Kitty were married in Dublin on 10 April 1806.<ref>Holmes (2002). p. 96.</ref> The marriage would prove to be unsatisfactory and the two would spend years apart while Wellesley was campaigning.

They lived apart for most of the time and occupied separate rooms in the house when they were together. Her brother, [[Edward Pakenham|Edward \"Ned\" Pakenham]], served under Wellesley throughout the [[Peninsular War]] and Wellesley's regard for him helped to smooth his relations with Kitty, until Ned Pakenham's death at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in 1815.<ref>Holmes (2002), p. 206</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\n\nWellington retired from political life in 1846, although he remained [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief]], and returned briefly to the spotlight in 1848 when he helped organise a military force to protect London during that [[Revolutions of 1848|year of European revolution]].<ref>Holmes (2002). p. 292.</ref>\n\nThe Conservative Party had split over the Repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, with Wellington and most of the former Cabinet still supporting Peel, but most of the MPs led by [[Lord Derby]] supporting a protectionist stance.

In 1851, it was discovered that there were a great many sparrows flying about in [[the Crystal Palace]] just before [[the Great Exhibition]] was to open. His advice to Queen Victoria was \"Sparrowhawks, ma'am\".<ref>Holmes (2002). pp. xvi.</ref>\n\nWellington has often been portrayed as a defensive general, even though many, perhaps most, of his battles were offensive (Argaum, Assaye, Oporto, Salamanca, Vitoria, Toulouse).

uses|DOS (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=August 2009}}\n\nA '''disk operating system''' (abbreviated '''DOS''') is a computer [[operating system]] that can use a [[disk storage]] device, such as a [[floppy disk]], [[hard disk drive]], or [[optical disc]]. A disk operating system must provide a [[file system]] for organizing, reading, and writing [[computer file|files]] on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations of operating systems, such as versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] in use, and is more appropriately used only for older generations of operating systems.\n\nDisk operating systems were available for [[mainframe]]s, [[microprocessor]]s and [[home computer]]s and were usually loaded from the disks themselves as part of the [[Booting|boot process]].\n\n==History==\nIn the early days of computers, there were no disk drives, floppy disks or modern [[flash storage]] devices. Early storage devices such as [[Digital delay line|delay line]]s, [[punched card]]s, [[paper tape]], [[magnetic tape]], and [[magnetic drum]]s were used instead. And in the early days of microcomputers and [[home computer]]s, paper tape or [[audio cassette tape]] (see [[Kansas City standard]]) or nothing were used instead. In the latter case, program and data entry was done at [[front panel]] switches directly into memory or through a [[computer terminal]] / keyboard, sometimes controlled by a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) [[BASIC]] interpreter; when power was turned off after running the program, the information so entered vanished.\n\nBoth [[hard disk]]s and floppy disk drives require software to manage rapid access to block storage of sequential and other data.  When microcomputers rarely had expensive disk drives of any kind, the need to have software to manage such devices (the disks) carried much status.  To have one or the other was a mark of distinction and prestige, and so was having the disk sort of an operating system.  As prices for both disk hardware and operating system software decreased, there came to be many such microcomputer systems.\n\nMature versions of the [[Commodore 64|Commodore]], [[SWTPC]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]], and [[Apple II]] home computer systems all featured a disk operating system (actually called ''DOS'' in the case of the Commodore 64 (''[[CBM DOS]]''), Atari 8-bit family (''[[Atari DOS]]''), and Apple II machines (''[[Apple DOS]]'')), as did (at the other end of the hardware spectrum, and much earlier) [[IBM]]'s [[System/360]], [[System/370|370]] and (later) [[System/390|390]] series of [[IBM mainframe|mainframe]]s (e.g., [[DOS/360]]: ''Disk Operating System / 360'' and [[VSE (operating system)|DOS/VSE]]: ''Disk Operating System / Virtual Storage Extended'').\n\nIn large machines there were other disk operating systems, such as IBM's [[VM (operating system)|VM]], DEC's [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] / [[RT-11]] / [[OpenVMS|VMS]] / [[TOPS-10]] / [[TWENEX]], MIT's [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]] / [[Compatible Time Sharing System|CTSS]], Control Data's assorted [[network operating system|NOS]] variants, Harris's Vulcan, Bell Labs' [[Unix]], and so on. In [[microcomputer]]s, SWTPC's 6800 and 6809 machines used [[Technical Systems Consultants|TSC]]'s [[FLEX (operating system)|FLEX]] disk operating system, [[Radio Shack]]'s [[TRS-80]] machines used [[TRSDOS]], their [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] used [[OS-9]], and most of the [[Intel 8080]] based machines from IMSAI, [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] (makers of the [[Altair 8800]]), [[Cromemco]], [[North Star]], etc., used the [[CP/M-80]] disk operating system. See [[list of operating systems]].\n\nUsually, a disk operating system was loaded from a disk. Only a very few comparable DOSes were stored elsewhere than on floppy disks; among these exceptions were Commodore, whose DOS resided on ROM chips in the [[Commodore 1541|disk drive]]s themselves (the computer itself had no DOS, just a form of a [[BIOS]] for communicating with [[peripherals]]).  The [[Lt. Kernal]] hard disk subsystem for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128]] models stored its DOS on the disk, as is the case with modern systems, and loaded the DOS into [[RAM]] at boot time; the British [[BBC Micro]]'s optional [[Disc Filing System]], DFS, offered as a kit with a disk controller chip, a ROM chip, and a handful of logic chips, to be installed inside the computer.\n\n==Disk operating systems that were extensions to the OS==\n*[[Apple DOS]] was the primary operating system for the [[Apple II series]] of computers, from 1979 with the introduction of the [[floppy disk drive]], until 1983 when it was replaced by [[ProDOS]].\n*[[Commodore DOS]] was used on 8-bit [[Commodore International|Commodore]] computers such as the [[Commodore 64]]. Unlike most other DOS systems, it was integrated into the disk drives, not loaded into the computer's own memory.\n*[[Atari DOS]] was used by the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers. The Atari OS only offered low-level disk-access, so an extra layer called ''DOS'' was booted from a floppy and offered higher level functions such as filesystems.<ref name=wilkinson/> Third-party replacements for Atari DOS were also available: [[DOS XL]], [[SpartaDOS X|SpartaDOS]], MyDOS, TurboDOS, Top-DOS.\n*[[MSX-DOS]] for the [[MSX]] computer standard. Initial version, released in 1984, was nothing but MS-DOS 1.0 ported to [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]; but in 1988 it evolved to version 2, offering facilities such as subdirectories, memory management and environment strings. The MSX-DOS kernel resided in ROM (built-in on the disk controller) so basic file access capacity was available even without the command interpreter, by using [[BASIC]] extended commands.\n*[[Disc Filing System]] (DFS) This was an optional component for the Acorn [[BBC Micro]], offered as a kit with a disk controller chip, a ROM chip, and a handful of logic chips, to be installed inside the computer\n*[[Advanced Disc Filing System]] (ADFS) was a successor to Acorn's DFS.\n*[[AMSDOS]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]] computers.\n*GDOS and G+DOS, for the [[+D]] and [[DISCiPLE]] disk interfaces for the [[ZX Spectrum]].\n\n==Disk operating systems that were the main OS==\nSome disk operating systems were the operating system for the entire computer system.\n*The [[DOS/360]] initial/simple operating system for the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] family of [[mainframe computer]]s (it later became DOS/VSE, and was eventually just called [[VSE (operating system)|VSE]]).\n*The [[DEC BATCH-11/DOS-11|DOS-11]] operating system for [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] [[minicomputer]]s.\n*[[TRSDOS]] was the operating system for the [[TRS-80]] line of computers from Tandy.<ref name=trsdos/>\n*[[MS-DOS]] for [[IBM PC]] compatibles with [[Intel]] [[x86]] CPUs. It started as [[86-DOS]], which served as the basis for [[Microsoft]]'s [[MS-DOS]], and was rebranded by IBM as [[IBM PC DOS]] until 1993. Various compatible systems were later produced by different organizations, starting with [[DR-DOS]] in 1988.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[live CD]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=wilkinson>{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Bill|title=Inside Atari DOS|date=1982|publisher=COMPUTE!

Where there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, ...}}\n\n== Theoretical approaches ==\nAlthough the theories that premise doublespeak are still indefinite, there are some theories that have parallels with the theory of doublespeak and Orwell's ideology in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and might possibly provide a better understanding of where doublespeak's theories could have come from.\n\n===Conflict theories===\nDue to the inherently deceptive nature of doublespeak as well as its prominent use in politics, doublespeak has been linked{{By whom|date=October 2015}} {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} to the sociological perspective known as [[conflict theories]]. Conflict theories detract from ideas of society being naturally in harmony, instead placing emphasis on political and material inequality as its structural features. [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s concepts on [[cultural hegemony]], in particular, suggest that the culture and values of the economic elite \u2013 the [[bourgeoisie]] \u2013 become indoctrinated as \"common sense\" to the working-class, allowing for the maintenance of the status quo through misplaced belief. Being himself one of the leaders of the [[Communist Party of Italy]], his theories had, in turn, been strongly influenced by the German social thinker [[Karl Marx]], and have their ideological roots grounded in [[Marxist]] theory of [[false consciousness]] and capitalist exploitation. While Gramsci's views argue that culture (beliefs, perceptions and values) allows the ruling class to maintain domination, Marx's explanation is along more economic lines, with concepts such as [[commodity fetishism]] demonstrating how the ideology of the bourgeoisie (in this case, the existence of property as a social creation rather than an \"eternal entity\") dominate over that of the working classes.<ref name=\"German Ideology\">{{cite book| last1 = Marx| first1 = Karl| last2 = Engels| first2 = Friedrich |author-link2=Friedrich Engels | title = The German Ideology| edition = 2004| year = 1970| publisher = International Publishers Co,1970| isbn = 0-7178-0302-3| pages = 18\u201319 }}</ref> \nIn both cases, both philosophers argue that one view \u2013 that of the bourgeoisie \u2013 dominates over others, hence the term conflict theories.\n\nOn the other hand, Terrence P. Moran of the US [[National Council of Teachers of English]] has compared the use of doublespeak in the mass media to laboratory experiments conducted on rats, where a batch of rats were deprived of food, before one half was fed sugar and water and the other half a saccharin solution. Both groups exhibited behavior indicating that their hunger was satisfied, but rats in the second group (which were fed saccharin solution) died from malnutrition. Moran highlights the structural nature of doublespeak, and notes that social institutions such as the mass media adopt an active, top-down approach in managing opinion. Therefore, Moran parallels doublespeak to producing an illusionary effect:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moran |first=Terrence |title=Public Doublespeak; 1984 and Beyond |journal=College English |date=Oct 1975 |volume=37 |issue=2 |page=224 |jstor=375076}}</ref>\n{{quote|This experiment suggests certain analogies between the environments created for rats by the scientists and the environments created for us humans by language and the various mass media of communication. Like the saccharine environment, an environment created or infiltrated by doublespeak provides the appearance of nourishment and the promise of survival, but the appearance is illusionary and the promise false.}}\n\n===Contemporary writings===\n\nDoublespeak might also have some connections with contemporary theories.\n[[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] note in their book that Orwellian doublespeak is an important component of the manipulation of the English language in American media, through a process called \"dichotomization\"; a component of media propaganda involving \"deeply embedded double standards in the reporting of news\".  For example, the use of state funds by the poor and financially needy is commonly referred to as \"[[social welfare]]\" or \"[[handout]]s\", which the \"coddled\" poor \"take advantage of\". These terms, however, do not apply to other beneficiaries of government spending such as military spending.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Goodwin |first=Jeff |title=What's Right (And Wrong) about Left Media Criticism? Herman and Chomsky's Propaganda Model |journal=Sociological Forum |date=March 1994 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=102\u2013103 |jstor=684944 |doi=10.1007/bf01507710}}</ref>\n\nExamples of the structural nature of the use of Doublespeak have been made by modern scholars. Noam Chomsky argues in ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' that people in modern society consist of decision-makers and social participants who have to be made to agree.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1991\">{{cite book| last1 = Chomsky| first1 = Noam| last2 = Herman | first2 = Edward S. |title = Manufacturing Consent| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JfOM2H_AbIIC&pg=PA53| year = 1991| publisher = Black Rose Books| location = 52| isbn = 1-55164-002-3 }}</ref> According to Chomsky, the media and public relations industry actively shape public opinion, working to present messages in line with their economic agenda for the purposes of controlling of the \"public mind\".<ref name=\"Chomsky 1991\"/> Contrary to the popular belief that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy, Chomsky goes so far as to argue that \"it's the essence of democracy\":<ref name=\"Chomsky 1991\"/>\n{{quote|The point is that in a ... totalitarian state, it doesn't much matter what people think because ... you can control what they do. But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can't control people by force and when the voice of the people can be heard, ... you have to control what people think. And the standard way to do this is to resort to what in more honest days used to be called propaganda. Manufacture of consent. Creation of necessary illusions.}}\n\nEdward Herman's book ''Beyond Hypocrisy'' also includes a doublespeak dictionary of commonly employed media terms and phrases into plain English.\n\nHenceforth, [[conflict theories]] demonstrate the dominating ideology of the bourgeoisie and Moran's theory highlights that doublespeak produces an illusionary effect, both theories having parallels to Orwell's ideology in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. Similarly, Herman's theory of doublespeak having an inherent nature to be manipulative and Chomsky's theory of \"dichotomization\" relates directly to the practice of doublespeak and how doublespeak is deliberately deceptive in nature.\n\n==Main contributors==\n\n===William Lutz===\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?10449-1/doublespeak ''Booknotes'' interview with William Lutz on ''Doublespeak: The Use of Language to Deceive You''], December 31, 1989, [[C-SPAN]]}}\n[[William D. Lutz]] has served as the third chairman of the Doublespeak Committee since 1975. In 1989, both his own book ''Doublespeak'' and, under his editorship, the committee's third book, ''Beyond Nineteen Eighty-Four'', were published. Lutz was also the former editor of the now defunct ''Quarterly Review of Doublespeak'', which examines ways that jargon has polluted the public vocabulary with phrases, words and usages of words designed to obscure the meaning of plain English. His book, ''Beyond Nineteen Eighty-Four'', consists of 220 pages and eighteen articles contributed by long-time Committee members and others whose body of work has made important contributions to understandings about language, as well as a bibliography of 103 sources on doublespeak.<ref name=\"Hasselriis 1991 28\u201335\">{{cite journal |last=Hasselriis |first=Peter |title=From Pearl Harbor to Watergate to Kuwait: \"Language in Thought and Action\" |journal=The English Journal |date=February 1991 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=28\u201335}}</ref>\n\nLutz is one of the main contributors to the committee as well as promoting the term \"doublespeak\" to a mass audience so as to inform them of the deceptive qualities that doublespeak contains. He mentions:<ref name=\"William Lutz\">{{cite news |title=A new look at 'doublespeak' |newspaper=Advertising Age |date=November 6, 1989 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n{{quote|There is more to being an effective consumer of language than just expressing dismay at dangling modifiers, faulty subject and verb agreement, or questionable usage. All who use language should be concerned whether statements and facts agree, whether language is, in Orwell's words, \"largely the defense of the indefensible\" and whether language \"is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\".}}\n\nHe also mentions that the NCTE Committee on Public Doublespeak and their works with regards to educating the public on doublespeak is responsible for \"the rather awesome task of combating the advertisers, the politicians, and the major manipulators of public language in our society\".<ref name=\"William Lutz\"/>\n\nLutz states that it is important to highlight doublespeak to the public because \"language isn't the invention of human beings to lie, deceive, mislead, and manipulate\" and the \"purpose of language is to communicate the truth and to facilitate social groups getting together\". Thus, according to Lutz, doublespeak is a form of language that defeats the purpose of inventing language because doublespeak does not communicate the truth but seeks to do the opposite and the doublespeak committee is tasked with correcting this problem that doublespeak has created in the world of language.<ref>{{cite news |title=Doublespeak; Care in language use, a defense against deception |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=November 22, 1982}}</ref>\n\n===NCTE Committee on Public Doublespeak===\n{{Main|National Council of Teachers of English}}\n\nThe '''National Council of Teachers of English''' (NCTE) Committee on Public Doublespeak was formed in 1971, in the midst of the Watergate scandal, at a point when there was widespread skepticism about the degree of truth which characterized relationships between the public and the worlds of politics, the military, and business. NCTE passed two resolutions. One called for the Council to find means to study dishonest and inhumane uses of language and literature by advertisers, to bring offenses to public attention, and to propose classroom techniques for preparing children to cope with commercial propaganda. The other called for the Council to find means to study the relations of language to public policy, to keep track of, publicize, and combat semantic distortion by public officials, candidates for office, political commentators, and all those who transmit through the mass media. Bringing the charges of the two resolutions to life was accomplished by forming NCTE's Committee on Public Doublespeak, a body which has made significant contributions in describing the need for reform where clarity in communication has been deliberately distorted. Such structures can be applied to the field of education, where they could conceivably initiate an anti-pollution bandwagon in educational communication and educate people on how to counter doublespeak.<ref name=\"Robert S.Zais\">{{cite journal|last=Zais|first=Robert S.|title=Labels, Bandwagons, & Linguistic Pollution in the Field of Education|journal=The English Journal|date=September 1978|volume=67|issue=6|pages=51\u201353}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Lutz stated that \"the doublespeak committee was formed to combat the use of public language by increasing people's awareness of what is good, clear, solid use of language and what is not.\" \"The committee does more than help students and the general public recognize what doublespeak is; it dramatizes that clarity of expression reflects clarity of thought.\"<ref name=\"William Lutz\"/>\n\n====Hugh Rank====\nHugh Rank formed the Doublespeak committee and was the first chairman of this committee. Under his editorship, the committee produced a book called ''Language and Public Policy'' (1974), with the aim of informing readers of the extensive scope of doublespeak being used to deliberately mislead and deceive the audience. He highlighted the deliberate public misuses of language and provided strategies for countering doublespeak by focusing on educating people in the English language so as to help them identify when doublespeak is being put into play. He was also the founder of the Intensify/Downplay pattern that has been widely used to identify instances of Doublespeak being used.<ref name=\"Robert S.Zais\"/>\n\n====Daniel Dieterich====\nDaniel Dieterich served as the second chairman of the Doublespeak committee after Hugh Rank in 1975. He served as editor of its second publication, ''Teaching about Doublespeak (1976)'', which carried forward the Committee's charge to inform teachers of ways of teaching students how to recognize and combat language designed to mislead and misinform.<ref name=\"Robert S.Zais\"/>\n\n====Criticism of NCTE====\nA. M. Tibbetts is one of the main critics of the NCTE, claiming that \"the Committee's very approach to the misuse of language and what it calls 'doublespeak' may in the long run limit its usefulness\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\">{{cite journal|last=Tibbetts|first=A.M.|title=A Case of Confusion: The NCTE Committee on Public Doublespeak|journal=College English|date=December 1978|volume=40|issue=4|pages=407\u201312}}</ref> According to him, the \"Committee's use of Orwell is both confused and confusing\". The NCTE's publications resonate with George Orwell's name, and allusions to him abound in statements on doublespeak; for example, the committee quoted Orwell's remark that \"language is often used as an instrument of social control\" in ''Language and Public Policy''. Tibbetts argues that such a relation between NCTE and Orwell's work is contradicting because \"the Committee's attitude towards language is liberal, even radical\" while \"Orwell's attitude was conservative, even reactionary\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\" /> He also criticizes on the Committee's \"continual attack\" against linguistic \"[[Linguistic purism|purism]]\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\"/>\n\n== Modern uses ==\n\nWhereas in the early days of the practice it was considered wrong to construct words to disguise meaning, this is now an accepted{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} and established practice. There is a thriving industry in constructing words without explicit meaning but with particular connotations for new products or companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doublespeak|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Doublespeak}}</ref> Doublespeak is also employed in the field of politics. Hence, education is necessary to recognize and combat against doublespeak-use effectively.\n\n=== In advertising ===\nAdvertisers can use doublespeak to mask their commercial intent from users, as users' defenses against advertising become more well entrenched.<ref name=\"Walker Gibson\">{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Walker|title=Public Doublespeak: Doublespeak in Advertising|journal=The English Journal|date=February 1975|volume=64|issue=2}}</ref> Some are attempting to counter this technique, however, with a number of systems which offer diverse views and information which highlights the manipulative and dishonest methods that advertisers employ.<ref name=\"Sidney J. Hormell\">{{cite journal|last=Hormell|first=Sidney J.|title=Public Doublespeak: Cable TV, Media Systems, and Doublespeak (Or) Something Funny Happened to the Message on the Way to the Audience.|journal=The English Journal|date=May 1975|volume=64|issue=5}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Jacques Ellul]], \"the aim is not to even modify people\u2019s ideas on a given subject, rather, it is to achieve conformity in the way that people act.\" He demonstrates this view by offering an example from drug advertising. By using doublespeak in advertisements, aspirin production rose by almost 50 percent from over 23 million pounds in 1960 to over 35 million pounds in 1970.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dieterich|first=Daniel J.|title=Public Doublespeak: Teaching about Language in the Marketplace|journal=College English|date=December 1974|volume=36|issue=4|pages=477\u201381}}</ref>\n\n==== The rule of parity ====\nWilliam Lutz's book ''The Rule of Parity'' illustrates how doublespeak is being employed in the advertising industry.\n\nLutz uses the example of parity products: products in which most, if not all, brands in a class or category are of similar quality. To highlight the uniqueness of their product, advertisers may choose to market it differently from their competitors. Advertising is used to create the impression of superiority. This is shown in the first rule of parity, which involves the use of the words \"better\" and \"best\". In parity claims, \"better\" means \"best\", and \"best\" means \"equal to\".<ref name=\"Peter Hasselriis\">{{cite journal|last=Hasselriis|first=Peter|title=All Toothpastes Are Equal (=Best): William Lutz's \"Doublespeak\" Doublespeak: From \"Revenue Enhancement\" to \"Terminal Living\": How Government, Business, Advertisers, and Others Use Language to Deceive You by William Lutz|journal=The English Journal|date=February 1991|volume=80|issue=2|pages=91\u201392}}</ref>\n\nLutz goes on to say that when advertisers state that their product is \"good\", it is equivalent in meaning to saying that their product is the best. If all the brands are similar, they must all be similarly good. When they claim that their product is the \"best\", they mean that the product is as good as the other superior products in its category. Using the toothpaste industry as an example, Lutz says that, because there is no dramatic difference among the products of the major toothpaste companies today, they are equal. However, if all of the different toothpastes are good and equal, there is no need to prove their claim. On the contrary, advertisers cannot market their products as \"better\" as it is a comparative term, and a claim of superiority.<ref name=\"Peter Hasselriis\"/>\n\n===Education against doublespeak===\nEducating students has been suggested by experts to be one of the ways to counter doublespeak. Educating students in the English language is important to help them identify how doublespeak is being used to mislead and conceal information.\n\nCharles Weingartner, one of the founding members of the NCTE committee on Public Doublespeak mentioned: \"people do not know enough about the subject (the reality) to recognize that the language being used conceals, distorts, misleads\". There is a crucial need for English language teachers to educate and become experts in teaching about linguistic vulnerability. \"Teachers of English should teach our students that words are not things, but verbal tokens or signs of things that should finally be carried back to the things that they stand for to be verified. Students should be taught a healthy skepticism about the potential abuse of language but duly warned about the dangers of an unhealthy cynicism.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kehl|first=D.G|author2=Howard Livingston|title=Doublespeak Detection for the English Classroom|journal=The English Journal|date=July 1999|volume=88|issue=6}}</ref>\n\nAccording to William Lutz: \"Only by teaching respect and love for the language can teachers of English instill in students the sense of outrage they should experience when they encounter doublespeak.\" \"Students must first learn to use the language effectively, to understand its beauty and power.\" \"Only by using language well will we come to appreciate the perversion inherent in doublespeak.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lutz|first=William|title=Fourteen Years of Doublespeak|journal=The English Journal|date=March 1988|volume=77|issue=3 |jstor=818411}}</ref>\n\n====Intensify/downplay pattern====\nThis pattern was formulated by Hugh Rank and is a simple tool designed to teach some basic patterns of persuasion used in political propaganda and commercial advertising. As it was formulated to educate the public on how to counter doublespeak via education, its aim was to reach the widest possible audience of citizens. It was prepared to be incorporated within a wide variety of existing programs and textbooks in English, speech, media, communications, journalism, social studies. The NCTE has endorsed this pattern as a useful way of teaching students to cope with propaganda from any source.\n\nThe function of the intensify/downplay pattern is not to dictate what should be discussed but to encourage coherent thought and systematic organization. The pattern works in two ways: intensifying and downplaying.  All people intensify and this is done via repetition, association and composition. Downplaying is commonly done via omission, diversion and confusion as they communicate in words, gestures, numbers, et cetera. Individuals can better cope with organized persuasion by recognizing the common ways whereby communication is intensified or downplayed, so as to counter doublespeak.<ref name=\"Hasselriis 1991 28\u201335\"/>\n\n=== In politics ===\n \nDoublespeak is often used to avoid answering questions or to avoid the public's questions without directly stating that the specific politician is ignoring or rephrasing the question.\n\n====Doublespeak Award====\n\n{{Main|Doublespeak Award}}\n\nDoublespeak is often used by politicians for the advancement of their agenda. The [[Doublespeak Award]] is an \"ironic tribute to public speakers who have perpetuated language that is grossly deceptive, evasive, euphemistic, confusing, or self-centered.\" It has been issued by the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (NCTE) since 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=NCTE: The Doublespeak Award|url=http://www.ncte.org/volunteer/groups/publiclangcom/doublespeakaward}}</ref>  The recipients of the Doublespeak Award are usually politicians, national administration or departments. An example of this is the United States Department of Defense, which won the award three times in 1991, 1993, and 2001 respectively. For the 1991 award, the United States Department of Defense \"swept the first six places in the Doublespeak top ten\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Tom|title=Rape trial deserved award for doublespeak|newspaper=The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec)|date=December 21, 1991}}</ref> for using euphemisms like \"servicing the target\" (bombing) and \"force packages\" (warplanes). Among the other phrases in contention were \"difficult exercise in labor relations\", meaning a strike, and \"meaningful downturn in aggregate output\", an attempt to avoid saying the word \"recession\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===In comedy===\n\nDoublespeak, particularly when exaggerated, can be used as a device in satirical comedy and social commentary to [[Irony|ironically]] parody political or bureaucratic establishments intent on obfuscation or prevarication.  The television series ''[[Yes Minister]]'' is notable for its use of this device.{{sfn|Herron|2007|p=144}}  [[Oscar Wilde]] was an early proponent of this device{{sfn|Killeen|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Bennett|2015}}{{sfn|Raby|1997}} and a significant influence on Orwell.{{sfn|Bennett|2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aesopian language]]\n* [[Alternative facts]]\n* [[Business speak]]\n* [[Catachresis]]\n* [[Cognitive dissonance]]\n* [[Double bind]]\n* [[Double entendre]]\n* [[Double-talk]]\n* [[Doublespeak Award]]\n* [[Euphemism]]\n* [[Obscurantism]]\n* [[Polite fiction]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book| last = Baar| first = James| title = Spinspeak II: The Dictionary Of Language Pollution| year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-4184-2742-9 }}\n*{{cite book| last1=Bennett| first1=Michael| title=Oscar Wilde's Society Plays |date=2015|publisher=Springer|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=w41MCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT17&lpg=PT17&dq=doublespeak+oscar+wilde&source=bl&ots=gF3l9xL6tY&sig=IQBPSA_WpRkttoLknOSqbuC2AAA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX5fmTyYzQAhXsyVQKHQQCAQoQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&q=doublespeak%20oscar%20wilde&f=false| accessdate = 3 November 2016|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book| author = Edward S.

Kate and the stranger stalk each other through the museum until they finally wind up outside, where Kate joins him in a taxi. They begin to have sex and continue at his apartment.\n\nHours later, Kate awakens and decides to discreetly leave while the man, Warren Lockman, is asleep. Kate sits at his desk to leave him a note and finds a document indicating that Warren has contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Mortified, she leaves the apartment. In her haste, she has left her wedding ring on the nightstand, so she returns to retrieve it.\n\nThe elevator doors open on the figure of a tall, blond woman in dark sunglasses wielding a straight razor. Kate is violently slashed to death in the elevator. A high-priced call girl, Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), happens upon the body. She catches a glimpse of the killer, therefore becoming both the prime suspect and the killer's next target.\n\nDr. Elliott receives a bizarre message on his answering machine from \"Bobbi\", a transsexual patient. Bobbi taunts the psychiatrist for breaking off their therapy sessions, apparently because Elliott refuses to sign the necessary papers for Bobbi to get [[sex-reassignment surgery]]. Elliott tries to convince Dr. Levy, the patient's new doctor, that Bobbi is a danger to herself and others.\n\nPolice Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) is skeptical about Liz's story, partly because of her profession, so Liz joins forces with Kate's revenge-minded son Peter (Keith Gordon) to find the killer. Peter, an inventor, uses a series of homemade listening devices and time-lapse cameras to track patients leaving Elliott's office. They catch Bobbi on camera, and soon Liz is being stalked by a tall blonde in sunglasses. Several attempts are subsequently made on Liz's life. One, in the New York City Subway, is thwarted by Peter, who sprays Bobbi with homemade Mace.\n\nLiz and Peter scheme to learn Bobbi's birth name by getting inside Dr. Elliott's office. Liz baits the therapist by stripping to lingerie and coming on to him, distracting him long enough to make a brief exit and leaf through his appointment book. Peter is watching through the window when a blonde pulls him away. When Liz returns, a blonde with a razor confronts her; the blonde outside shoots and wounds the blonde inside, the wig falls off, and it is Dr. Elliott, revealing that he is also Bobbi. The blonde who shot Bobbi is actually a female police officer, revealing herself to be the blonde who has been trailing Liz.\n\nElliott is arrested and placed in an insane asylum. Dr. Levy explains later to Liz that Elliott wanted to be a woman, but his male side would not allow him to go through with the operation. Whenever a woman sexually aroused Elliott, Bobbi, representing the unstable, female side of the doctor's personality, became threatened to the point that it finally became murderous. When Dr. Levy realized this through his last conversation with Elliott, he called the police on the spot, who then, with his help, did their duty.\n\nIn a final sequence, Elliott escapes from the asylum and slashes Liz's throat in a bloody act of vengeance. She wakes up screaming, Peter rushing to her side, realizing that it was just a dream.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dr. Robert Elliott\n* [[Angie Dickinson]] as Kate Miller\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Liz Blake\n* [[Keith Gordon]] as Peter Miller\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Detective Marino\n* [[David Margulies]] as Dr. Levy\n* Ken Baker as Warren Lockman\n* Susanna Clemm as Betty Luce\n* [[Brandon Maggart]] as Cleveland Sam\n* [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as the voice of Bobbi\n\n==Production==\nThe nude body in the opening scene, taking place in a shower, was not that of Angie Dickinson, but of 1977 ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' [[List of Penthouse Pets|Pet of the Year]] model Victoria Lynn Johnson.<ref>Kenny, Glenn (September 06, 2011).

In it, [[fuel]] is ignited by heat generated during the compression of air in the combustion chamber, into which fuel is then injected. This is in contrast to igniting the fuel-air mixture with a [[spark plug]] as in the [[Otto cycle]] (four-stroke/petrol) engine. Diesel engines are used in [[Aircraft_diesel_engine|aircraft]], [[automobile]]s, [[power generation]], [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s, and both surface [[ship]]s and [[submarine]]s.\n\nThe Diesel cycle is assumed to have constant pressure during the initial part of the combustion phase (<math>V_2</math> to <math>V_3</math> in the diagram, below). This is an idealized mathematical model: real physical diesels do have an increase in pressure during this period, but it is less pronounced than in the Otto cycle. In contrast, the idealized [[Otto cycle]] of a [[four-stroke cycle|gasoline engine]] approximates a constant volume process during that phase.\n\n== Idealized Diesel cycle ==\n[[Image:DieselCycle PV.svg|thumb|300px|left|[[p-V Diagram]] for the ideal Diesel cycle. The cycle follows the numbers 1-4 in clockwise direction.]]\n\nThe image on the left shows a [[p-V diagram]] for the ideal Diesel cycle; where <math>p</math> is [[pressure]] and V the volume or <math>v</math> the [[specific volume]] if the process is placed on a unit mass basis. The ideal Diesel cycle follows the following four distinct processes:\n\n* Process 1 to 2 is [[isentropic]] compression of the fluid (blue)\n* Process 2 to 3 is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] constant pressure heating (red)\n* Process 3 to 4 is isentropic expansion (yellow)\n* Process 4 to 1 is reversible constant volume cooling (green)<ref>Eastop & McConkey 1993, ''Applied Thermodynamics for Engineering Technologists'', Pearson Education Limited, Fifth Edition, p.137</ref>\n\nThe Diesel engine is a heat engine: it converts [[heat]] into [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]].  During the bottom isentropic processes (blue), energy is transferred into the system in the form of work <math>W_{in}</math>, but by definition (isentropic) no energy is transferred into or out of the system in the form of heat. During the constant pressure (red, [[isobaric process |isobaric]]) process, energy enters the system as heat <math>Q_{in}</math>. During the top isentropic processes (yellow), energy is transferred out of the system in the form of <math>W_{out}</math>, but by definition (isentropic) no energy is transferred into or out of the system in the form of heat. During the constant volume (green, [[isochoric process|isochoric]]) process, some of energy flows out of the system as heat through the right depressurizing process <math>Q_{out}</math>. The work that leaves the system is equal to the work that enters the system plus the difference between the heat added to the system and the heat that leaves the system; in other words, net gain of work is equal to the difference between the heat added to the system and the heat that leaves the system.\n\n* Work in (<math>W_{in}</math>) is done by the piston compressing the air (system)\n* Heat in (<math>Q_{in}</math>) is done by the [[combustion]] of the fuel\n* Work out (<math>W_{out}</math>) is done by the working fluid expanding and pushing a piston (this produces usable work)\n* Heat out (<math>Q_{out}</math>) is done by venting the air\n* Net work produced = <math>Q_{in}</math> - <math>Q_{out}</math>\n\nThe net work produced is also represented by the area enclosed by the cycle on the P-V diagram. The net work is produced per cycle and is also called the useful work, as it can be turned to other useful types of energy and propel a vehicle ([[kinetic energy]]) or produce electrical energy. The summation of many such cycles per unit of time is called the developed power. The <math>W_{out}</math> is also called the gross work, some of which is used in the next cycle of the engine to compress the next charge of air.\n\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Maximum thermal efficiency ===\nThe maximum thermal efficiency of a Diesel cycle is dependent on the compression ratio and the cut-off ratio. It has the following formula under cold [[Standard state|air standard]] analysis: \n\n<math>\\eta_{th}=1-\\frac{1}{r^{\\gamma-1}}\\left ( \\frac{\\alpha^{\\gamma}-1}{\\gamma(\\alpha-1)} \\right )</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\eta_{th} </math> is [[thermal efficiency]]\n:<math>\\alpha</math> is the cut-off ratio <math>\\frac{V_3}{V_2}</math> (ratio between the end and start volume for the combustion phase)\n:{{math|r}} is the [[compression ratio]] <math>\\frac{V_1}{V_2}</math>\n:<math>\\gamma </math> is ratio of [[specific heat capacity|specific heats]] (C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>v</sub>)<ref>[http://230nsc1.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/diesel.html The Diesel Engine]</ref>\n\nThe cut-off ratio can be expressed in terms of temperature as shown below:\n:<math>\\frac{T_2}{T_1} ={\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)^{\\gamma-1}} = r^{\\gamma-1}</math>\n\n:<math> \\displaystyle {T_2} ={T_1} r^{\\gamma-1} </math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_3}{V_2} = \\frac{T_3}{T_2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{T_3}{T_1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{r^{\\gamma-1}}\\right)</math>\n\n<math>T_3</math> can be approximated to the flame temperature of the fuel used. The flame temperature can be approximated to the [[adiabatic flame temperature]] of the fuel with corresponding air-to-fuel ratio and compression pressure, <math>p_3</math>.\n<math>T_1</math> can be approximated to the inlet air temperature.\n\nThis formula only gives the ideal thermal efficiency. The actual thermal efficiency will be significantly lower due to heat and friction losses. The formula is more complex than the Otto cycle (petrol/gasoline engine) relation that has the following formula;\n\n<math>\\eta_{otto,th}=1-\\frac{1}{r^{\\gamma-1}}</math>\n\nThe additional complexity for the Diesel formula comes around since the heat addition is at constant pressure and the heat rejection is at constant volume. The Otto cycle by comparison has both the heat addition and rejection at constant volume.\n\nComparing the two formulae it can be seen that for a given compression ratio ({{math|r}}), the ideal Otto cycle will be more efficient. However, a [[diesel engine]] will be more efficient overall since it will have the ability to operate at higher compression ratios.  If a petrol engine were to have the same compression ratio, then knocking (self-ignition) would occur and this would severely reduce the efficiency, whereas in a diesel engine, the self ignition is the desired behavior.  Additionally, both of these cycles are only idealizations, and the actual behavior does not divide as clearly or sharply.  Furthermore, the ideal Otto cycle formula stated above does not include throttling losses, which do not apply to diesel engines.\n\n== Applications ==\n===Diesel engines ===\n{{main|Diesel engine}}\nDiesel engines have the lowest [[specific fuel consumption (shaft engine)|specific fuel consumption]] of any large internal combustion engine employing a single cycle, 0.26&nbsp;lb/hp\u00b7h (0.16&nbsp;kg/kWh) for very large marine engines (combined cycle power plants are more efficient, but employ two engines rather than one). Two-stroke diesels with high pressure forced induction, particularly [[turbocharging]], make up a large percentage of the very largest diesel engines.\n\nIn [[North America]], diesel engines are primarily used in large trucks, where the low-stress, high-efficiency cycle leads to much longer engine life and lower operational costs. These advantages also make the diesel engine ideal for use in the heavy-haul railroad environment.\n\n=== Other internal combustion engines without spark plugs ===\nMany [[model airplane]]s use very simple \"glow\" and \"diesel\" engines.  Glow engines use [[glow plug]]s.  \"Diesel\" model airplane engines have variable compression ratios.  Both types depend on special fuels.\n\nSome 19th-century or earlier experimental engines used external flames, exposed by valves, for ignition, but this becomes less attractive with increasing compression.  (It was the research of [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot]] that established the thermodynamic value of compression.)  A historical implication of this is that the diesel engine could have been invented without the aid of electricity.\n<br /> See the development of the  [[hot bulb engine]] and [[indirect injection]] for historical significance.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Diesel engine]]\n* [[Hot bulb engine]]\n* [[Mixed/dual cycle]]\n* [[Partially premixed combustion]]\n{{Thermodynamic cycles|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diesel Cycle}}\n[[Category:Thermodynamic cycles]]", "sha1": "m6ago2zeydk19755qtaz33ymks1dltw"}}, {"title": "Deus Ex (video game)", "ns": "0", "id": "8484", "revision": {"id": "866441194", "parentid": "865132322", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T10:44:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Harshrathod50", "id": "24004857"}, "minor": "", "comment": "clean up, replaced: [[multiplayer]] \u2192 [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{distinguish|Deus Ex Machina (video game)}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title      = Deus Ex\n| image      = Dxcover.jpg\n| developer  = [[Ion Storm]]\n| publisher  = [[Eidos Interactive]]\n| director   = [[Warren Spector]]\n| producer   = Warren Spector\n| designer   = [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]]\n| programmer = Chris Norden\n| artist     = Jay Lee\n| writer     = Sheldon Pacotti\n| composer   = {{Unbulleted list|[[Alexander Brandon]]|[[Dan Gardop\u00e9e]]|[[Michiel van den Bos]]}}\n| series     = ''[[Deus Ex]]''\n| engine     = [[Unreal Engine]]\n| platforms  = {{Unbulleted list|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]]|[[PlayStation 2]]}}\n| released   = {{Collapsible list|titlestyle=font-weight:normal;background:transparent;text-align:left|title=June 17, 2000|'''Microsoft Windows'''{{Video game release|WW|June 17, 2000}}'''Mac OS'''{{Video game release|NA|July 7, 2000}}'''PlayStation 2'''{{Video game release|NA|March 26, 2002|EU|June 7, 2002}}}}\n| genre      = [[Action role-playing game|Action role-playing]], [[first-person shooter]], [[Stealth game|stealth]]\n| modes      = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n}}\n\n'''''Deus Ex''''' is a 2000 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ion Storm]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]].

A modified version of the game was released later for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2002. In the years following its release, ''Deus Ex'' has received additional improvements and content from its fan community.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim, including repeatedly being named \"Best PC Game of All Time\" in ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s \"Top 100 PC Games\" in 2011 and in a poll carried out by the UK gaming magazine ''[[PC Zone]]''. It was a frequent candidate for and winner of Game of the Year awards, drawing praise for its pioneering designs in player choice and multiple narrative paths. It has sold more than 1 million copies, as of April 23, 2009. The game has spawned both a sequel, ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'', released in 2003, and three prequels: ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'', released in 2011, ''[[Deus Ex: The Fall]]'', released in 2013, and ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'', released in 2016.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Deus Ex'' incorporates elements from four [[video game genre]]s: [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[first-person shooter]], [[adventure game|adventure]], and \"[[immersive sim]]ulation\", the last of which being a game where \"nothing reminds you that you're just playing a game\".<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3114/postmortem_ion_storms_deus_ex.php |last=Spector |first=Warren |title=Postmortem: Ion Storm's ''Deus Ex'' |date=2000-12-06 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=July 24, 2007 }}</ref> For example, the game uses a [[Point of view (literature)#Other types and uses|first-person]] camera during gameplay and includes exploration and character interaction as primary features.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" />\n\nThe player assumes the role of JC Denton, a [[Nanotechnology in fiction|nanotech]]-augmented operative of the [[United Nations]] Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO).<ref name=\"dxmanual\">''Deus Ex'' game manual</ref> This nanotechnology is a central gameplay mechanism and allows players to perform [[superhuman]] feats.\n\n=== Role-playing elements ===\nAs the player accomplishes objectives, the [[player character]] is rewarded with \"skill points\".

The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).\n\n=== Combat elements ===\n''Deus Ex'' features combat similar to first-person shooters, with [[real time (media)|real-time]] action, a first-person perspective, and reflex-based gameplay.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" /> As the player will often encounter enemies in groups, combat often tends toward a tactical approach, including the use of cover, strafing, and \"[[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]]\".

Objectives can be completed in numerous ways, including [[Stealth game|stealth]], sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and certain aspects of the story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.\n\nBecause of its design focus on player choice, ''Deus Ex'' has been compared with ''[[System Shock]]'', a game that inspired its design.<ref name=\"kierongillen\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer\"/> Together, these factors give the game a great degree of replayability, as the player will have vastly different experiences, depending on which methods he or she uses to accomplish objectives.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n''Deus Ex'' was designed as a [[single player]] game, and the initial releases of the Windows and Macintosh versions of the game did not include [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] functionality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/specials/special.pl?spec=deusex&pagenum=1 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110605223321/http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/specials/special.pl?spec=deusex&pagenum=1 |archivedate=2011-06-05 |title=Interview with Warren Spector |work=www.gaming-age.com |last=Klepek |first=Patrick |accessdate=2006-12-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Support for multiplayer modes was later incorporated through [[patch (computing)|patches]].<ref name=\"gamespy2\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december00/dxmp/index2.shtm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64z2lz0cZ?url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december00/dxmp/index2.shtm |archivedate=January 26, 2012 |title=''Deus Ex'' goes Multiplayer |work=Gamespy |author=John \"Warrior\" Keefer |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The component includes three game modes: deathmatch, basic team deathmatch, and advanced team [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]].

Mysterious groups such as [[Majestic 12]], the [[Illuminati]], the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Bilderberg Group]], and the [[Trilateral Commission]] also either play a central part in the plot or are alluded to during the course of the game.\n\nThe plot of ''Deus Ex'' depicts a society on a slow spiral into chaos. There is a massive division between the rich and the poor, not only socially, but in some cities physically. A lethal [[pandemic]] known as the \"Gray Death\" ravages the world's population, especially within the [[United States]], and has no cure. A synthetic [[vaccine]], \"Ambrosia\", manufactured by the company VersaLife, nullifies the effects of the virus but is in critically short supply. Because of its scarcity, Ambrosia is available only to those deemed \"vital to the [[social order]]\", and finds its way primarily to government officials, military personnel, the rich and influential, scientists, and the intellectual elite. With no hope for the common people of the world, riots occur worldwide, and a number of terrorist organizations have formed with the professed intent of assisting the downtrodden, among them the National Secessionist Forces<ref name=\"KotakuPredictive\"/> of the U.S., and a French group known as Silhouette.\n\nIn order to combat these threats to the world order, the [[United Nations]] has expanded its influence around the globe to form the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO).<ref name=\"wendiwhite\">'''Wendi White (in''' '''''Righteous Angels: Perspectives on UNATCO''''' '''):''' As the giddiness that greeted the new millennium faded to grim apathy in the face of the plague, famine, and the inevitable waves of national convulsions that followed in their wake, the United Nations found itself increasingly outmoded and unable to cope with the worldwide rise in terrorism. {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref> It is headquartered near [[New York City]] in a bunker beneath [[Liberty Island]], placed there after a terrorist strike on the [[Statue of Liberty]].<ref name=\"unatcohandbook\">'''''UNATCO Handbook: UNATCO and the World''''' ''':'''Not only did the United States become a charter member of UNATCO, but UNATCO headquarters are now located on Liberty Island in the shadow of that shattered monument to FREEDOM.\" {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref>\n\nThe main character of ''Deus Ex'' is JC Denton ([[Jay Anthony Franke|Jay Franke]]), a UNATCO agent physically altered with advanced [[nanotechnology]] to gain superhuman abilities.<ref name=\"CastJC\"/><ref name=\"VoiceFranke\"/> His UNATCO colleagues include: the [[Human enhancement|mechanically-augmented]] and ruthlessly efficient field agents, Gunther Hermann and Anna Navarre;<ref name=\"CastGunther\"/><ref name=\"CastAnna\"/> JC's brother Paul (Jay Franke), who joined UNATCO to avenge his parents' deaths at the hands of Majestic 12;<ref name=\"CastAnna\"/><ref name=\"VoiceFranke\"/> and quartermaster General Sam Carter.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wordsworth|first1=Richard|title=How Deus Ex Predicted The Future|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/04/how-deus-ex-predicted-the-future/|website=Kotaku|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=April 17, 2017}}</ref> Alex Jacobson's character model and name are based on [[Warren Spector]]'s own nephew, Alec Jacobson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=1115#more-1115 |title=RPS Exclusive: Warren Spector Interview |author=Kieron Gillen |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=February 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Plot ===\nAfter completing his training, UNATCO agent JC Denton takes several missions given by Director Joseph Manderley to track down members of the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) and their stolen shipments of the \"Ambrosia\" vaccine, the treatment for the \"Gray Death\" virus. Through these missions, JC is reunited with his brother, Paul, who is also nano-augmented. JC tracks the Ambrosia shipment to a private terminal at [[LaGuardia Airport]]. Paul meets JC outside the plane and explains that he has defected from UNATCO and is now working with the NSF after learning that the Gray Death is a man-made virus, with UNATCO using its power to make sure only the elite receive the vaccine.<ref name=\"pauldefection\">'''Paul:''' The Gray Death is a man-made virus. Everyone up to the President is at UNATCO's mercy as long as UNATCO controls the supply of Ambrosia. / '''JC:''' You believe that? / '''Paul:''' We have proof. We need to get the Ambrosia to Hong Kong. Heard of Tracer Tong? He can help us synthesize it ourselves. {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref>\n\nJC returns to UNATCO headquarters and is told by Manderley that both he and Paul have been outfitted with a 24-hour [[kill switch]] and that Paul's has been activated due to his betrayal. Manderley orders JC to fly to [[Hong Kong]] to eliminate Tracer Tong, a hacker whom Paul has contact with, and who can disable the kill switches. Instead, JC returns to Paul's apartment to find Paul hiding inside. Paul further explains his defection and encourages JC to also defect by sending out a distress call to alert the NSF's allies. Upon doing so, JC becomes a wanted man by UNATCO, and his own kill switch is activated by [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Director Walton Simons. JC is unable to escape UNATCO forces, and both he and Paul (provided he survived the raid on the apartment) are taken to a secret prison below UNATCO headquarters. An entity named \"Daedalus\" contacts JC and informs him that the prison is part of [[Majestic 12]], and arranges for him and Paul to escape. The two flee to Hong Kong to meet with Tong, who deactivates their kill switches. Tong requests JC infiltrate the VersaLife building. Doing so, JC discovers that the corporation is the source for the Gray Death, and he is able to steal the plans for the virus and destroy the \"universal constructor\" (UC) that produces it.<ref name=\"daedalusplague\">'''Daedalus:''' Majestic 12 seeks to use force and intimidation to seize absolute control. Of everything. They will not hesitate to use all means necessary to achieve this goal, and have engineered the disease you refer to as the \"Gray Death\" in an effort to accomplish this. The Gray Death is a nanotechnologically engineered virus. You must locate the Universal Constructor used to create the Gray Death and destroy it. My information indicates that it is in Hong Kong, housed in a Majestic 12 facility beneath the corporation known as VersaLife. {{cite video game |title=Deus Ex |developer=Ion Storm |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=2002-03-25 |platform=PlayStation 2 }}</ref>\n\nAnalysis of the virus shows it was manufactured by the [[Illuminati]], prompting Tong to send JC to [[Paris]] to try to make contact with the organization and obtain their help fighting Majestic 12. JC eventually meets with Illuminati leader Morgan Everett and learns that the Gray Death virus was intended to be used for [[Human enhancement|augmentation]] technology, but Majestic 12, led by trillionaire businessman and former Illuminatus Bob Page, was able to steal and repurpose<!--?--> it into its current viral form. Everett recognizes that without VersaLife's universal constructor, Majestic 12 can no longer create the virus, and will likely target [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], where X-51, a group of former [[Area 51]] scientists, have built another one. After aiding the base personnel in repelling a Majestic 12 attack, JC meets X-51 leader Gary Savage, who reveals that Daedalus is an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) borne out of the [[ECHELON]] program. Everett attempts to gain control over Majestic 12's communications network by releasing Daedalus onto the U.S. military networks, but Page counters by releasing his own AI, Icarus, which merges with Daedalus to form a new AI, Helios, with the ability to control all global communications. After this, Savage enlists JC's help in procuring schematics for reconstructing components for the UC that were damaged during Majestic 12's raid of Vandenberg. JC finds the schematics and electronically transmits them to Savage. Page intercepts the transmission and launches a [[nuclear missile]] at Vandenberg to ensure that Area 51 (now Majestic 12's headquarters), will be the only location in the world with an operational UC. However, JC is able to reprogram the missile to strike Area 51. JC then travels there himself to confront Page.\n\nWhen JC locates him, Page reveals that he seeks to merge with Helios and gain full control over all nanotechnology, essentially becoming a god. JC is contacted by Tong, Everett, and the Helios AI simultaneously. All three factions ask for his help in defeating Page while furthering their own objectives, and JC is forced to choose between them. Tong seeks to plunge the world into a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] by destroying the global communications hub and preventing anyone from taking control of the world.<ref name=\"tongending\">'''JC Denton:''' If we destroy the Aquinas Hub, we'll take down the global network. / '''Tracer Tong:''' Exactly.

According to the document, the game would engage with \"the millennial madness that's gripping the world ... and a general fascination with conspiracy theories and the desire to play with high-tech espionage toys\".<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\"/> The team designed a [[Statistic (role-playing games)|skill system]] that featured \"special powers\" derived from nanotechnological augmentation and avoided the inclusion of [[Dice#Application in role-playing games|die rolling]] and skills that required micromanagement.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=52\u20133}} Augmentations were unique to the player character.

Two writers and four testers were hired as contractors.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} Chris Norden was the lead programmer and assistant director, [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] the lead designer, Jay Lee the lead artist, and Sheldon Pacotti the lead writer.<ref name=\"PC Zone: best ever\"/> However, Spector's initial management structure, which involved two competing design teams and the [[matrix management]] of the Dallas art team, was a failure.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=56}} According to Spector, the team was interested in multiple video game genres, and it contained both design maximalists who wanted to \"do everything\" and design minimalists who wanted to do a few things well.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Close friends of the team who understood the intentions behind the game were invited to [[playtest]] and give feedback. The wide range of input led to debates in the office and changes to the game.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Spector later concluded that the team was \"blinded by promises of complete creative freedom\", and by their belief that the game would have no budget, marketing or time restraints.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} By mid-1998, the game's title had become ''Deus Ex'', derived from the [[Latin]] [[literary device]] ''[[deus ex machina]]'' (\"god from the machine\") in which a plot is resolved by an unpredictable intervention.<ref name=\"RPGFan: machina\"/> Spector acknowledged its grammatical faults as a title, but he liked it because of its relevance to the in-game struggle for power, to the medium's storytelling difficulties, to the game being played on a computer, and to the \"self-referential\" acceptance of trying one's best to resolve affairs.<ref name=\"RPGFan: machina\"/>\n\nSpector felt that the best aspects of ''Deus Ex''{{'}}s development were the \"high-level vision\" and length of preproduction, flexibility within the project, testable \"proto-missions\", and [[Unreal Engine]] license.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=52\u201355}} The team's pitfalls included the management structure, unrealistic goals, underestimating risks with [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]], their handling of proto-missions, and weakened morale from bad press.{{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=56\u201358}} He referred to that period of Ion Storm as \"Sturm und Drang\", because of the degree of hype and the vitriol following ''[[Daikatana]]''{{'s}} [[trash talk]] marketing, alongside negative press in 1998 and 1999.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}} He said that his Austin team had \"frequent\" slumps in morale from taking the company's coverage personally and seeing their private emails posted online.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}} Eventually, the ''Deus Ex'' Austin team developed a {{\" '}}we'll show them' mentality\" to distinguish their work and reputation from those of the Dallas branch.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=58}} ''Deus Ex'' was released on June 23, 2000 and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. The team planned third-party [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ports]] for [[Mac OS 9]] and [[Linux]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}}\n\n=== Design ===\n\nThe original 1997 design document for ''Deus Ex'' privileges character development over all other features, including experimental sequences and technology demos.<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/>{{clarify|date=July 2014}} The game was designed to be \"genre-busting\": in parts [[simulation game|simulation]], [[role-playing game]], [[first-person shooter]], and [[adventure game|adventure]].{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The team wanted players to consider \"who they wanted to be\" in the game, and for that to alter how they behaved in the game.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\"/> In this way, the game world was \"deeply simulated\", or realistic and believable enough that the player would solve problems in creative, [[Emergent gameplay|emergent]] ways without noticing distinct puzzles.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\"/> The developers also wanted to include \"choice\" and \"consequence\", which Spector called the team's \"two most frequently uttered words\".<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\"/> However, the team's simulation ultimately failed to maintain the desired level of openness, and they had to [[:wikt:brute force|brute force]] \"skill\", \"action\", and \"character interaction\" paths through each level.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> Playtesting also revealed that their idea of a role-playing game based in the real world was more interesting in theory than in reality.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} The team chose two real-world bases for levels: \"highly interconnected, multi-level\" spaces, and places that most cannot visit (e.g., the [[White House]]).<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p2\"/> In practice, the team found that certain aspects of the real world, such as hotels and office buildings, were not compelling in a game.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} Ion Storm saw ''Deus Ex'' as being about \"player expression\" rather than making the developers appear \"clever\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} They treated the player as a \"collaborator\", who they sought to empower to \"make choices and ... deal with the consequences\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} Spector credited the 1995 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Suikoden (video game)|Suikoden]]'' as an inspiration, stating that the limited [[Dialog tree|choices]] in ''Suikoden'' inspired him to expand on the idea with more meaningful choices in ''Deux Ex''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/11/10/how-suikoden-influenced-deus-ex-and-epic-mickey/|website=Siliconera|title=How Suikoden Influenced Deus Ex And Epic Mickey|date=November 10, 2012|author=Ishaan|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:JFK limousine.png|thumb|The premise of ''Deus Ex'' was inspired by conspiracy theories such as those behind the JFK assassination]] The game's story changed greatly during production, but the idea of an augmented counterterrorist protagonist named JC Denton remained throughout.<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/> Though Spector originally pictured ''Deus Ex'' as akin to ''The X-Files'', lead writer Sheldon Pacotti felt that it ended up more like [[James Bond]].<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/> Spector wrote that the team overextended itself by planning highly elaborate scenes, including a replica of downtown Austin,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} a reconstruction of Area 51 from satellite data,<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> a sunken post-earthquake [[Los Angeles]], a raid to free thousands of [[prisoners of war]] from a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]-controlled [[United Nations]] [[concentration camp]], and over 25 missions throughout Siberia, western Europe, and the United States.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> Designer Harvey Smith pushed for the removal of a subplot in which Mexico invaded Texas, in order to make development easier and the narrative more personal. He also removed a largely complete White House level due to its complexity and production needs.{{efn|Spector referred to the White House as his \"dream\" level,<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> and their \"toughest map challenge\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} }} Finished [[digital asset]]s were repurposed or, in the cases of Texas and the Denver airport, abandoned by the team. Pete Davison of USgamer referred to the White House and presidential bunker as \"the truly deleted scenes of ''Deus Ex''{{'s}} lost levels\".<ref name=\"USgamer: deleted scenes\"/>\n\nOne of the things that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, in order to create a better immersion and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor [[Jay Anthony Franke]] to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=GameInformer|title=Replay - Deus Ex|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOPHmbulMp4|website=YouTube|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Deus Ex|title=Let's Play Deus Ex with Warren Spector, Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Norden|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTVBSxnwiCo|website=YouTube|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nOnce coded, the team's game systems did not work as intended. Prototypes of the systems and of certain missions were built near the beginning of development, which revealed some of the team's planning mistakes.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} For example, the early tests of the conversation system and user interface were flawed, but the team had time to revise them before the game's release.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} The team also found augmentations and skills to be less interesting than they had seemed in the design document.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Colleagues from other companies\u2014such as [[Doug Church]], [[Rob Fermier]], [[Marc LeBlanc]], and [[Gabe Newell]]\u2014noticed and pointed out these deficiencies in game \"tension\" when they played the prototype.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} In response, Harvey Smith substantially revised the augmentations and skills.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: postmortem p3\"/> [[Milestone (project management)|Production milestones]] served as wake-up calls for the game's direction. A May 1998 milestone that called for a functional demo revealed that the size of the game's maps caused [[Frame rate#Video games|frame rate]] issues, which was one of the first signs that maps needed to be cut.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} A year later, the team reached a milestone for finished game systems that Spector nicknamed the \"Wow, these missions suck\" milestone, which led to better estimates for their future mission work and to the reduction of the 500-page design document to 270 pages.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=54}} Spector recalled Smith's mantra on this point: \"less is more\". {{sfn|Spector|2000|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nOne of the team's biggest blind spots was the AI programming for NPCs. Spector wrote that they considered it in preproduction, but that they did not figure out how to handle it until \"relatively late in development\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} This led to wasted time when the team had to discard their early AI code. The team built atop their [[game engine]]'s shooter-based AI instead of writing new code that would allow characters to exhibit convincing emotions. As a result, NPC behavior was variable until the very end of development. Spector felt that the team's \"sin\" was their inconsistent display of a trustable \"human AI\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}\n\n=== Technology ===\n\n[[File:UE Logo Black Centered.svg|thumb|100px|left|''Deus Ex'' used the [[Unreal Engine|Unreal game engine]], which was designed for first-person shooters]] The game was developed on systems including dual-processor [[Pentium Pro]] 200s and [[Athlon]] 800s with eight and nine gigabyte hard drives, some using [[SCSI]]. The team used \"more than 100 video cards\" throughout development.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} ''Deus Ex'' was built using [[Visual Studio]], [[Lightwave]], and [[Lotus Notes]]. They also built a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=50}} The team used [[UnrealEd]] atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was \"superior to anything else available\".{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} Their trust in [[UnrealScript]] led them to code \"special-cases\" for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}} Even as concerned team members expressed misgivings, the team only addressed this later in the project. To Spector, this was a lesson to always prefer \"general solutions\" over \"special casing\", such that the tool set works predictably.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}\n\nThey waited to license a game engine until after preproduction,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=52}} expecting the benefits of licensing to be more time for the content and gameplay, which Spector reported to be the case. They chose the Unreal engine as it did 80% of what they needed from an engine and was more economical than building from scratch. Their small programming team allowed for a larger design group. The programmers also found the engine accommodating,{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} though it took about nine months to acclimate to the software.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=53}} Spector felt that they would have understood the code better had they built it themselves, instead of \"treating the engine as a [[black box]]\" and coding conservatively.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} He acknowledged that this precipitated into the [[Direct3D]] issues in their final release, which slipped through their quality assurance testing.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=55}} Spector also noted that the artificial intelligence, pathfinding, and sound propagation were designed for shooters and should have been rewritten from scratch instead of relying on the engine. He thought the licensed engine worked well enough that he expected to use the same for [[Deus Ex: Invisible War|the game's sequel]] and ''[[Thief 3]]''.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=56}} He added that developers should not attempt to force their technology to perform in ways it was not intended, and should find a balance between perfection and pragmatism.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p=57}}\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Deus_Ex_-_Title_Song.ogg |title=Alexander Brandon \"''Deus Ex'' Main Title\"\n|description=30-second sample from the theme song of ''Deus Ex''.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nThe soundtrack of ''Deus Ex'', composed by [[Alexander Brandon]] (primary contributor, including main theme), [[Dan Gardop\u00e9e]] (\"Naval Base\" and \"Vandenberg\"), [[Michiel van den Bos]] (\"UNATCO\", \"Lebedev's Airfield\", \"Airfield Action\", \"DuClare Chateau\" plus minor contribution to some of Brandon's tracks), and [[Reeves Gabrels]] (\"NYC Bar\"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deusex-machina.com/information/faq-goty.asp |title=Deus Ex Game of the Year Edition FAQ. |work=Deus Ex Machina |accessdate=March 20, 2007}}</ref> was praised by critics for complementing the gritty atmosphere predominant throughout the game with melodious and [[ambient music]] incorporated from a number of genres, including [[techno]], [[jazz]], and [[classical music|classical]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/deusex/Deus_Ex-2.html |title=Deus Ex review |work=RPGFan |author=Bahamut |accessdate=March 20, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=33407 |title=Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition review |work=Allgame |last=Allen |first=Christopher |accessdate=March 20, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womengamers.com/revprev/act/act-deusex.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315043118/http://www.womengamers.com/revprev/act/act-deusex.php |archivedate=2010-03-15 |title=Deus Ex review |work=WomenGamers |author=iceVic |accessdate=March 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The music sports a basic dynamic element, similar to the [[iMUSE]] system used in early 1990s [[LucasArts]] games; during play, the music will change to a different iteration of the currently playing song based on the player's actions, such as when the player starts a conversation, engages in combat, or transitions to the next level.

Brewster also edited the 18-volume ''[[Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Brewster was born at the Canongate in [[Jedburgh]], [[Roxburghshire]], to Margaret Key (1753\u20131790) and James Brewster (c. 1735\u20131815), the [[Rector (education)|rector]] of [[Jedburgh Grammar School]] and a teacher of high reputation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Margaret Maria |title=The home life of Sir David Brewster |date=1881 |publisher=D.

He was licensed a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], and preached around Edinburgh on several occasions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wylie |first1=James Aitken |title=Disruption worthies : a memorial of 1843, with an historical sketch of the free church of Scotland from 1843 down to the present time |date=1881 |publisher=T.

In 1799 fellow-student [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] persuaded him to study the [[diffraction]] of light. The results of his investigations were communicated from time to time in papers to the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' of London and other scientific journals. The fact that other scientists \u2013 notably [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] and [[Augustin Fresnel]] \u2013 were pursuing the same investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate Brewster's claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the priority must be assigned to others.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} A lesser-known classmate of his, [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]], also went on to become a popular astronomical writer.\n\nThe most important subjects of his inquiries can be enumerated under the following five headings:\n#The laws of [[light polarization]] by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]], and other quantitative laws of phenomena;\n#The discovery of the polarising structure induced by heat and [[pressure]];\n#The discovery of crystals with two axes of double refraction, and many of the laws of their phenomena, including the connection between optical structure and crystalline forms;\n#The laws of metallic reflection;\n#Experiments on the absorption of light.\n\nIn this line of investigation, the prime importance belongs to the discovery of\n#the connection between the refractive index and the polarizing angle;\n#biaxial crystals, and\n#the production of double refraction by irregular heating.\n\nThese discoveries were promptly recognised. As early as 1807 the degree of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] was conferred upon Brewster by [[Marischal College]], [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]]; in 1815 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]], and received the [[Copley Medal]]; in 1818 he received the [[Rumford Medal]] of the society; and in 1816 the [[French Institute]] awarded him one-half of the prize of three thousand francs for the two most important discoveries in physical science made in Europe during the two preceding years.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brewster cigar box.jpg|thumb|Inner picture of a cigar box from the early 1900s with a portrait of Brewster.]]\nAmong the non-scientific public, his fame spread more effectually by his invention in about 1815 of the [[kaleidoscope]], for which there was a great demand in both the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} As a reflection of this fame, Brewster portrait was later printed in some cigar boxes. Brewster chose renowned [[achromatic lens]] developer [[Carpenter and Westley|Philip Carpenter]] as the sole manufacturer of the kaleidoscope in 1817.

Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] discovered its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of a cumbersome but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were made to combine by means of [[mirror]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} A dogged rival of Wheatstone's, Brewster was unwilling to credit him with the invention, however, and proposed that the true author of the stereoscope was a Mr. Elliot, a \"Teacher of Mathematics\" from Edinburgh, who, according to Brewster, had conceived of the principles as early as 1823 and had constructed a lensless and mirrorless prototype in 1839, through which one could view drawn landscape transparencies, since photography had yet to be invented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zone|first=Ray|title=Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838\u20131952|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=978-0813124612|pages=9\u201310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1dgJ3-y1ZsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=mr.+elliot+stereoscope+brewster&source=bl&ots=iUW2QPC31i&sig=HQ_GHth1MtwC6vnS2oCc2PVA0Fs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zYs3Upi2Kqnh2AXrzoCwCw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=mr.%20elliot%20stereoscope%20brewster&f=false}}</ref> Brewster's personal contribution was the suggestion to use [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] for uniting the dissimilar pictures; and accordingly the lenticular stereoscope may fairly be said to be his invention.\n\nA much more valuable and practical result of Brewster's optical researches was the improvement of the British [[lighthouse]] system. Although Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation, perfected the dioptric apparatus independently, Brewster was active earlier in the field than Fresnel, describing the dioptric apparatus in 1812. Brewster pressed its adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two years before Fresnel suggested it, and it was finally introduced into lighthouses mainly through Brewster's persistent efforts.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Other work===\nAlthough Brewster's own discoveries were important, they were not his only service to science. He began writing in 1799 as a regular contributor to the ''[[Ruddiman's Edinburgh Magazine|Edinburgh Magazine]]'', of which he acted as editor at the age of twenty. In 1807, he undertook the editorship of the newly projected ''[[Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia]]'', of which the first part appeared in 1808, and the last not until 1830. The work was strongest in the scientific department, and many of its most valuable articles were from the pen of the editor. At a later period he was one of the leading contributors to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (seventh and eighth editions) writing, among others, the articles on electricity, [[hydrodynamics]], [[magnetism]], [[microscope]], [[optics]], [[stereoscope]], and [[voltaic electricity]].  He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1816.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>\n\nIn 1819 Brewster undertook further editorial work by establishing, in conjunction with [[Robert Jameson]] (1774\u20131854), the ''[[Edinburgh Philosophical Journal]]'', which took the place of the ''Edinburgh Magazine''. The first ten volumes (1819\u20131824) were published under the joint editorship of Brewster and Jameson, the remaining four volumes (1825\u20131826) being edited by Jameson alone. After parting company with Jameson, Brewster started the ''[[Edinburgh Journal of Science]]'' in 1824, 16 volumes of which appeared under his editorship during the years 1824\u20131832, with very many articles from his own pen.\n\nHe contributed around three hundred papers<ref name=odnb/> to the transactions of various learned societies, and few of his contemporaries wrote as much for the various reviews. In the ''[[North British Review]]'' alone, seventy-five articles of his appeared. A list of his larger separate works will be found below. Special mention, however, must be made of the most important of them all: his biography of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. In 1831 he published the ''Life of Sir Isaac Newton'',<ref>Sir David Brewster, ''Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5IfAQAAMAAJ Vol. 1], Preface</ref> a short popular account of the philosopher's life, in ''[[Murray's Family Library]]'', followed by an 1832 American edition in Harper's Family Library;<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gLcVAAAAYAAJ The Life of Sir Isaac Newton]'' (1832) Harper's Family Library, New York, No. 26.</ref> but it was not until 1855 that he was able to issue the much fuller ''Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton'', a work which embodied the results of more than 20 years' investigation of original manuscripts and other available sources.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Brewster, Sir David|volume=4 |pages=513-514}}</ref><ref>\"Discovery of gravitation, A.D. 1666\" by Sir David Brewster, in ''The Great Events by Famous Historians'', Rossiter Johnson, LL.D. Editor-in-Chief, Volume XII, pp. 51\u201365, ''The National Alumni'', 1905.</ref>\n\nBrewster's position as editor brought him into frequent contact with the most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the first to recognise the benefit that would accrue from regular communication among those in the field of science. In a review of [[Charles Babbage]]'s book ''Decline of Science in England'' in ''[[Quarterly Review|John Murray's Quarterly Review]]'', he suggested the creation of \"an association of our nobility, clergy, gentry and philosophers\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nlUAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA341 Reflexions on the Decline of Science in England, and on some of its Causes], ''Quarterly Review'', Vol. 43, Nr. 86 (October 1830)</ref> This was taken up by various ''Declinarians'' and found speedy realisation in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Its first meeting was held at [[York]] in 1831; and Brewster, along with Babbage and Sir [[John Herschel]], had the chief part in shaping its constitution.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn the same year in which the British Association held its first meeting, Brewster received the honour of knighthood and the decoration of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]]. In 1838, he was appointed principal of the united colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard, [[University of St Andrews]]. In 1849, he acted as president of the British Association and was elected one of the eight foreign associates of the [[Institute of France]] in succession to [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius|J. J. Berzelius]]; and ten years later, he accepted the office of principal of the University of Edinburgh, the duties of which he discharged until within a few months of his death.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In 1855, the government of France made him an [[Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].\n\nHe was a close friend of [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], inventor of the [[calotype]] process, who sent Brewster early examples of his work. It was Brewster who suggested Talbot only patent his process in England, initiating the development of early photography in Scotland and eventually allowing for the formation of the first photographic society in the world, the [[Edinburgh Calotype Club]], in 1843.<ref name=odnb /> Brewster was a prominent member of the club until its dissolution sometime in the mid-1850s; however, his interest in photography continued, and he was elected the first President of the [[Photographic Society of Scotland]] when it was founded in 1856.<ref>{{cite book|title=The British Journal of Photography|volume=XXI|publisher=Henry Greenwood|location=London|page=385|url=https://archive.org/stream/britishjournalp01socigoog#page/n395/mode/2up|editor=J.

He was a man of highly honourable and fervently religious character. In estimating his place among scientific discoverers, the chief thing to be borne in mind is that his genius was not characteristically mathematical. His method was empirical, and the laws that he established were generally the result of repeated experiment. To the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he dealt he contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy although he did not maintain to the end of his life the corpuscular theory he never explicitly adopted the wave theory of light. Few would dispute the verdict of [[James David Forbes]], an editor of the eighth edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'': \"His scientific glory is different in kind from that of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and Fresnel; but the discoverer of the law of polarization of biaxial crystals, of optical mineralogy, and of double refraction by compression, will always occupy a foremost rank in the intellectual history of the age.\" In addition to the various works of Brewster already mentioned, the following may be added: ''Notes and Introduction to Carlyle's translation of Legendre's Elements of Geometry'' (1824); ''Treatise on Optics'' (1831); [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/general.29167.1 '' Letters on Natural Magic'', addressed to Sir Walter Scott (1832)] ''The Martyrs of Science, or the Lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler'' (1841); ''More Worlds than One'' (1854).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn his ''Treatise'' he demonstrated that vegetal colors were related with the [[absorption spectra]]<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Robert Cross (1848\u20131921, ed)|author2=William Ripley Nichols|author3=John Trowbridge (1843\u20131923, ed) |author4=Samuel Kneeland |author5=George Bliss |author6=David Ames Wells|title=Year-book of Facts in Science and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07cWAQAAIAAJ|year=1854|quote=Sir David Brewster had several years before discovered a remarkable phenomenon in an alcoholic solution of the green coloring matter of leaves, or, as it is called by chemists, chlorophyll}}</ref> and he described for the first time the red fluorescence of [[chlorophyll]].\n\n===History of Scottish Freemasonry===\nAs well as his many scientific works and biographies of notable scientists, Brewster also wrote 'The History of Free Masonry, Drawn from Authentic Sources of Information; with an Account of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, from Its Institution in 1736, to the Present Time'<ref>https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009710912?type%5B%5D=author&lookfor%5B%5D=%22Brewster%2C%20David%2C%20Sir%2C%201781-1868.%22&ft=</ref>, published in 1804, when he was only 23.

DTMF was first developed in the [[Bell System]] in the United States, and became known under the trademark '''Touch-Tone''' for use in [[push-button telephone]]s supplied to telephone customers, starting in 1963.  DTMF is standardized as [[ITU-T]] Recommendation Q.23.<ref>{{cite report |series=Recommendation |id=Q.23 |title=Technical features of push-button telephone sets |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.23/en |publisher=ITU}}</ref> It is also known in the UK as ''MF4''.\n\nThe Touch-Tone system using a [[telephone keypad]] gradually replaced the use of [[rotary dial]] and has become the industry standard for  [[landline]] and mobile service. Other [[multi-frequency]] systems are used for internal signaling within the telephone network.\n\n==Multifrequency signaling==\nPrior to the development of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as [[pulse dialing]] (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the [[local loop]] between the telephone exchange and the [[calling party]]'s telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the [[rotary dial]] as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special [[subscriber trunk dialing]] equipment. Operators used an earlier type of [[multi-frequency]] signaling.\n\n'''Multi-frequency signaling''' (MF) is a group of signaling methods that use a mixture of two [[pure tone]] (pure [[sine wave]]) sounds. Various MF signaling [[Communications protocol|protocols]] were devised by the [[Bell System]] and [[CCITT]]. The earliest of these were for [[in-band]] signaling between switching centers, where [[Long distance calling|long-distance]] [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]] used a 16-[[Numerical digit|digit]] [[keypad]] to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance [[telephone call]]s, dual-tone multi-frequency signaling was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.\n\nThe DTMF system uses a set of eight audio frequencies transmitted in pairs to represent 16 signals, represented by the ten digits, the letters A to D, and the symbols ''#'' and ''*''. As the signals are audible tones in the voice frequency range, they can be transmitted through electrical repeaters and amplifiers, and over radio and microwave links, thus eliminating the need for intermediate operators on long-distance circuits.\n\nAT&T described the product as \"a method for pushbutton signaling from customer stations using the voice transmission path.\"<ref>AT&T, ''Compatibility Bulletin No. 105''</ref> In order to prevent consumer telephones from interfering with the MF-based routing and switching between telephone switching centers, DTMF frequencies differ from all of the pre-existing MF signaling protocols between switching centers: MF/R1, [[R2 signalling|R2]], CCS4, CCS5, and others that were later replaced by [[Signalling System No 7|SS7]] digital signaling. DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark ''Touch-Tone''. The term was first used by AT&T in commerce on July 5, 1960 and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first [[push-button telephone]] was made available to the public. It was a registered trademark by AT&T from September 4, 1962 to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[Q.23]]. In the UK, it is also known as MF4.\n\nOther vendors of compatible telephone equipment called the Touch-Tone feature ''tone dialing'' or ''DTMF'', or used their other trade names such as ''Digitone'' by [[Northern Electric Company]] in Canada.\n\nAs a method of [[in-band signaling]], DTMF signals were also used by [[cable television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] to indicate the start and stop times of local commercial insertion points during station breaks for the benefit of cable companies. Until [[out-of-band signaling]] equipment was developed in the 1990s, fast, unacknowledged DTMF tone sequences could be heard during the commercial breaks of cable channels in the United States and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Previously, terrestrial television stations used DTMF tones to control remote transmitters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  In [[IP telephony]], DTMF signals can also be delivered as either in-band or out-of-band tones,<ref>H.

In the end, the lettered keys were dropped from most phones, and it was many years before the two symbol keys became widely used for [[vertical service code]]s such as *67 in the United States of America and Canada to suppress [[caller ID]].\n\nPublic [[payphone]]s that accept credit cards use these additional codes to send the information from the [[magnetic strip]].\n\nThe [[Autovon|AUTOVON]] telephone system of the [[United States Armed Forces]] used these signals to assert certain privilege and priority levels when placing telephone calls.<ref>[http://www.tech-faq.com/abcd.shtml \"What are the ABCD tones?\" \u2014 Tech FAQ]</ref>  Precedence is still a feature of military telephone networks, but using number combinations. For example, entering 93 before a number is a priority call.\n\nPresent-day uses of the A, B, C and D signals on telephone networks are few, and are exclusive to network control. For example, the A key is used on some networks to cycle through different carriers at will. The A, B, C and D tones are used in radio phone patch and repeater operations to allow, among other uses, control of the repeater while connected to an active phone line.\n\nThe *, #, A, B, C and D keys are still widely used worldwide by [[amateur radio]] operators and commercial two-way radio systems for equipment control, repeater control, remote-base operations and some telephone communications systems.\n\nDTMF signaling tones can also be heard at the start or end of some [[VHS]] (Video Home System) cassette tapes. Information on the master version of the video tape is encoded in the DTMF tone. The encoded tone provides information to automatic duplication machines, such as format, duration and volume levels, in order to replicate the original video as closely as possible.\n\nDTMF tones are used in some [[caller ID]] systems to transfer the caller ID information, but in the United States only [[Bell 202 modem|Bell 202]] modulated [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signaling is used to transfer the data.\n\n==Keypad==\n[[File:MultiTone1.png|thumb|right|Combination of 1209 Hz and 697 Hz sine waves, representing DTMF \"1\"]]\nThe DTMF [[telephone keypad]] is laid out as a matrix of push buttons in which each row represents the low  frequency component and each column represents the high frequency component of the DTMF signal. The commonly used keypad has four rows and three columns, but a fourth column is present for some applications. Pressing a key sends a combination of the row and column frequencies. For example, the ''1'' key produces a superimposition of a 697 [[hertz|Hz]] low tone and a 1209 Hz high tone. Initial pushbutton designs employed levers, enabling each button to activate one row and one column contact. The tones are decoded by the switching center to determine the keys pressed by the user.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ DTMF keypad frequencies (with sound clips)\n|-\n!align=center|\n!align=center| 1209&nbsp;Hz\n!align=center| 1336&nbsp;Hz\n!align=center| 1477&nbsp;Hz\n!align=center| 1633&nbsp;Hz\n|-\n!align=center| 697&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf1.ogg|1]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf2.ogg|2]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf3.ogg|3]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:DtmfA.ogg|A]]\n|-\n!align=center| 770&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf4.ogg|4]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf5.ogg|5]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf6.ogg|6]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:DtmfB.ogg|B]]\n|-\n!align=center| 852&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf7.ogg|7]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf8.ogg|8]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf9.ogg|9]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:DtmfC.ogg|C]]\n|-\n!align=center| 941&nbsp;Hz\n|align=center| [[:Media:DtmfStar.ogg|*]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf0.ogg|0]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:Dtmf-.ogg|#]]\n|align=center| [[:Media:DtmfD.ogg|D]]\n|}\n\n==Decoding==\n[[File:1&1 NetXXL powered by FRITZ! - CMD CM8870CSI on mainboard-1833.jpg|thumb|Two CMD CM8870CSI DTMF Receivers]]\nDTMF was originally decoded by tuned filter banks. By the end of the 20th century, [[digital signal processing]] became the predominant technology for decoding. DTMF decoding algorithms typically use the [[Goertzel algorithm]]. As DTMF signaling is often transmitted in-band with voice or other audio signals present simultaneously, the DTMF signal definition includes strict limits for timing (minimum duration and interdigit spacing), frequency deviations, harmonics, and amplitude relation of the two components with respect to each other (''twist'').<ref>W. D.

They are seven books from the [[Septuagint]], the  standard translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the Hellenistic period, written during the reign of [[Ptolemy II]] (283-246 BCE) and referenced extensively in the [[New Testament]], particularly in the [[Pauline Epistles]]. With the rise of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] at the end of the [[Second Temple Period]], the Hebrew Canon was in flux, until the [[Masoretic Text]], compiled between the 7th and 10th centuries, became the authoritative text of the mainstream Rabbinic Judaism. The Masoretic Text excluded the seven deuterocanonical books and formed the basis for their exclusion in the Protestant Old Testament. The term distinguished these texts both from those that were termed [[protocanonical books]], which were the books of the Hebrew canon; and from the [[Biblical Apocrypha|apocryphal books]], which were those books of Jewish origin that were known sometimes to have been read in church as [[religious text|scripture]] but which were considered not to be canonical.\n\nThe deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament are:\n* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]\n* [[Book of Judith|Judith]]\n* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]] (also called the Wisdom of Solomon)\n* [[Sirach]] (also called Ecclesiasticus)\n* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]], including the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] ([[Book of Jeremiah#Septuagint version|Additions to Jeremiah in the Septuagint]])<ref>''An Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek'', [[Henry Barclay Swete]], Cambridge University Press, 1914, Part II, Chapter III, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/swete/greekot.iv.iii.html Section 6], \"Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah were regarded by the Church as adjuncts of Jeremiah, much in the same way as Susanna and Bel were attached to Daniel.

In this debate, which had preceded the dissemination of Jerome's Vulgate version, the books in the Hebrew bible had been termed \"canonical\"; the additional books that were recognised by the Christian churches had been termed \"ecclesiastical\", and those that were considered not to be in the Bible were termed \"apocryphal\".<ref name=\"Bogaert 69-92\">{{Cite book |publisher= Cambridge University Press |editor1= Richard Marsden |editor2=E.

For Sixtus, this term included portions of both Old and New Testaments (Sixtus considers the final chapter of the [[Gospel of Mark]] as 'deuterocanonical'); and he also applies the term to the [[Book of Esther]] from the canon of the Hebrew Bible.  The term was then taken up by other writers to apply specifically those books of the Old Testament which had been recognised as canonical by the Council of Trent, but which were not in the Hebrew canon<ref name=\"isbe\">[http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/C/CANON+OF+THE+OLD+TESTAMENT%2C+II/ Canon of the Old Testament, II, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1915]</ref><ref name=\"canonOT\" /><ref>Commonly cited include (1) [[Melito of Sardis]], who went ''east'', to Palestine, and recorded the canon he found being used in the synagogues, as recorded in Eusebius' ''Church History'' 4.26.13\u201314, (2) [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], (3) [[Council of Laodicea]], (4) [[Jerome]] residing in [[Bethlehem]]</ref>\n\nThe acceptance of some of these books among [[early Christians]] was widespread, though not universal, and surviving Bibles from the early Church always include, with varying degrees of recognition, books now called ''deuterocanonical''.<ref>J.N.

St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem|Cyril]] of that see, while vindicating for the Church the right to fix the Canon, places them among the apocrypha and forbids all books to be read privately which are not read in the churches. In Antioch and Syria the attitude was more favourable. [[St. Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]] shows hesitation about the rank of the deuteros; he esteemed them, but they had not the same place as the Hebrew books in his regard. The historian Eusebius attests the widespread doubts in his time; he classes them as antilegomena, or disputed writings, and, like Athanasius, places them in a class intermediate between the books received by all and the apocrypha.\"<ref name=\"canonOT\" />\n\n\"In the Latin Church, all through the [[Middle Ages]] we find evidence of hesitation about the character of the deuterocanonicals. There is a current friendly to them, another one distinctly unfavourable to their authority and sacredness, while wavering between the two are a number of writers whose veneration for these books is tempered by some perplexity as to their exact standing, and among those we note [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]. Few are found to unequivocally acknowledge their canonicity. The prevailing attitude of Western medieval authors is substantially that of the Greek Fathers.

Among Orthodox, the term is understood to mean that they were compiled separately from the primary canon, as explained in 2 Esdras, where Esdras is instructed to keep certain books separate and hidden.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nThe Eastern Orthodox Churches have traditionally included all the books of the Septuagint in their Old Testaments. The Greeks use the word ''Anagignoskomena'' (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 \"readable, worthy to be read\") to describe the books of the Greek [[Septuagint]] that are not present in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. When Orthodox theologians use the term \"deuterocanonical\", it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.<ref>[http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ Orthodox Answer To a Question About Apocrypha, Canon, Deuterocanonical \u2013 Answer #39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314205050/http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ |date=14 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox canon includes the deuterocanonical books listed above, plus [[3 Maccabees]] and [[1 Esdras]] (also included in the [[Clementine Vulgate]]), while Baruch is divided from the Epistle of Jeremiah, making a total of 49 Old Testament books in contrast with the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] 39-book canon.<ref name = \"Kimbrough\">{{cite book| author = S.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Deuterocanon, in addition to the standard set listed above, along with the books of Esdras and ''Prayer of Minasse'', also includes some books that are still held canonical by only the Ethiopian Church, including Enoch or ''Henok'' ([[I Enoch]]), ''Kufale'' ([[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]]) and 1, 2 and 3 [[Meqabyan]] (which are sometimes wrongly confused with the \"Books of Maccabees\").{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==In Christian Churches having their origins in the Reformation==\n{{Further|Biblical apocrypha}}\n===Anglican Communion===\nThere is a great deal of overlap between the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of the original 1611 [[King James Bible]] and the Catholic deuterocanon, but the two are distinct. The Apocrypha section of the original 1611 King James Bible includes, in addition to the deuterocanonical books, the following three books, which were not included in the list of the canonical books by the [[Council of Trent]]:{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[1 Esdras]] ([[Vulgate]] 3 Esdras)\n* [[2 Esdras]] (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\n* [[Prayer of Manasseh]]\n\nThese books make up the [[Biblical apocrypha#Clementine Vulgate|Apocrypha]] section of the [[Vulgate#Clementine Vulgate|Clementine Vulgate]]: [[3 Esdras]] ([[1 Esdras]]); [[4 Esdras]] ([[2 Esdras]]); and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], where they are specifically described as \"outside of the series of the canon\". The 1609 [[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible|Douai Bible]] includes them in an appendix, but they have not been included in English Catholic Bibles since the [[Richard Challoner|Challoner]] revision of the Douai Bible in 1750. They are found, along with the deuterocanonical books, in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of certain Protestant Bibles (some versions of the King James, for example).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nUsing the word apocrypha (Greek: hidden away) to describe texts, although not necessarily pejorative, implies to some people that the writings in question should not be included in the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of the [[Books of the Bible|Bible]]. This classification commingles them with certain non-canonical [[gospel]]s and [[New Testament apocrypha]].

Following competition at national and regional levels it was added to the Olympic program for the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]].\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Discobolus Kleomelos Louvre G111.jpg|thumb|left|Discus-thrower, tondo of a [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the Kleomelos Painter, [[Louvre Museum]]]]\n[[Image:Discus Thrower Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|left|Modern copy of [[Myron]]'s ''[[Discobolus]]'' in [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden]], [[Denmark]]]]\nThe men's discus is a heavy [[Lens (geometry)|lenticular]] [[disk (mathematics)|disc]] with a weight of {{convert|2|kg|lb}} and diameter of {{convert|22|cm|in}}, the women's discus has a weight of {{convert|1|kg|lb}} and diameter of {{convert|18|cm|in}}.\n\nUnder [[IAAF]] (international) rules, Youth boys (16\u201317 years) throw the {{convert|1.6|kg|lb}} discus, the Junior men (18\u201319 years) throw the unique {{convert|1.75|kg|lb}} discus, and the girls/women of those ages throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus.\n\nIn international competition, men throw the 2&nbsp;kg discus through to age 49. The {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}} discus is thrown by ages 50\u201359, and men age 60 and beyond throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus. Women throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus through to age 74. Starting with age 75, women throw the {{convert|0.75|kg|lb}} discus.\n\nThe typical discus has sides made of plastic, wood, fiberglass, carbon fiber or metal with a metal rim and a metal core to attain the weight. The rim must be smooth, with no roughness or finger holds. A discus with more weight in the rim produces greater angular momentum for any given spin rate, and thus more stability, although it is more difficult to throw. However, a higher rim weight, if thrown correctly, can lead to a farther throw. A solid rubber discus is sometimes used (see [[#United States|in the United States]]).\n\nTo make a throw, the competitor starts in a circle of {{T&Fcalc|2.5|m}} diameter, which is recessed in a concrete pad by {{convert|20|mm|in}}. The thrower typically takes an initial stance facing away from the direction of the throw. He then spins anticlockwise (for right-handers) around one and a half times through the circle to build momentum, then releases his throw. The discus must land within a 34.92-degree sector. The rules of competition for discus are virtually identical to those of [[shot put]], except that the circle is larger, a stop board is not used and there are no form rules concerning how the discus is to be thrown.\n\nThe basic motion is a forehanded sidearm movement. The discus is spun off the index finger or the middle finger of the throwing hand. In flight the disc spins clockwise when viewed from above for a right-handed thrower, and anticlockwise for a left-handed thrower. As well as achieving maximum momentum in the discus on throwing, the discus' distance is also determined by the trajectory the thrower imparts, as well as the aerodynamic behavior of the discus. Generally, throws into a moderate headwind achieve the maximum distance. Also, a faster-spinning discus imparts greater gyroscopic stability. The technique of discus throwing is quite difficult to master and needs lots of experience to get right, thus most top throwers are 30 years old or more.\n\n==Phases==\nThe discus technique can be broken down into phases. The purpose is to transfer from the back to the front of the throwing circle while turning through one and a half circles. The speed of delivery is high, and speed is built up during the throw (slow to fast). Correct technique involves the buildup of torque so that maximum force can be applied to the discus on delivery.\n\n[[Image:DiscusRutgerSmith6551.jpg|thumb|World and European champion [[Rutger Smith]] in phases of the discus throw]]\n\nDuring the wind-up, weight is evenly distributed between the feet, which are about shoulder distance and not overly active. The wind-up sets the tone for the entire throw; the rhythm of the throw is very important.\n\nFocusing on rhythm can bring about the consistency to get in the right positions that many throwers lack. Executing a sound discus throw with solid technique requires perfect balance. This is due to the throw being a linear movement combined with a one and a half rotation and an implement at the end of one arm. Thus, a good discus thrower needs to maintain balance within the circle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitaltrackandfield.com/shot-put-discus-technique/|title=Shot Put and Discus Technique and Training|last=Cappos|first=Scott|date=|website=Digital Track and Field|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor a right handed thrower, the next stage is to move the weight over the left foot. From this position the right foot is raised, and the athlete 'runs' across the circle. There are various techniques for this stage where the leg swings out to a small or great extent, some athletes turn on their left heel (e.g. Ilke Wylluda<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vr-6mTLm30|title=wyludda discus throw 1996 olympics|first=|last=throwhammer|date=13 September 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>) but turning on the ball of the foot is far more common.\n\nThe aim is to land in the 'power position', the right foot should be in the center and the heel should not touch the ground at any point. The left foot should land very quickly after the right. Weight should be mostly over the back foot with as much torque as possible in the body\u2014so the right arm is high and far back. This is very hard to achieve.\n[http://trackandfield.about.com/od/discus/ss/discustechnique_8.htm#step-heading Power position.]\n\nThe critical stage is the delivery of the discus, from this 'power position' the hips drive through hard, and will be facing the direction of the throw on delivery. Athletes employ various techniques to control the end-point and recover from the throw, such as fixing feet (to pretty much stop dead<ref name=\"auto\"/>), or an active reverse spinning onto the left foot (e.g. Virgilijus Alekna<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhZwyyfBCBo|title=2005 World Championship Men's Discus - 1st Virgilijus Alekna|first=|last=ntujavelin|date=26 December 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>).\n\nSports scientist [[Richard Ganslen]] researched the ''Aerodynamics of the Discus'', reporting the discus will [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] at an angle of 29\u00b0.<ref>http://archive.auvac.org/research/publications/files/2003/niewiadomska.pdf</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[Image:2003 Greece 10 Euro OS Discus front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Discus commemorative coin]]]]\n\nThe discus throw has been the subject of a number of well-known ancient Greek statues and Roman copies such as the [[Discobolus]] and [[Discophoros]]. The discus throw also appears repeatedly in ancient [[Greek mythology]], featured as a means of [[manslaughter]] in the cases of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]], [[Crocus (mythology)|Crocus]], [[Phocus#Phocus.2C son of Aeacus|Phocus]], and [[Acrisius]], and as a named event in the [[funeral games]] of [[Patroclus]].\n\nDiscus throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the \u20ac10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Discus commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. On the obverse of the coin a modern athlete is seen in the foreground in a half-turned position, while in the background an ancient discus thrower has been captured in a lively bending motion, with the discus high above his head, creating a vivid representation of the sport.\n\n==United States==\nIn U.S. high school track and field, boys typically throw a discus weighing 1.6&nbsp;kg (3&nbsp;lb&nbsp;9&nbsp;oz) and the girls throw the 1&nbsp;kg (2.2&nbsp;lb) women's discus. Under USATF Youth rules, boys throw the 1&nbsp;kg discus between the ages of 11\u201314, and transition to the 1.6&nbsp;kg discus as 15- to 18-year-olds. Girls throw the 1&nbsp;kg discus as 11- to 18-year-olds.\n\nUnder [[National Federation of State High School Associations|US high school rules]], if a discus hits the surrounding safety cage and is deflected into the sector, it is ruled a foul.  In contrast, under [[IAAF]], [[World Masters Athletics|WMA]], [[NCAA]] and [[USATF]] rules, it is ruled a legal throw.  Additionally, under US high school rules, distances thrown are rounded down to the nearest whole inch, rather than the nearest centimetre.\n\nUS high school rules allow the use of a solid rubber discus; it is cheaper and easier to learn to throw (due to its more equal distribution of weight, as opposed to the heavy rim weight of the metal rim/core discus), but less durable. However, there are a vast variety of metal discuses to choose from. The weight is not always distributed into the rim of metal discuses as there are four categories that the discs are sold in; center weighted, low spin, high spin, and very high spin. Center weighted discs carry 50-60% of their weight in the rims  and are intended for beginner throwers just as rubber discs are. <ref>https://www.elitethrowscoaching.com/single-post/2018/02/27/How-To-Choose-The-Correct-Discus-Rim-Weight\n</ref>\n\n==Top 25 performers==\n{{see also|Men's discus throw world record progression|Women's discus throw world record progression}}\n\n*Correct as of July 2017.<ref name=\"Top All-time Throws\">[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/throws/discus-throw/outdoor/men/senior Discus Throw - men - senior - outdoor].

In contrast to [[real number]]s that have the property of varying \"smoothly\", the objects studied in discrete mathematics \u2013 such as [[integer]]s, [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], and [[Statement (logic)|statements]] in [[Mathematical logic|logic]]<ref>Richard Johnsonbaugh, ''Discrete Mathematics'', Prentice Hall, 2008.</ref> \u2013 do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Discrete mathematics |urlname=DiscreteMathematics}}</ref> Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in \"continuous mathematics\" such as [[calculus]] or [[Euclidean geometry]].

However, there is no exact definition of the term \"discrete mathematics.\"<ref>Brian Hopkins, ''Resources for Teaching Discrete Mathematics'', Mathematical Association of America, 2008.</ref> Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.\n\nThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term '''finite mathematics''' is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.\n\nResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of [[digital computers]] which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of [[computer science]], such as [[computer algorithm]]s, [[programming language]]s, [[cryptography]], [[automated theorem proving]], and [[software development]]. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in [[operations research]].\n\nAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.\n\nIn university curricula, \"Discrete Mathematics\" appeared in the 1980s, initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat haphazard at the time. The curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction with efforts by [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[Mathematical Association of America|MAA]] into a course that is basically intended to develop [[mathematical maturity]] in freshmen; therefore it is nowadays a prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well.<ref name=\"LevasseurDoerr\">{{cite book|author1=Ken Levasseur|author2=Al Doerr|title=Applied Discrete Structures|url=http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ads2/|page=8}}</ref><ref name=\"Howson1988\">{{cite book|editor=Albert Geoffrey Howson|title=Mathematics as a Service Subject|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35395-3|pages=77\u201378}}</ref> Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well.<ref name=\"Rosenstein\">{{cite book|author=Joseph G.

[[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]] proved this in 1976.<ref name=\"4colors\">{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = Robin| authorlink = Robin Wilson (mathematician)| title = Four Colors Suffice| year = 2002| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn = 978-0-691-11533-7| place = London }}</ref>]]\n\nThe history of discrete mathematics has involved a number of challenging problems which have focused attention within areas of the field. In graph theory, much research was motivated by attempts to prove the [[four color theorem]], first stated in 1852, but not proved until 1976 (by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, using substantial computer assistance).<ref name=\"4colors\" />\n\nIn [[Mathematical logic|logic]], the [[Hilbert's second problem|second problem]] on [[David Hilbert]]'s list of open [[Hilbert's problems|problems]] presented in 1900 was to prove that the [[axioms]] of [[arithmetic]] are [[consistent]]. [[G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]], proved in 1931, showed that this was not possible \u2013 at least not within arithmetic itself. [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] was to determine whether a given polynomial [[Diophantine equation]] with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] proved that this [[Matiyasevich's theorem|could not be done]].\n\nThe need to [[Cryptanalysis|break]] German codes in [[World War II]] led to advances in [[cryptography]] and [[theoretical computer science]], with the [[Colossus computer|first programmable digital electronic computer]] being developed at England's [[Bletchley Park]] with the guidance of [[Alan Turing]] and his seminal work, On Computable Numbers.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hodges | first=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | title=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | year=1992 }}</ref> At the same time, military requirements motivated advances in [[operations research]]. The [[Cold War]] meant that cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances such as [[public-key cryptography]] being developed in the following decades. Operations research remained important as a tool in business and project management, with the [[critical path method]] being developed in the 1950s. The [[telecommunication]] industry has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory and [[information theory]]. [[Formal verification]] of statements in logic has been necessary for [[software development]] of [[safety-critical system]]s, and advances in [[automated theorem proving]] have been driven by this need.\n\n[[Computational geometry]] has been an important part of the [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] incorporated into modern [[video game]]s and [[computer-aided design]] tools.\n\nSeveral fields of discrete mathematics, particularly theoretical computer science, graph theory, and [[combinatorics]], are important in addressing the challenging [[bioinformatics]] problems associated with understanding the [[Phylogenetic tree|tree of life]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Trevor R.

The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has offered a $1 million [[USD]] prize for the first correct proof, along with prizes for [[Millennium Prize Problems|six other mathematical problems]].<ref name=\"CMI Millennium Prize Problems\">{{cite web|title=Millennium Prize Problems|url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/|date=2000-05-24|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref>\n\n==Topics in discrete mathematics==\n\n===Theoretical computer science===\n{{Main|Theoretical computer science}}\n[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|210px|[[Computational complexity theory|Complexity]] studies the time taken by [[algorithm]]s, such as this [[Quicksort|sorting routine]].]]\nTheoretical computer science includes areas of discrete mathematics relevant to computing. It draws heavily on [[graph theory]] and [[mathematical logic]]. Included within theoretical computer science is the study of algorithms for computing mathematical results. [[Computability]] studies what can be computed in principle, and has close ties to logic, while complexity studies the time, space, and other resources taken by computations. [[Automata theory]] and [[formal language]] theory are closely related to computability. [[Petri net]]s and [[process algebra]]s are used to model computer systems, and methods from discrete mathematics are used in analyzing [[VLSI]] electronic circuits. [[Computational geometry]] applies algorithms to geometrical problems, while [[computer image analysis]] applies them to representations of images. Theoretical computer science also includes the study of various continuous computational topics.\n\n===Information theory===\n{{Main|Information theory}}\n[[File:WikipediaBinary.svg|thumb|150px|The [[ASCII]] codes for the word \"Wikipedia\", given here in [[Binary numeral system|binary]], provide a way of representing the word in [[information theory]], as well as for information-processing [[algorithm]]s.]]\nInformation theory involves the quantification of [[information]]. Closely related is [[coding theory]] which is used to design efficient and reliable data transmission and storage methods. Information theory also includes continuous topics such as: [[analog signal]]s, [[analog coding]], [[analog encryption]].\n\n===Logic===\n{{Main|Mathematical logic}}\nLogic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and [[inference]], as well as of [[consistency]], [[soundness]], and [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]]. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in [[intuitionistic logic]]) [[Peirce's law]] (((''P''\u2192''Q'')\u2192''P'')\u2192''P'') is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a [[truth table]]. The study of [[mathematical proof]] is particularly important in logic, and has applications to [[automated theorem proving]] and [[formal verification]] of software.\n\n[[Well-formed formula|Logical formulas]] are discrete structures, as are [[Proof theory|proofs]], which form finite [[tree structure|trees]]<ref>{{cite book| author = A.

The [[truth value]]s of logical formulas usually form a finite set, generally restricted to two values: ''true'' and ''false'', but logic can also be continuous-valued, e.g., [[fuzzy logic]]. Concepts such as infinite proof trees or infinite derivation trees have also been studied,<ref>{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.111.1105 | title = Cyclic proofs of program termination in separation logic | first1 = J. | last1 = Brotherston | first2 = R. | last2 = Bornat | first3 = C. | last3 = Calcagno | journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices | volume = 43 | issue = 1 |date=January 2008 | doi = 10.1145/1328897.1328453 }}</ref> e.g. [[infinitary logic]].\n\n===Set theory===\n{{Main|Set theory}}\nSet theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]], which are collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all [[prime number]]s. [[Partially ordered set]]s and sets with other [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] have applications in several areas.\n\nIn discrete mathematics, [[countable set]]s (including [[finite set]]s) are the main focus. The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is usually marked by [[Georg Cantor]]'s work distinguishing between different kinds of [[infinite set]], motivated by the study of trigonometric series, and further development of the theory of infinite sets is outside the scope of discrete mathematics. Indeed, contemporary work in [[descriptive set theory]] makes extensive use of traditional continuous mathematics.\n\n===Combinatorics===\n{{Main|Combinatorics}}\nCombinatorics studies the way in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged.\n[[Enumerative combinatorics]] concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects - e.g. the [[twelvefold way]] provides a unified framework for counting [[permutations]], [[combinations]] and [[Partition of a set|partitions]].\n[[Analytic combinatorics]] concerns the enumeration (i.e., determining the number) of combinatorial structures using tools from [[complex analysis]] and [[probability theory]]. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and [[generating functions]] to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic formulae]].\nDesign theory is a study of [[combinatorial design]]s, which are collections of subsets with certain [[Set intersection|intersection]] properties.\n[[Partition theory]] studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to [[integer partition]]s, and is closely related to [[q-series]], [[special functions]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]]. Originally a part of [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], partition theory is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.\n[[Order theory]] is the study of [[partially ordered sets]], both finite and infinite.\n\n===Graph theory===\n{{Main|Graph theory}}\n[[File:TruncatedTetrahedron.gif|thumb|right|200px|[[Graph theory]] has close links to [[group theory]]. This [[truncated tetrahedron]] graph is related to the [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>4</sub>.]]\nGraph theory, the study of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] and [[network theory|networks]], is often considered part of combinatorics, but has grown large enough and distinct enough, with its own kind of problems, to be regarded as a subject in its own right.<ref>[http://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/ecom/MasterServlet/GetItemDetailsHandler?iN=9780801866890&qty=1&viewMode=1&loggedIN=false&JavaScript=y Graphs on Surfaces], [[Bojan Mohar]] and [[Carsten Thomassen]], Johns Hopkins University press, 2001</ref> Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of [[topology]], e.g. [[knot theory]]. [[Algebraic graph theory]] has close links with group theory. There are also [[continuous graph]]s, however for the most part research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.\n\n===Probability===\n{{Main|Discrete probability theory}}\nDiscrete probability theory deals with events that occur in countable [[sample spaces]]. For example, count observations such as the numbers of birds in flocks comprise only natural number values {0, 1, 2, ...}. On the other hand, continuous observations such as the weights of birds comprise real number values and would typically be modeled by a continuous probability distribution such as the [[normal distribution|normal]]. Discrete probability distributions can be used to approximate continuous ones and vice versa. For highly constrained situations such as throwing [[dice]] or experiments with [[decks of cards]], calculating the probability of events is basically [[enumerative combinatorics]].\n\n===Number theory===\n[[File:Ulam 1.png|thumb|200px|right|The [[Ulam spiral]] of numbers, with black pixels showing [[prime number]]s. This diagram hints at patterns in the [[Prime number#Distribution|distribution]] of prime numbers.]]\n{{Main|Number theory}}\nNumber theory is concerned with the properties of numbers in general, particularly [[integer]]s. It has applications to [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]], particularly with regard to [[modular arithmetic]], [[diophantine equations]], linear and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and [[primality test]]ing. Other discrete aspects of number theory include [[geometry of numbers]]. In [[analytic number theory]], techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go beyond discrete objects include [[transcendental number]]s, [[diophantine approximation]], [[p-adic analysis]] and [[function field of an algebraic variety|function fields]].\n\n===Algebra===\n{{Main|Abstract algebra}}\n[[Algebraic structure]]s occur as both discrete examples and continuous examples. Discrete algebras include: [[boolean algebra (logic)|boolean algebra]] used in [[logic gate]]s and programming; [[relational algebra]] used in [[databases]]; discrete and finite versions of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are important in [[algebraic coding theory]]; discrete [[semigroup]]s and [[monoid]]s appear in the theory of [[formal languages]].\n\n===Calculus of finite differences, discrete calculus or discrete analysis===\n{{Main|finite difference}}\nA [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined on an interval of the [[integer]]s is usually called a [[sequence]]. A sequence could be a finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a [[discrete dynamical system]]. Such a discrete function could be defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its general term, or it could be given implicitly by a [[recurrence relation]] or [[difference equation]]. Difference equations are similar to a [[differential equation]]s, but replace [[derivative|differentiation]] by taking the difference between adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more often) studied in their own right. Many questions and methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. For instance, where there are [[integral transforms]] in [[harmonic analysis]] for studying continuous functions or analogue signals, there are [[discrete transform]]s for discrete functions or digital signals. As well as the [[discrete metric]] there are more general discrete or [[finite metric space]]s and [[finite topological space]]s.\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:SimplexRangeSearching.svg|right|thumb|150px|[[Computational geometry]] applies computer [[algorithm]]s to representations of [[geometry|geometrical]] objects.]]\n{{Main|discrete geometry|computational geometry}}\n[[Discrete geometry]] and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of ''discrete collections'' of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is [[tessellation|tiling of the plane]]. Computational geometry applies algorithms to geometrical problems.\n\n===Topology===\nAlthough [[topology]] is the field of mathematics that formalizes and generalizes the intuitive notion of \"continuous deformation\" of objects, it gives rise to many discrete topics; this can be attributed in part to the focus on [[topological invariant]]s, which themselves usually take discrete values.\nSee [[combinatorial topology]], [[topological graph theory]], [[topological combinatorics]], [[computational topology]], [[discrete topological space]], [[finite topological space]], [[topology (chemistry)]].\n\n===Operations research===\n{{Main|Operations research}}\n[[File:Pert chart colored.svg|right|thumb|150px|[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|PERT]] charts like this provide a project management technique based on [[graph theory]].]]\nOperations research provides techniques for solving practical problems in engineering, business, and other fields \u2014 problems such as allocating resources to maximize profit, or scheduling project activities to minimize risk. Operations research techniques include [[linear programming]] and other areas of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[queuing theory]], [[scheduling algorithm|scheduling theory]], [[network theory]]. Operations research also includes continuous topics such as [[continuous-time Markov process]], continuous-time [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]], [[process optimization]], and continuous and hybrid [[control theory]].\n\n===Game theory, decision theory, utility theory, social choice theory===\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Payoff matrix for the [[Prisoner's dilemma]], a common example in [[game theory]]. One player chooses a row, the other a column; the resulting pair gives their payoffs\n| 2L = Cooperate  | 2R = Defect     |\n1U = Cooperate  | UL = \u22121, \u22121       | UR = \u221210, 0       |\n1D = Defect     | DL = 0, \u221210       | DR = \u22125, \u22125      }}\n[[Decision theory]] is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision.\n\n[[Utility theory]] is about measures of the relative [[economic]] satisfaction from, or desirability of, consumption of various goods and services.\n\n[[Social choice theory]] is about [[voting]]. A more puzzle-based approach to voting is [[ballot theory]].\n\n[[Game theory]] deals with situations where success depends on the choices of others, which makes choosing the best course of action more complex. There are even continuous games, see [[differential game]]. Topics include [[auction theory]] and [[fair division]].\n\n===Discretization===\n{{Main|Discretization}}\n\nDiscretization concerns the process of transferring continuous models and equations into discrete counterparts, often for the purposes of making calculations easier by using approximations. [[Numerical analysis]] provides an important example.\n\n===Discrete analogues of continuous mathematics===\nThere are many concepts in continuous mathematics which have discrete versions, such as [[discrete calculus]], [[discrete probability distribution]]s, [[discrete Fourier transform]]s, [[discrete geometry]], [[discrete logarithm]]s, [[discrete differential geometry]], [[discrete exterior calculus]], [[discrete Morse theory]], [[difference equation]]s, [[discrete dynamical system]]s, and [[Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma#Probability and measure theory|discrete vector&nbsp;measures]].\n\nIn [[applied mathematics]], [[discrete modelling]] is the discrete analogue of [[continuous modelling]]. In discrete modelling, discrete formulae are fit to [[data]]. A common method in this form of modelling is to use [[recurrence relation]].\n\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], the concept of a curve can be extended to discrete geometries by taking the [[Spectrum of a ring|spectra]] of [[polynomial ring]]s over [[finite field]]s to be models of the [[affine space]]s over that field, and letting [[Algebraic variety|subvarieties]] or spectra of other rings provide the curves that lie in that space. Although the space in which the curves appear has a finite number of points, the curves are not so much sets of points as analogues of curves in continuous settings. For example, every point of the form <math>V(x-c) \\subset \\operatorname{Spec} K[x] = \\mathbb{A}^1</math> for <math>K</math> a field can be studied either as <math>\\operatorname{Spec} K[x]/(x-c) \\cong \\operatorname{Spec} K</math>, a point, or as the spectrum <math>\\operatorname{Spec} K[x]_{(x-c)}</math> of the [[Localization of a ring|local ring at (x-c)]], a point together with a neighborhood around it. Algebraic varieties also have a well-defined notion of [[tangent space]] called the [[Zariski tangent space]], making many features of calculus applicable even in finite settings.\n\n===Hybrid discrete and continuous mathematics===\nThe [[time scale calculus]] is a unification of the theory of [[difference equations]] with that of [[differential equations]], which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. Another way of modeling such a situation is the notion of [[hybrid system|hybrid dynamical system]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Discrete mathematics}}\n* [[Outline of discrete mathematics]]\n* [[Cyberchase]], a show that teaches Discrete Mathematics to children\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite book |author=Norman L.

It was first synthesized in 1874. DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist [[Paul Hermann M\u00fcller]] in 1939. DDT was used in the second half of [[World War II]] to control [[malaria]] and [[typhus]] among civilians and troops. M\u00fcller was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] \"for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several [[arthropods]]\" in 1948.<ref name=nobel>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/ NobelPrize.org: The Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine 1948], accessed July 26, 2007.</ref>\n\nBy October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/> Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s book ''[[Silent Spring]]''. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environmental and health effects. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States.<ref name=\"Lear\">{{cite book|first=Linda |last=Lear|title=Rachel Carson: Witness for Nature|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=36euz6DjmwUC}}|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0-547-23823-4}}</ref> A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], but its limited and still-controversial use in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] [[Vector control|control]] continues,<ref name=\"Larson\">{{cite journal |last=Larson |first=Kim | name-list-format = vanc |date=December 1, 2007 |title=Bad Blood |journal=On Earth |issue=Winter 2008 |url=http://www.onearth.org/article/bad-blood? |accessdate=June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref name=moyers>{{cite journal |last=Moyers |first=Bill | name-list-format = vanc |author-link=Bill Moyers |title=Rachel Carson and DDT |date=September 21, 2007 |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09212007/profile2.html |accessdate=March 5, 2011 }}</ref> because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.\n\nAlong with the passage of the [[Endangered Species Act]], the United States ban on DDT is a major factor in the comeback of the [[bald eagle]] (the [[Bald eagle#National bird of the United States|national bird of the United States]]) and the [[peregrine falcon]] from near-extinction in the [[contiguous United States]].<ref name=Stokstad07>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stokstad E | title = Species conservation.

The decision thus created controversy.<ref name=Dunlap/>\n\nThe EPA held seven months of hearings in 1971\u20131972, with scientists giving evidence for and against DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced the cancellation of most uses of DDT \u2013 exempting public health uses under some conditions.<ref name=EPA1975/> Immediately after the announcement, both EDF and the DDT manufacturers filed suit against EPA. Industry sought to overturn the ban, while EDF wanted a comprehensive ban. The cases were consolidated, and in 1973 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ]] ruled that the EPA had acted properly in banning DDT.<ref name=EPA1975/>\n\nSome uses of DDT continued under the public health exemption.

Most commonly a data set  corresponds to the contents of a single [[table (database)|database table]], or a single statistical [[data matrix (multivariate statistics)|data matrix]], where every [[column (database)|column]] of the table represents a particular variable, and each [[row (database)|row]] corresponds to a given member of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.  Each value is known as a datum. The data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows.\n\nThe term data set may also be used more loosely, to refer to the data in a collection of closely related tables, corresponding to a particular experiment or event. Less used names for this kind of data sets are '''data corpus''' and '''data stock'''. An example of this type is the data sets collected by space agencies performing experiments with instruments aboard [[space probe]]s. Data sets that are so large that traditional [[data processing]] applications are inadequate to deal with them are known as [[big data]].<ref name=\"Editorial\">{{cite journal | last1 = Snijders | first1 = C. | last2 = Matzat | first2 = U. | last3 = Reips | first3 = U.-D. | year = 2012 | title = 'Big Data': Big gaps of knowledge in the field of Internet | url = http://www.ijis.net/ijis7_1/ijis7_1_editorial.html | journal = International Journal of Internet Science | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1\u20135 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[open data]] discipline, data set is the unit to measure the information released in a public open data repository.

These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various [[statistical measure]]s applicable to them, such as [[standard deviation]] and [[kurtosis]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTzeRZFmaBgC&pg=PA100 |title=Principles of data mining and knowledge discovery |author=Jan M. \u017bytkow, Jan Rauch |postscript=<!--None--> |isbn=978-3-540-66490-1 |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe values may be numbers, such as [[real number]]s or [[integer]]s, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be [[nominal data]] (i.e., not consisting of [[Number|numerical]] values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a [[level of measurement]]. For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. However, there may also be ''[[missing values]]'', which must be indicated in some way.\n\nIn [[statistics]], data sets usually come from actual observations obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] a [[statistical population]], and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population. Data sets may further be generated by [[algorithms]] for the purpose of testing certain kinds of [[software]].  Some modern statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] still present their data in the classical data set fashion.  If data is missing or suspicious an [[imputation (statistics)|imputation]] method may be used to complete a data set.<ref name=\"sde\">{{cite book |title=Statistical Data Editing: Impact on Data Quality: Volume 3 of Statistical Data Editing, Conference of European Statisticians Statistical standards and studies |author=United Nations Statistical Commission |author2=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |year=2007 |publisher=United Nations Publications |isbn=9211169526 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=X0wtLo2XY9gC |accessdate=19 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Classic data sets ==\nSeveral classic data sets have been used extensively in the [[statistical]] literature:\n\n* [[Iris flower data set]] \u2013 Multivariate data set introduced by [[Ronald Fisher]] (1936).<ref name=\"fisher36\">{{cite journal|author=Fisher, R.A. |title=The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems| journal=[[Annals of Eugenics]]| volume=7 |pages=179&ndash;188| year=1936| url=http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/138.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x}}</ref>\n* [[MNIST database]] \u2013 Images of handwritten digits commonly used to test classification, clustering, and image processing algorithms\n* ''[[Categorical data analysis]]'' \u2013 Data sets used in the book, ''An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis''.\n*''[[Robust statistics]]'' \u2013 Data sets used in ''Robust Regression and Outlier Detection'' ([[Peter Rousseeuw|Rousseeuw]] and Leroy, 1986).
