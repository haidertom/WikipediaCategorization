According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', it was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\nThe language spoken in the city during the 14th century was, and still is, accepted as the [[Italian language]]. Almost all the writers and poets in Italian literature of the ''[[Golden Age|golden age]]'' are in some way connected with Florence, leading ultimately to the adoption of the Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, as a literary language of choice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://italian.about.com/library/weekly/aa060699a.htm |title=History of the Italian Language |publisher=italian.about.com |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nStarting from the late Middle Ages, Florentine money\u2014in the form of the gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]\u2014financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, to Lyon and Hungary. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the [[Hundred Years War]]. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their [[Avignon Papacy|provisional capital of Avignon]] and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.\n\nFlorence was home to the Medici, one of European history's most important noble families. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were [[pope]]s in the early 16th century: [[Leo X]] and [[Clement VII]]. [[Catherine de Medici]] married king [[Henry II of France]] and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France. [[Marie de' Medici]] married [[Henry IV of France]] and gave birth to the future king [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. The Medici reigned as [[Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], starting with [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] in 1569 and ending with the death of [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]] in 1737.\n\n===Roman origins===\n{{Quote box |width=17em |align=left   |bgcolor=#B0C4DE\n|title=Historical affiliations\n|fontsize=80% |quote=\n[[File:Consul et lictores.png|15px]] [[Roman Republic]] 59\u201327 BC <br>\n[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|15px]] [[Roman Empire]] 27 BC\u2013AD 285 <br>\n[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|15px]] [[Western Roman Empire]] 285\u2013476 <br>\n{{flagicon image|Odovacar Ravenna 477.jpg}} [[Odoacer|Kingdom of Odoacer]] 476\u2013493 <br>\n{{flagicon image|Teodorico re dei Goti (493-526).png}} [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] 493\u2013553 <br>\n[[File:Simple Labarum.svg|12px]] [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] 553-568 <br>\n[[File:Corona ferrea monza (heraldry).svg|15px]] [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] 570\u2013773 <br>\n[[File:Charlemagne autograph.svg|15px]] [[Carolingian Empire]] 774\u2013797 <br>\n[[File:Corona ferrea monza (heraldry).svg|15px]] [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Regnum Italiae]] 797\u20131001 <br>\n[[File:Shield and Coat of Arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (c.1200-c.1300).svg|15px]] [[March of Tuscany]] 1002\u20131115 <br>\n[[File:Flag of Florence.svg|15px|border]] [[Republic of Florence]] 1115\u20131532 <br>\n[[File:Coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1562-1737).svg|15px]] [[Duchy of Florence]] 1532\u20131569 <br>\n[[File:Bandiera del granducato di Toscana (1562-1737 ).png|15px|border]] [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] 1569\u20131801 <br>\n[[File:Etrurian Kingdom and War Flag with Great Royal Coat of Arms.svg|15px|border]] [[Kingdom of Etruria]] 1801\u20131807 <br>\n[[File:Flag of France.svg|15px|border]] [[First French Empire]] 1807\u20131815 <br>\n[[File:Flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1840).svg|15px|border]] [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] 1815\u20131859 <br>\n[[File:Flag of Italy.svg|15px|border]] [[United Provinces of Central Italy]] 1859\u20131860 <br>\n[[File:Flag of Italy (1861-1946).svg|15px|border]] [[Kingdom of Italy]] 1861\u20131946 <br>\n[[File:Flag of Italy.svg|15px|border]] [[Italian Republic]] 1946\u2013present\n}}\n[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julius Caesar]] established Florence in 59&nbsp;BC]]\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[Goth]] King [[Totila]] razes the walls of Florence during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] initially formed in 200&nbsp;BC the small settlement of [[Fiesole]] (Faesulae in Latin),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/florence/history|title=History of Florence \u2013 Lonely Planet Travel Information|first=Lonely|last=Planet|date=|work=lonelyplanet.com}}</ref> which was destroyed by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 80&nbsp;BC in reprisal for supporting the [[populares]] faction in Rome. The present city of Florence was established by [[Julius Caesar]] in 59&nbsp;BC as a settlement for his veteran soldiers and was named originally ''Fluentia'', owing to the fact that it was built between two rivers, which was later changed to ''Florentia'' (\"flowering\").<ref>Leonardo Bruni, ''History of the Florentine People'' I.1, 3</ref> It was built in the style of an [[Military camp|army camp]] with the main streets, the ''[[cardo]]'' and the ''[[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]'', intersecting at the present ''[[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]]''. Situated along the ''[[Via Cassia]]'', the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the [[Arno]], the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre.\n\nIn centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent periods of [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] rule, during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people. Peace returned under [[Lombards|Lombard]] rule in the 6th century. Florence was conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in 774 and became part of the [[March of Tuscany|Duchy of Tuscany]], with [[Lucca]] as capital. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and [[Fiesole]] were united in one county.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Explore the World Nelles Pocket: Florence - Fiesole, Prato, Pistoia, San Gimignano, Voltera, Siena|last=Bleek|first=Ulrike|publisher=Gunter Nelles|year=|isbn=|location=Munich|pages=13}}</ref>\n\n===Second millennium===\n[[File:Firenze-sanminiato01.jpg|thumb|right|The Basilica di [[San Miniato al Monte]]]]\n[[Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany|Margrave Hugo]] chose Florence as his residency instead of [[Lucca]] at about 1000&nbsp;AD. The [[Golden Age]] of Florentine art began around this time. In 1013, construction began on the Basilica di [[San Miniato al Monte]]. The exterior of the church was reworked in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] between 1059 and 1128. In 1100, Florence was a \"[[Commune]]\", meaning a city state. The city's primary resource was the [[Arno|Arno river]], providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade. Another great source of strength was its industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g. bill of exchange,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13484709|title=Cradle of capitalism|date=16 April 2009|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> [[double-entry bookkeeping system]]) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival [[Pisa]] (defeated by [[Genoa]] in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406), and the exercise of power by the [[mercantilism|mercantile]] elite following an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, that resulted in a set of laws called the [[Ordinances of Justice]] (1293).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\n{{Main|Republic of Florence|Italian Renaissance}}\n\n====Rise of the Medici====\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] statue outside the [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]\n\nOf a population estimated at 94,000 before the [[Black Death]] of 1348,<ref>\"[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/ Decameron Web, Boccaccio, Plague]\".

After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382\u20131434) of the [[House of Albizzi|Albizzi]] family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.\n\nIn the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe, considered rich and economically successful. Life was not idyllic for all residents though, among whom there were great disparities in wealth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pallanti, Giuseppe|title=Mona Lisa Revealed: The True Identity of Leonardo's Model|year=2006|publisher=Skira|location=Florence, Italy|pages=17, 23, 24|isbn=978-88-7624-659-3}}</ref> [[Cosimo de' Medici]] was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast [[patronage]] network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the ''gente nuova'' (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]], who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]. Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including [[Alexander Agricola]], [[Johannes Ghiselin]], and [[Heinrich Isaac]]. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).\n\nFollowing Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son [[Piero II de' Medici|Piero&nbsp;II]]. When the French king [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&nbsp;VIII]] invaded [[northern Italy]], Piero&nbsp;II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the [[French Army|French army]] at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel and they expelled Piero&nbsp;II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.\n\n====Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici Popes====\n[[File:Hanging and burning of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence.jpg|thumb|right|Girolamo Savonarola being burnt at the stake in 1498]]\nDuring this period, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Girolamo Savonarola]] had become [[prior]] of the [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He blamed the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused [[Pope Alexander VI]] of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his extreme teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic and [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] on the [[Piazza della Signoria]] on 23 May 1498.\n\nA second individual of unusually acute insight was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimisation of political expediency and even malpractice. In other words, Machiavelli was a political thinker, perhaps most renowned for his political handbook, titled [[The Prince]], which is about ruling and the exercise of power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the [[Florentine Histories]], the history of the city. Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527. Restored twice with the support of both [[Emperor Charles V]] and [[Pope Clement VII]] (Giulio de Medici), the Medici in 1532 became hereditary dukes of Florence, and in 1569 [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], ruling for two centuries. In all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a [[Duchy of Lucca|Duchy]]) and the Principality of [[Piombino]] were independent from Florence.\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n[[File:Wenceslaus Werlin-Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and his family.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his family. Leopold was, from 1765 to 1790, the [[Grand duke|Grand Duke]] of Tuscany]]\nThe extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], [[Lorraine (duchy)|duke of Lorraine]] and husband of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a [[secundogeniture]] of the [[House of Lorraine|Habsburg-Lorraine]] dynasty, who were deposed for the [[House of Bourbon-Parma]] in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the [[Napoleon]]ic client state [[Kingdom of Etruria]]. Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by [[First French Empire|France]]. Florence was the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the French d\u00e9partement of [[Arno (department)|Arno]] from 1808 to the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the [[Congress of Vienna]] but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\nFlorence replaced [[Turin]] as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele&nbsp;II]], then [[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]], the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.\n\nThe country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops made its addition to the kingdom possible.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:SanMiniatoAlMonte-Cimetiere.jpg|thumb|''Porte Sante'' cemetery, burial place of notable figures of Florentine history.]]\nAfter doubling during the 19th century, Florence's population was to triple in the 20th, resulting from growth in tourism, trade, [[financial services]] and industry.\n\nDuring [[World War II in Europe|World War II]] the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943\u20131944) and was declared an [[open city]] in late July 1944 as troops of the [[British Eighth Army|British 8th Army]] closed in. In early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the [[Arno]] linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross. However, at the last moment Charles Steinhauslin, at the time consulate of 26 countries in Florence, convinced the German general in Italy that the [[Ponte Vecchio]] was not to be destroyed due to its historical value.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Florence was liberated by [[2nd New Zealand Division|New Zealand]], [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|South African]] and British troops on 4 August 1944. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about {{convert|9|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).\n\nInstead, an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge, including part of the [[Vasari Corridor|Corridoio Vasariano]], was destroyed using mines. Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible, but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design. Shortly before leaving Florence, as they knew that they would soon have to retreat, the Germans executed many [[freedom fighter]]s and political opponents publicly, in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAt the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence, Italy.

The executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed by 7 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]], that is nominated and presieded over by a directly elected [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor]]. The current mayor of Florence is [[Dario Nardella]].\n\nThe municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (''Quartieri''). Each Borough is governed by a Council (''Consiglio'') and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities. The Boroughs are:\n* [[Historic Centre of Florence|Centro storico]] (Historic Centre); population: 67,170;\n* [[Campo di Marte]]; population: 88,588;\n* Gavinana-[[Galluzzo]]; population: 40,907;\n* Isolotto-[[Legnaia]]; population: 66,636;\n* Rifredi; population: 103,761.\n\nAll of the five boroughs are governed by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].\n\nThe former Italian Prime Minister (2014-2016), [[Matteo Renzi]], served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.\n\n==Main sights==\n{{Main|Architecture of Florence}}\n[[File:Florence Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore]]\n[[File:Palazzo Vecchio by nigth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Vecchio]]]]\n[[File:1835 S.D.U.K. City Map or Plan of Florence or Firenze, Italy - Geographicus - Florence-SDUK-1835.jpg|left|thumb|1835 City Map of Florence, still largely in the confines of its medieval city centre.]]\n[[File:Ponte Vecchio Firenze.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Vecchio]], which spans the [[Arno river]]]]\nFlorence is known as the \"cradle of the Renaissance\" (''la culla del Rinascimento'') for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, [[Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore|Santa Maria del Fiore]], known as ''The Duomo'', whose dome was built by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. The nearby [[Campanile]] (partly designed by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]) and the [[Baptistery of Florence Cathedral|Baptistery]] buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world.<ref>Ross King, ''Brunelleschi's Dome, The Story of the great Cathedral of Florence'', Penguin, 2001</ref> In 1982, the '''[[Historic Centre of Florence|historic centre of Florence]]''' (Italian: ''centro storico di Firenze'') was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Historic Centre of Florence \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/174|website = whc.unesco.org|accessdate = 8 July 2015|first = UNESCO|last = Centre}}</ref> The centre of the city is contained in [[Defensive wall|medieval walls]] that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in [[Piazza della Signoria]], is [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]]'s [[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]] (1563\u20131565), which is a masterpiece of [[marble sculpture]] at the terminus of a still functioning Roman [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]].\n\nThe layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a [[garrison]] settlement.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of [[medieval architecture|medieval]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[modern architecture]] can be found. The [[Palazzo Vecchio]] as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\nThe river Arno, which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno \u2013 which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.\n[[File:Firenze-Florenz-Florence at night from Piazzale Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|Florence at night from Piazzale Michelangelo]]\n[[File:Palazzo Pitti Florence.jpg|alt=Palazzo Pitti|left|thumb|[[Palazzo Pitti]]]]\nOne of the bridges in particular stands out \u2014 the Ponte Vecchio (''Old Bridge''), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries [[Vasari Corridor|Vasari's elevated corridor]] linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence ([[Palazzo Pitti]]). Although the original bridge was constructed by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War&nbsp;II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental [[arch]]es, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman [[Alcon\u00e9tar Bridge]]).\n\n[[File:Vechio Ponte Santa Trinita with the Oltrarno district.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Santa Trinita]] with the [[Oltrarno]] district]]\nThe church of [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] contains the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici Chapel]], the [[mausoleum]] of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]\u2014the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century. Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world \u2013 founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family.\n[[File:Florence Duomo from Michelangelo hill.jpg|thumb|left|Florence Duomo as seen from Michelangelo hill.]]\nThe Uffizi is located at the corner of [[Piazza della Signoria]], a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The [[Palazzo della Signoria]] facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the [[history of art]] and political changes were staged here, such as:\n* In 1301, [[Dante Alighieri]] was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).\n* On 26 April 1478, [[Jacopo de' Pazzi]] and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as ''La congiura dei Pazzi'' (''[[Pazzi conspiracy|The Pazzi conspiracy]]''), murdering [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453\u20131478)|Giuliano di Piero de' Medici]] and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.\n* In 1497, it was the location of the [[Bonfire of the Vanities]] instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher [[Girolamo Savonarola]]\n* On 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. (A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged)\n* In 1504, [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's David]] (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]]) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as Palazzo Vecchio).\n\nThe [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as [[Donatello]], [[Giambologna]], Ammannati and [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]], although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.\n\n===Monuments, museums and religious buildings===\n{{see also|List of churches in Florence|Theatres in Florence}}\n[[File:Galeri.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=1.15|Piazzale degli Uffizi]]\nFlorence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The Palazzo Vecchio is the [[City and town halls|town hall]] of Florence and also an art museum. This large [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Battlement|crenellated]] fortress-palace overlooks the [[Piazza della Signoria]] with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]. Originally called the ''Palazzo della Signoria'', after the [[Signoria of Florence]], the ruling body of the [[Republic of Florence]], it was also given several other names: ''Palazzo del Popolo'', ''Palazzo dei Priori'', and ''Palazzo Ducale'', in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the [[Corridoio Vasariano]].\n\n[[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], designed by [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolomeo]] for [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo il Vecchio]], of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence  and hosts museums and the [[Biblioteca Riccardiana|Riccardiana Library]]. The [[Palazzo Strozzi]], an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Palazzo Medici]], but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted [[Gabinetto Vieusseux]], with the library and reading room.<br />\nThere are several other notable places, including the [[Palazzo Rucellai]], designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by [[Bernardo Rossellino]]; the [[Palazzo Davanzati]], which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the [[Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali (Florence)|Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali]], designed in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style in 1871; the [[Palazzo Spini Feroni]], in [[Piazza Santa Trinita]], a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer [[Salvatore Ferragamo]]; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello, the [[Palazzo Antinori]], and the Royal building of Santa Maria Novella.\n[[File:Palazzo Pitti Gartenfassade Florenz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Pitti]] on [[Boboli Gardens]]' side]]\nFlorence contains numerous museums and art galleries where some of the world's most important works of art are held.

The gallery is articulated in many halls, catalogued by schools and chronological order. Engendered by the Medici family's artistic collections through the centuries, it houses works of art by various painters and artists. The [[Vasari Corridor]] is another gallery, built connecting the Palazzo Vecchio with the Pitti Palace passing by the Uffizi and over the Ponte Vecchio. The Galleria dell'Accademia houses a Michelangelo collection, including the [[David (Michelangelo)|David]]. It has a collection of Russian icons and works by various artists and painters. Other museums and galleries include the [[Bargello]], which concentrates on sculpture works by artists including Donatello, [[Giambologna]] and [[Michelangelo]]; the Palazzo Pitti, containing part of the Medici family's former private collection. In addition to the Medici collection, the palace's galleries contain many Renaissance works, including several by [[Raphael]] and [[Titian]], large collections of costumes, ceremonial carriages, silver, porcelain and a [[Palazzo Pitti#Gallery of Modern Art|gallery of modern art]] dating from the 18th century. Adjoining the palace are the [[Boboli Gardens]], elaborately landscaped and with numerous sculptures.\n\n[[File:Il Duomo di Firenze.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral]]\n[[File:Florence in the evening.jpg|thumb|Florence in the evening]]\nThere are several different churches and religious buildings in Florence.

The Odeon Cinema of the Palazzo dello Strozzino is one of the oldest cinemas in the city. Established from 1920 to 1922<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinehall.it/pagine/odeon.asp |title=Gruppo Cine Hall |publisher=Cinehall.it |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> in a wing of the Palazzo dello Strozzino, it used to be called the ''Cinema Teatro Savoia'' (Savoy Cinema-Theatre), yet was later called ''Odeon''. The [[Teatro della Pergola]], located in the centre of the city on the eponymous street, is an [[opera house]] built in the 17th century. Another theatre is the [[Teatro Comunale Florence|Teatro Comunale]] (or ''Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino''), originally built as the open-air amphitheatre, the ''Politeama Fiorentino Vittorio Emanuele'', which was inaugurated on 17 May 1862 with a production of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and which seated 6,000 people.

The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1306\u20131321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Lapo Gianni]] composed their most important works.<ref name=\"florenceholidays.com\"/> Dante's masterpiece is the ''Divine Comedy'', which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before.

All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.<ref name=\"florenceholidays\"/>\n\nIn the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in ''The Prince'', spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries.

The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private.[73] It was here that the [[Florentine Camerata]] convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result\u2014in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate \"classical\" forms such as the symphony and concerto.  After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the [[Madrigal]], born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were \"larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.<ref name=\"Hanning, Barbara Russano 2010. pg. 182\">.Hanning, Barbara Russano, J.

Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time.  At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or ''[[Stile Antico]]/Prima Prattica'' the other the ''[[Stile Moderno]]/Secondo Prattica''.  The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time.<ref>Grout, Donald Jay, Donald Jay Grout, and Claude V. Palisca.

Giulio Caccini's book ''Le Nuove Musiche'' was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time.<ref name=\"Hanning, Barbara Russano 2010. pg. 182\"/>  The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called [[monody]] which indicated the combination of voice and [[basso continuo]] and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner.  This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as [[harpsichord]], played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.<ref>Bonds, Mark E.,Etd. Kassell, Richard.

The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; [[tripe]] (''trippa'') and stomach (''[[lampredotto]]'') were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city. [[Antipasto|Antipasti]] include ''crostini toscani'', sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]], and sliced meats (mainly [[prosciutto]] and [[salame]], often served with melon when in season).

Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]], a student of Brunelleschi, that [[Christopher Columbus]] used to sell his \"enterprise\" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's \"Projection\" is a refined version of Toscanelli's \u2013 taking into account the Americas, of which the Florentine was, obviously, ignorant.\n\n[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and so on. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for our understanding of science.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|Italian fashion}}\n{{See also|Fashion designers of Florence|Polimoda}}\n[[File:Via de Tornabuoni 07.JPG|thumb|Luxury boutiques along Florence's prestigious Via de' Tornabuoni.]]\n\nBy the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe.

''Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002.</ref> Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine \"soir\u00e9es\" of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgiorgini.it/italianfashion.htm |title=The birth of italian fashion |publisher=Gbgiorgini.it |date= |accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref> Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company [[Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.|Salvatore Ferragamo]] since 1928. [[Gucci]], [[Roberto Cavalli]], and [[Emilio Pucci]] are also headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as [[Prada]] and [[Chanel]] have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is [[Via de' Tornabuoni]], where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels, such as [[Armani]] and [[Bulgari]], have their elegant boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/guides/europe/italy/florence/where-to-shop |title=Conde Nast Traveller's guide to shopping in Florence |publisher=Cntraveller.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Historical evocations===\n\n====''Scoppio del Carro''====\nThe ''[[Scoppio del carro|Scoppio del Carro]]'' (\"Explosion of the Cart\") is a celebration of the [[First Crusade]]. During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the ''Brindellone'' and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] between the Baptistery of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] (''Battistero di San Giovanni'') and the [[Florence Cathedral]] (''Santa Maria del Fiore''). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.\n\n====''Calcio Storico''====\n[[File:Calcio Storico Corteo.jpg|thumb|Calcio Storico]]\n{{See also|Calcio Fiorentino}}\n\n''Calcio Storico Fiorentino'' (\"Historic Florentine [[Association football|Football]]\"), sometimes called ''Calcio in costume'', is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the [[Middle Ages]], when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)|siege of Florence]]. That day [[Papal States|Papal troops]] besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each ''quartiere ''(quarter) of Florence during late June and early July.<ref>[http://www.calciostorico.it/ Calcio Storico Fiorentino (Official site)] {{it icon}}</ref> There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.\n\n=== Sport ===\n[[File:Soccer in Florence, Italy, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Stadio Artemio Franchi]]]]\nIn [[association football]] Florence is represented by [[ACF Fiorentina]], which plays in [[Serie A]], the top league of [[Football in Italy|Italian league system]].\n[[ACF Fiorentina|ACF Fiorentina]] has won two Italian Championships since their formation in 1926.

Individual tickets, or a pass called Carta Agile with multiple rides, should be purchased in advance and are available at local tobacconists, bars and newspaper stalls and must be validated once on board. These tickets may be used on ATAF and Li-nea buses, Tramvia and second-class local trains only within city railway stations. Train tickets must be validated before boarding.The main bus station is next to Santa Maria Novella [[railway station]]. [[Trenitalia]] runs trains between the railway stations within the city, and to other destinations around Italy and Europe. The central railway station, [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]], is about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} northwest of the Piazza del Duomo. There are two other important stations: [[Firenze Campo di Marte railway station|Campo di Marte]] and [[Firenze Rifredi railway station|Rifredi]]. Most bundled routes are Firenze\u2014Pisa, Firenze\u2014Viareggio and Firenze-Arezzo (along the main line to Rome). Other local railways connect Florence with [[Borgo San Lorenzo]] in the Mugello area (Faentina railway) and [[Siena]].\n\nLong distance {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} buses are run by the SITA, Copit, CAP companies.

The first line began operation on 14 February 2010 and connects Florence's primary intercity railway station ([[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]]) with the southwestern suburb of [[Scandicci]]. This line is {{convert|7.4|km|1|abbr=on}} long and has 14 stops. The construction of a second line began on 5 November 2011, construction was stopped due to contractors' difficulties and restarted in 2014, completion is now scheduled for 2018.

For example, the [[cyclic group]] of [[modular arithmetic|addition modulo ''n'']] can be obtained from the [[integer]]s by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of ''n'' and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a [[congruence class]]) as a single entity. It is part of the mathematical field known as [[group theory]].\n\nIn a quotient of a group, the [[equivalence class]] of the [[identity element]] is always a [[normal subgroup]] of the original group, and the other equivalence classes are precisely the [[coset]]s of that normal subgroup.  The resulting quotient is written {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}}, where ''G'' is the original group and ''N'' is the normal subgroup.  (This is pronounced \"''G'' mod ''N''\", where \"mod\" is short for [[modular arithmetic|modulo]].)\n\nMuch of the importance of quotient groups is derived from their relation to [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]].  The [[isomorphism theorem#First isomorphism theorem|first isomorphism theorem]] states that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of any group ''G'' under a homomorphism is always [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a quotient of ''G''.  Specifically, the image of ''G'' under a homomorphism {{nowrap|''\u03c6'': ''G'' \u2192 ''H''}} is isomorphic to {{nowrap|''G'' / ker(''\u03c6'')}} where ker(''\u03c6'') denotes the [[kernel (algebra)#Group homomorphisms|kernel]] of ''\u03c6''.\n\nThe [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] notion of a quotient group is a [[subgroup]], these being the two primary ways of forming a smaller group from a larger one. Any normal subgroup has a corresponding quotient group, formed from the larger group by eliminating the distinction between elements of the subgroup. In [[category theory]], quotient groups are examples of [[quotient object]]s, which are [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[subobject]]s.  For other examples of quotient objects, see [[quotient ring]], [[quotient space (linear algebra)]], [[quotient space (topology)]], and [[quotient set]].\n\n==Definition and illustration==\nGiven a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' and a subgroup ''H'', and an element ''a'' in ''G'', one can consider the corresponding left [[coset]]: ''aH'' := { ''ah'' : ''h'' in ''H'' }. Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group ''G'' of [[integer]]s, with [[Binary operation|operation]] defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup ''H'' of even integers. Then there are exactly two cosets: ''0 + H'', which are the even integers, and ''1 + H'', which are the odd integers (here we are using additive notation for the binary operation instead of multiplicative notation). \n\nFor a general subgroup ''H'', it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, { ''aH'' : ''a'' in ''G'' }. This is possible exactly when ''H'' is a [[normal subgroup]], as we will see below. A subgroup ''N'' of a group ''G'' is normal [[if and only if]] the coset equality ''aN'' = ''Na'' holds for all ''a'' in ''G''. A normal subgroup of ''G'' is denoted {{nowrap|''N'' \u25c1 ''G''}}. \n\n===Definition===\n\nLet ''N'' be a normal subgroup of a group ''G''. We define the set ''G''/''N'' to be the set of all left [[coset]]s of ''N'' in ''G'', i.e., {{nowrap|1=''G''/''N'' = { ''aN'' : ''a'' &isin; ''G'' }<nowiki/>}}. Define an operation on ''G''/''N'' as follows. For each ''aN'' and ''bN'' in ''G''/''N'', the product of ''aN'' and ''bN'' is (''aN'')(''bN''). This defines an operation on ''G''/''N'' if we impose (''aN'')(''bN'') = (''ab'')''N'', because (''ab'')''N'' does not depend on the choice of the representatives ''a'' and ''b'': if ''xN'' = ''aN'' and ''yN'' = ''bN'' for some ''x'', ''y'' in ''G'', then\n\n:''(ab)N'' = ''a(bN)'' = ''a(yN)'' = ''a(Ny)'' = ''(aN)y'' = ''(xN)y'' = ''x(Ny)'' = ''x(yN)'' = ''(xy)N''.\n\nHere we have used in an important way that ''N'' is a normal subgroup. One checks that this operation on ''G''/''N'' is associative, has identity element ''N'', and the inverse of an element ''aN'' of ''G''/''N'' is ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>''N''. Therefore, the set ''G''/''N'' together with the operation defined above forms a group; this is known as the '''quotient group''' of ''G'' by ''N''.\n\nBecause of the normality of ''N'', the left cosets and right cosets of ''N'' in ''G'' are equal, and so we could have instead defined ''G''/''N'' to be the set of right cosets of ''N'' in ''G''.\n\n===Example: Addition modulo 6===\n\nFor example, consider the group with addition modulo 6: ''G'' = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Consider the subgroup ''N'' = {0, 3}, which is normal because ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]]. Then the set of (left) cosets is of size three:\n\n: ''G''/''N'' = { ''a''+''N'' : ''a'' &isin; ''G'' } = { {0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5} } = { 0+''N'' , 1+''N'', 2+''N'' }.\n\nThe binary operation defined above makes this set into a group, known as the quotient group, which in this case is isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] of order 3.\n\n==Motivation for the name \"quotient\"==\nThe reason ''G''/''N'' is called a quotient group comes from [[division (mathematics)|division]] of [[integer]]s.  When dividing 12 by 3 one obtains the answer 4 because one can regroup 12 objects into 4 subcollections of 3 objects.  The quotient group is the same idea, although we end up with a group for a final answer instead of a number because groups have more structure than an arbitrary collection of objects.\n\nTo elaborate, when looking at ''G''/''N'' with ''N'' a normal subgroup of ''G'', the group structure is used to form a natural \"regrouping\".  These are the cosets of ''N'' in ''G''.  Because we started with a group and normal subgroup, the final quotient contains more information than just the number of cosets (which is what regular division yields), but instead has a group structure itself.\n\n==Examples==\n===Even and odd integers===\nConsider the group of [[integer]]s '''Z''' (under addition) and the subgroup 2'''Z''' consisting of all even integers. This is a normal subgroup, because '''Z''' is [[abelian group|abelian]]. There are only two cosets: the set of even integers and the set of odd integers; therefore, the quotient group '''Z'''/2'''Z''' is the cyclic group with two elements.  This quotient group is isomorphic with the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1 }<nowiki/>}} with addition modulo&nbsp;2; informally, it is sometimes said that '''Z'''/2'''Z''' ''equals'' the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1 }<nowiki/>}} with addition modulo 2.\n\n'''Example further explained...'''<br>\n\nLet <math> \\gamma(m)= </math> remainders of <math> m \\in \\Z </math> when dividing by <math> 2 </math>.<br>\nThen <math> \\gamma(m)=0 </math> when <math> m </math> is even and <math> \\gamma(m)=1 </math> when <math> m </math> is odd.<br>\nBy definition of <math> \\gamma </math>,  the kernel of <math> \\gamma </math>,<br>\nker(<math> \\gamma </math>) <math> = \\{ m \\in \\Z : \\gamma(m)=0 \\} </math>,  is the set of all even integers.<br>\nLet <math> H=</math> ker(<math>\\gamma</math>).<br>\nThen <math> H </math> is a subgroup, because the identity in <math> \\Z </math>, which is <math> 0 </math>, is in <math> H </math>,<br>\nthe sum of two even integers is even and hence if <math> m </math> and <math> n </math> are in <math> H </math>, <math> m+n </math> is in <math> H </math> (closure)<br> \nand if <math> m </math> is even, <math> -m </math> is also even and so <math> H </math> contains its inverses.<br>\nDefine <math> \\mu : </math>{{math| <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> / H}}<math>\\to \\Z_2 </math> as <math> \\mu(aH)=\\gamma(a) </math> for <math> a\\in\\Z </math><br>\nand {{math| <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> / H}} is the quotient group of left cosets;  {{math| <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> / H}}<math>=\\{H,1+H\\} </math>.<br>  \nBy the way we have defined <math> \\mu </math>,  <math> \\mu(aH) </math>  is <math> 1 </math> if <math> a </math> is odd and <math> 0 </math> if <math> a </math> is even.<br> \nThus, <math> \\mu </math> is an isomorphism from {{math| <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> / H}} to <math> \\Z_2 </math>.\n\n===Remainders of integer division===\nA slight generalization of the last example. Once again consider the group of integers '''Z''' under addition.  Let ''n'' be any positive integer. We will consider the subgroup ''n'''''Z''' of '''Z''' consisting of all multiples of ''n''. Once again ''n'''''Z''' is normal in '''Z''' because '''Z''' is abelian. The cosets are the collection {''n'''''Z''', 1+''n'''''Z''', ..., (''n''&minus;2)+''n'''''Z''', (''n''&minus;1)+''n'''''Z'''}. An integer ''k'' belongs to the coset ''r''+''n'''''Z''', where ''r'' is the remainder when dividing ''k'' by ''n''. The quotient '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' can be thought of as the group of \"remainders\" modulo ''n''. This is a [[cyclic group]] of order ''n''.\n\n===Complex integer roots of 1===\n[[File:Normal subgroup illustration.svg|right|thumb|The cosets of the fourth [[roots of unity]] ''N'' in the twelfth roots of unity ''G''.]]\nThe twelfth [[roots of unity]], which are points on the [[Complex number|complex]] [[unit circle]], form a multiplicative abelian group ''G'', shown on the picture on the right as colored balls with the number at each point giving its complex argument. Consider its subgroup ''N'' made of the fourth roots of unity, shown as red balls. This normal subgroup splits the group into three cosets, shown in red, green and blue. One can check that the cosets form a group of three elements (the product of a red element with a blue element is blue, the inverse of a blue element is green, etc.). Thus, the quotient group ''G''/''N'' is the group of three colors, which turns out to be the cyclic group with three elements.\n\n===Sums of integers and real numbers===\nConsider the group of [[real number]]s '''R''' under addition, and the subgroup '''Z''' of integers. The cosets of '''Z''' in '''R''' are all sets of the form ''a''+'''Z''', with {{nowrap|0 \u2264 ''a'' < 1}} a real number. Adding such cosets is done by adding the corresponding real numbers, and subtracting 1 if the result is greater than or equal to 1. The quotient group '''R'''/'''Z''' is isomorphic to the [[circle group]] S<sup>1</sup>, the group of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]] 1 under multiplication, or correspondingly, the group of [[rotation]]s in 2D about the origin, i.e., the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(2). An isomorphism is given by {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a''+'''Z''') = exp(2''\u03c0ia'')}} (see [[Euler's identity]]).\n\n===Matrices of real numbers===\nIf ''G'' is the group of invertible 3 \u00d7 3 real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and ''N'' is the subgroup of 3 \u00d7 3 real matrices with [[determinant]] 1, then ''N'' is normal in ''G'' (since it is the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the determinant [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]]). The cosets of ''N'' are the sets of matrices with a given determinant, and hence ''G''/''N'' is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers. The group ''N'' is known as the [[special linear group]] SL(3).\n\n===Integer modular arithmetic===\nConsider the abelian group {{nowrap|1='''Z'''<sub>4</sub> = '''Z'''/4'''Z'''}} (that is, the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1, 2, 3 }<nowiki/>}} with addition [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4), and its subgroup {{nowrap|{ 0, 2 }<nowiki/>}}. The quotient group {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>4</sub>/{ 0, 2 }<nowiki/>}} is {{nowrap|{ { 0, 2 }, { 1, 3 } }<nowiki/>}}.  This is a group with identity element {{nowrap|{ 0, 2 }<nowiki/>}}, and group operations such as {{nowrap|1={ 0, 2 } + { 1, 3 } = { 1, 3 } }}.  Both the subgroup {{nowrap|{ 0, 2 }<nowiki/>}} and the quotient group {{nowrap|{ { 0, 2 }, { 1, 3 } }<nowiki/>}} are isomorphic with '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n===Integer multiplication===\nConsider the multiplicative group <math>G=\\mathbf{Z}^*_{n^2}</math>. The set ''N'' of ''n''th residues is a multiplicative subgroup isomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{Z}^*_{n}</math>. Then ''N'' is normal in ''G'' and the factor group ''G''/''N'' has the cosets ''N'', (1+''n'')''N'', (1+''n'')<sup>2</sup>N, ..., (1+''n'')<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>N. The [[Paillier cryptosystem]] is based on the [[conjecture]] that it is difficult to determine the coset of a random element of ''G'' without knowing the factorization of ''n''.\n\n==Properties==\nThe quotient group {{nowrap|''G''/''G''}} is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial group]] (the group with one element), and {{nowrap|''G''/{''e''}<nowiki/>}} is isomorphic to ''G''.\n\nThe [[group order|order]] of {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}}, by definition the number of elements, is equal to {{nowrap|{{!}}''G'' : ''N''{{!}}}}, the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of ''N'' in ''G''. If ''G'' is finite, the index is also equal to the order of ''G'' divided by the order of ''N''. Note that {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}} may be finite, although both ''G'' and ''N'' are infinite (e.g. {{nowrap|'''Z'''/2'''Z'''}}).\n\nThere is a \"natural\" [[surjective]] [[group homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''\u03c0'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''G''/''N''}}, sending each element ''g'' of ''G'' to the coset of ''N'' to which ''g'' belongs, that is: {{nowrap|1=''\u03c0''(''g'') = ''gN''}}. The mapping ''\u03c0'' is sometimes called the ''canonical projection of G onto {{nowrap|G/N}}''. Its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is ''N''.\n\nThere is a bijective correspondence between the subgroups of ''G'' that contain ''N'' and the subgroups of {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}}; if ''H'' is a subgroup of ''G'' containing ''N'', then the corresponding subgroup of {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}} is ''\u03c0''(''H''). This correspondence holds for normal subgroups of ''G'' and {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}} as well, and is formalized in the [[lattice theorem]].\n\nSeveral important properties of quotient groups are recorded in the [[fundamental theorem on homomorphisms]] and the [[isomorphism theorem]]s.\n\nIf ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]], [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]], [[solvable group|solvable]], [[cyclic group|cyclic]] or [[generating set of a group|finitely generated]], then so is {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}}.\n\nIf ''H'' is a subgroup in a finite group ''G'', and the order of ''H'' is one half of the order of ''G'', then ''H'' is guaranteed to be a normal subgroup, so {{nowrap|''G''/''H''}} exists and is isomorphic to ''C''<sub>2</sub>.  This result can also be stated as \"any subgroup of index 2 is normal\", and in this form it applies also to infinite groups. Furthermore, if ''p'' is the smallest prime number dividing the order of a finite group, ''G'', then if {{nowrap|''G''/''H''}} has order ''p'', ''H'' must be a normal subgroup of ''G''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dummit|Foote|2003|p=120}}</ref> \n\nGiven ''G'' and a normal subgroup ''N'', then ''G'' is a [[group extension]] of {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}} by ''N''. One could ask whether this extension is trivial or split; in other words, one could ask whether ''G'' is a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] or [[semidirect product]] of ''N'' and {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}}. This is a special case of the [[extension problem]]. An example where the extension is not split is as follows: Let ''G'' = '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> = {0, 1, 2, 3}, and ''N'' = {0, 2}, which is isomorphic to '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>. Then {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}} is also isomorphic to '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>. But '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> has only the trivial [[automorphism]], so the only semi-direct product of ''N'' and {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}} is the direct product. Since '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is different from {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub> \u00d7 '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}}, we conclude that ''G'' is not a semi-direct product of ''N'' and {{nowrap|''G''/''N''}}.\n\n==Quotients of Lie groups==\nIf ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and ''N'' is a normal [[Lie subgroup]] of ''G'', the quotient {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} is also a Lie group.  In this case, the original group ''G'' has the structure of a [[fiber bundle]] (specifically, a [[principal bundle|principal ''N''-bundle]]), with base space {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} and fiber ''N''.\n\nFor a non-normal Lie subgroup ''N'', the space {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} of left cosets is not a group, but simply a [[differentiable manifold]] on which ''G'' acts.

These particles obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Fermions include all [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s, as well as all [[composite particle]]s made of an [[even and odd|odd number]] of these, such as all [[baryon]]s and many [[atom]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. Fermions differ from [[boson]]s, which obey [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]].\n\nA fermion can be an [[elementary particle]], such as the [[electron]], or it can be a [[composite particle]], such as the [[proton]]. According to the [[spin-statistics theorem]] in any reasonable [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[quantum field theory]], particles with [[integer]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] are [[boson]]s, while particles with [[half-integer]] spin are fermions.\n\nIn addition to the spin characteristic, fermions have another specific property: they possess conserved baryon or lepton quantum numbers. Therefore, what is usually referred to as the spin statistics relation is in fact a spin statistics-quantum number relation.<ref>Physical Review D volume 87, page 0550003, year 2013, author Weiner, Richard M., title \"Spin-statistics-quantum number connection and supersymmetry\"  arxiv:1302.0969</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, only one fermion can occupy a particular [[quantum state]] at any given time. If multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different. Fermions are usually associated with [[matter]], whereas bosons are generally [[force carrier]] particles, although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear.  [[Weak interaction|Weakly interacting]] fermions can also display bosonic behavior under extreme conditions.  At low temperature fermions show [[superfluidity]] for uncharged particles and [[superconductivity]] for charged particles.\n\nComposite fermions, such as protons and [[neutron]]s, are the key building blocks of [[baryonic matter|everyday matter]].\n\nThe name fermion was coined by English theoretical physicist [[Paul Dirac]] from the surname of Italian physicist [[Enrico Fermi]].<ref>Notes on Dirac's lecture ''Developments in Atomic Theory'' at Le Palais de la D\u00e9couverte, 6 December 1945, UKNATARCHI Dirac Papers BW83/2/257889. See note 64 on page 331 in \"The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom\" by Graham Farmelo</ref>\n\n==Elementary fermions==\n\nThe [[Standard Model]] recognizes two types of elementary fermions: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s. In all, the model distinguishes 24 different fermions. There are six quarks ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[bottom quark|bottom]] and [[top quark|top]] quarks), and six leptons ([[electron]], [[electron neutrino]], [[muon]], [[muon neutrino]], [[Tau (particle)|tau particle]] and [[tau neutrino]]), along with the corresponding [[antiparticle]] of each of these.\n\nMathematically, fermions come in three types:\n* [[Weyl fermion]]s (massless),\n* [[Dirac fermion]]s (massive), and\n* [[Majorana fermion]]s (each its own antiparticle).\nMost Standard Model fermions are believed to be Dirac fermions, although it is unknown at this time whether the [[neutrino]]s are Dirac or Majorana fermions (or both). Dirac fermions can be treated as a combination of two Weyl fermions.<ref name=\"MoriiLim2004\">{{cite book|author1=T. Morii|author2=C. S. Lim|author3=S. N. Mukherjee|title=The Physics of the Standard Model and Beyond|date=1 January 2004|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-981-279-560-1}}</ref>{{rp|106}}  In July 2015, Weyl fermions have been experimentally realized in [[Weyl semimetal]]s.\n\n==Composite fermions==\n{{see also|List of particles#Composite particles}}\n\nComposite particles (such as [[hadron]]s, nuclei, and atoms) can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents. More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an odd number of fermions is itself a fermion. It will have half-integer spin.\n\nExamples include the following:\n*A baryon, such as the proton or neutron, contains three fermionic quarks and thus it is a fermion.\n*The nucleus of a [[carbon-13]] atom contains six protons and seven neutrons and is therefore a fermion.\n*The atom [[helium-3]] (<sup>3</sup>He) is made of two protons, one neutron, and two electrons, and therefore it is a fermion.\n\nThe number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.\n\nFermionic or bosonic behavior of a composite particle (or system) is only seen at large (compared to size of the system) distances. At proximity, where spatial structure begins to be important, a composite particle (or system) behaves according to its constituent makeup.\n\nFermions can exhibit bosonic behavior when they become loosely bound in pairs. This is the origin of superconductivity and the [[superfluid]]ity of helium-3: in superconducting materials, electrons interact through the exchange of [[phonon]]s, forming [[Cooper pair]]s, while in helium-3, Cooper pairs are formed via spin fluctuations.\n\nThe quasiparticles of the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] are also known as [[composite fermions]], which are electrons with an even number of quantized vortices attached to them.\n\n===Skyrmions===\n{{Standard model of particle physics|cTopic=[[Elementary particle]]s}}\n{{main|Skyrmion}}\n\nIn a quantum field theory, there can be field configurations of bosons which are topologically twisted. These are coherent states (or [[soliton]]s) which behave like a particle, and they can be fermionic even if all the constituent particles are bosons. This was discovered by [[Tony Skyrme]] in the early 1960s, so fermions made of bosons are named [[skyrmion]]s after him.\n\nSkyrme's original example involved fields which take values on a three-dimensional sphere, the original [[nonlinear sigma model]] which describes the large distance behavior of [[pion]]s. In Skyrme's model, reproduced in the [[1/N expansion|large N]] or [[AdS/QCD|string]] approximation to [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD), the proton and neutron are fermionic [[topological soliton]]s of the pion field.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nWhereas Skyrme's example involved pion physics, there is a much more familiar example in quantum electrodynamics with a [[magnetic monopole]]. A bosonic monopole with the [[Dirac quantization condition|smallest possible magnetic charge]] and a bosonic version of the electron will form a fermionic [[dyon]].\n\nThe analogy between the Skyrme field and the Higgs field of the electroweak sector has been used<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link=Richard M.

The Futurians were based in [[New York City]] and were a major force in the development of science fiction writing and [[science fiction fandom]] in the years 1937\u20131945.\n\n==Origins of the group==\nAs described in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s autobiography ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'', the Futurians spun off from the [[Greater New York Science Fiction Club]] (headed by [[Sam Moskowitz]], later an influential SF editor and historian) over ideological differences, with the Futurians wishing to take a more overt political stance. Other sources indicate that [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was pushing for a more [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] direction with a goal of leading fandom toward a political ideal, all of which Moskowitz resisted. As a result, Wollheim broke off from the Greater New York group and founded the Futurians in September, 1938.<ref name = \"Kyle\">{{cite journal\n  | last =Kyle\n  | first =David\n  | title =SaM \u2013 Fan Forever\n  | journal =Mimosa\n  | issue =21\n  | pages =7\u201310\n  |date=December 1997\n  | url =http://www.jophan.org/mimosa/m21/kyle.htm\n  | accessdate = 24 Apr 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{dead link|date=October 2017}}[http://fancyclopedia.editme.com/FUTURIAN Fancylopedia, ''Futurians'']</ref><ref>[http://efanzines.com/FWD/FWD.htm efanzines.com, ''FUTURIAN WAR DIGEST'']</ref> The fans following Moskowitz reorganized into the Queens Science Fiction Club.\n\n[[File:With Frederik Pohl and John Michel c. 1938.jpg|thumbnail|Donald A. Wollheim, Frederik Pohl and John Michel in 1938]] \n[[Frederik Pohl]], in his autobiography ''The Way the Future Was'', said that the origin of the Futurians lay with the [[Science Fiction League]] founded by [[Hugo Gernsback]] in 1934, the local New York City chapter of which was called the \"Brooklyn Science Fiction League\" or BSFL, headed by [[G. G. Clark]].\n\nWollheim, [[John Michel (science fiction)|John Michel]], and [[Robert A. W. Lowndes]] were also members of the BSFL.  Along with Pohl, the four started calling themselves the \"Quadrumvirate\".  Pohl, commenting about that time, said \"we four marched from Brooklyn to the sea, leaving a wide scar of burned out clubs behind us. We changed clubs the way [[Detroit]] changes tailfins, every year had a new one, and last year's was junk\".\n\nThere were several club names during that period, before finally settling on the Futurians. In 1935 there was the \"East New York Science Fiction League\" (ENYSFL), later the \"Independent League for Science Fiction\" (ILSF).  In 1936 came the International Cosmos Science Club (ICSC), which also involved [[Will Sykora]]. Pohl then says that \"on reflection 'Cosmos' seemed to take in a bit more territory than was justified, so we changed it to the International Scientific Association (it wasn't International either, but then it also wasn't scientific)\".   The ISA then was renamed New York Branch-International Scientific Association (NYB-ISA).\n\nIn 1937, after a falling-out with Will Sykora and others, the \"Quadrumvirate\" went on to found the Futurians.  Sykora then founded the [[Queens Science Fiction League]] with [[Sam Moskowitz]] and [[James V. Taurasi]].  Later, the QSFL changed into [[New Fandom]].   Pohl said the New Fandom and the Futurians were \"Addicted to Feuds\", that \"No [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] nor [[KGB]] ever wrestled so valiantly for the soul of an emerging nation as New Fandom and the Futurians did for science fiction\".\n\nMost of the group's members also had professional ambitions within science fiction and related fields, and collectively were very effective at achieving this goal, as the roster of members suggests.  At one point in the earliest 1940s, approximately half of all the pulp SF and fantasy magazines in the U.S. were being edited by Futurians:  Frederik Pohl at the [[Popular Publications]] offshoot [[Fictioneers, Inc.]] (''[[Astonishing Stories]]'' and ''[[Super-Science Stories]]''); Robert Lowndes at [[Columbia Publications]], most notably with ''[[Science Fiction (American magazine)|Science Fiction]]'' and ''[[Future Fiction]]'' (though through the decade to come, Lowndes's responsibilities would expand to other types of fiction magazine in the chain), and Donald Wollheim at the very marginal [[Albing Publications]] with the short-lived, micro-budgeted ''[[Cosmic Stories]]'' and ''[[Stirring Science Stories]]'' (Wollheim soon moved on to [[Avon Books]]; Do\u00eb \"[[Leslie Perri]]\" Baumgardt also worked on a romance fiction title for Albing). Most of these projects had small editorial budgets, and relied in part, or occasionally entirely, on contributions from fellow Futurians for their contents.\n\n==Political tendencies==\n\nAt the time the Futurians were formed, Donald Wollheim was strongly attracted by [[communism]] and believed that followers of science fiction \"should actively work for the realization of the scientific world-state as the only genuine justification for their activities and existence\".<ref name = \"Carr\">{{cite book |last=Carr |first=Terry |title=Classic Science Fiction: The First Golden Age |year=1979 |publisher= [[Robson Books]] |isbn=0-86051-070-0}} p. 430</ref> It was to this end that Wollheim formed the Futurians, and many of its members were in some degree interested in the political applications of science fiction.  Members of the Futurians, including Wollheim, Michel, Lowndes, and Cohen briefly became interested in [[Technocracy]], a utopian movement led by [[Howard Scott]], and attended a study course, although they later dismissed Scott as a \"crackpot\".<ref name = \"Knight\">{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Damon |title=The Futurians |year=1977 |publisher=John Day}} pp. 47\u20138</ref>\n\nHence the group included supporters of [[Trotskyism]], like [[Judith Merril]] and others who would have been deemed [[far left]] for the era ([[Frederik Pohl]] became a member of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] in 1936, but later quit in 1939). On the other hand, several members were political moderates or apolitical, and in the case of [[James Blish]] arguably{{attribution needed|date=March 2015}} [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]]. [[Damon Knight]] in ''The Futurians'' indicates that Blish at that time felt [[Fascism]] was interesting in theory, if repellent as it was then being practised. More solid evidence is that Blish admired the work of [[Oswald Spengler]]{{vague|date=March 2015}}.\n\nPohl, in his autobiography, ''[[The Way the Future Was]]'', said Wollheim voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Presidential Candidate [[Alfred Landon]] in 1936.\n\n==Members included==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Isaac Asimov]]\n* [[Elsie Wollheim|Elise Balter]] (also known as Elsie Wollheim)\n* [[James Blish]]\n* [[Hannes Bok]]\n* [[Daniel Burford]]\n* [[Chester Cohen]]\n* [[Rosalind Cohen]] (later Mrs. Dirk Wylie)\n* [[Dirk Wylie|Harry Dockweiler]] (also known as Dirk Wylie)\n* Jack Gillespie\n* [[Virginia Kidd]]\n* [[Damon Knight]]\n* [[Cyril Kornbluth]]\n* [[Mary Kornbluth|Mary Byers]] (also known as Mary Kornbluth)\n* [[Walter Kubilius]]\n* [[David Kyle]]\n* [[Herman Leventman]]\n* [[Robert A.

This inspired the creation of an organization for longstanding fans under the initial chairmanship of [[Robert A. Madle]]. Originally only those fans who were known to have been active in fandom before the cutoff date, January 1, 1938, were eligible. Such fannish activity (or \"[[fanac]]\") including writing to letter columns in [[science fiction]] [[magazine]]s, having been published in [[fanzine]]s, or having participated in science fiction oriented clubs, or just generally doing fannish things.<ref>[http://nebulasf.atspace.com/madle.htm Madle, Robert A. \"Bob Madle's American Letter\" ''[[Nebula Science Fiction|Nebula]]'' 40 (May 1959)]</ref>\n\nThe term itself is an oblique reference to [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s classic science fiction epic ''[[Last and First Men]]''. In this book the stages of mankind are enumerated. Thus early 1950s historian of fandom [[Jack Speer]] began to label successive generations of fans as First Fandom, Second Fandom, Third Fandom, and so forth... all the way to Seventh Fandom and beyond.\n\nCurrently the organization allows several classes of membership. For example, a ''Dinosaur'' is a member who was active before the first [[Worldcon]] (World Science Fiction Convention) held on July 4, 1939, while ''Associate Membership'' requires provable activity in fandom for more than three decades.\n\nFirst Fandom annually presents its [[First Fandom Hall of Fame award]] and Sam Moskowitz Archive Award for excellence in science fiction collecting. at the beginning of the Hugo Awards Ceremony at the World Science Fiction Convention.\n\nThere is an analogous informal society in [[Finnish fandom]] called the ''Dinosaur Club''; the cutoff being the first major Finnish [[Convention (meeting)|con]] [[Kingcon]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n1.

The basic unit was the ''[[cumann]]'' (branch) which were then grouped into ''comhairle ceantair'' (district branch) and a ''comhairle d\u00e1il ceantair'' (constituency branch) in every constituency. At the party's height, it had 3,000 ''cumainn'', an average of 75 per constituency. The party claimed 55,000 members in 2004, a figure which political scientist Eoin O'Malley considers exaggerated compared to membership figures for other parties.\n\nHowever, since the early 1990s the cumann structure was weakened. Every ''cumann'' was entitled to three votes to selection conventions irrespective of its size; hence, a large number of ''cumainn'' became in effect \"paper ''cumainn''\", the only use of which was to ensure an aspiring or sitting candidate got enough votes. Another problem arose with the emergence of parallel organisations grouped around candidates or elected officials. Supporters and election workers for a particular candidate were loyal to a candidate and not to the party. If the candidate were to leave the party, through either resignation, retirement or defeat at an election, the candidate's supporters would often depart. Although this phenomenon was nothing new (the most famous example being [[Neil Blaney]]'s \"Donegal Mafia\")<ref name=\"komito\">{{cite thesis |url=http://www.ucd.ie/lis/staff/komito/thesis.htm |type=Ph.D. |title=Politics and Clientelism in Urban Ireland: Information, reputation, and brokerage |first=Lee |last=Komito |date=1985 |publisher=University Microfilms International |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |id=8603660 |quote=The only exception was Neil Blaney in Donegal.

This was in part exacerbated by significant infighting between candidates in the run-up to the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=White |authorlink=Michael White (journalist)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/25/irish-general-election-parties-divided |title=Irish general election turns into slanging match with parties divided |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011 |location=London}}</ref> ''The Irish Times'' estimated that half of its 3,000 ''cumainn'' are effectively moribund.

Though their influence declined, the clan remained close advisors to the succeeding Emperors.\n\n== Asuka/Nara period ==\nThe Fujiwara clan's political influence was initiated during the [[Asuka period]]. Nakatomi no Kamatari, a member of the lower-nobility [[Nakatomi clan|Nakatomi family]] led a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] against the [[Soga clan|Soga]] in 645 and initiated a series of sweeping government [[reform movement|reforms]] that would be known as the [[Taika Reform]]. In 668 Emperor Tenji (reigned 668\u2013671), bestowed the ''[[kabane]]'' {{nihongo|Fujiwara no [[Ason]]|\u85e4\u539f\u671d\u81e3}} on Kamatari. The surname passed to the descendants of [[Fujiwara no Fuhito]] (659\u2013720), the second son and heir of Kamatari, who was prominent at the court of several emperors and empresses during the early [[Nara period]]. He made his daughter Miyako a concubine of [[Emperor Monmu]]. Her son, Prince Obito became [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]]. Fuhito succeeded in making another of his daughters, [[Empress K\u014dmy\u014d|K\u014dmy\u014dshi]], the empress consort of Emperor Sh\u014dmu. She was the first empress (like [[Empress Wu]] in China) consort of Japan who was not a daughter of the imperial family itself. Fuhito had four sons; and each of them became the progenitor of a cadet branch of the clan: \n* the [[Hokke (Fujiwara)|Hokke]] or Northern branch founded by [[Fujiwara no Fusasaki]]<ref>Nussbaum, \"Fujiwara no Fusasaki\" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 202|page=202}}.</ref>\n* the [[Ky\u014dke]] branch founded by [[Fujiwara no Maro]]<ref>Nussbaum, \"Fujiwara no Maro\" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 205|page=205}}.</ref>\n* the [[Nanke (Fujiwara)|Nanke]] or Southern branch founded by [[Fujiwara no Muchimaro]]<ref>Nussbaum, \"Fujiwara no Muchimaro\" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 207|page=207}}.</ref>\n* the [[Shikike]] branch founded by [[Fujiwara no Umakai]]<ref>Nussbaum, \"Fujiwara no Umakai\" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 211|page=211}}.</ref>\nAmong them, the Hokke came to be considered as the leaders of the entire clan.\n\n== Heian period ==\n{{Main|Heian period}}\n\nDuring the [[Heian period]] of Japanese history, the [[Hokke (Fujiwara)|Hokke]] managed to establish a hereditary claim to the position of [[regent]], either for an underage emperor (''[[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|sessh\u014d]]'') or for an adult one (''[[kampaku]]''). Some prominent Fujiwaras occupied these positions more than once, and for more than one emperor. Lesser members of the Fujiwara were [[Noble court|court]] [[Nobility|nobles]], [[Provinces of Japan|provincial]] [[governor]]s and vice governors, members of the provincial [[aristocracy]], and [[samurai]]. The Fujiwara was one of the four great families that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian Period (794\u20131185), and the most important of them at that time. The others were [[Tachibana clan (kuge)|the Tachibana]], [[Taira clan|the Taira]] and [[Minamoto clan|the Minamoto]]. The Fujiwara exercised tremendous power, especially during the period of regency governments in 10th and 11th centuries, having many emperors as practically [[puppet monarch]]s.\n\nThe Fujiwara dominated the government of Japan 794\u20131160. There is no clear starting point of their dominance. However, their domination of civil administration was lost by the establishment of the first shogunate (i.e., [[Kamakura shogunate]]) under [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] in 1192.\n\nFujiwara princes initially served as highest ministers of the imperial Court (''kampaku'') and regents (''sessh\u014d'') for underage monarchs. The Fujiwara were the proverbial \"power behind the throne\" for centuries. Apparently they never aspired to supplant the imperial dynasty. Instead, the clan's influence stemmed from its matrimonial alliances with the imperial family. Because consorts of crown princes, younger sons, and emperors were generally Fujiwara women, the male heads of the Fujiwara house were often the father-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle, or maternal grandfather of the emperor. The family reached the peak of its power under [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] (966\u20131027), a longtime ''[[kampaku]]'' who was the grandfather of three emperors, the father of six empresses or imperial consorts, and the grandfather of seven additional imperial consorts; it is no exaggeration to say that it was Michinaga who ruled Japan during this period, not the titular Emperors.\n\nThe Fujiwara clan is featured prominently in ''[[The Pillow Book]]'', by [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]].\n\n=== Fujiwara regime in the Heian period ===\nThe Fujiwara Regency was the main feature of government of the entire Heian era. [[Kyoto]] ([[Heian-ky\u014d]]) was geopolitically a better seat of government; with good river access to the sea, it could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces.\n\nJust before the move to the Heian-ky\u014d, the Emperor had abolished universal conscription in the eighth century and soon local, private militaries came into being. The Fujiwara, [[Taira]], and [[Minamoto]] were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class.\n\nIn the ninth and tenth centuries, much authority was lost to the great families, who disregarded the Chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in Kyoto. Stability came to Heian Japan, but, even though succession was ensured for the Imperial family through heredity, power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family, the Fujiwara.\n\nFamily administrations now became public institutions. As the most powerful family, the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne. Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family.\n\nAs the [[Soga clan|Soga]] had taken control of the throne in the sixth century, the Fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family, and one of their members was the first head of the Emperor's Private Office. Another Fujiwara became regent for his grandson, then a minor emperor, and yet another was appointed ''[[kampaku]]'' (regent for an adult emperor). Toward the end of the ninth century, several emperors tried, but failed, to check the Fujiwara. For a time, however, during the reign of [[Emperor Daigo]] (897\u2013930), the Fujiwara regency was suspended as he ruled directly.\n\nNevertheless, the Fujiwara were not demoted by Emperor Daigo but actually became stronger during his reign. Central control of Japan had continued to decline, and the Fujiwara, along with other great families and religious foundations, acquired ever larger ''[[sh\u014den]]'' and greater wealth during the early tenth century. By the early Heian period, the ''sh\u014den'' had obtained legal status, and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity, waiver of taxes, and immunity from government inspection of the ''sh\u014den'' they held. Those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to sh\u014den holders in return for a share of the harvest. People and lands were increasingly beyond central control and taxation, a de facto return to conditions before the Taika Reform.\n\n[[File:Fujiwaranomichinaga.jpg|thumb|[[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] (966&ndash;1028)]]\n\nWithin decades of Emperor Daigo's death, the Fujiwara had absolute control over the court. By the year 1000, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will. Little authority was left for traditional officialdom, and government affairs were handled through the Fujiwara family's private administration. The Fujiwara had become what historian George B. Sansom has called \"hereditary dictators\".\n\nThe Fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy. There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Japanese writing had long depended on Chinese ideograms (''[[kanji]]''), but these were now supplemented by ''[[kana]]'', two types of phonetic Japanese script: ''[[katakana]]'', a mnemonic device using parts of Chinese ideograms; and ''[[hiragana]]'', a cursive form of ''kanji'' writing and an art form in itself. ''Hiragana'' gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan's famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in ''[[Kager\u014d Nikki]]'' (\"The Gossamer Years\") by \"the mother of Michitsuna\", ''Makura no S\u014dshi'' (''[[The Pillow Book]]'') by [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]], and ''Genji Monogatari'' (''[[Tale of Genji]]'') by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] (herself a Fujiwara). Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored ''yamato-e'' (Japanese style) paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid and late Heian periods, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day.\n\nDecline in food production, growth of the population, and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of Fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries. Members of the Fujiwara, [[Taira]], and [[Minamoto]] families\u2014all of whom had descended from the imperial family\u2014attacked one another, claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land, set up rival regimes, and generally broke the peace of Japan.\n\nThe Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d]] (1068\u201373), the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century. Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d, determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule, implemented reforms to curb Fujiwara influence. He also established an office to compile and validate [[Estate (house)|estate]] records with the aim of reasserting central control. Many ''[[sh\u014den]]'' were not properly certified, and large landholders, like the Fujiwara, felt threatened with the loss of their lands. Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d also established the ''In no ch\u014d'', or Office of the Cloistered Emperor, which was held by a succession of emperors who abdicated to devote themselves to behind-the-scenes governance, or ''insei'' ([[Cloistered rule]]).\n\nThe ''In no ch\u014d'' filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power. Rather than being banished, the Fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making. In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising Minamoto family. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne. The period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the ''In no ch\u014d'' and of the rise of the military class throughout the country. Military might rather than civil authority dominated the government.\n\nA struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the Fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power. [[Fujiwara no Yorinaga]] sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1158 against the heir apparent, who was supported by the Taira and Minamoto. In the end, the Fujiwara were destroyed, the old system of government supplanted, and the ''insei'' system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs, marking a turning point in Japanese history. Within a year, the Taira and Minamoto clashed, and a twenty-year period of Taira ascendancy began. The Taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces. Finally, [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] (1147\u20131199) rose from his headquarters at [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] (in the [[Kant\u014d region]], southwest of modern Tokyo) to defeat the Taira, and with them the child emperor [[Emperor Antoku]] they controlled, in the [[Genpei War]] (1180\u20131185).\n\nAfter this downfall, the younger branches of the Fujiwara clan turned their focus from politics to the arts, producing literary luminaries such as [[Fujiwara no Shunzei]] or [[Fujiwara no Teika]].\n\n=== Decline ===\nOnly forty years after [[Michinaga]]'s death, his Fujiwara heirs were not able to prevent the ascension of [[Emperor Go-Sanjo|Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d]] (reigned 1068\u20131073), the first emperor since [[Emperor Uda]] whose mother was not a Fujiwara. The system of government by retired emperor (''daij\u014d tenn\u014d'') ([[cloistered rule]]) beginning from 1087 further weakened the Fujiwara's control over the Imperial Court.\n\nThe Fujiwara-dominated Heian period approached its end along disturbances of 12th century. The dynastic struggle known as the H\u014dgen Disturbance (''[[H\u014dgen Rebellion|H\u014dgen no Ran]]'') led to the Taira emerging as the most powerful clan in 1156. During the Heiji Disturbance (''[[Heiji Rebellion|Heiji no Ran]]'') in 1160 the Taira defeated the coalition of Fujiwara and Minamoto forces. This defeat marked the end of the Fujiwara's dominance.\n\n== Split and enduring influence ==\nDuring the 13th century, the [[Fujiwara northern house]] (''Hokke'') was split into the [[five regent houses]]: [[Konoe clan|Konoe]], [[Takatsukasa clan|Takatsukasa]], [[Kuj\u014d clan|Kuj\u014d]], [[Nij-o clan|Nij\u014d]] and [[Ichij\u014d clan|Ichij\u014d]]. \n\nThey had a \"monopoly\" to the offices of ''sessh\u014d'' and ''kampaku'', and served in turn. The political power had shifted away from the court nobility in Kyoto to the new warrior class in the countryside. However, Fujiwara princes remained close advisers, regents and ministers to the emperors for centuries, the family remained and political reputation and influence even until the 20th century (such as [[Fumimaro Konoe]] and [[Morihiro Hosokawa]], who became the Prime Ministers). As such, they had a certain political power and much influence, as often the rival warriors and later bakufu sought their alliance. [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his sister [[Oichi]] were descended from the [[Taira]] and Fujiwara clans; regent [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and shogun [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] were related by marriage to the [[Fujiwara]] clan. [[Empress Sh\u014dken]], wife of [[Emperor Meiji]], was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan and, through [[Gracia Hosokawa]], of the [[Minamoto clan]].\n\nUntil the marriage of the Crown Prince [[Hirohito]] (Emperor Sh\u014dwa) to Princess Nagako of Kuni (posthumously [[Empress K\u014djun]]) in January 1924, the principal consorts of emperors and crown princes had often been recruited from one of the [[Sekke]] Fujiwara. Imperial princesses were often married to Fujiwara lords \u2013 throughout a millennium at least. As recently as Emperor Sh\u014dwa's third daughter, the late former Princess Takanomiya (Kazoku), and Prince Mikasa's elder daughter, the former Princess Yasuko, married into Takatsukasa and Konoe families, respectively. Likewise a daughter of the last [[Tokugawa shogunate|''sh\u014dgun'']] married a second cousin of Emperor Sh\u014dwa.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{main|Fujiwara family tree}}\n{{Fujiwara family tree}}\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Sessh\u014d]]''\n* ''[[Sh\u014dgun]]''\n* [[Bakufu]]\n* [[Puppet emperor]]\n* [[Cloistered rule]]\n* [[History of Japan]]\n* [[Lists of incumbents]]\n* [[T\u014dshi Kaden]], an early bibliographic clan record\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Nussbaum, Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and K\u00e4the Roth.

Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism by the United States of America under the [[US constitution|Constitution]] of 1787, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.<ref>In 1946, scholar Kenneth Wheare observed that the two levels of government in the US were 'co-equally supreme'. In this he echoed the perspective of the founding fathers, James Madison in ''Federalist 39'' having seen the several states as forming 'distinct and independent portions of the supremacy' in relation to the general government.

This is determined by the absence or presence of a right of secession for the parts. The structures are termed, respectively, the [[Federation|federal state]] (or [[federation]]) and the federal union of states (or federal union).</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The pathway of regional integration or separation.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The pathway of regional integration or separation]]\nThe terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the Latin word ''foedus'', meaning \"treaty, pact or [[wikt:covenant|covenant]].\" Their common meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms. It was in this sense that James Madison in ''Federalist 39'' had referred to the new US Constitution as 'neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both' (i.e. neither constituting a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a hybrid of the two).<ref>Madison, James, Hamilton, Alexander and Jay, John (1987) ''The Federalist Papers'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 259.</ref> In the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form established, while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states.<ref>Law, John (2012) 'Sense on Federalism', in ''Political Quarterly'', Vol. 83, No. 3, p. 544.</ref> Thus, this article relates to the modern usage of the word 'federalism'.\n\nModern federalism is a system based upon [[democracy|democratic]] rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments. The term ''[[federalist]]'' describes several political beliefs around the world depending on context.\n\nFederalism is sometimes viewed as in the context of international negotiation as \"the best system for integrating diverse nations, ethnic groups, or combatant parties, all of whom may have cause to fear control by an overly powerful center.\"<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\">Michael Meyer-Resende, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/18/why-talk-of-federalism-wont-help-peace-in-syria-assad/ Why Talk of Federalism Won't Help Peace in Syria, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' (March 18, 2017).</ref> However, in some countries, those skeptical of federal prescriptions believe that increased regional autonomy is likely to lead to secession or dissolution of the nation.<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\"/> In Syria, federalization proposals have failed in part because \"Syrians fear that these borders could turn out to be the same as the ones that the fighting parties have currently carved out.\"<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\"/>\n\nFederations such as [[Yugoslavia]] or [[Czechoslovakia]] collapsed as soon as it was possible to put the model to the test.<ref>'The Federal Experience in Yugoslavia', Mihailo Markovic, page 75; included in 'Rethinking Federalism: Citizens, Markets, and Governments in a changing world', edited by Karen Knop, Sylvia Ostry, Richard Simeon, Katherine Swinton|Google books</ref>\n\n===Explanations for adoption of federalist systems===\nAccording to Daniel Ziblatt's ''Structuring the State'', there are four competing theoretical explanations in the academic literature for the adoption of federal systems:\n# Ideational theories, which hold that a greater degree of ideological commitment to decentralist ideas in society makes federalism more likely to be adopted.\n# Cultural-historical theories, which hold that federal institutions are more likely to be adopted in societies with culturally or ethnically fragmented populations.\n# \"Social contract\" theories, which hold that federalism emerges as a bargain between a center and a periphery where the center is not powerful enough to dominate the periphery and the periphery is not powerful enough to secede from the center.\n# \"Infrastructural power\" theories, which hold that federalism is likely to emerge when the subunits of a potential federation already have highly developed infrastructures (e.g. they are already constitutional, parliamentary, and administratively modernized states).<ref>{{Cite book|author=Daniel Ziblatt|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8201.html|title=Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=2008}}</ref>\n\n==European vs. American federalism==\n{{main article|Federal Europe|Federalism in the United States}}\nIn [[#Federalism in Europe|Europe]], \"Federalist\" is sometimes used to describe those who favor a common federal government, with distributed power at regional, national and supranational levels. Most European federalists want this development to continue within the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was [[Winston Churchill]]'s  speech in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html|title=The Churchill Society London. Churchill's Speeches.|website=www.churchill-society-london.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[#United States|United States]], federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government.  When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, the [[Federalist Party]] supported a stronger central government, while \"[[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]]\" wanted a weaker central government.  This is very different from the modern usage of \"federalism\" in Europe and the United States.  The distinction stems from the fact that \"federalism\" is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a [[confederation|confederacy]] and a [[unitary state]].  The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the [[Articles of Confederation]], under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government.\n\nIn contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European \"federalism\" argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state.  The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense.  As the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] has increased, some people have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] intended.  Most people politically advocating \"federalism\" in the United States argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the [[Courts of the United States|judiciary]] (see [[Federalist Society]], [[New Federalism]]).\n\nIn [[#Canada|Canada]], federalism typically implies opposition to [[Souverainism|sovereigntist]] movements (most commonly [[Quebec separatism]]).\n\nThe governments of Argentina, [[#Australia|Australia]], [[#Brazil|Brazil]], [[#India|India]], and [[#Mexico|Mexico]], among others, are also organized along federalist principles.\n\nFederalism may encompass as few as two or three internal divisions, as is the case in [[Administrative divisions of Belgium|Belgium]] or Bosnia and Herzegovina. In general, two extremes of federalism can be distinguished: at one extreme, the strong federal state is almost completely unitary, with few powers reserved for local governments; while at the other extreme, the national government may be a federal state in name only, being a [[confederation]] in actuality.\n\nIn 1999, the [[Government of Canada]] established the [[Forum of Federations]] as an international network for exchange of best practices among federal and federalizing countries. Headquartered in [[Ottawa]], the Forum of Federations partner governments include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and Switzerland.\n==Examples of federalism==\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main article|Federalism in Australia|Federation of Australia}}\n[[File:Australia location map recolored.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Commonwealth of Australia, consisting of its [[federal district]], [[Australian Capital Territory]] (red), the states of [[New South Wales]] (pink), [[Queensland]] (blue), [[South Australia]] (purple), [[Tasmania]] (yellow, bottom), [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (green), [[Western Australia]] (orange) and the [[Northern Territory]] (yellow, top).]]\nOn the 1st of January 1901 the nation-state of Australia officially came into existence as a federation. The [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]] was colonised by the United Kingdom in 1788, which subsequently established six, eventually self-governing, colonies there. In the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held [[referendums]] on becoming the unified, self-governing \"Commonwealth of Australia\" within the British Empire. When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the [[Federation of Australia]] commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The model of Australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the United States of America, although it does so through a parliamentary [[Westminster system]] rather than a presidential system.\n\n===Brazil===\n[[File:Brazil Political Map.svg|thumb|left|Brazil is a union of 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and its [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]], which is the site of the federal capital, [[Bras\u00edlia]].]]\n{{See also|States of Brazil}}\nIn Brazil, the [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil|fall of the monarchy in 1889]] by a military ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' led to the rise of the [[presidential system]], headed by [[Deodoro da Fonseca]]. Aided by well-known jurist [[Ruy Barbosa]], Fonseca established federalism in Brazil by decree, but this system of government would be confirmed by every [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian constitution]] since 1891, although some of them would distort some of the federalist principles. The 1937 federal government had the authority to appoint State Governors (called [[Federal intervention|intervenors]]) at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]. Brazil also uses the Fonseca system to regulate interstate trade. Brazil is one of the biggest federal governments.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1988]] introduced a new component to the ideas of federalism, including [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] as federal entities. Brazilian municipalities are now invested with some of the traditional powers usually granted to states in federalism, and they are allowed to have a Constitution like the Constitution of Rio Grande do Sul State\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main article|Canadian federalism}}\n[[File:Political map of Canada.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|In Canada, the provincial governments derive all their powers directly from the [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]]. In contrast, the [[Territories of Canada|territories]] are subordinate to the federal government and are delegated powers by it.]]\n\nIn Canada the system of federalism is described by the division of powers between the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] and the country's [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] governments.  Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867|Constitution Act]] (previously known as the [[British North America Act]]) of 1867, specific powers of legislation are allotted.  Section 91 of the constitution gives rise to federal authority for legislation, whereas section 92 gives rise to provincial powers.\n\nFor matters not directly dealt with in the constitution, the federal government retains residual powers; however, conflict between the two levels of government, relating to which level has legislative jurisdiction over various matters, has been a longstanding and evolving issue.  Areas of contest include legislation with respect to regulation of the economy, taxation, and natural resources.\n\n===India===\n{{Main article|Federalism in India}}\n[[File:State- and union territory-level parties.svg|thumb|left|Indian state governments led by various political parties]]\n\nThe [[Government of India]] (referred to as the ''Union Government'') was established by the [[Constitution of India]], and is the governing authority of a ''federal union'' of [[States and territories of India|29 states and 7 union territories]].\n\nThe government of India is based on a 3 tiered system, in which the [[Constitution of India]] delineates the subjects on which each tier of government has executive powers.  The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government (also known as the Central Government), representing the Union of India, and the State governments. Later, a third tier was added in the form of [[Panchayats]] and Municipalities. In the current arrangement, The [[Constitution of India#Schedules|Seventh Schedule]] of the Indian Constitution delimits the subjects of each level of governmental jurisdiction, dividing them into three lists:\n* [[Union List]] includes subjects of national importance such as defence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the  subjects mentioned in the Union List.\n* [[State List]] contains subjects of State and local importance such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the State List.\n* [[Concurrent List]] includes subjects of common interest to both the Union Government as well as the State Governments, such as education, forest, trade unions, marriage, adoption and succession. Both the Union as well as the State Governments can make laws on the subjects mentioned in this list. If their laws conflict with each other, the law made by the Union Government will prevail.\n\n====Asymmetric federalism====\nA distinguishing aspect of Indian federalism is that unlike many other forms of federalism, it is asymmetric.<ref name=\"NCERT\">{{cite book | url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/textbook/textbook.htm?keps2=10-10 | title=Indian Constitution at Work | publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] | pages=232, 233}}</ref> [[Article 370]] makes special provisions for the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per its [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]].

Also one more aspect of Indian federalism is system of [[President's Rule]] in which the central government (through its appointed Governor) takes control of state's administration for certain months when no party can form a government in the state or there is violent disturbance in the state.\n\n====Coalition politics====\nAlthough the Constitution does not say so, India is now a multilingual federation.<ref name=\"NCERT\" /> India has a multi-party system, with political allegiances frequently based on linguistic, regional and caste identities,<ref>Johnson, A \"Federalism: The Indian Experience \", HSRC Press,1996, Pg 3, ISBN</ref> necessitating coalition politics, especially at the [[Government of India|Union]] level.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[File:Nigeria states.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right| A map of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], showing its [[States of Nigeria|36 states and 1 Federal Capital Territory]]]]\n{{Main article| Federalism in Nigeria}}The [[Nigeria|Federal Republic of Nigeria]] has various states which have [[States of Nigeria#Evolution of Nigerian states|evolved over time]] due to [[List of wars involving Nigeria|multiple civil wars]] and the effect of their [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial era]].

There has been significant tension between the southern states and the northern states due to financial inequality, [[Nigerian Civil War|ethnic differences]], [[Religious violence in Nigeria|religious conflict]], and more. For example, religious conflict has led to the rise of [[Boko Haram]], a violent [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist militant group]] which practices [[salafi jihadism]] and [[wahhabism]].

The United States had a similar system until 1913, where prior to the 17th Amendment, Senators were delegates of the state elected by the state legislatures rather than the citizens.\n\nAlready the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the [[German Confederation]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]] and the [[Weimar Republic]] were federal complexes of territories of different political structures. Modern Germany abandoned federalism only during [[Nazi Germany|Nazism]] (1933\u20131945, only de facto but not de jure) and in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (1952\u20131990).

In \"Federalist No. 46,\" James Madison asserted that the states and national government \"are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people, constituted with different powers.\" Alexander Hamilton, writing in \"Federalist No. 28,\" suggested that both levels of government would exercise authority to the citizens' benefit: \"If their [the peoples'] rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress.\" ([http://www.learner.org/courses/democracyinamerica/dia_3/dia_3_topic.html 1])\n[[File:Map of USA with state names.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The United States is composed of fifty self-governing states and several territories.]]\n\nBecause the states were preexisting political entities, the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to  the federal government. The federal government has certain ''express powers'' (also called ''[[enumerated powers]]'') which are powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, the ''[[Necessary and Proper Clause]]'' gives the federal government the ''implied power'' to pass any law \"necessary and proper\" for the execution of its express powers.

Maryland]] (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and by some later amendments\u2014as well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government.\n\nThe [[Federalist Party]] of the United States was opposed by the [[Democratic-Republicans]], including powerful figures such as [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that: the Legislature had too much power (mainly because of the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]]) and that they were unchecked; the Executive had too much power, and that there was no check on the executive; a dictator would arise; and that a bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a potential dictator from exploiting or tyrannizing citizens. The federalists, on the other hand, argued that it was impossible to list all the rights, and those that were not listed could be easily overlooked because they were not in the official bill of rights. Rather, rights in specific cases were to be decided by the judicial system of courts.\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], the federal government increased greatly in influence on everyday life and in size relative to the state governments. Reasons included the need to regulate businesses and industries that span state borders, attempts to secure civil rights, and the provision of social services.  The federal government acquired no substantial new powers until the acceptance by the Supreme Court of the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]].\n\nFrom 1938 until 1995, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] did not invalidate any federal statute as exceeding Congress' power under the [[Commerce Clause]]. Most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers, such as the [[Commerce Clause]], whose applicability has been narrowed by the Supreme Court in recent years. In 1995 the Supreme Court rejected the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act]] in the Lopez decision, and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the [[Violence Against Women Act of 1994]] in the ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' decision. Recently, the Commerce Clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' decision.\n\n[[Dual federalism]] holds that the federal government and the state governments are co-equals, each sovereign.\n\nHowever, since the Civil War Era, the national courts often interpret the federal government as the final judge of its own powers under dual federalism. The establishment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] governments (which are [[Indian country|separate and distinct]] from state and federal government) exercising limited powers of [[Tribal sovereignty|sovereignty]], has given rise to the concept of \"bi-federalism.\"\n\n===Venezuela===\n[[File:Localizador Politico de Venezuela.svg|thumb|right|Map of the Venezuelan federation]]\nThe [[Federal War]] ended in 1863 with the signing of the Treaty of Coche by both the centralist government of the time and the Federal Forces.  The [[United States of Venezuela]] were subsequently incorporated under a \"Federation of Sovereign States\" upon principles borrowed from the [[Articles of Confederation]] of the United States of America. In this Federation, each State had a \"President\" of its own that controlled almost every issue, even the creation of \"State Armies,\" while the Federal Army was required to obtain presidential permission to enter any given state.\n\nHowever, more than 140 years later, the original system has gradually evolved into a quasi-centralist form of government. While the [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 Constitution]] still defines Venezuela as a Federal Republic, it abolished the Senate, transferred competences of the States to the Federal Government and granted the President of the Republic vast powers to intervene in the States and Municipalities.\n\n===Federalism with two components===\n\n====Belgium====\n{{Importance section|date=September 2009}}\n{{main article|Belgian federal government|Belgian federal parliament|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}\n\nFederalism in the Kingdom of Belgium is an evolving system.\n\nBelgian federalism is a twin system which reflects both the\n* [[Languages of Belgium|linguistic ''communities'']] of the country, [[French Community of Belgium|French]] (ca. 40% of the total population), [[Flemish Community|Dutch]] (ca. 59%), and to a much lesser extent [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German]] (ca. 1%) and the\n* geographically defined Regions (federated States: [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels-Capital]] (de facto Greater Brussels), [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]]). The last two correspond to [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|the language areas in Belgium]], Wallonia hosting both the bulk of the French-speaking population and the German-speaking minority. In Brussels, ca. 80% of the population speaks French and ca. 20% Dutch with the city being an enclave of the Flemish region and officially a bilingual area.<ref>{{nl}}[http://www.brusselsstudies.be/PDF/NL_51_BruS13NL.pdf \u201dTaalgebruik in Brussel en de plaats van het Nederlands.

French is the second most spoken mother tongue of Belgium, after Dutch. Within the French-speaking Community of Belgium, there is a geographical and political distinction between Wallonia and Brussels for historical and sociological reasons. Historically, the Walloons were for a federalism with three components and the Flemings for two.<ref>See: Witte, Els & Craeybeckx, Jan. Politieke geschiedenis van Belgi\u00eb. Antwerpen, SWU, pp. 455, 459-460.</ref> This difference is one of the elements which makes the Belgian issue so complicated. The Flemings wanted to defend their culture while the Walloons wanted to defend their political and economical supremacy they had in the 19th century: ''It is true that the Walloon movement, which has never stopped affirming that Wallonia is part of the French cultural area, has never made this cultural struggle a priority, being more concerned to struggle against its status as a political minority and the economic decline which was only a corollary to it''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallonie-en|title=ligne.net/Wallonie_Politique/1995_Destatte_Philippe_Wallonia-Identity.htm Wallonia today - The search for an identity without nationalist mania  - (1995)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn one hand, this means that the [[Politics in Belgium|Belgian political landscape]], generally speaking, consists of only two components: the Dutch-speaking population represented by Dutch-language [[List of political parties in Belgium|political parties]], and the majority populations of Wallonia and Brussels, represented by their French-speaking parties. The Brussels region emerges as a third component.<ref>[[Charles Picqu\u00e9]], Minister-President of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] said in a September, 2008  declaration in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] at the National Walloon Feast : ''It is, besides, impossible to have a debate about the institutions of Belgium in which Brussels would be excluded.''  (French ''Il n'est d'ailleurs, pas question d'imaginer un d\u00e9bat institutionnel dont Bruxelles serait exclu.'' [http://www.actu24.be/article/regions/regionbruxelles/infosbxl/fetes_de_wallonie_picque_emu_par_linvitation_lancee_a_bruxelles/182803.aspx]) The [[Brussels-Capital Region]] has claimed and obtained a special place in the current negotiations about the reformation of the Belgian state. (French ''Pendant 18 ans, Bruxelles est demeur\u00e9e sans statut (...)

Instead of adopting a federal model, the UK has relied on gradual [[devolution]] to decentralise political power. Devolution in the UK began with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] which granted [[home rule]] to Ireland as a constituent country of the former [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign [[Irish Free State]] (which eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland), Northern Ireland retained its devolved government through the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the only part of the UK to have such a body at this time. This body was suspended in 1972 and Northern Ireland was governed by [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] during the period of conflict known as [[The Troubles]].\n\nIn modern times, a process of [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] has decentralised power once again. Since the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 referendums in Scotland]] and [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1997|Wales]] and the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in Northern Ireland, three of the four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the UK]] now have some level of autonomy.

The mode of political organization preferred by anarchists, in general, is federalism or [[confederalism]]. However, the anarchist definition of federalism tends to differ from the definition of federalism assumed by pro-state political scientists. The following is a brief description of federalism from section I.5 of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'':\n\n:\"The social and political structure of anarchy is similar to that of the economic structure, i.e., it is based on a voluntary federation of decentralized, directly democratic policy-making bodies. These are the neighborhood and community assemblies and their confederations. In these grassroots political units, the concept of \"self-management\" becomes that of \"self-government\", a form of municipal organisation in which people take back control of their living places from the bureaucratic state and the capitalist class whose interests it serves.\n:[...]\n:The key to that change, from the anarchist standpoint, is the creation of a network of participatory communities based on self-government through direct, face-to-face democracy in grassroots neighborhood and community assemblies [meetings for discussion, debate, and decision making].\n:[...]\n:Since not all issues are local, the neighborhood and community assemblies will also elect mandated and re-callable delegates to the larger-scale units of self-government in order to address issues affecting larger areas, such as urban districts, the city or town as a whole, the county, the [[bio-region]], and ultimately the entire planet. Thus the assemblies will confederate at several levels in order to develop and co-ordinate common policies to deal with common problems.\n:[...]\n:This need for co-operation does not imply a centralized body. To exercise your autonomy by joining self-managing organisations and, therefore, agreeing to abide by the decisions you help make is not a denial of that autonomy (unlike joining a hierarchical structure, where you forsake autonomy within the organisation). In a centralized system, we must stress, power rests at the top and the role of those below is simply to obey (it matters not if those with the power are elected or not, the principle is the same). In a federal system, power is not delegated into the hands of a few (obviously a \"federal\" government or state is a centralized system). Decisions in a federal system are made at the base of the organisation and flow upwards so ensuring that power remains decentralized in the hands of all. Working together to solve common problems and organize common efforts to reach common goals is not centralization and those who confuse the two make a serious error -- they fail to understand the different relations of authority each generates and confuse obedience with co-operation.\"<ref>Anarchist Writers. \"I.5 What could the social structure of anarchy look like?\" An Anarchist FAQ. http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5</ref>\n\n==Christian Church==\n{{See also|Subsidiarity}}\nFederalism also finds expression in [[ecclesiology]] (the [[doctrine]] of the [[Christian Church|church]]).  For example, [[presbyterian church governance]] resembles [[parliament]]ary [[republicanism]] (a form of ''political federalism'') to a large extent.  In [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] denominations, the local church is ruled by elected [[Elder (religious)|elders]], some of which are [[minister of religion|ministerial]].  Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to [[Presbytery (presbyterian church)|presbyteries]] and further to a [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assembly]].  Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members.  In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself.  As in ''political federalism'', in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty.\n\nOther ecclesiologies also have significant representational and federalistic components, including the more anarchic [[Congregationalist church governance|congregational ecclesiology]], and even in more hierarchical [[Episcopalian church governance|episcopal ecclesiology]].\n\nSome Christians argue that the earliest source of political federalism (or federalism in human institutions; in contrast to [[Covenant Theology|theological federalism]]) is the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] federalism found in the [[Bible]].  They point to the structure of the early [[Christian Church]] as described (and prescribed, as believed by many) in the [[New Testament]].  In their arguments, this is particularly demonstrated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]], described in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] chapter 15, where the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Elder (religious)|elders]] gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church.  To this day, elements of federalism can be found in almost every Christian denomination, some more than others.\n\n==Constitutional structure==\n\n===Division of powers===\n\n{{distinguish|separation of powers}}\n\nIn a federation, the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the [[constitution]]. Almost every country allows some degree of regional self-government, in federations the right to self-government of the component states is constitutionally entrenched. Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit, although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence.\n\nIn almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense as [[exclusive federal powers]]. Were this not the case a federation would not be a single sovereign state, per the UN definition. Notably, the [[states of Germany]] retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]'s agreement to join the [[German Empire]] in 1871. Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another.\nThe constitutions of [[Grundgesetz|Germany]] and the [[United States Constitution|United States]] provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like [[Constitution of Canada|Canada]] and [[Constitution of India|India]], on the other hand, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility.  Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state as [[concurrent powers]] are retained by the constituent states.\n[[File:La esp Rep. Federal, Rep. Unitaria (2).JPG|thumb|Satiric depiction of late 19th century political tensions in Spain]]\nWhere every component state of a federation possesses the same powers, we are said to find 'symmetric federalism'. [[Asymmetric federalism]] exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do. This is often done in recognition of the existence of a distinct culture in a particular region or regions. In Spain, the [[History of the Basque people#Late Modern history|Basques]] and [[Catalan people|Catalans]], as well as the Galicians, spearheaded a historic movement to have their national specificity recognized, crystallizing in the \"historical communities\" such as [[Navarre]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]], and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. They have more powers than the later expanded arrangement for other Spanish regions, or [[Autonomous communities of Spain|the Spain of the autonomous communities]] (called also the \"coffee for everyone\" arrangement), partly to deal with their separate identity and to appease peripheral nationalist leanings, partly out of respect to [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|specific rights they had held]] earlier in history. However, strictly speaking Spain is not a federalism, but a decentralized administrative organization of the state.\n\nIt is common that during the historical evolution of a federation there is a gradual movement of power from the component states to the centre, as the federal government acquires additional powers, sometimes to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The acquisition of new powers by a federal government may occur through formal constitutional amendment or simply through a broadening of the interpretation of a government's existing constitutional powers given by the courts.\n\nUsually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (''munic\u00edpios'') with their own legislative council (''c\u00e2mara de vereadores'') and a mayor (''prefeito''), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a \"little constitution\", called \"organic law\" (''lei org\u00e2nica''). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (''municipio libre'', \"free municipality\") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the [[political divisions of Mexico|constituent states]]. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.\n\nFederations often employ the [[paradox]] of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of [[Sovereign state|statehood]]) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the [[United States constitution|US Constitution]]) wrote in [[Federalist No. 39|Federalist Paper No. 39]] that the US Constitution \"is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...\" This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all [[sovereignty]] that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people.\n\n===Bicameralism===\n\nThe structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states. One method, known as '[[intrastate federalism]]', is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions. Where a federation has a [[bicameral]] legislature the [[upper house]] is often used to represent the component states while the [[lower house]] represents the people of the nation as a whole. A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of [[apportionment (politics)|apportionment]], as is the case in the [[senate]]s of the United States and Australia, where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population.\n\nAlternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|German Bundesrat]] and in the [[Council of the European Union]]. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.\n\n===Intergovernmental relations===\nIn Canada, the provincial governments represent regional interests and negotiate directly with the central government. A [[First Ministers conference]] of the prime minister and the provincial premiers is the [[de facto]] highest political forum in the land, although it is not mentioned in the constitution.\n\n===Constitutional change===\nFederations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution. As well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent. An amendment to the constitution of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a ''double majority''.\n\nSome federal constitutions also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state. The US constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent. In Australia, if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states, then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states.  Any amendment to the Canadian constitution that would modify the role of the [[Monarchy in Canada|monarchy]] would require unanimous consent of the provinces.  The [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] provides that no amendment is admissible at all that would abolish the federal system.\n\n===Other technical terms===\n* [[Fiscal federalism]] \u2013 the relative financial positions and the financial relations between the levels of government in a federal system.\n* Formal federalism (or '[[constitutional federalism]]') \u2013 the delineation of powers is specified in a written constitution, which may or may not correspond to the actual operation of the system in practice.\n* [[Executive federalism]] refers in the English-speaking tradition to the intergovernmental relationships between the executive branches of the levels of government in a federal system and in the continental European tradition to the way constituent units 'execute' or administer laws made centrally.\n\n==Federalism as a political philosophy==\n\n{{Main article|Federalist}}\n\nThe meaning of ''federalism'', as a political movement, and of what constitutes a 'federalist', varies with country and historical context.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Movements associated with the establishment or development of federations can exhibit either centralising or decentralising trends.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} For example, at the time those nations were being established, factions known as \"federalists\" in the United States and Australia advocated the formation of strong central government. Similarly, in European Union politics, federalists mostly seek greater EU integration. In contrast, in Spain and in post-war Germany, federal movements have sought decentralisation: the transfer of power from central authorities to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has been a political force for several decades, the \"federalist\" impulse aims to keep Quebec inside Canada.\n\n== Federalism as a conflict reducing device ==\n\nFederalism, and other forms of territorial autonomy, is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order to prevent violence among different groups within countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level.<ref>Arend Lijphart. 1977.

Abauzit is also notable for proofreading or correcting the writings of [[Isaac Newton]] and other scholars.\n\n==Biography==\nFirmin Abauzit was born of [[Huguenot]] parents November 11, 1679 at [[Uz\u00e8s]], in [[Languedoc]].<ref name=eb>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=8}}</ref><ref name=cam>{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990|p=1}}</ref> His father died when he was but two years of age; and when, on the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, the authorities took steps to have him educated in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, his mother contrived his escape.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFor two years his brother and he lived as fugitives in the mountains of the [[C\u00e9vennes]], but they at last reached [[Geneva]], where their mother afterwards joined them on escaping from the imprisonment in which she was held from the time of their flight. Abauzit at an early age acquired great proficiency in languages, physics, and theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1698, he traveled to [[Germany]], then to [[Dutch Republic|Holland]],<ref name=cam/> where he became acquainted with [[Pierre Bayle]],<ref name=eb/> [[Pierre Jurieu]] and [[Jacques Basnage]]. Proceeding to [[England]], he was introduced to Sir [[Isaac Newton]], who found in him one of the earliest defenders, against [[Charles-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Castel de Saint-Pierre|Castel]] of his discoveries.<ref name=eb/><ref name=ww/> Newton corrected in the second edition of his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' an error pointed out by Abauzit,<ref name=ww/> and, when sending him the ''Commercium Epistolicum,'' said, \"You are well worthy to judge between [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and me.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe reputation of Abauzit induced [[William III of England|William III]] to request him to settle in [[England]], but he did not accept the king's offer, preferring to return to [[Geneva]].<ref name=ww/>\nThere, from 1715 he rendered valuable assistance to a society that had been formed for translating the [[New Testament]] into [[French language|French]]. He declined the offer of the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1723.<ref name=eb/> He assisted in the French language [[New Testament]] in 1726.<ref name=eb/> In 1727, he was granted citizenship in Geneva, and he accepted the office of honorary librarian to Geneva, the city of his adoption.<ref name=eb/> It was while he was in Geneva in his later years that he authored many of his works. Here also was the city of his death past the age of 87, on March 20, 1767.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Legacy==\nAbauzit was a man of great learning and of wonderful versatility. Whatever chanced to be discussed, it used to be said of Abauzit that he seemed to have made it a subject of particular study. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who was jealously sparing of his praises, addressed to him, in his ''[[Julie, ou la nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse]]'', a fine [[panegyric]]; and when a stranger flatteringly told [[Voltaire]] he had come to see a great man, the philosopher asked him if he had seen Abauzit.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Among his acquaintances, Abauzit claimed Rousseau, Voltaire, Newton, and Bayle.<ref name=ww>{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=1}}</ref>\n\nLittle remains of the labours of this intellectual giant, his heirs having, it is said, destroyed the papers that came into their possession, because their own religious opinions were different. A few theological, archaeological, and astronomical articles from his pen appeared in the ''Journal helv\u00e9tique'' and elsewhere, and he contributed several papers to Rousseau's ''Dictionnaire de musique'' (1767). He wrote a work throwing doubt on the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] authority of the [[Apocalypse]], which called forth a reply from Dr [[Leonard Twells]], and was published in [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]''. He also edited and made valuable additions to [[Jacob Spon]]'s ''Histoire de la r\u00e9publique de Gen\u00e8ve''. A collection of his writings was published at Geneva in 1770 (''\u0152uvres de feu M. Abauzit''), and another at [[London]] in 1773 (''\u0152uvres diverses de M. Abauzit'').\n\n===Works===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Works of Abauzit\n! year!! Title !!

'''Legionnaires''' are highly trained infantry soldiers and the Legion is unique in that it was, and continues to be, open to foreign [[Military recruitment|recruits]] willing to serve in the French Armed Forces. When it was founded, the French Foreign Legion was not unique; other [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|foreign formation]]s existed at the time in France.\n\nCommanded by [[French nationality law|French]] officers, it is open to French citizens, who amounted to 24% of the recruits in 2007.<ref>Jean-Dominique Merchet, [http://secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr/defense/2008/11/la-lgion-saccro.html La L\u00e9gion s'accroche \u00e0 ses effectifs]</ref> The Foreign Legion is today known as a unit whose training focuses on traditional military skills and on its strong ''[[Morale|esprit de corps]]'', as its men come from different countries with different cultures.

The Foreign Legion was initially stationed only in [[French Algeria|Algeria]], where it took part in the [[Pacification of Algeria|pacification]] and development of the colony. Subsequently, the Foreign Legion was deployed in a number of conflicts, including the [[First Carlist War]] in 1835, the [[Crimean War]] in 1854, the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] in 1859, the [[French intervention in Mexico]] in 1863, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, the [[Tonkin Campaign]] and [[Sino-French War]] in 1883, supporting growth of the [[French colonial empire]] in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[pacification of Algeria|pacifying Algeria]], the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] in 1892, the [[Second Madagascar expedition]] in 1895, and the [[Mandingo Wars]] in 1894.\n\nIn World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. It played a smaller role in World War II than in World War I, though having a part in the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian]], [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syrian]] and [[North African Campaign|North African]] campaigns. During the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954), the Foreign Legion saw its numbers swell. The FFL lost a large number of men in the catastrophic [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]]. During the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence]] (1954\u20131962), the Foreign Legion came close to being disbanded after some officers, men, and the highly decorated [[List of French paratrooper units|1st Foreign Parachute Regiment]] (1<sup>er</sup> REP) took part in the [[Algiers putsch of 1961|Generals' putsch]]. Operations during this period included the [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]] and various offensives launched by [[Maurice Challe|General Maurice Challe]] including Operations Oranie and [[Operation Jumelles|Jumelles]].\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Legion regiments had additional roles in sending units as a [[rapid deployment force]] to preserve French interests \u2013 in its former African colonies and in other nations as well; it also returned to its roots of being a unit always ready to be sent to conflict zones around the world. Some notable operations include: the [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict]] in 1969\u20131972 (the first time that the Legion was sent in operations after the Algerian War), 1978\u20131979, and 1983\u20131987; [[Kolwezi]] in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in May 1978. In 1981, the [[1st Foreign Regiment]] and Foreign Legion regiments partook to the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]]. In 1990, Foreign Legion regiments were sent to the [[Persian Gulf]] and took part in [[Op\u00e9ration Daguet]], part of [[Division Daguet]]. Following the [[Gulf War]] in the 1990s, the Foreign Legion helped with the evacuation of French citizens and foreigners in [[Rwanda]], Gabon and [[Zaire]]. The Foreign Legion was also deployed in [[Cambodia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the mid- to late-1990s, the Foreign Legion was deployed in the [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]] and in [[Kosovo]]. The Foreign Legion also took part in operations in Rwanda in 1990\u20131994; and the [[Ivory Coast]] in 2002 to the present. In the 2000s, the Foreign Legion was deployed in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan, [[Operation Unicorn|Operation Licorne]] in Ivory Coast, the [[EUFOR Tchad/RCA]] in Chad, and [[Operation Serval]] in the [[Northern Mali conflict]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324235104578242993426029234 |title=France Widens Military Effort in Mali |first=Drew |last=Hinshaw |author2=Gauthier-Villars, David |date=January 15, 2013| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>\n\nOther countries have tried to emulate the French Foreign Legion model.

On 28 June 1835, the unit was handed over to the Spanish government. The Foreign Legion landed via sea at [[Tarragona]] on 17 August with around 1,400 who were quickly dubbed ''Los Algerinos'' (the Algerians) by locals because of their previous posting.\n\nThe Foreign Legion's commander immediately dissolved the national battalions to improve the ''esprit de corps''. Later, he also created three squadrons of lancers and an artillery battery from the existing force to increase independence and flexibility. The Foreign Legion was dissolved on 8 December 1838, when it had dropped to only 500 men. The survivors returned to France, many reenlisting in the new Foreign Legion along with many of their former [[Carlism|Carlist]] enemies.\n\n===Crimean War===\n{{Main|Crimean War}}\n[[File:L\u00e9gion \u00c9trang\u00e8re 1852.png|thumb|upright|The ''L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' in 1852.]]\n\nOn 9 June 1854, the [[French ship Jean Bart (1852)|French ship ''Jean Bart'']] [[French Navy|embarked]] four battalions of the Foreign Legion for the [[Crimean Peninsula]].

On 21 June 1855, the Third Battalion, left Corsica for the Crimea.\n\nOn 8 September the final assault was launched on [[Sevastopol]]. Two days later, the Second Foreign Regiment with flags and band playing ahead, marched through the streets of Sevastopol.

The Foreign Legion acquitted itself particularly well against the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]] at the [[battle of Magenta]] (4 June 1859) and at the [[Battle of Solferino]] (24 June). Legion losses were significant and the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment|2nd Foreign Regiment]] lost Colonel Chabri\u00e8re, its commanding officer.

The Second and Third Infantry Battalions (''chef de bataillon'' Diguet and Lieutenant-Colonel Schoeffer) were also deployed to Tonkin shortly afterwards, and were present in all the major campaigns of the Sino-French War. Two Foreign Legion companies led the defence at the celebrated [[Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang]] (24 November 1884 to 3 March 1885). In January 1885 the Foreign Legion's 4th Battalion (''chef de bataillon'' Vitalis) was deployed to the French bridgehead at Keelung (Jilong) in Formosa (Taiwan), where it took part in the later battles of the [[Keelung Campaign]]. The battalion played an important role in Colonel [[Jacques Duchesne]]'s offensive in March 1885 that captured the key Chinese positions of La Table and Fort Bamboo and disengaged Keelung.\n\nIn December 1883, during a review of the Second Legion Battalion on the eve of its departure for Tonkin to take part in the [[B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign]], General [[Oscar de N\u00e9grier|Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier]] pronounced a famous ''mot'': ''Vous, l\u00e9gionnaires, vous \u00eates soldats pour mourir, et je vous envoie o\u00f9 l'on meurt!''

Nonetheless, Samori was forced to sign several treaties ceding territory to the French between 1886 and 1889. Samori began a steady retreat, but the fall of other resistance armies, particularly [[Babemba Traor\u00e9]] at [[Sikasso]], permitted the colonial army to launch a concentrated assault against his forces.

While many would have preferred direct enlistment in the regular French Army, the only option immediately available was that of the Foreign Legion. On one day only (3 August 1914) a reported 8,000 volunteers applied to enlist in the Paris recruiting office of the Legion.\n\nIn World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the Western Front, including [[Second Battle of Artois|Artois]], [[Second Battle of Champagne|Champagne]], [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Second Battle of the Aisne|Aisne]], and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] (in 1917), and also suffered heavy casualties during 1918. The Foreign Legion was also in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Dardanelles]] and [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]], and was highly decorated for its efforts. Many young foreigners volunteered for the Foreign Legion when the war broke out in 1914. There were marked differences between the idealistic volunteers of 1914 and the hardened men of the old Legion, making assimilation difficult. Nevertheless, the old and the new men of the Foreign Legion fought and died in vicious battles on the Western front, including [[Belloy-en-Santerre]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]], where the poet [[Alan Seeger]], after being mortally wounded by machine-gun fire, cheered on the rest of his advancing battalion.<ref>Shortly before his death, Seeger wrote, \"I have a rendez-vous with Death, at some disputed barricade. ...

The [[sapper]] traditionally sport large [[beard]]s, wear leather aprons and gloves and hold axes. The sappers were very common in European armies during the Napoleonic Era but progressively disappeared during the 19th century. The French Army, including the Legion disbanded its regimental sapper platoons in 1870. However, in 1931 one of a number of traditions restored to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Legion's founding was the reestablishment of its bearded ''Pionniers''.<ref name=\"Douglas Porch page 418\">Douglas Porch, page 418, The French Foreign Legion. A Complete History, {{ISBN|0-333-58500-3}}</ref>\n\nIn the French Army, since the 18th century, every infantry regiment included a small detachment of pioneers. In addition to undertaking road building and entrenchment work, such units were tasked with using their axes and shovels to clear obstacles under enemy fire opening the way for the rest of the infantry. The danger of such missions was recognised by allowing certain privileges, such as being authorised to wear beards.\n\nThe current pioneer platoon of the Foreign Legion is provided by the Legion depot and headquarters regiment for public ceremonies.<ref>{{cite book| author=Martin Windrow| title=Uniforms of the French Foreign Legion 1831\u20131981| year=1981| publisher=Blandford| isbn=978-0-7137-1010-6}}</ref> The unit has reintroduced the symbols of the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic]] sappers: the beard, the axe, the leather apron, the crossed-axes insignia and the leather gloves.

In comparison to the 116-step-per-minute pace of other French units, the Foreign Legion has an 88-step-per-minute marching speed. It is also referred to by Legionnaires as the \"crawl\". This can be seen at ceremonial parades and public displays attended by the Foreign Legion, particularly while parading in Paris on 14 July ([[Bastille Day Military Parade]]). Because of the impressively slow pace, the Foreign Legion is always the last unit marching in any parade. The Foreign Legion is normally accompanied by its own band, which traditionally plays the march of any one of the regiments comprising the Foreign Legion, except that of the unit actually on parade. The regimental song of each unit and \"[[Le Boudin]]\" is sung by legionnaires standing at attention. Also, because the Foreign Legion must always stay together, it does not break formation into two when approaching the presidential grandstand, as other French military units do, in order to preserve the unity of the legion.\n\n[[File:2june 2007 296.jpg|thumb|right|Because of its slower pace, the Foreign Legion is always the last unit marching in any parade (Parade in Rome, June 2007).]]\n\nContrary to popular belief, the adoption of the Foreign Legion's slow marching speed was not due to a need to preserve energy and fluids during long marches under the hot Algerian sun. Its exact origins are somewhat unclear, but the official explanation is that although the pace regulation does not seem to have been instituted before 1945, it hails back to the slow marching pace of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], and its reintroduction was a \"return to traditional roots\".<ref name=\"Le Grand Livre des Insignes de la L\u00e9gion Etrang\u00e8re\">Szecsko, p. 17</ref> This was in fact, the march step of the Foreign Legion's ancestor units \u2013 the ''R\u00e9giments \u00c9trangers'' or Foreign Regiments of the ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'' French Army, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''{{'}}s foreign units, and the pre-1831 foreign regiments.\n\n==Uniform==\n\n[[File:French Foreign Legion dsc06878.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''L\u00e9gionnaires'' in modern dress uniform.

The field uniform was often modified under the influence of the extremes of climate and terrain in which the Foreign Legion served. [[Shako]]s were soon replaced by the light cloth [[kepi]], which was far more suitable for North African conditions. The practice of wearing heavy ''capotes'' (greatcoats) on the march and ''vestes'' (short hip-length jackets) as working dress in barracks was followed by the Foreign Legion from its establishment.<ref>{{cite book| author=Martin Windrow| title=Uniforms of the French Foreign Legion 1831\u20131981| year=1981| publisher=Blandford| isbn=978-0-7137-1010-6| page=16}}</ref>\nOne short lived aberration was the wearing of green uniforms in 1856 by Foreign Legion units recruited in Switzerland for service in the [[Crimean War]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Martin Windrow| title=Uniforms of the French Foreign Legion 1831\u20131981| year=1981| publisher=Blandford| isbn=978-0-7137-1010-6| page=42}}</ref> In the Crimea itself (1854\u201359) a hooded coat and red or blue waist sashes were adopted for winter dress,<ref>{{cite book| author=Martin Windrow| title=Uniforms of the French Foreign Legion 1831\u20131981| year=1981| publisher=Blandford| isbn=978-0-7137-1010-6| page=39}}</ref> while during the Mexican Intervention (1863\u201365) straw hats or sombreros were sometimes substituted for the kepi.<ref>{{cite book| author=Martin Windrow| title=Uniforms of the French Foreign Legion 1831\u20131981| year=1981| publisher=Blandford| isbn=978-0-7137-1010-6| page=43}}</ref><ref>Pages 26-29 \"La Legion Etrangere 1831/1945, Raymond Guyader, Hors Serie No. 6 Gazette des Uniformes 1997</ref> When the latter was worn it was usually covered with a white \"havelock\" \u2013 the predecessor of the white kepi that was to become a symbol of the Foreign Legion.

The original kepi cover was khaki and due to constant washing turned white quickly. The white or khaki kepi cover was not unique to the Foreign Legion at this stage but was commonly seen amongst other French units in North Africa. It later became particularly identified with the Foreign Legion as the unit most likely to serve at remote frontier posts (other than locally recruited tirailleurs who wore [[Fez (hat)|fezzes]] or [[turban]]s). The variances of climate in North Africa led the French Army to the sensible expedient of letting local commanders decide on the appropriate \"tenue de jour\" (uniform of the day) according to circumstances. Thus a legionnaire might parade or walk out in blue tunic and white trousers in hot weather, blue tunic and red trousers in normal temperatures or wear the blue greatcoat with red trousers under colder conditions. The sash could be worn with greatcoat, blouse or veste but not with the tunic. Epaulettes were a detachable dress item worn only with tunic or greatcoat for parade or off duty wear.<ref>Pages 44-46  \"La Legion Etrangere 1831/1945, Raymond Guyader, Hors Serie No. 6 Gazette des Uniformes 1997</ref>\n\n[[File:Fflmorocco.png|thumb|A drawing showing French Foreign Legion troops in action against tribesmen in [[Morocco]] in 1908.

The Third Foreign Infantry Regiment adopted white tunics and trousers for walking-out dress during the 1930s<ref>{{cite book|first=Martin |last=Windrow|page=42|title=French Foreign Legion 1814-1945|ISBN=1-85532-761-9}}</ref>\nand all Foreign Legion officers were required to obtain full dress uniforms in the pre-war colours of black and red from 1932 to 1939.\n\nDuring World War II the Foreign Legion wore a wide range of uniform styles depending on supply sources. These ranged from the heavy capotes and [[Adrian helmet]]s of 1940 through to British battledress and American field uniforms from 1943 to 1945. The white kepi was stubbornly retained whenever possible.\n\nFrom 1940 until 1963 the Foreign Legion maintained four Saharan Companies (''Compagnies Sahariennes'') as part of the French forces used to patrol and police the desert regions to the south of Morocco and Algeria. Special uniforms were developed for these units, modeled on those of the French officered Camel Corps (''[[M\u00e9hariste]]s'') having prime responsibility for the Sahara. In full dress these included black or white zouave style trousers, worn with white tunics and long flowing cloaks. The Legion companies maintained their separate identity by retaining their distinctive kepis, sashes and fringed epaulettes.\n\nThe white kepis, together with the sash<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Galliac|page=88|title=L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise|ISBN=978-2-35250-195-4}}</ref> and epaulettes survive in the Foreign Legion's modern parade dress. Since the 1990s the modern kepi has been made wholly of white material rather than simply worn with a white cover. Officers and senior noncommissioned officers still wear their kepis in the pre-1939 colours of dark blue and red. A green tie and (for officers) a green waistcoat recall the traditional branch colour of the Foreign Legion. From 1959 a green [[beret]] (previously worn only by the legion's paratroopers) became the universal ordinary duty headdress, with the kepi reserved for parade and off duty wear.<ref>[http://lib.ru/TXT/franclegion.txt_Piece100.01 Lib.ru]</ref><ref>[http://lib.ru/TXT/franclegion.txt_Piece100.02 Lib.ru]</ref> Other items of currently worn dress are the standard issue of the French Army.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Further|Modern equipment and uniform of the French Army}}\nThe Foreign Legion is basically equipped with the same equipment as similar units elsewhere in the French Army. These include:\n* The [[FAMAS]] assault rifle, a French-made automatic [[bullpup]]-style rifle, chambered in the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round. The FAMAS is being replaced by the [[Heckler & Koch HK416]]. The 13e DBLE, a Foreign Legion Regiment, was the first unit to use the new rifle.\n* The [[SPECTRA helmet|SPECTRA]] is a [[Combat helmet|ballistic helmet]], designed by the [[French Armed Forces|French military]], fitted with real-time positioning and information system, and with light amplifiers for night vision.\n* The [[F\u00c9LIN]] suit, an infantry combat system that combines ample pouches, reinforced body protections and a portable electronic platform.\n\n== Commandement de la L\u00e9gion \u00c9trang\u00e8re Tenure (1931\u2013present) ==\n{{Main|Foreign Legion Command|1st Foreign Regiment|Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9}}\n\n=== Commandement de la L\u00e9gion \u00c9trang\u00e8re (1931\u20131984) ===\n{|\n|-\n| valign=top |\n\n==== Inspector Tenure ====\n;''Inspection de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re (I.L.E)''\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:left;

The majority of enlisted men originate from outside France, while the majority of the officer corps consists of Frenchmen. Many recruits originate from Eastern Europe and Latin America. Neil Tweedie of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said that Germany traditionally provided many recruits, \"somewhat ironically given the Legion's bloody role in two world wars.\"<ref name=\"Tweedie\"/> He added that \"Brits, too, have played their part, but there was embarrassment recently when it emerged that many British applicants were failing selection due to endemic unfitness.\"<ref name=\"Tweedie\"/>\n\n==== Alsace-Lorraine ====\n{{Main| Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9|Alsace-Lorraine|Malgr\u00e9-nous}}\n\nOriginal nationalities of the Foreign Legion reflect the events in history at the time they join.

(2008) ''Waffen SS Elite Forces 1: Leibstandarte and Das Reich'' (p. 183) {{ISBN|978-0-7858-2323-0}}.</ref> as many soldiers returning to civilian life found it hard to find reliable employment. Jean-Denis Lepage reports that \"The Foreign Legion discreetly recruited from German P.O.W. camps\",<ref>{{cite book| author=Jean-Denis G. G. Lepage| title=The French Foreign Legion: An Illustrated History| date=28 January 2008| publisher=McFarland| isbn=978-0-7864-3239-4| page=170}}</ref> but adds that the number of these recruits has been subsequently exaggerated. [[Bernard B. Fall]], who was a supporter of the French government, writing in the context of the [[First Indochina War]], questioned the notion that the Foreign Legion was mainly German at that time, calling it:\n\n<blockquote>[a] canard\u2026with the sub-variant that all those Germans were at least SS generals and other much wanted war criminals. As a rule, and in order to prevent any particular nation from making the Foreign Legion into a [[Praetorian Guard]], any particular national component is kept at about 25 percent of the total. Even supposing (and this was the case, of course) that the French recruiters, in the eagerness for candidates would sign up Germans enlisting as Swiss, Austrian, Scandinavian and other nationalities of related ethnic background, it is unlikely that the number of Germans in the Foreign Legion ever exceeded 35 percent. Thus, without making an allowance for losses, rotation, discharges, etc., the maximum number of Germans fighting in Indochina at any one time reached perhaps 7,000 out of 278,000. As to the ex-Nazis, the early arrivals contained a number of them, none of whom were known to be war criminals. French intelligence saw to that.<br>\nSince, in view of the rugged Indochinese climate, older men without previous tropical experience constituted more a liability than an asset, the average age of the Foreign Legion enlistees was about 23. At the time of the battle of Dien Bien Phu, any legionnaire of that age group was at the worst, in his \"Hitler Youth\" shorts when the [Third] Reich collapsed.<ref>{{cite book| author=Bernard B.

A proportion of the Swiss and Belgians are actually likely to be Frenchmen who wish to avoid detection.<ref>Evan McGorman, ''Life in the French Foreign Legion'', p. 21</ref> In addition many Alsatians are said to have joined the Foreign Legion when [[Alsace]] was part of the [[German Empire]], and may have been recorded as German while considering themselves French.\n\nRegarding recruitment conditions within the Foreign Legion, see the official page (in English) dedicated to the subject:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legion-recrute.com/en/condition.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122095354/http://www.legion-recrute.com/en/condition.php |archivedate=22 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |title=French Foreign Legion \u2013 Recruiting |publisher=Legion-recrute.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> With regard to age limits, recruits can be accepted from ages ranging from 17 \u00bd (with parental consent) to 39.5 years old.\n\n===Countries that allow post-Foreign Legion contract===\nIn the Commonwealth Realms, its collective provisions provide for nationals to commute between armies in training or other purposes. Moreover, this 'blanket provision' between member-states cannot exclude others for it would seem inappropriate to single out individual countries, that is, France in relation to the Legion. For example, [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand]] may allow post-Legion enlistment providing the national has commonwealth citizenship. [[British Army|Britain]] allows post-Legion enlistment. Canada allows post-Legion enlistment in its ranks with a completed five-year contract.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn the European Union framework, post Legion enlistment is less clear. Denmark, Norway, Germany and Portugal allow post-Legion enlistment while The Netherlands has constitutional articles that forbid it. [Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap, Artikel 15, lid 1e, (In Dutch:)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0003738/geldigheidsdatum_08-03-2015#Hoofdstuk5|title=Wetten.nl \u2013 Wet- en regelgeving \u2013 Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap \u2013 BWBR0003738|work=overheid.nl}}</ref>] (that is: one can lose his Dutch nationality by accepting a foreign nationality or can lose his Dutch nationality by serving in the army of a foreign state that is engaged in a conflict against the Dutch Kingdom or one of its allies<ref>[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/nederlandse-nationaliteit/verliezen-nederlandse-nationaliteit Rijksoverheid.nl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824224415/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/nederlandse-nationaliteit/verliezen-nederlandse-nationaliteit |date=24 August 2014 }}</ref>). The European Union twin threads seem to be recognized dual nationality status or restricting constitutional article.\n\nThe United States allows post-FFL enlistment in its [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and career soldiers, up to the rank of captain only and to [[Permanent residence (United States)|Green Card]] holders.\n\nIsrael allows post-Legion enlistment.\n\nOne of the biggest national groups in the Legion are [[Poland|Poles]]. Polish law basically allows service in a foreign army, but only after written permission from the Ministry of National Defense.\n\n==Emulation by other countries==\n\n===Chinese Ever Victorious Army===\nThe [[Ever Victorious Army]] was the name given to a Chinese imperial army in the late 19th century. The new force originally comprised about 200 mostly European mercenaries, recruited in the Shanghai area from sailors, deserters and adventurers. Many were dismissed in the summer of 1861, but the remainder became the officers of the Chinese soldiers recruited mainly in and around Sungkiang (Songjiang). The Chinese troops were increased to 3,000 by May 1862, all equipped with Western firearms and equipment by the British authorities in Shanghai. Throughout its four-year existence the Ever Victorious Army was mainly to operate within a thirty-mile radius of Shanghai. It was disbanded in May 1864 with 104 foreign officers and 2,288 Chinese soldiers being paid off. The bulk of the artillery and some infantry transferred to the Chinese Imperial forces. It was the first Chinese army trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy.\n\n===Israeli Mahal===\nIn Israel, [[Mahal (Israel)|Mahal]] ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05d7\"\u05dc}}, an acronym for ''Mitnadvei \u1e24utz LaAretz'', which means ''Volunteers from outside the Land [of Israel]'') is a term designating non-Israelis serving in the Israeli military. The term originates with the approximately 4,000 both Jewish and non-Jewish volunteers who went to [[Israel]] to fight in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] including [[Aliyah Bet]].<ref>Benny Morris, ''1948'', 2008, p.85.</ref> The original Mahalniks were mostly World War II [[veteran]]s from [[United States Armed Forces|American]] and [[British Armed Forces|British armed forces]].\n\nToday, there is a program, [[Garin Tzabar]], within the Israeli Ministry of Defense that administers the enlistment of non-Israeli citizens in the country's armed forces. Programs enable foreigners to join the [[Israel Defense Forces]] if they are of Jewish descent (which is defined as at least one grandparent).\n\n===Netherlands KNIL Army===\nThough not named \"Foreign Legion\", the Dutch [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Koninklijk Nederlandsch-Indische Leger (KNIL)]], or Royal Netherlands-Indian Army (in reference to the [[Dutch East Indies]], now [[Indonesia]]), was created in 1830, a year before the French Foreign Legion, and is therefore not an emulation but an entirely original idea and had a similar recruitment policy. It stopped being an army of foreigners around 1900 when recruitment was restricted to Dutch citizens and to the indigenous peoples of the Dutch East Indies. The KNIL was finally disbanded on 26 July 1950, seven months after the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesia as a sovereign state, and almost five years after Indonesia declared its independence.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Rhodesian Light Infantry and 7 Independent Company===\n{{see also|Rhodesian Light Infantry|7 Independent Company (Rhodesia)}}\nDuring the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] enlisted volunteers from overseas on the same pay and conditions of service as locally based regulars.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rhodesian War: A Military History|last1=Moorcraft|first1=Paul L.|authorlink1=Paul Moorcraft|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Peter|authorlink2=Peter McLaughlin|date=April 2008|origyear=1982|location=Barnsley|publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]]|isbn=978-1-84415-694-8|page=52}}</ref> The vast majority of the Rhodesian Army's foreigners joined the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI), a heliborne commando regiment with a glamorous international reputation;<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern African Wars: Rhodesia, 1965\u201380|last1=Abbott|first1=Peter|last2=Botham|first2=Philip|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|date=June 1986|isbn=978-0-85045-728-5|page=17}}</ref> this unit became colloquially known as the \"Rhodesian foreign legion\" as a result, even though foreigners never made up more than about a third of its men.

According to [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the ''principles'' of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of ''circularity of action'', which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more ''practical'' aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection.\n{{Quote|[Practical experimenters] object to the mathematician's definition, pointing out that this would force them to say that feedback was present in the ordinary pendulum ... between its position and its momentum\u2014a \"feedback\" that, from the practical point of view, is somewhat mystical.

The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a [[speedometer]].  The error signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.\n\nThe terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" were first applied to feedback prior to WWII. The idea of positive feedback was already current in the 1920s with the introduction of the [[regenerative circuit]].<ref name=mindell>\n{{Cite book\n|author=David A.

According to Black:\n\n{{Quote|Positive feed-back increases the gain of the amplifier, negative feed-back reduces it.<ref name=black>\nH.S. Black, \"Stabilized feed-back amplifiers\", ''Electrical Engineering'', vol. 53, pp.&nbsp;114\u2013120, January 1934.</ref>}}\nAccording to Mindell (2002) confusion in the terms arose shortly after this:\n{{Quote|...Friis and Jensen had made the same distinction Black used between \"positive feed-back\" and \"negative feed-back\", based not on the sign of the feedback itself but rather on its effect on the amplifier's gain. In contrast, Nyquist and Bode, when they built on Black's work, referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed. Black had trouble convincing others of the utility of his invention in part because confusion existed over basic matters of definition.<ref name=mindell/>{{rp|page=121}}}}\n\nEven prior to the terms being applied, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] had described several kinds of \"component motions\" associated with the [[centrifugal governor]]s used in steam engines, distinguishing between those that lead to a continual ''increase'' in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation, and those that lead to a ''decrease'' of the same.<ref name=maxwell>\n{{cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|title=On Governors|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:On_Governors.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume= 16|year= 1868 |pages= 270\u2013283|doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055}}</ref>\n\n====Terminology====\nThe terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines.\n\n# the altering of the ''gap'' between reference and actual values of a parameter, based on whether the gap is ''widening'' (positive) or ''narrowing'' (negative).<ref name=\"Ramaprasad\" />\n# the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of the ''action'' or ''effect'' that alters the gap, based on whether it has a ''happy'' (positive) or ''unhappy'' (negative) emotional connotation to the recipient or observer.<ref name=herold1977>Herold, David M., and Martin M.

As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it:\n{{Quote|''Quantitative'' feedback tells us how much and how many. ''Qualitative'' feedback tells us how good, bad or indifferent.<ref name=Connellan>Thomas K.

For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it.\n\n==Applications==\n===Dynamical systems===\n{{Main|Dynamical system|Chaos theory|Edge of chaos|Control theory}}\nBy using feedback properties, the behavior of a system can be altered to meet the needs of an application; systems can be made stable, responsive or held constant. It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the [[edge of chaos]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wotherspoon|first1=T.|last2=Hubler|first2=A.|title=Adaptation to the edge of chaos with random-wavelet feedback|journal=J.

The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is [[insulin oscillation]]s.\n\nBiological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and negative. As in other contexts, ''positive'' and ''negative'' do not imply that the feedback causes ''good'' or ''bad'' effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it. The [[mirror neuron]]s are part of a social feedback system, when an observed action is \"mirrored\" by the brain\u2014like a self-performed action.\n\nNormal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators; failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vlahopoulos|first1=SA|last2=Cen|first2=O|last3=Hengen|first3=N|last4=Agan|first4=J|last5=Moschovi|first5=M|last6=Critselis|first6=E|last7=Adamaki|first7=M|last8=Bacopoulou|first8=F|last9=Copland|first9=JA|last10=Boldogh|first10=I|last11=Karin|first11=M|last12=Chrousos|first12=GP|title=Dynamic aberrant NF-\u03baB spurs tumorigenesis: A new model encompassing the microenvironment.|journal=Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews|date=20 June 2015|pmid=26119834|doi=10.1016/j.cytogfr.2015.06.001|volume=26|pages=389\u2013403|pmc=4526340}}</ref>\nIn an injured or infected tissue, inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells, which alter gene expression, and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted, including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function.

In 1745, the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee, who added a [[windmill fantail|fantail]] to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In 1787, [[Thomas Mead]] regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a [[conical pendulum|centrifugal pendulum]] to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e., to adjust the load).\n\nThe use of the [[centrifugal governor]] by [[James Watt]] in 1788 to regulate the speed of his [[steam engine]] was one factor leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Steam engines also use float valves and [[relief valve|pressure release valves]] as mechanical regulation devices.

Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the [[BIBO stability|stability]] and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes.  This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it.  When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in overcorrection, causing the output to [[oscillation|oscillate]] or \"hunt\".<ref>With mechanical devices, hunting can be severe enough to destroy the device.</ref> While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators.\n\n[[Harry Nyquist]] at [[Bell Labs]] derived the [[Nyquist stability criterion]] for determining the stability of feedback systems. An easier method, but less general, is to use [[Bode plot]]s developed by [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Hendrik Bode]] to determine the [[Gain margin|gain margin and phase margin]]. Design to ensure stability often involves [[frequency compensation]] to control the location of the [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s of the amplifier.\n\nElectronic feedback loops are used to control the output of [[electronics|electronic]] devices, such as [[amplifiers]]. A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating ''open loop'' if no output feedback is being employed and ''closed loop'' if feedback is being used.<ref>P. Horowitz & W. Hill, ''The Art of Electronics'', Cambridge University Press (1980), Chapter 3, relating to operational amplifiers.</ref>\n\nWhen two or more amplifiers are cross-coupled using positive feedback, complex behaviors can be created. These ''[[multivibrator]]s'' are widely used and include:\n\n* astable circuits, which act as oscillators\n* monostable circuits, which can be pushed into a state, and will return to the stable state after some time\n* bistable circuits, which have two stable states that the circuit can be switched between\n\n====Negative feedback====\nA Negative feedback occurs when the fed-back output signal has a relative phase of 180\u00b0 with respect to the input signal (upside down). This situation is sometimes referred to as being ''out of phase'', but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations, as in \"90\u00b0 out of phase\". Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations.<ref name=Bhattacharya>\nFor an analysis of desensitization in the system pictured, see {{cite book |author=S.K Bhattacharya |title=Linear Control Systems |pages=134\u2013135 |quote=The parameters of a system ... may vary...

A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the [[asymptotic gain model]].\n\n====Positive feedback====\nPositive feedback occurs when the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device [[oscillates]] between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce [[hysteresis]] into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make [[Flip-flop (electronics)|bistable]] circuits for volatile storage of information.\n\nThe loud squeals that sometimes occurs in [[audio system]]s, [[public address system|PA systems]], and [[rock music]] are known as [[audio feedback]]. If a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker that it is connected to, sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the speaker, and is picked up by the microphone and re-amplified.  If the [[loop gain]] is sufficient, howling or squealing at the maximum power of the amplifier is possible.\n\n====Oscillator====\n[[File:OpAmpHystereticOscillator.svg|thumb|A popular [[Relaxation oscillator#Comparator\u2013based electronic relaxation oscillator|op-amp relaxation oscillator]].]]\nAn [[electronic oscillator]] is an [[electronic circuit]] that produces a periodic, [[oscillation|oscillating]] electronic signal, often a [[sine wave]] or a [[square wave]].<ref name=\"Snelgrove\">{{cite web\n  | last = Snelgrove\n  | first = Martin\n  | title = Oscillator\n  | work = McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 10th Ed., Science Access online service\n  | publisher = McGraw-Hill\n  | year = 2011\n  | url = http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=477900&referURL=http%3a%2f%2faccessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d477900\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 1 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Chattopadhyay\n  | first = D. \n  | title = Electronics (fundamentals And Applications)\n  | publisher = New Age International\n  | year = 2006\n  | location = \n  | pages = 224\u2013225\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n0rf9_2ckeYC&pg=PA224&dq=%22negative+resistance%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jc95T-2gCqaviQLzzqmnDg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBDh4#v=onepage&q=%22negative%20resistance%22&f=false\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 81-224-1780-9}}</ref>  Oscillators convert [[direct current]] (DC) from a power supply to an [[alternating current]] signal.

They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in [[sequential logic]]. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of [[digital electronics]] systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.\n\nLatches and flip-flops are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can be used for storage of ''[[state (computer science)|state]]'', and such a circuit is described as [[sequential logic]]. When used in a [[finite-state machine]], the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.\n\nFlip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or [[clock signal|clock]]ed (synchronous or edge-triggered).  Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term ''flip-flop'' exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called ''latches''.<ref name=\"pedroni\">\n{{cite book| author = Volnei A.

In vertical text, ''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|tategaki]]'', the furigana is placed to the right of the line of text; in horizontal text, ''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|yokogaki]]'', it is placed above the line of text, as illustrated below.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-3}}\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em\" |{{lang|ja|\u304b<br>\u3093}}\n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u5b57}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em\" |{{lang|ja|\u3058}}\n|}\n{{col-3|align=center|valign=middle}}\nor\n{{col-3}}\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center\" | {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3093}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center\" |{{lang|ja|\u3058}}\n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" |{{lang|ja|\u5b57}}\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThese examples spell the word ''kanji'', which is made up of two kanji characters: {{lang|ja|\u6f22}} (''kan'', written in hiragana as {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3093}}), and {{lang|ja|\u5b57}} (''ji'', written in hiragana as {{lang|ja|\u3058}}).\n\n==Appearance==\nFurigana may be added by character, in which case the furigana characters that correspond to a kanji are centered over that kanji; or by word or phrase, in which case the entire furigana word is centered over several kanji characters, even if the kanji do not represent equal shares of the kana needed to write them. The latter method is more common, especially since some words in Japanese have unique pronunciations (''[[jukujikun]]'') that are not related to readings of any of the characters the word is written with.\n\nFurigana fonts are generally sized so that two kana characters fit naturally over one kanji; when more kana are required, this is resolved either by adjusting the furigana by using a [[condensed font]] (narrowing the kana), or by adjusting the kanji by [[intercharacter spacing]] (adding spaces around the kanji). In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading\u2014for example {{lang|ja|\u301c\u306b\u643a\u308f\u308b}} (where {{lang|ja|\u643a}} reads {{lang|ja|\u305f\u305a\u3055}}, ''tazusa'')\u2014the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing. Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to ''[[y\u014don]]'' with a long vowel, such as {{Nihongo||\u308a\u3087\u3046|ry\u014d}}; five kana are required for {{Nihongo||\u5fd7\u3001\u3053\u3053\u308d\u3056\u3057|kokorozashi}} and {{Nihongo||\u627f\u308b\u3001\u3046\u3051\u305f\u307e\u308f\u308b|uketamawaru}}, the longest of any character in the [[Joyo kanji]]. Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a ''[[gairaigo]]'' reading; the word \"centimeter\" is generally written as \"cm\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space) and has the seven-kana reading {{lang|ja|\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb}} (''senchim\u0113toru'') (it can also be written as the kanji {{lang|ja|\u7cce}}, though this is very rare); another common example is \"%\" (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading {{lang|ja|\u30d1\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8}} (''p\u0101sento''). These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units (hence closely associated to the preceding figure).\n\nWhen it is necessary to distinguish between native Japanese ''[[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun'yomi]]'' and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-derived ''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'' pronunciations, for example in [[Japanese dictionary|kanji dictionaries]], the Japanese pronunciations are written in [[hiragana]], and the Chinese pronunciations are written in [[katakana]]. However, this distinction is really only important in dictionaries and other reference works. In ordinary prose, the script chosen will usually be [[hiragana]]. The one general exception to this is ''modern'' Chinese place names, personal names, and (occasionally) food names\u2014these will often be written with kanji, and katakana used for the furigana; in more casual writing these are simply written in katakana, as borrowed words. Occasionally this style is also used for loanwords from other languages (especially English). For example, the kanji {{lang|ja|\u4e00\u89d2\u7363}} (literally \"one horn beast\") might be glossed with katakana {{lang|ja|\u30e6\u30cb\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3}}, ''yunik\u014dn'', to show the pronunciation of the loanword \"unicorn\", which is unrelated to the normal reading of the kanji. Generally, though, such loanwords are just written in straight katakana.\n\nThe distinction between regular kana and the smaller character forms, which are used in regular orthography to mark such things as [[gemination]] and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], is often not made in furigana: for example, the usual [[hiragana]] spelling of the word {{lang|ja|\u5374\u4e0b}} (''kyakka'') is {{lang|ja|\u304d\u3083\u3063\u304b}}, but in furigana it might be written {{lang|ja|\u304d\u3084\u3064\u304b}}. This was especially common in old-fashioned [[printing press|movable type]] printing when smaller fonts were not available. Nowadays, with computer-based printing systems, this occurs less frequently.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:JR Namba entrance.jpg|thumb|300px|On this sign, furigana indicate the pronunciation of the Latin letters \"[[JR Group|JR]]\" and the [[kanji]] for \"[[JR Namba Station|Namba]]\"]]\nFurigana are most commonly used in works for children, who may not have sufficiently advanced reading skills to recognize the kanji, but can understand the word when written phonetically in [[hiragana]]. Because children learn hiragana before [[katakana]], in books for very young children, there are hiragana furigana next to the katakana characters. It is common to use furigana on all kanji characters in works for young children. This is called {{nihongo|''s\u014drubi''|[[wikt:\u7dcf\u30eb\u30d3|\u7dcf\u30eb\u30d3]]}} in Japanese.\n\nNumeric characters used for counting (e.g. {{lang|ja|\u4e8c{{ruby-ja|\u672c|\u307b\u3093}}/\uff12{{ruby-ja|\u672c|\u307b\u3093}}}} ''ni-hon'' \"two long things\"; {{lang|ja|\uff12\u3064\u3081}} ''futatsume'' \"second\"; {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u7b2c|\u3060\u3044}}\u4e8c{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u307e\u304d}}/{{ruby-ja|\u7b2c|\u3060\u3044}}\uff12{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u307e\u304d}}}} ''dai-ni maki'' \"chapter 2\"; {{lang|ja|\uff12\u30da\u30fc\u30b8}} ''ni-p\u0113ji'' \"page 2\"; etc.) are usually not tagged with furigana. Numeric words in established compounds (e.g. {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00|\u3044\u3063}}{{ruby-ja|\u6b69|\u307d}}}} ''ippo'' \"step\"), however, may be.\n\nMany [[Children's anime and manga|children's]], [[sh\u014dnen]] and [[sh\u014djo manga]] use furigana (however, rarely on [[Japanese numerals|numerals]]). Sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga tend to have furigana for all non-numeric characters, while children's manga, such as ''[[Doraemon]]'', may also ignore furigana on elementary-grade kanji. [[Seinen]] and [[josei manga]] ignores furigana most of the time, even on the names of the characters if they're common names. There are also books with a phonetic guide (mainly in [[hiragana]] but sometimes in [[r\u014dmaji]]) for Japanese learners, which may be bilingual or Japanese only. These are popular with foreigners wishing to master Japanese faster and enjoy reading Japanese short stories, novels or articles.\n\nFurigana unrelated to the kanji they are assigned to are quite often used to convey certain effects, rather than to denote a phonetic guide, especially in manga, anime and games<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.japanesewithanime.com/2016/11/furigana-meaning.html|title=Furigana - What Is It?|work=Japanese with Anime|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref> (card games, board games and video games all included). The specific types of effects vary: furigana could be used to visually reinforce complex ideas without having to use long expressions; to annotate strange, foreign, rarely seen text; or simply for shorthand. For example, the word {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u60aa\u5922|{{ruby-ja|\u60aa|\u3057\u3093}}{{ruby-ja|\u5922|\u3058\u3064}}]]}} \"nightmare\" may be assigned with {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u771f\u5b9f|\u3057\u3093\u3058\u3064]]}} ''shinjitsu'' \"truth\" rather than its true reading, {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3042\u304f\u3080|\u3042\u304f\u3080]]}} ''akumu'', to convey the meaning of \"nightmarish truth\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Aoyama|first=Gosho|author-link=Gosho Aoyama|date=March 15, 2007|title=[[Magic Kaito]]|chapter=<span lang=\"ja\">\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u306e{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u307e\u304d}}\u3010{{ruby-ja|\u5f8c|\u3053\u3046}}{{ruby-ja|\u7de8|\u3078\u3093}}\u3011</span>|trans-chapter=Dark Knight [Last Chapter]|volume=4}}</ref> Some authors may even use furigana that means the opposite of what the base text does to reinforce an effect, such as the complicated relationship between characters.

Furigana also appear often on maps to show the pronunciation of unusual place names.\n\nBefore the war, youths might arguably have been almost illiterate if not for furigana.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Defrancis|first1=John|title=The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|accessdate=15 January 2015|location=Honolulu|page=216|date=1986}}</ref>\n\n===Names===\n[[Japanese name]]s are usually written in [[kanji]]. Because there are many possible readings for kanji names, including special name-only readings called [[nanori]], furigana are often used to give the readings of names. On Japanese official forms, where the name is to be written, there is  always an adjacent column for the name to be written in furigana. Usually katakana is preferred.\n\nFurigana may also be used for foreign names written in kanji. Chinese and Korean names are the most common examples: Chinese names are usually pronounced with Japanese readings and the pronunciation written in hiragana, while Korean names are usually pronounced with Korean readings and the pronunciation written in katakana. Furigana may also be necessary in the rare case where names are transliterated into kanji from other languages (e.g. soccer star [[Ruy Ramos]] and politician [[Marutei Tsurunen]].)\n\n===Language learning===\nKanji and kanji compounds are often presented with furigana in Japanese language textbooks for non-native speakers.\n\nFurigana are also often used in foreign language textbooks for Japanese learners to indicate pronunciation. The words are written in the original foreign script, such as [[hangul]] for [[Korean language|Korean]], and furigana is used to indicate the pronunciation. According to Ministry of Education guidelines, and the opinions of educators, the use of Japanese furigana should be avoided in English teaching due to the differences in pronunciation between English and Japanese. For instance, the word \"birthdate\" might be glossed in furigana as {{lang|ja|\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30a4\u30c8}} (''b\u0101sudeito''), which corresponds to an imperfect pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gifu-net.ed.jp/kyoka/eigo/CommunicativeEnglish/05-11cSpeaking.htm |title=Speaking/Pronunciation |author=Lena Ginsburg |date=July 2005|publisher=Gifu Prefectural Board of Education |accessdate=3 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://genkienglish.net/katakana.htm |title=No Katakana!! |author=Richard Graham|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Punning and double meaning===\nSome writers use furigana to represent slang pronunciations, particularly those that would become hard to understand without the kanji to provide their meaning.\n\nAnother use is to write the kanji for something which had been previously referenced, but write furigana for {{transl|ja|''sore''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u305d\u308c|\u305d\u308c]]}}) or {{transl|ja|''are''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3042\u308c|\u3042\u308c]]}}), meaning \"that\". This means that the actual word used was \"that\", but the kanji clarify for the reader what \"that\" refers to.\n\nIn [[karaoke]] it is extremely common for furigana to be placed on the song lyrics. The song lyrics are often written in kanji pronounced quite differently from the furigana. The furigana version is used for pronunciation.\n\nAlso, because the kanji represent meaning while the furigana represent sound, one can combine the two to create [[pun]]s or indicate meanings of foreign words. One might write the kanji for \"blue\", but use katakana to write the pronunciation of the English word \"blue\"; this may be done, for example, in Japanese subtitles on foreign films, where it can help associate the written Japanese with the sounds actually being spoken by the actors, or it may be used in a translation of a work of fiction to enable the translator to preserve the original sound of a proper name (such as \"Firebolt\" in the [[Harry Potter]] series) in furigana, while simultaneously indicating its meaning with kanji. A similar practice is used in native fiction to clarify extended meanings. For example, in a work of science fiction, some astronaut could use the word {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068|\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068]]}}, ''furusato'', meaning \"my hometown\", when referring to planet Earth. To clarify that for the reader, the word ''furusato'' (hometown) might be written in hiragana over the kanji for ''chikyuu'' (Earth).\n\n==Other Japanese reading aids==\n===Okurigana===\n{{Main|Okurigana}}\nOkurigana are kana that appear inline at normal size following kanji stems, typically to complete and to inflect adjectives and verbs. In this use they may also help to disambiguate kanji with multiple readings; for example, {{lang|ja|\u4e0a\u304c\u308b}} ({{lang|ja|\u3042\u304c\u308b}}, ''agaru'') vs. {{lang|ja|\u4e0a\u308b}} ({{lang|ja|\u306e\u307c\u308b}}, ''noboru''). Unlike furigana, the use of okurigana is a mandatory part of the written language.\n\n===Kunten===\n\nIn the written style known as ''[[kanbun]]'', which is the Japanese approximation of [[Classical Chinese]], small marks called ''[[kunten]]'' are sometimes added as reading aids. Unlike furigana, which indicate pronunciation, ''kunten'' indicate Japanese grammatical structures absent from the ''kanbun'', as well as showing how words should be reordered to fit Japanese sentence structure.\n\n===Furikanji===\n\nFurigana are sometimes also used to indicate meaning, rather than pronunciation. Over the foreign text, smaller sized Japanese words, in kana or kanji, corresponding to the ''meaning'' of the foreign words, effectively translate it in place. While rare now, some late 19th\u2013early 20th century authors used kanji as furigana for [[loanword]]s written in katakana.

12 February 1768&nbsp;\u2013 2 March 1835) was the last [[Holy Roman Emperor]], ruling from 1792 until 6 August 1806, when he dissolved the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] after the decisive defeat at the hands of the [[First French Empire]] led by [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. In 1804, he had founded the [[Austrian Empire]] and became '''Francis I''', the first [[Emperor of Austria]], ruling from 1804 to 1835, so later he was named the one and only ''Doppelkaiser'' (double emperor) in history.<ref>{{harvnb|Posse|1909\u201313|pp=256ff}}</ref>\nFor the two years between 1804 and 1806, Francis used the title and style ''by the Grace of God elected Roman Emperor, ever Augustus, hereditary Emperor of Austria'' and he was called the ''Emperor of both the Holy Roman Empire and Austria''. He was also [[King of Hungary|Apostolic King of Hungary]] and [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]] as Francis I. He also served as the first president of the [[German Confederation]] following its establishment in 1815.\n\nFrancis II continued his leading role as an opponent of Napoleonic France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and suffered several more defeats after Austerlitz. The proxy marriage of state of his daughter [[Marie Louise of Austria]] to Napoleon on 10 March 1810 was arguably his severest personal defeat. After the abdication of Napoleon following the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Austria participated as a leading member of the [[Holy Alliance]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]], which was largely dominated by Francis's chancellor [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich]] culminating in a new European map and the restoration of Francis's ancient dominions (except the Holy Roman Empire which was dissolved). Due to the establishment of the [[Concert of Europe]], which largely resisted popular [[nationalism|nationalist]] and liberal tendencies, Francis became viewed as a [[reactionary]] later in his reign.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Archduke Franz Joseph Karl (1770).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Archduke Francis at the age of 2, 1770. by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]]]\nFrancis was a son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]] (1747\u20131792) and his wife [[Maria Luisa of Spain]] (1745\u20131792), daughter of [[Charles III of Spain]]. Francis was born in [[Florence]], the capital of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], where his father reigned as [[Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke]] from 1765\u201390.  Though he had a happy childhood surrounded by his many siblings,<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=233}}</ref> his family knew Francis was likely to be a future Emperor (his uncle [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph]] had no surviving issue from either of his two marriages), and so in 1784 the young Archduke was sent to the Imperial Court in [[Vienna]] to educate and prepare him for his future role.<ref name=wheatcroft234>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=234}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] himself took charge of Francis's development.  His disciplinarian regime was a stark contrast to the indulgent Florentine Court of Leopold.  The Emperor wrote that Francis was \"stunted in growth\", \"backward in bodily dexterity and deportment\", and \"neither more nor less than a spoiled mother's child\".  Joseph concluded that \"the manner in which he was treated for upwards of sixteen years could not but have confirmed him in the delusion that the preservation of his own person was the only thing of importance\".<ref name=wheatcroft234/>\n\nJoseph's [[martinet]] method of improving the young Francis were \"fear and unpleasantness\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=235}}</ref>  The young Archduke was isolated, the reasoning being that this would make him more self-sufficient as it was felt by Joseph that Francis \"failed to lead himself, to do his own thinking\".  Nonetheless, Francis greatly admired his uncle, if rather feared him. To complete his training, Francis was sent to join an army regiment in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] and he settled easily into the routine of military life.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=236}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Joseph II in 1790, Francis's father became Emperor. He had an early taste of power while acting as Leopold's deputy in Vienna while the incoming Emperor traversed the Empire attempting to win back those alienated by his brother's policies.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=238}}</ref> The strain tolled on Leopold and by the winter of 1791, he became ill.  He gradually worsened throughout early 1792; on the afternoon of 1 March Leopold died, at the relatively young age of 44. Francis, just past his 24th birthday, was now Emperor, much sooner than he had expected.\n\n== Emperor ==\n[[File:Ludwig Streitenfeld 001.jpg|thumb|left|95px|upright|Francis II \u2014 the last Holy Roman Emperor, by Ludwig Streitenfel]]\nAs the leader of the large multi-ethnic [[Habsburg Empire]], Francis felt threatened by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] social and political reforms, which were being exported throughout Europe with the expansion of the first French Empire. Francis had a fraught relationship with France. His aunt [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], the wife of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and Queen consort of France, was guillotined by the revolutionaries in 1793, at the beginning of his reign.  Francis, on the whole, was indifferent to her fate (she was not close to his father, Leopold, and although Francis had met her, he had been too young at the time to have any memory of his aunt). [[Georges Danton]] attempted to negotiate with the Emperor for Marie Antoinette's release, but Francis was unwilling to make any concessions in return.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|2002|p=492}}</ref>\n\nLater, he led Austria into the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. He briefly commanded the Allied forces during the [[Flanders Campaign]] of 1794 before handing over command to his brother [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]]. He was later defeated by Napoleon. By the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], he ceded the left bank of the [[Rhine]] to [[First French Republic|France]] in exchange for [[Domini di Terraferma|Venice]] and [[Venetian Dalmatia|Dalmatia]]. He again fought against France during the [[War of the Second Coalition|Second]] and [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]], when after meeting a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], he had to agree to the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], weakening the [[Austrian Empire]] and reorganizing [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] under a Napoleonic imprint that would be called the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. \n[[File:P\u00f6rtr\u00e4t Kaiser Franz I von \u00d6sterreich.jpg|thumb||upright|Francis I as Austrian [[Austrian Emperor|Emperor]], ''undated'', [[Salzburg Museum]].]]\nAt this point, he believed his position as Holy Roman Emperor to be untenable, so on 6 August 1806, he abdicated the throne, declaring the empire to be already dissolved in the same declaration. This was a political move to impair the legitimacy of the Confederation of the Rhine.<ref name=\"Wilson2016\">{{cite book|author=Peter H.

Two years earlier, as a reaction to Napoleon making himself an emperor, he had raised Austria to the status of an empire.  Hence, after 1806, he reigned as Francis I, Emperor of Austria.<ref name=\"Reich1905\">{{harvnb|Reich|1905|p=622}}</ref>\n\nIn 1809, Francis [[War of the Fifth Coalition|attacked]] France again, hoping to take advantage of the [[Peninsular War]] embroiling Napoleon in [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spain]]. He was again defeated, and this time forced to ally himself with Napoleon, ceding territory to the Empire, joining the [[Continental System]], and wedding his daughter [[Marie Louise of Austria|Marie-Louise]] to the Emperor. The [[Napoleonic wars]] drastically weakened Austria, making it entirely landlocked and threatened its preeminence among the states of Germany, a position that it would eventually cede to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].\n\nIn 1813, for the fourth and final time, Austria turned against France and joined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Prussia and Sweden in their [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against Napoleon]]. Austria played a major role in the final defeat of France\u2014in recognition of this, Francis, represented by [[Clemens von Metternich]], presided over the [[Congress of Vienna]], helping to form the [[Concert of Europe]] and the [[Holy Alliance]], ushering in an era of [[conservatism]] in Europe. The [[German Confederation]], a loose association of [[Central Europe]]an states was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to organize the surviving states of the Holy Roman Empire.  The Congress was a personal triumph for Francis, who hosted the assorted dignitaries in comfort,<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=249}}</ref> though Francis undermined his allies [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] by negotiating a secret treaty with the restored French king [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=250}}</ref>\n\n== Domestic policy ==\n[[File:Basel, Switzerland, Napoleonic Wars Medal of Francis II by P.

Treu (better version).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Medallion]] of Francis I, the first Emperor of Austria, designed by [[:de:Philipp Jakob Treu|Philipp Jakob Treu]] in [[Basel]], [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Switzerland]] on 13 January [[1814]]. This was the date in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] when the allied monarchs of Russia, Austria and Prussia crossed the Rhine at Basel on their way to fight Napoleon in France.]]\nThe violent events of the French Revolution impressed themselves deeply into the mind of Francis (as well as all other European monarchs), and he came to distrust radicalism in any form.  In 1794, a \"[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]\" conspiracy was discovered in the Austrian and Hungarian armies.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=239}}</ref>  The leaders were put on trial, but the verdicts only skirted the perimeter of the conspiracy.  Francis's brother [[Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria|Alexander Leopold]] (at that time [[Palatine of Hungary]]) wrote to the Emperor admitting \"Although we have caught a lot of the culprits, we have not really got to the bottom of this business yet.\"  Nonetheless, two officers heavily implicated in the conspiracy were [[hanging|hanged]] and [[gibbet]]ed, while numerous others were sentenced to imprisonment (many of whom died from the conditions).<ref name=wheatcroft240>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=240}}</ref>\n\nFrancis was from his experiences suspicious and set up an extensive network of police spies and censors to monitor dissent<ref name=wheatcroft240/> (in this he was following his father's lead, as the Grand Duchy of Tuscany had the most effective secret police in Europe).<ref name=wheatcroft234/>  Even his family did not escape attention.  His brothers, the Archdukes [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Charles]] and [[Archduke Johann of Austria|Johann]] had their meetings and activities spied upon.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=248}}</ref>  Censorship was also prevalent.  The author [[Franz Grillparzer]], a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a \"precautionary\" measure.  When Grillparzer met the censor responsible, he asked him what was objectionable about the work.  The censor replied, \"Oh, nothing at all.  But I thought to myself, 'One can never tell'.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=241}}</ref>\n[[File:Kaiser Franz I von \u00d6sterreich in Feldmarschallsuniform c1820.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Emperor Francis I of Austria in [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]]'s uniform, decorated with the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Order of the House of Austria]], ''c.''1820.]]\nIn military affairs Francis had allowed his brother, the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], extensive control over the army during the Napoleonic wars.  Yet, distrustful of allowing any individual too much power, he otherwise maintained the separation of command functions between the [[Hofkriegsrat]] and his field commanders.<ref>{{harvnb|Rothenburg|1976|p= 6}}</ref> In the later years of his reign he limited military spending, requiring it not exceed forty million [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|florins]] per year; because of [[inflation]] this resulted in inadequate funding, with the army's share of the budget shrinking from half in 1817 to only twenty-three percent in 1830.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=10}}\n\nFrancis presented himself as an open and approachable monarch (he regularly set aside two mornings each week to meet his imperial subjects, regardless of status, by appointment in his office, even speaking to them in their own language),<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=245}}</ref> but his will was sovereign.  In 1804, he had no compunction about announcing that through his authority as Holy Roman Emperor, he declared he was now Emperor of Austria (at the time a geographical term that had little resonance).  Two years later, Francis personally wound up the moribund Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.  Both actions were of dubious constitutional legality.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=246}}</ref>\n\n\n== Later years ==\n[[File:Sarcophagus Emperor Franz II.(I.)

[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 3.</ref>{{snd}}6 September 1902) was an [[England|English]] [[chemist]].\n\n==Education==\nBorn in [[London]] as son of [[Johann Leopold Abel]], Abel studied chemistry at the [[University of Westminster|Royal Polytechnic Institution]] and in 1845 became one of the original 26 students of [[A. W. von Hofmann]] at the [[Royal College of Chemistry]].<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Douglas|title=Who's Buried where in England|edition=Third|year=1999|publisher=Constable|isbn=0-09-479310-7}}</ref> In 1852 he was appointed lecturer in chemistry at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]],<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> succeeding [[Michael Faraday]],<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> who had held that post since 1829.\n\n==Early career==\nFrom 1854 until 1888 Abel served as ordnance chemist at the Chemical Establishment of the [[Royal Arsenal]] at Woolwich,<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> establishing himself as the leading British authority on explosives. Three years later was appointed chemist to the [[War Department (UK)|War Department]]<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> and chemical referee to the government. During his tenure of this office, which lasted until 1888, he carried out a large amount of work in connection with the chemistry of [[explosive]]s.\n\n==Notable work==\nOne of the most important of his investigations had to do with the manufacture of [[guncotton]], and he developed a process, consisting essentially of reducing the nitrated cotton to fine pulp,<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> which enabled it to be safely manufactured and at the same time yielded the product in a form that increased its usefulness. This work to an important extent prepared the way for the \"[[smokeless powder]]s\" which came into general use towards the end of the 19th century; [[cordite]], the type adopted by the British government in 1891, was invented jointly by him and Sir [[James Dewar]].<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> He and Dewar were unsuccessfully sued by [[Alfred Nobel]] over infringement of Nobel's [[patent]] for a similar explosive called [[ballistite]], the case finally being resolved in the [[House of Lords]] in 1895. He also extensively researched the behaviour of [[black powder]] when ignited, with the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[physicist]] Sir [[Sir Andrew Noble, 1st Baronet|Andrew Noble]]. At the request of the [[British government]], he devised the Abel test, a means of determining the [[flash point]] of [[petroleum]] products.<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> His first instrument, the open-test apparatus, was specified in an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1868 for officially specifying [[petroleum]] products. It was superseded in August 1879 by the much more reliable Abel close-test instrument.<ref name=\"Greenwood\" /> Under his leadership, first, guncotton was developed at [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills]], patented in 1865, then, the propellant cordite, patented in 1889. In [[electricity]], Abel studied the construction of electrical [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s and other applications of electricity to warlike purposes, and his work on problems of [[steel]] manufacture won him in 1897 the [[Bessemer medal]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iom3.org/awards-archive#Bessemer |title=Awards archive |website=Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining |language=en |access-date=2018-09-04 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> of the [[Iron and Steel Institute]], of which from 1891 to 1893 he was president.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iom3.org/iom3-presidents |title=IOM3 Presidents  |website=Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining |language=en |access-date=2018-09-04 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership and honours==\nHe was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1860 and received their [[Royal Medal]] in 1887.

It is a form of [[luminescence]]. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer [[wavelength]], and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[Spectrum#Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can be seen only when exposed to [[UV light]]. Fluorescent materials cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] materials, which continue to emit light for some time after.\n\nFluorescence has many practical applications, including [[mineralogy]], [[gemology]], [[medicine]], chemical sensors ([[fluorescence spectroscopy]]), [[fluorescent labelling]], [[dye]]s, biological detectors, cosmic-ray detection, and, most commonly, [[fluorescent lamp]]s.

The specific frequencies of exciting and emitted light are dependent on the particular system.\n\nS<sub>0</sub> is called the ground state of the [[fluorophore]] (fluorescent molecule), and S<sub>1</sub> is its first (electronically) excited singlet state.\n\nA molecule in S<sub>1</sub> can relax by various competing pathways. It can undergo ''non-radiative'' [[Photoluminescence#Relaxation|relaxation]] in which the excitation energy is dissipated as [[heat]] (vibrations) to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a [[triplet state]], which may subsequently relax via [[phosphorescence]], or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.\n\nRelaxation from S<sub>1</sub> can also occur through interaction with a second molecule through [[Quenching (fluorescence)|fluorescence quenching]]. Molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence just because of its unusual triplet ground state.\n\nIn most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation; this phenomenon is known as the [[Stokes shift]]. However, when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is possible for one [[electron]] to absorb two [[photon]]s; this [[two-photon absorption]] can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation. The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation, termed \"resonance fluorescence\".<ref>Holler, F. James; Skoog, Douglas A. and Crouch, Stanley R. (2006) ''Principles Of Instrumental Analysis''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0495012017}}</ref>\n\nMolecules that are excited through light absorption or via a different process (e.g. as the product of a reaction) can transfer energy to a second 'sensitized' molecule, which is converted to its excited state and can then fluoresce.\n\n===Quantum yield===\nThe fluorescence [[quantum yield]] gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], p. 10</ref><ref>Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario (2012). ''Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications''. Wiley-VCH. {{ISBN|978-3-527-32837-6}}. p. 64</ref>\n\n: <math> \\Phi = \\frac {\\text{Number of photons emitted}} {\\text{Number of photons absorbed}} </math>\n\nThe maximum possible fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 (100%); each [[photon]] absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence is by the rate of excited state decay:\n\n: <math> \\Phi = \\frac{ { k}_{ f} }{ \\sum_{i}{ k}_{i } } </math>\n\nwhere <math>{ k}_{ f}</math> is the rate constant of [[spontaneous emission]] of radiation and\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i}{ k}_{i } </math>\n\nis the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are, therefore, often called \"non-radiative rates\", which can include:\ndynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction (or [[resonance energy transfer]]), internal conversion, and [[intersystem crossing]]. Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected.\n\nFluorescence quantum yields are measured by comparison to a standard. The [[quinine]] salt ''quinine sulfate'' in a [[sulfuric acid]] solution is a common fluorescence standard.\n\n===Lifetime===\n[[File:Jablonski Diagram of Fluorescence Only.png|thumb|[[Jablonski diagram]]. After an electron absorbs a high-energy photon the system is excited electronically and vibrationally. The system relaxes vibrationally, and eventually fluoresces at a longer wavelength.]]\n\nThe fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows [[first-order kinetics]]:\n\n:<math> \\left[S_1 \\right] = \\left[S_1 \\right]_0 e^{-\\Gamma t} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\left[S_1 \\right]</math> is the concentration of excited state molecules at time <math>t</math>, <math>\\left[S_1 \\right]_0</math> is the initial concentration and [[Gamma|<math>\\Gamma</math>]] is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of [[exponential decay]]. Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:\n\n:<math> \\Gamma_{tot}=\\Gamma_{rad} + \\Gamma_{nrad} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Gamma_{tot}</math> is the total decay rate, <math>\\Gamma_{rad}</math> the radiative decay rate and <math>\\Gamma_{nrad}</math> the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds, typical excited state decay times for photon emissions with energies from the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] to [[near infrared]] are within the range of 0.5 to 20 [[nanoseconds]]. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] and [[fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy]].\n\n===Jablonski diagram===\nThe [[Jablonski diagram]] describes most of the relaxation mechanisms for excited state molecules. The diagram alongside shows how fluorescence occurs due to the relaxation of certain excited electrons of a molecule.<ref name=\"mehta\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ \"Animation for the Principle of Fluorescence and UV-Visible Absorbance\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609034835/http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ |date=9 June 2013 }}. ''PharmaXChange.info''.</ref>\n\n===Fluorescence anisotropy===\nFluorophores are more likely to be excited by photons if the transition moment of the fluorophore is parallel to the electric vector of the photon.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], pp. 12\u201313</ref> The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.\n\nFluorescence anisotropy can be defined quantitatively as\n:<math>r = {I_\\parallel - I_\\perp \\over I_\\parallel + 2I_\\perp}</math>\nwhere <math>I_\\parallel</math> is the emitted intensity parallel to polarization of the excitation light and <math>I_\\perp</math> is the emitted intensity perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation light.<ref>Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario (2012).

Wiley-VCH. {{ISBN|978-3-527-32837-6}}. p. 186</ref>\n\n===Fluorence===\nStrongly fluorescent pigments often have an unusual appearance which is often described colloquially as a \"neon color\" (originally \"day-glo\" in the late 1960s, early 1970s). This phenomenon was termed \"Farbenglut\" by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and \"fluorence\" by Ralph M. Evans. It is generally thought to be related to the high brightness of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer (such as blue to yellow) and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter (more saturated) than it could possibly be by reflection alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schieber|first1=Frank|title=Modeling the Appearance of Fluorescent Colors|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|date=October 2001|volume=45|issue=18|pages=1324\u20131327|doi=10.1177/154193120104501802}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThere are several general [[rule of thumb|rules]] that deal with fluorescence. Each of the following rules has exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding fluorescence (these rules do not necessarily apply to [[two-photon absorption]]).\n\n===Kasha's rule===\n[[Kasha's rule]] dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation.<ref>[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]. [http://goldbook.iupac.org/K03371.html Kasha\u2013Vavilov rule \u2013 Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed.

Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1997.</ref> This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha\u2013Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Mirror image rule===\nFor many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], pp. 6\u20138</ref> This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the [[Franck\u2013Condon principle]] which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.\n\n===Stokes shift===\n{{main|Stokes shift}}\nIn general, emitted fluorescence light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], pp. 6\u20137</ref> This phenomenon, known as [[Stokes shift]], is due to energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed and when a new one is emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.\n\n==Fluorescence in nature==\nThere are many natural compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the [[greeneye]], use fluorescence.\n\n===Biofluorescence vs. bioluminescence vs. biophosphorescence===\n====Biofluorescence====\nBiofluorescence is the absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] wavelengths from the [[visible light]] spectrum by fluorescent proteins in a living organism, and the emission of light at a lower energy level. This causes the light that is emitted to be a different color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an [[electron]], raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescence light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.<ref name=\"Fluorescence in marine organisms\">{{cite web|title=Fluorescence in marine organisms|url=http://gestaltswitchexpeditions.com/fluorescence-in-marine-orga/|website=Gestalt Switch Expeditions|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221070425/http://www.gestaltswitchexpeditions.com/fluorescence-in-marine-orga/|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Bioluminescence====\n[[Bioluminescence]] differs from biofluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas biofluorescence is the absorption and reemission of light from the environment.<ref name=\"Fluorescence in marine organisms\"/>\n\n====Biophosphorescence====\n[[Phosphorescence|Biophosphorescence]] is similar to biofluorescence in its requirement of light wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy.

Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the [[photic zone]]. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense as it is on the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.\n\nFluorescence is simply defined as the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at one [[wavelength]] and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength.<ref name=\"sparks\" /> Thus any type of fluorescence depends on the presence of external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause biofluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it. The visual field in the photic zone is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the biofluorescent spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the aphotic zone as a byproduct of that same organism\u2019s bioluminescence. Some biofluorescence in the aphotic zone is merely a byproduct of the organism\u2019s tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose. However, some cases of functional and adaptive significance of biofluorescence in the aphotic zone of the deep ocean is an active area of research.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Matz|first1=M.|title=Fluorescence: The Secret Color of the Deep|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/05deepscope/background/fluorescence/fluorescence.html|publisher=Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031213647/http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/05deepscope/background/fluorescence/fluorescence.html|archivedate=31 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====[[Photic zone]]====\n=====Fish=====\n[[File:Diversity of fluorescent patterns and colors in marine fishes - journal.pone.0083259.g001.png|thumb|Fluorescent marine fish]]\nBony fishes living in shallow water, due to living in a colorful environment, generally have good color vision.

[[Ruby|Rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and [[diamonds]] exhibit red fluorescence under long-wave UV, blue and sometimes green light; diamonds also emit light under [[X-ray]] radiation.\n\nFluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent [[manganese]], in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of [[calcite]], the green fluorescence of [[willemite]], the yellow fluorescence of [[esperite]], and the orange fluorescence of [[wollastonite]] and [[clinohedrite]]. Hexavalent [[uranium]], in the form of the [[uranyl cation]], fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as [[autunite]] or [[andersonite]], and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of [[hyalite]] opal. Trivalent [[chromium]] at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of [[ruby]]. Divalent [[europium]] is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral [[fluorite]]. Trivalent [[lanthanide]]s such as [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the [[yttrofluorite]] variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of [[zircon]]. [[Powellite]] ([[calcium molybdate]]) and [[scheelite]] (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy [[tungsten]] to the lower-energy [[molybdenum]], such that fairly low levels of [[molybdenum]] are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for [[scheelite]], instead of blue. Low-iron [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.\n\nCrude oil ([[petroleum]]) fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull-brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright-yellowish and bluish-white for very light oils and condensates.

Stilbene is also one of the [[gain medium]]s used in [[dye lasers]].\n\n====Atmosphere====\nFluorescence is observed in the atmosphere when the air is under energetic electron bombardment.

Paintings by Beo Beyond]]\nThe common [[fluorescent lamp]] relies on fluorescence. Inside the [[glass]] tube is a partial vacuum and a small amount of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the ''[[phosphor]]'', which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent [[lighting]] is more energy-efficient than [[incandescent]] lighting elements. However, the uneven [[spectrum]] of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or [[daylight]]. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254&nbsp;nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436&nbsp;nm (blue), 546&nbsp;nm (green) and 579&nbsp;nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many [[compact fluorescent lamp]] and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.<ref name=\"How Fluorescent Lamps Work\">{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Tom|title=How Fluorescent Lamps Work|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/fluorescent-lamp.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=27 June 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706040948/http://home.howstuffworks.com/fluorescent-lamp.htm|archivedate=6 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFluorescent lights were first available to the public at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes (such as compact fluorescent lamps). Some [[High-intensity discharge lamp|high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps]] couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nWhite [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) became available in the mid-1990s as [[LED lamp]]s, in which blue light emitted from the [[semiconductor]] strikes phosphors deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[Glow stick]]s sometimes utilize fluorescent materials to absorb light from the [[chemiluminescence|chemiluminescent]] reaction and emit light of a different color.<ref name=\"How Fluorescent Lamps Work\"/>\n\n===Analytical chemistry===\nMany analytical procedures involve the use of a [[fluorometer]], usually with a single exciting wavelength and single detection wavelength. Because of the sensitivity that the method affords, fluorescent molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion can be measured.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/abio.1993.1020| title = Fluorometric Assay Using Dimeric Dyes for Double- and Single-Stranded DNA and RNA with Picogram Sensitivity| journal = Analytical Biochemistry| volume = 208| issue = 1| pages = 144\u2013150| year = 1993| last1 = Rye | first1 = H.

Also, [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]] plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. There is, then, a higher probability of excitement and release of photons by lower-energy atoms, making analysis more efficient.\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n{{Main|Fluorescence spectroscopy}}\nUsually the setup of a fluorescence assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength is required for proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to [[Stokes shift]] and various [[electron transition]]s. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission [[monochromator]], and observed selectively by a detector.<ref>{{cite book|author=Harris, Daniel C.|title=Exploring chemical analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5eEW76lizEC|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-7167-0571-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731220213/https://books.google.com/books?id=x5eEW76lizEC|archivedate=31 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Biochemistry and medicine===\n{{Main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}\n[[Image:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|right|[[Endothelium|Endothelial cells]] under the microscope with three separate channels marking specific cellular components]]\nFluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or [[autofluorescence]]).\nIn fact, a [[protein]] or other component can be \"labelled\" with an extrinsic [[fluorophore]], a fluorescent [[dye]] that can be a small molecule, protein, or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.<ref>[[#Lakowicz|Lakowicz]], p. xxvi</ref>\n\nThe quantification of a dye is done with a [[spectrofluorometer]] and finds additional applications in:\n\n====Microscopy====\n* When scanning the fluorescence intensity across a plane one has [[fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]] of tissues, cells, or subcellular structures, which is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labelling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image (multiple channels). DNA microarrays are a variant of this.\n* Immunology: An antibody is first prepared by having a fluorescent chemical group attached, and the sites (e.g., on a microscopic specimen) where the antibody has bound can be seen, and even quantified, by the fluorescence.\n* FLIM ([[Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy]]) can be used to detect certain bio-molecular interactions that manifest themselves by influencing fluorescence lifetimes.\n* Cell and molecular biology: detection of [[colocalization]] using fluorescence-labelled antibodies for selective detection of the antigens of interest using specialized software such as ImageJ.\n\n====Other techniques====\n* FRET ([[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer]], also known as [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]]) is used to study protein interactions, detect specific nucleic acid sequences and used as biosensors, while fluorescence lifetime (FLIM) can give an additional layer of information.\n* Biotechnology: [[biosensors]] using fluorescence are being studied as possible [[Fluorescent glucose biosensors]].\n* Automated sequencing of [[DNA]] by the [[chain termination method]]; each of four different chain terminating bases has its own specific fluorescent tag. As the labelled DNA molecules are separated, the fluorescent label is excited by a UV source, and the identity of the base terminating the molecule is identified by the wavelength of the emitted light.\n* FACS ([[fluorescence-activated cell sorting]]). One of several important [[cell sorting]] techniques used in the separation of different cell lines (especially those isolated from animal tissues).\n* DNA detection: the compound [[ethidium bromide]], in aqueous solution, has very little fluorescence, as it is quenched by water. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced after it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]]. Intercalated ethidium is in a hydrophobic environment when it is between the base pairs of the DNA, protected from quenching by water which is excluded from the local environment of the intercalated ethidium. Ethidium bromide may be carcinogenic \u2013 an arguably safer alternative is the dye [[SYBR Green]].\n* FIGS ([[Fluorescence image-guided surgery]]) is a medical imaging technique that uses fluorescence to detect properly labeled structures during surgery.\n* [[Intravascular fluorescence]] is a catheter-based medical imaging technique that uses fluorescence to detect high-risk features of atherosclerosis and unhealed vascular stent devices.<ref name=\"pmid20210433\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Calfon MA, Vinegoni C, Ntziachristos V, Jaffer FA | title=Intravascular near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging of atherosclerosis: toward coronary arterial visualization of biologically high-risk plaques. | journal=J Biomed Opt | year= 2010 | volume= 15 | issue= 1 | pages= 011107 | pmid=20210433 | doi=10.1117/1.3280282 | pmc=3188610 | bibcode=2010JBO....15a1107C }}</ref> Plaque autofluorescence has been used in a first-in-man study in coronary arteries in combination with [[optical coherence tomography]].<ref name=\"pmid26971006\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ughi GJ, Wang H, Gerbaud E, Gardecki JA, Fard AM, Hamidi E, etal |title=Clinical Characterization of Coronary Atherosclerosis With Dual-Modality OCT and Near-Infrared Autofluorescence Imaging | journal=JACC Cardiovasc Imaging | year= 2016 | volume=  9| issue=  11| pages=  1304\u20131314| pmid=26971006 | pmc=5010789 | doi=10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.11.020}}</ref> Molecular agents has been also used to detect specific features, such as stent [[fibrin]] accumulation and enzymatic activity related to artery inflammation.<ref name=\"pmid26685129\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hara T, Ughi GJ, McCarthy JR, Erdem SS, Mauskapf A, Lyon SC, etal | title=Intravascular fibrin molecular imaging improves the detection of unhealed stents assessed by optical coherence tomography in vivo | journal=Eur Heart J | year= 2015 | volume=  38| issue=  6| pages=  447\u2013455| pmid=26685129 | pmc=5837565 | doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehv677}}</ref>\n* SAFI (species altered fluorescence imaging) an imaging technique in [[electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetics]] and [[microfluidics]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n |pmid        = 23463253\n |url         = https://microfluidics.stanford.edu/Publications/ParticleTracking_Diagnostics/Shkolnikov_A%20method%20for%20non-invasive%20full-field%20imaging%20and%20quantification%20of%20chemical%20species.pdf\n |year        = 2013\n |author1     = Shkolnikov\n |first1      = V\n |title       = A method for non-invasive full-field imaging and quantification of chemical species\n |journal     = Lab on a Chip\n |volume      = 13\n |issue       = 8\n |pages       = 1632\u201343\n |last2       = Santiago\n |first2      = J.

Otherwise, there are integers ''a'' and ''b'',  where ''n'' = ''ab'' and {{nowrap begin}}1 < ''a'' \u2264 ''b'' < ''n''.{{nowrap end}}\nBy the induction hypothesis,\n{{nowrap begin}}''a'' = ''p''<sub>1</sub>''p''<sub>2</sub>...''p''<sub>''j''</sub>{{nowrap end}}\nand\n{{nowrap begin}}''b'' = ''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>...''q''<sub>''k''</sub>{{nowrap end}} are products of primes. But then\n{{nowrap begin}}''n'' = ''ab'' = ''p''<sub>1</sub>''p''<sub>2</sub>...''p''<sub>''j''</sub>''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>...''q''<sub>''k''</sub>{{nowrap end}} is a product of primes.\n\n===Uniqueness===\nAssume that ''s'' > 1 is the product of prime numbers in two different ways:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ns\n&=p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_1 q_2 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWe must show ''m'' = ''n'' and that the ''q''<sub>''j''</sub> are a rearrangement of the ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\nAs ''p''<sub>1</sub> divides ''s'', [[Euclid's lemma]] implies that ''p''<sub>1</sub> divides one of the ''q''<sub>''j''</sub>; relabeling the ''q''<sub>''j''</sub> if necessary, say that ''p''<sub>1</sub> divides ''q''<sub>1</sub>. But ''q''<sub>1</sub> is prime, so its only divisors are itself and 1. Therefore, ''p''<sub>1</sub> = ''q''<sub>1</sub>, so that\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{s}{p_1}\n&=p_2 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_2 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nReasoning the same way, ''p''<sub>2</sub> must equal one of the remaining ''q''<sub>''j''</sub>. Relabeling again if necessary, say ''p''<sub>2</sub> = ''q''<sub>2</sub>. Then\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{s}{p_1 p_2}\n&=p_3 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_3 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis can be done for each of the ''m'' ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>'s, showing that ''m'' \u2264 ''n'' and every ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> is a ''q''<sub>''j''</sub>. Applying the same argument with the <math>p</math>'s and <math>q</math>'s reversed shows ''n'' \u2264 ''m'' (hence  ''m'' = ''n'') and every ''q''<sub>''j''</sub> is a ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\n===Elementary proof of uniqueness===\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid's lemma, as follows:\n\nAssume that ''s'' > 1 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. If ''s'' were prime then it would factor uniquely as itself, so there must be at least two primes in each factorization of ''s'':\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ns\n&=p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m \\\\\n&=q_1 q_2 \\cdots q_n.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIf any ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''q''<sub>''j''</sub> then, by cancellation, ''s''/''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''s''/''q''<sub>''j''</sub> would be another positive integer, different from s, which is greater than 1 and also has two distinct factorizations. But ''s''/''p''<sub>''i''</sub> is smaller than ''s'', meaning ''s'' would not actually be the smallest such integer. Therefore every ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> must be distinct from every ''q''<sub>''j''</sub>.\n\nWithout loss of generality, take ''p''<sub>1</sub> < ''q''<sub>1</sub> (if this is not already the case, switch the ''p'' and ''q'' designations.) Consider\n\n:<math>t = (q_1 - p_1)(q_2 \\cdots q_n),</math>\n\nand note that 1 < ''q''<sub>2</sub> \u2264 ''t'' < ''s''. Therefore ''t'' must have a unique prime factorization. By rearrangement we see,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nt\n&= q_1(q_2 \\cdots q_n) - p_1(q_2 \\cdots q_n) \\\\\n&= s - p_1(q_2 \\cdots q_n) \\\\\n&= p_1((p_2 \\cdots p_m) - (q_2 \\cdots q_n)).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHere ''u'' = ((''p''<sub>2</sub> ... ''p''<sub>''m''</sub>) - (''q''<sub>2</sub> ... ''q''<sub>''n''</sub>)) is positive, for if it were negative or zero then so would be its product with ''p''<sub>''1''</sub>, but that product equals ''t'' which is positive. So ''u'' is either 1 or factors into primes. In either case, ''t'' = ''p''<sub>1</sub>''u'' yields a prime factorization of ''t'', which we know to be unique, so ''p''<sub>1</sub> appears in the prime factorization of ''t''.\n\nIf (''q''<sub>1</sub> - ''p''<sub>1</sub>) equaled 1 then the prime factorization of ''t'' would be all ''q'''s, which would preclude ''p''<sub>1</sub> from appearing. Thus  (''q''<sub>1</sub> - ''p''<sub>1</sub>) is not 1, but is positive, so it factors into primes: (''q''<sub>1</sub> - ''p''<sub>1</sub>) = (''r''<sub>1</sub> ... ''r''<sub>''h''</sub>). This yields a prime factorization of\n\n:<math>t = (r_1 \\cdots r_h)(q_2 \\cdots q_n),</math>\n\nwhich we know is unique. Now, ''p''<sub>1</sub> appears in the prime factorization of ''t'', and it is not equal to any ''q'', so it must be one of the ''r'''s. That means ''p''<sub>1</sub> is a factor of (''q''<sub>1</sub> - ''p''<sub>1</sub>), so there exists a positive integer ''k'' such that ''p''<sub>1</sub>''k'' = (''q''<sub>1</sub> - ''p''<sub>1</sub>), and therefore\n\n:<math>p_1(k+1) = q_1.</math>\n\nBut that means ''q''<sub>1</sub> has a proper factorization, so it is not a prime number. This contradiction shows that ''s'' does not actually have two different prime factorizations. As a result, there is no smallest positive integer with multiple prime factorizations, hence all positive integers greater than 1 factor uniquely into primes.\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe first generalization of the theorem is found in Gauss's second monograph (1832) on [[biquadratic reciprocity]]. This paper introduced what is now called the [[ring theory|ring]] of [[Gaussian integer]]s, the set of all [[complex number]]s ''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers. It is now denoted by <math>\\mathbb{Z}[i].</math> He showed that this ring has the four units \u00b11 and \u00b1''i'', that the non-zero, non-unit numbers fall into two classes, primes and composites, and that (except for order), the composites have unique factorization as a product of primes.<ref>[[#CITEREFGauss1832|Gauss, BQ, \u00a7\u00a7 31\u201334]]</ref>\n\nSimilarly, in 1844 while working on [[cubic reciprocity]], [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] introduced the ring <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]</math>, where   <math>\\omega=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}, </math> &nbsp; <math>\\omega^3=1 </math> is a cube [[root of unity]]. This is the ring of [[Eisenstein integer]]s, and he proved it has the six units <math>\\pm 1, \\pm\\omega, \\pm\\omega^2</math> and that it has unique factorization.\n\nHowever, it was also discovered that unique factorization does not always hold. An example is given by <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]</math>. In this ring one has<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=\u00a7 14.6}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\n6=\n2\\cdot 3=\n(1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5}).\n</math>\n\nExamples like this caused the notion of \"prime\" to be modified. In <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]</math> it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, e.g., 2 = ''ab'', then one of ''a'' or ''b'' must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of \"prime\". It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid's lemma; e.g.,\n2 divides neither (1 + {{sqrt|&minus;5}}) nor (1 &minus; {{sqrt|&minus;5}}) even though it divides their product 6. In [[algebraic number theory]] 2 is called '''irreducible''' in <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]</math> (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not '''prime''' in <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]</math> (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]</math> is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in <math>\\mathbb{Z}.</math> Using these definitions it can be proven that in any ring a prime must be irreducible. Euclid's classical lemma can be rephrased as \"in the ring of integers <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> every irreducible is prime\". This is also true in <math>\\mathbb{Z}[i]</math> and <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega],</math> but not in <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}].</math>\n\nThe rings in which factorization into irreducibles is essentially unique are called [[unique factorization domain]]s. Important examples are [[polynomial ring]]s over the integers or over a [[field (mathematics)|field]], [[Euclidean domain]]s and [[principal ideal domain]]s.\n\nIn 1843 [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] introduced the concept of [[ideal number]], which was developed further by [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] (1876) into the modern theory of [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], special subsets of rings. Multiplication is defined for ideals, and the rings in which they have unique factorization are called [[Dedekind domain]]s.\n\nThere is a version of [[ordinal arithmetic|unique factorization for ordinals]], though it requires some additional conditions to ensure uniqueness.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Riemann zeta function#Euler product formula|Euler product formula]]\n* [[Integer factorization]]\n* [[Noetherian ring]]\n* [[Prime signature]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\nThe ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' has been translated from Latin into English and German.

There are over 50 different ''palos'', some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions are breaking down: the ''Farruca'', for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.\n\nThere are many ways to categorize ''Palos'' but they traditionally fall into three classes: the most serious is known as ''[[cante jondo]]'' (or ''[[Cante flamenco#Cante Grande (also known as cante jondo)|cante grande]]''), while lighter, frivolous forms are called ''[[Cante Chico|cante chico]]''. Forms that do not fit either category are classed as ''[[Cante Intermedio|cante intermedio]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pohren\n|first= Donn E.|title=The Art of Flamenco|year=2005|publisher=Bold Strummer|location= Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0933224025|page=68}}</ref>\n\nThese are the best known ''palos'':<ref name=\"The Palos of Flamenco\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flamencoexport.com/flamenco-wiki/palos-del-flamenco.html|title=Los Palos del Flamenco Distingue los Diferentes Palos del Flamenco|website=www.flamencoexport.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flamenco-events.com/palosetcompas.html|title=Flamenco-Events Palos et compas|last=www.flamenco-events.com|website=www.flamenco-events.com|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>\n* [[Alegr\u00edas]]\n* [[Buler\u00edas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1 por Buler\u00edas|Buler\u00edas por sole\u00e1 (sole\u00e1 por buler\u00edas)]]\n* Caracoles\n* [[Cartageneras]]\n* [[Fandango]]\n* Fandango de Huelva\n* Fandango Malague\u00f1o\n* [[Farruca]]\n* [[Grana\u00edna|Grana\u00ednas]]\n* [[Guajiras (Flamenco)|Guajiras]]\n* [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|Malague\u00f1as]]\n* Martinete\n* Mineras\n* [[Peteneras]]\n* Ronde\u00f1as\n* [[Saeta (flamenco)|Saeta]]\n* [[Siguiriyas|Seguiriyas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1]]\n* [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]]\n* Tanguillos\n* Tarantos\n* [[Tientos (Flamenco)|Tientos]]\n* Villancicos\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure ===\nA typical flamenco recital with voice and guitar accompaniment, comprises a series of pieces (not exactly \u201csongs\u201d) in different palos.

The Phrygian mode occurs in ''palos'' such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], most [[buler\u00edas]], [[siguiriya]]s, [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] and [[tientos]].\n[[File:E Phrygian Scale.PNG|frame|left|Descending E Phrygian scale in flamenco music, with common alterations in parentheses]]\n\nA typical [[chord sequence]], usually called the \"[[Andalusian cadence]]\" may be viewed as in a modified Phrygian: in E the sequence is '''Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013E'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=Peter|editor=Tenzer, Michael|title=Analytical Studies in World Music|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=96}}</ref> According to [[Manolo Sanl\u00facar]] '''E''' is here the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], '''F''' has the [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] of [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] while '''Am''' and '''G''' assume the functions of [[subdominant]] and [[mediant]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tristeyazul.com/cronicas/ntc14.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308101516/http://www.tristeyazul.com/cronicas/ntc14.htm |archivedate=2007-03-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\nGuitarists tend to use only two basic inversions or \"chord shapes\" for the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord (music)]], the open 1st inversion '''E''' and the open 3rd inversion '''A''', though they often [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] these by using a [[capo]]. Modern guitarists such as [[Ram\u00f3n Montoya]], have introduced other positions: Montoya himself started to use other chords for the tonic in the [[Dorian mode|modern Dorian]] sections of several ''palos''; '''F{{music|sharp}}''' for ''[[Tarantella|tarantas]]'', '''B''' for ''[[grana\u00edna]]s'' and '''A{{music|flat}}''' for the ''minera''. Montoya also created a new ''palo'' as a solo for guitar, the ''[[ronde\u00f1a]]'' in '''C{{music|sharp}}''' with ''[[scordatura]]''. Later guitarists have further extended the repertoire of [[tonality|tonalities]], chord positions and ''scordatura''.\n\nThere are also ''palos'' in major mode; most [[canti\u00f1as]] and [[alegr\u00edas]], [[guajiras]], some ''[[buler\u00edas]]'' and ''[[ton\u00e1s]]'', and the ''cabales'' (a major type of ''[[siguiriyas]]''). The minor mode is restricted to the ''[[Farruca]]'', the ''milongas'' (among ''[[cantes de ida y vuelta]]''), and some styles of ''tangos, buler\u00edas'', etc. In general traditional palos in major and minor mode are limited harmonically to two-chord (tonic\u2013dominant) or three-chord (tonic\u2013subdominant\u2013dominant) progressions. (Rossy 1998:92) However modern guitarists have introduced [[chord substitution]], transition chords, and even [[modulation (music)|modulation]].\n\n''[[Fandangos]]'' and derivative ''palos'' such as ''[[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]]'', ''tarantas'' and ''[[cartageneras]] are bimodal'': guitar introductions are in Phrygian mode while the singing develops in major mode, modulating to Phrygian at the end of the stanza. (Rossy 1998:92)\n\n=== Melody ===\nDionisio Preciado, quoted by Sabas de Hoces <ref name=\"funjdiaz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funjdiaz.net/folklore/07ficha.cfm?id=201|title=Revista de Folklore|publisher=funjdiaz.net|accessdate=2014-02-10}}</ref> established the following characteristics for the melodies of flamenco singing:\n\n#[[Microtonality]]: presence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] smaller than the [[semitone]].\n#[[Portamento]]: frequently, the change from one note to another is done in a smooth transition, rather than using discrete intervals.\n#Short [[tessitura]] or [[range (music)|range]]: Most traditional flamenco songs are limited to a range of a sixth (four tones and a half). The impression of vocal effort is the result of using different [[timbre]]s, and variety is accomplished by the use of microtones.\n#Use of [[enharmonic scale]]. While in [[equal temperament]] scales, [[enharmonic]]s are notes with identical pitch but different spellings (e.g. A\u266d and G\u266f); in flamenco, as in [[Equal temperament|unequal temperament]] scales, there is a microtonal intervalic difference between enharmonic notes.\n#Insistence on a note and its contiguous chromatic notes (also frequent in the guitar), producing a sense of urgency.\n#Baroque [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], with an expressive, rather than merely aesthetic function.\n#Apparent lack of regular rhythm, especially in the [[siguiriyas]]: the melodic rhythm of the sung line is different from the metric rhythm of the accompaniment.\n#Most styles express sad and bitter feelings.\n#Melodic [[improvisation]]: flamenco singing is not, strictly speaking, improvised, but based on a relatively small number of traditional songs, singers add variations on the spur of the moment.\n\nMusicologist Hip\u00f3lito Rossy adds the following characteristics (Rossy 1997: 97):\n\n*Flamenco melodies are characterized by a descending tendency, as opposed to, for example, a typical opera [[aria]], they usually go from the higher pitches to the lower ones, and from [[Dynamics (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|piano]], as was usual in ancient Greek scales.\n*In many styles, such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]] or [[siguiriya]], the melody tends to proceed in contiguous [[degree (music)|degrees]] of the scale. [[Steps and skips|Skips]] of a third or a fourth are rarer. However, in [[fandangos]] and fandango-derived styles, fourths and sixths can often be found, especially at the beginning of each line of verse. According to Rossy, this is proof of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian [[jota (music)|jota]].\n\n=== Comp\u00e1s ===\n'''Comp\u00e1s''' is the Spanish word for [[metre (music)|metre]] or [[time signature]] (in classical [[music theory]]). It also refers to the rhythmic cycle, or layout, of a ''palo''.\n\nThe comp\u00e1s is fundamental to flamenco. Comp\u00e1s is most often translated as [[rhythm]] but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the comp\u00e1s is rendered through hand clapping (''palmas'') or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (''rasgueado'') or tapping the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]] (''golpe''). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.\n\nFlamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco. There are also free-form styles including, among others, the [[ton\u00e1s]], [[Saeta (flamenco)|saetas]], [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]], tarantos, and some types of [[fandangos]].\n\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}. These metres are used in forms like [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]], [[tientos]], [[Flamenco Rumba|gypsy rumba]], [[zambra]] and tanguillos.\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|3|4}}. These are typical of [[fandangos]] and [[sevillanas]], suggesting their origin as non-Roma styles, since the {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|4|4}} measures are not common in ethnic Roma music.\n*12-beat rhythms usually rendered in amalgams of {{music|time|6|8}} + {{music|time|3|4}} and sometimes {{music|time|12|8}}. The 12-beat cycle is the most common in flamenco, differentiated by the accentuation of the beats in different palos. The accents do not correspond to the classic concept of the downbeat. The alternating of groups of 2 and 3 beats is also common in Spanish folk dances of the 16th Century such as the ''zarabanda'', ''j\u00e1cara'' and ''canarios''.\n\nThere are three types of 12-beat rhythms, which vary in their layouts, or use of accentuations: sole\u00e1, seguiriya and buler\u00eda.\n\n#[[peteneras]] and [[guajiras]]: 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. Both palos start with the strong accent on 12. Hence the meter is  '''12''' 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11...\n#The [[seguiriya]], [[liviana (Flamenco)|liviana]]<!-- liviana links to a page about a genus of moths-->, [[Palo (flamenco)|serrana]], ton\u00e1 liviana, cabales: '''12'''1 '''2''' 3 '''4''' 5 6 '''7''' 8 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''.\n#[[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], within the [[canti\u00f1as]] group of palos which includes the [[alegr\u00edas]], canti\u00f1as, mirabras, romera, caracoles and sole\u00e1 por buler\u00eda (also \"[[Buler\u00edas|buler\u00eda por sole\u00e1]]\"): 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. For practical reasons, when transferring flamenco guitar music to sheet music, this rhythm is written as a regular {{music|time|3|4}}.\n\nThe [[Buler\u00edas]] is the emblematic palo of flamenco: today its 12-beat cycle is most often played with accents on the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th beats. The accompanying ''palmas'' are played in groups of 6 beats, giving rise to a multitude of counter-rhythms and percussive voices within the 12 beat comp\u00e1s.\n\n[[File:Flamenco Compas.theora.ogv|thumb|400 px|none|Flamenco [[Buler\u00edas]] with emphasis as '''[12]''' 1 2 '''[3]''' 4 5 '''[6]''' 7 '''[8]''' 9 '''[10]''' 11 \u2013 also the rhythm for the song [[America (West Side Story song)|''America'' from the ''West Side Story'']]]]\n\n== Forms of flamenco expression ==\n\n=== Toque (guitar) ===\n\n{{Main article|Flamenco guitar}}\n\n[[File:Paco de lucia 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Paco de Luc\u00eda]], one of the most commercially successful exponents of flamenco.<ref name=\"Koster2002\">{{cite book|last=Koster|first=Dennis|title=Guitar Atlas, Flamenco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8SMixi1mbQC&pg=PA5|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=978-0-7390-2478-2|page=5}}</ref>]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the flamenco guitar is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[Flamenco guitar]].\n\n=== Cante (song) ===\n{{Main article|Cante flamenco}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Flamenco performance by the La Primavera group]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the cante is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[cante flamenco]].\n\n=== Baile (dance) ===\n\n''El baile flamenco'' is known for its emotional intensity, proud carriage, expressive use of the arms and rhythmic stamping of the feet (often confused{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} with [[tap dance]] or [[Irish dance]] but with a completely different technique). As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.\n\nIn the twentieth century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most \"authentic\" form of flamenco. There is less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.\n[[File:Tablao Cordob\u00e9s 06.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Flamenco, C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\"Flamenco puro\" is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is always performed solo, and is improvised rather than choreographed. Some purists frown on castanets (even though they can be seen in many early 20th century photos of flamenco dancers).\n\n\"Classical flamenco\" is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies, tending to exhibit more clearly the characteristics derived from the [[Seguidilla]], a traditional Spanish dance. It is danced largely in a proud and upright way. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held and the arms are long, like a ballet dancer. In fact many of the dancers in these companies have trained in ballet as well as flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by ballet, as evidenced by the fusion of the two created by 'La Argentinita' in the early part of the twentieth century and later, by [[Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]].\n\nIn the 1950s [[Jose Greco]] was one of the most famous male Flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the Ed Sullivan Show, and reviving the art almost singlehandedly.\n\nModern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, shawls and fans.\n\n\"[[New Flamenco|Flamenco nuevo]]\" is a recent style in flamenco, characterized by pared-down costumes (the men often dance bare-chested, and the women in plain jersey dresses). Props such as castanets, fans and shawls are rarely used. Dances are choreographed and include influences from other dance styles.\n\n[[File:Deborah Greenfield.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Los Angeles, United States]]\nThe flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the [[Sevillanas]] at the annual [[Seville Fair|Feria]] in [[Seville]].\n\nIn traditional flamenco, young people are not considered to have the emotional maturity to adequately convey the ''[[Duende (art)|duende]]'' (soul) of the genre. Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional early to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Castelucho.jpg|[[Claudio Castelucho]], Flamenco\nFile:Theatre Flamenco Work Sample.webm|Theatre Flamenco Work Sample\nFile:Baile andaluz 1893 Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero]], Baile Andaluz\nFile:Sargent John Singer Spanish Dancer.jpg|[[John Singer Sargent]], Spanish Dancer\n</gallery>\n\n;Scenes of flamenco performance in Seville.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 07.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 11.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 19.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 20.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 23.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Guitar|Latin music|Music}}\n{{div col|colwidth=10em}}\n*[[Andalusian Centre of Flamenco]]\n*[[Concurso de Cante Jondo]]\n*[[Festival Bienal Flamenco]]\n*[[Flamenco rumba]]\n*[[Flamenco shoes]]\n*[[Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album]]\n*''[[Kumpan\u00eda: Flamenco Los Angeles]]''\n*[[New Flamenco]]\n*[[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]]\n*[[Paco de Lucia]]\n*[[David Pe\u00f1a Dorantes]]\n*[[Ni\u00f1o Josele]]\n*[[Paco Pe\u00f1a]]\n*[[Picados]]\n*[[Silverio Franconetti]]\n*[[Tablao]]\n*[[Tomatito]]\n*[[Traje de flamenca]]\n*[[Maria Pages]]\n*[[Cristina Hoyos]]\n*[[Vicente Amigo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''El cante flamenco'', Alianza Editorial, Madrid, Second edition, 1998. {{ISBN|84-206-9682-X}} (First edition: 1994)\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''La Discograf\u00eda ideal del cante flamenco'', Planeta, Barcelona, 1995. {{ISBN|84-08-01602-4}}\n* Arredondo P\u00e9rez, Herminia y Garc\u00eda Gallardo, Francisco J.: \"M\u00fasica flamenca.

Although now known as a [[Christmas gift-bringer]], and normally considered to be synonymous with [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]'s [[Santa Claus]] which is now known worldwide, he was originally part of an unrelated and much older [[English folklore|English folkloric]] tradition. The recognisably modern figure of the English Father Christmas developed in the late [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], but Christmas had been personified for centuries before then.<ref name=\"EnglishYear385\">{{cite book | title=The English Year | publisher=Penguin Books | author=Roud, Steve | year=2006 | location=London | pages=385\u2013387 | isbn=978-0-140-51554-1}}</ref>\n\nEnglish personifications of Christmas were first recorded in the 15th century, with Father Christmas himself first appearing in the mid 17th century in the aftermath of the [[English Civil War]]. The [[Puritans|Puritan]]-controlled English government had legislated to abolish Christmas, considering it [[papist]], and had outlawed its traditional customs. [[Cavalier|Royalist]] political [[pamphleteer]]s, linking the old traditions with their cause, adopted Old Father Christmas as the symbol of 'the good old days' of feasting and good cheer. Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, Father Christmas's profile declined. His character was maintained during the late 18th and into the 19th century by the Christmas folk plays later known as [[mummers play]]s.\n\nUntil Victorian times, Father Christmas was concerned with adult feasting and merry-making. He had no particular connection with children, nor with the giving of presents, nocturnal visits, stockings or chimneys. But as later Victorian Christmases developed into child-centric family festivals, Father Christmas became a bringer of gifts. The popular American myth of [[Santa Claus]] arrived in England in the 1850s and Father Christmas started to take on Santa's attributes.

This government is variously known as the Union, the United States, or the federal government.\n\nUnder the Constitution and various treaties, the legal jurisdiction of the United States includes territories and territorial waters.<ref>[http://www.puertoricoreport.com/puerto-rico-is-a-territory-of-the-united-states/#.VNi_3el0wdU Puerto Rico is a Territory of the United States]  Puerto Rico Report \" The U.S. federal government has full responsibility for the conduct of foreign relations of all areas subject to United States jurisdiction, including all U.S. states, territories, and possessions.''

The Territorial Clause of the Constitution authorizes the Congress to \"make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property\" of the United States.  Relying on the Territorial Clause, the Congress has enacted legislation making some provisions of the Constitution explicitly applicable in the insular areas.'',  ''Whenever a bill comes up that relates to Puerto Rico, it is referred to the committee on Resources.

We have the right to vote.\"  Puerto Rico could not do that because they are under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution, like it or not.</ref>\n\n== Legislative Branch ==\n\nOne aspect of federal jurisdiction is the extent of legislative power. Under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] has power to legislate only in the areas that are [[Enumerated powers|delegated]] to it. Under clause 17 [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I Section 8 of the Constitution]] however, Congress has power to \"exercise exclusive Legislation in all cases whatsoever\" over the federal district ([[Washington, D.C.]]) and other territory ceded to the federal government by the states, such as for military installations.\n\nFederal jurisdiction in this sense is important in [[criminal law]] because federal law does not supersede state criminal law. Congress has enacted the [[Assimilative Crimes Act]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|13}}), which provides that any act that would have been a crime under the laws of the state in which a [[federal enclave]] is situated is also a federal crime.  Per the Article 1 of the United States Constitution \"Enclave Clause\"  the State must cede jurisdiction to the federal gov't to establish a federal enclave, all cessions are recorded in state and federal law.  As most such enclaves are occupied by the military, except large land masses such as Rocky Mountain National Park, [[military law]] is especially concerned with these enclaves, especially the issue of establishing who has jurisdiction and what type of jurisdiction. In such areas, the federal government may have a proprietorial interest only (rights as landowner), concurrent jurisdiction (with federal and state law applicable), or exclusive jurisdiction over the land where an act was committed. [[Court-martial|Courts-martial]] involving military members subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] apply regardless of location.  Some started to replace the term \"proprietorial interest only\", with \"proprietary jurisdiction\".  This incorrectly implies that the federal government has obtained some form of legislative jurisdiction from the state.  The correct and original term is \"Proprietorial Interest Only\".\n\n[[Article Four of the United States Constitution]] also states that the Congress has the power to enact laws ''respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.''  '''Federal jurisdiction''' exists over any territory thus subject to laws enacted by the Congress.\n\n== Judicial branch ==\n[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|U.S. Court of Appeals and District Court jurisdictions]]\n\nThe [[Law of the United States|American legal system]] includes both [[State court (United States)|state courts]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. State courts hear cases involving state law, and such federal laws as are not restricted to hearing in federal courts.  Federal courts may only hear cases where federal jurisdiction can be established. Specifically, the court must have both [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over the matter of the claim and [[personal jurisdiction]] over the parties.\n\nThe Federal Courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, meaning that they only exercise powers granted to them by the Constitution and Federal Laws. There are several forms of subject-matter jurisdiction, but the two most commonly appealed to are [[federal-question jurisdiction]] and [[diversity jurisdiction]]. Federal question jurisdiction is available when the plaintiff raises a claim that arises under the laws, treaties, or Constitution of the United States, as opposed to claims arising under state law.<ref>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331</ref> By the \"Well-Pleaded Complaint\" rule, federal question jurisdiction is not available if the federal issue arises only as a defense to a state-law claim.<ref>See ''[[Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Mottley]]'',  211 U.S. 149(1908).</ref> Diversity jurisdiction, on the other hand, is available regarding state-law claims if every plaintiff is from a different state from every defendant (the requirement for so-called complete or total diversity) and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.<ref>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</ref>\n\nIf a Federal Court has subject matter jurisdiction over one or more of the claims in a case, it has discretion to exercise ancillary jurisdiction over other state law claims.\n\nThe Supreme Court has \"cautioned that ... Court[s] must take great care to 'resist the temptation' to express preferences about [certain types of cases] in the form of jurisdictional rules. Judges must strain to remove the influence of the merits from their jurisdictional rules. The law of jurisdiction must remain apart from the world upon which it operates\".<ref>A. Althouse, ''Standing, in Fluffy Slippers'', 77 Va. L. Rev 1177, 1189 (1991) characterizing the Supreme Court's decision in ''Whitmore v. Arkansas'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=495&invol=149 495 U.S. 149] (1990).</ref>\n\nGenerally, when a case has successfully overcome the hurdles of [[Standing (law)|standing]], [[Case or Controversy]] and [[State actor|State Action]], it will be heard by a [[trial court]]. The non-governmental party may raise claims or defenses relating to alleged constitutional violation(s) by the government. If the non-governmental party loses, the constitutional issue may form part of the [[appeal]]. Eventually, a petition for [[certiorari]] may be sent to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants certiorari and accepts the case, it will receive written [[briefs]] from each side (and any [[amici curiae]] or friends of the court\u2014usually interested third parties with some expertise to bear on the subject) and schedule oral arguments. The [[Justice]]s will closely question both parties. When the Court renders its decision, it will generally do so in a single [[majority opinion]] and one or more [[dissenting opinion]]s. Each opinion sets forth the facts, prior decisions, and legal reasoning behind the position taken. The majority opinion constitutes binding [[precedent]] on all lower courts; when faced with very similar facts, they are bound to apply the same reasoning or face reversal of their decision by a higher court.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jurisdiction]]\n* [[Law of the United States]]\n* [[Federalism]]\n* [[Territorial Clause]] - U.S. Const. art.

The frequency of an oscillator is altered \"in accordance with the [[amplitude]] of a modulating signal.\" {{harv|Dodge|Jerse|1997|p=115}}\n\nFM synthesis can create both harmonic and [[Inharmonicity|inharmonic]] sounds. For synthesizing harmonic sounds, the modulating signal must have a [[harmonic]] relationship to the original carrier signal. As the amount of frequency modulation increases, the sound grows progressively more complex. Through the use of modulators with frequencies that are non-integer multiples of the carrier signal (i.e. non-harmonic), [[Atonality|atonal]] and [[Tonality|tonal]] bell-like and percussive sounds can easily be created.\n\nFM synthesis using analog [[oscillator]]s may result in pitch instability. However, FM synthesis can also be implemented digitally, the latter proving to be more 'reliable' and is currently seen as standard practice. Digital FM synthesis (implemented as [[phase modulation]]) was the basis of several musical instruments beginning as early as 1974. Yamaha built the first prototype [[digital synthesizer]] in 1974, based on FM synthesis,<ref name=yamaha2014/> before commercially releasing the Yamaha GS-1 in 1980.<ref name=\"roads\"/> The [[Synclavier|Synclavier I]], manufactured by [[New England Digital|New England Digital Corporation]] beginning in 1978, included a digital FM synthesizer, using an FM synthesis algorithm licensed from Yamaha.<ref name=mixmag2006>{{cite journal | title\t= 1978 New England Digital Synclavier | url  \t= http://www.mixonline.com/news/news-products/1978-new-england-digital-synclavier/383609 | date \t= September 1, 2006 | journal\t= Mix | publisher\t= Penton Media}}</ref> Yamaha's groundbreaking [[Yamaha DX7|DX7]], released in 1983, brought FM to the forefront of synthesis in the mid-1980s.\n\nFM synthesis had also become the usual setting for games and software until the mid-nineties.

[[Casio]] developed a related form of synthesis called [[phase distortion synthesis]], used in its [[Casio CZ synthesizers|CZ range of synthesizers]]. It had a similar (but slightly differently derived) sound quality to the DX series. [[Don Buchla]] implemented FM on his instruments in the mid-1960s, prior to Yamaha's patent.

The FM synthesis patent brought Stanford $20&nbsp;million before it expired, making it (in 1994) \"the second most lucrative licensing agreement in Stanford's history\".<ref>Stanford University News Service (06/07/94), [http://news.stanford.edu/pr/94/940607Arc4222.html Music synthesis approaches sound quality of real instruments]</ref> FM today is mostly found in software-based synths such as FM8 by [[Native Instruments]] or [[Sytrus]] by [[Image-Line]], but it has also been incorporated into the synthesis repertoire of some modern digital synthesizers, usually coexisting as an option alongside other methods of synthesis such as [[subtractive synthesis|subtractive]], [[sample-based synthesis]], [[additive synthesis]], and other techniques. The degree of complexity of the FM in such hardware synths may vary from simple 2-operator FM, to the highly flexible 6-operator engines of the [[Korg Kronos]] and [[Alesis Fusion]], to creation of FM in extensively modular engines such as those in the latest synthesisers by [[Kurzweil Music Systems]].\n\nNew hardware synths specifically marketed for their FM capabilities disappeared from the market after the release of the [[Yamaha SY99]] and [[Yamaha FS1R|FS1R]], and even those marketed their highly powerful FM abilities as counterparts to [[sample-based synthesis]] and [[formant synthesis]] respectively. However, well-developed FM synthesis options are a feature of [[Nord Lead]] synths manufactured by Clavia, the [[Alesis Fusion]] range, the [[Korg Oasys]] and [[Korg Kronos|Kronos]] and the Modor NF-1. Various other synthesizers offer limited FM abilities to supplement their main engines.\n\nMost recently, in 2016, [[Korg]] released the Korg Volca FM, an FM iteration of the Korg [[Volca]] series of compact, affordable desktop modules, and Yamaha released the Montage, which combines a 128-voice sample-based engine with a 128-voice FM engine. This iteration of FM is called FM-X, and features 8 operators; each operator has a choice of several basic wave forms, but each wave form has several parameters to adjust its spectrum. Elektron now in 2018 have the Digitone, an FM synth in a Elektrons renown sequence engine.\n\nFMX synthesis was introduced with the Yamaha Montage synthesizers in 2016.  FMX uses 8 operators. Each FMX operator has a set of multi-spectral wave forms to choose from, which means each FMX operator can be equivalent to a stack of 3 or 4 DX7 FM operators.  The list of selectable wave forms includes sine waves, the All1 and All2 wave forms, the Odd1 and Odd2 wave forms, and the Res1 and Res2 wave forms. The sine wave selection works the same as the DX7 wave forms.  The All1 and All2 wave forms are a saw-tooth wave form.  The Odd1 and Odd2 wave forms are pulse or square waves.  These two types of wave forms can be used to model the basic harmonic peaks in the bottom of the harmonic spectrum of most instruments.  The Res1 and Res2 wave forms move the spectral peak to a specific harmonic and can be used to model either triangular or rounded groups of harmonics further up in the spectrum of an instrument.  Combining an All1 or Odd1 wave form with multiple Res1 (or Res2) wave forms (and adjusting their amplitudes) can model the harmonic spectrum of an instrument or sound.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://javelinart.com/FM_Synthesis_of_Real_Instruments.pdf|title=FM_Synthesis_of_Real_Instruments|last=Zollinger|first=W.

The FS1R had 16 operators, 8 standard FM operators and 8 additional operators that used a noise source rather than an oscillator as its sound source.  By adding in tuneable noise sources the FS1R could model the sounds produced in the human voice and in a wind instrument, along with making percussion instrument sounds. The FS1R also contained an additional wave form called the Formant wave form.  Formants can be used to model resonating body instrument sounds like the cello, violin, acoustic guitar, bassoon, English horn, or human voice.

He was the first astronomer who determined reliable values for the distance from the sun to another star by the method of [[parallax]]. A special type of mathematical functions were named [[Bessel function]]s after Bessel's death, though they had originally been discovered by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and then generalised by Bessel.\n\n== Life and family ==\n\nBessel was born in [[Minden]], [[Westphalia]], administrative center of [[Minden-Ravensberg]], as second son of a civil servant. He was born into a large family in Germany. At the age of 14 Bessel was apprenticed to the import-export concern Kulenkamp at [[Bremen]]. The business's reliance on cargo ships led him to turn his [[mathematics|mathematical]] skills to problems in [[navigation]]. This in turn led to an interest in [[astronomy]] as a way of determining [[longitude]].\n\nBessel came to the attention of a major figure of German astronomy at the time, [[Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers]], by producing a refinement on the orbital calculations for [[Halley's Comet]] in 1804, using old observation data taken from [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[Nathaniel Torporley]] in 1607.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nTwo years later Bessel left Kulenkamp and became [[Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter]]'s assistant at [[Lilienthal, Lower Saxony|Lilienthal]] Observatory near [[Bremen]]. There he worked on [[James Bradley]]'s stellar observations to produce precise positions for some 3,222 stars.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn January 1810, at the age of 25, Bessel was appointed director of the newly founded [[K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory]] by King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]]. On the recommendation of fellow mathematician and physicist [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (with whom he regularly corresponded)<ref>Clifford J. Cunningham, ''Bode's Law and the Discovery of Juno: Historical Studies in Asteroid Research'', Springer, 2017, pp. 121ff..</ref> he was awarded an honorary doctor degree from the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in March 1811.\n\nAround that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence.<ref>Helmut Koch, ''Introduction to Classical Mathematics I: From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law to the Uniformization Theorem'', Springer, p. 90.</ref> However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are not known.<ref>Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1842 Bessel took part in the annual meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Manchester, accompanied by the geophysicist [[Georg Adolf Erman]] and the mathematician [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]].\n\nBessel married Johanna, the daughter of the chemist and pharmacist [[Karl Gottfried Hagen]] who was the uncle of the physician and biologist [[Hermann August Hagen]] and the hydraulic engineer [[Gotthilf Hagen]], the latter also Bessel's student and assistant from 1816 to 1818. The physicist [[Franz Ernst Neumann]], Bessel's close companion and colleague, was married to Johanna Hagen's sister Florentine. Neumann introduced Bessel's exacting methods of measurement and data reduction into his mathematico-physical seminar, which he co-directed with [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] at K\u00f6nigsberg.<ref>{{Cite book | first1=Kathryn M. | last1=Olesko | title=Physics as a Calling: Discipline and Practice in the K\u00f6nigsberg Seminar for Physics | publisher=Cornell University Press | year=1991 }}</ref> These exacting methods had a lasting impact upon the work of Neumann's students and upon the Prussian conception of precision in measurement.\n\nBessel had two sons and three daughters. His eldest daughter, Marie, married Georg Adolf Erman, member of the scholar family [[Erman]]. One of their sons was the renowned [[Egyptologist]] [[Adolf Erman]].\n\nAfter several months of illness Bessel died in March 1846 at his observatory from [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal | ref = {{harvid|Bessel|1846}}| doi = 10.1002/asna.18460240402 | title = Bessel's Tod | language = German| trans-title = Bessel's death| journal = Astronomische Nachrichten | volume = 24 | issue = 556| pages = 49\u201352 | year = 1846 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-qAEAAAAQAAJ&&pg=PA50| bibcode = 1846AN.....24...49B}}</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n[[File:Koenigsberg observatory.jpg|right|thumb|[[K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory]] in  1830. It was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War.]]\n\nWhile the observatory was still in construction Bessel elaborated the ''Fundamenta Astronomiae'' based on Bradley's observations. As a preliminary result he produced tables of [[atmospheric refraction]] that won him the [[Lalande Prize]] from the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1811. The K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory began operation in 1813.\n\nStarting in 1819, Bessel determined the position of over 50,000 stars using a [[meridian circle]] from [[Georg von Reichenbach|Reichenbach]], assisted by some of his qualified students. The most prominent of them was [[Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander]].\n\nWith this work done, Bessel was able to achieve the feat for which he is best remembered today: he is credited with being the first to use [[parallax]] in [[Cosmic distance ladder|calculating the distance to a star]]. Astronomers had believed for some time that parallax would provide the first accurate measurement of interstellar distances\u2014in fact, in the 1830s there was a fierce competition between astronomers to be the first to measure a [[stellar parallax]] accurately. In 1838 Bessel won the race, announcing that [[61 Cygni]] had a parallax of 0.314 [[arcsecond]]s; which, given the diameter of the [[Earth]]'s orbit, indicated that the star is 10.3 ly away.<ref>{{Cite journal | ref = harv| last = Bessel | first = F.

Nearly at the same time [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] and [[Thomas James Henderson|Thomas Henderson]] measured the parallaxes of [[Vega]] and [[Alpha Centauri]].\n\nAs well as helping determine the parallax of 61 Cygni, Bessel's precise measurements using a new meridian circle from ''Adolf Repsold'' allowed him to notice deviations in the motions of [[Sirius]] and [[Procyon]], which he deduced must be caused by the gravitational attraction of unseen companions.<ref>\n{{Cite journal | ref = harv| last = Bessel | first = F.

His method simplified the calculation to such an extent, without sacrificing accuracy, that it is still in use today.\n\nBessel's work in 1840 contributed to the [[discovery of Neptune]] in 1846 at [[Berlin Observatory]], several months after Bessel's death. On Bessel's proposal (1825) the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] started the edition of the ''Berliner Akademische Sternkarten'' (''Berlin Academic Star Charts'') as an international project. One unpublished new chart enabled [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to find Neptune near the position calculated by LeVerrier in 1846.\n\nIn the second decade of the 19th century while studying the dynamics of 'many-body' gravitational systems, Bessel developed what are now known as [[Bessel function]]s. Critical for the solution of certain [[differential equations]], these functions are used throughout both classical and [[quantum physics]].\n\nBessel is responsible for the correction to the formula for the [[sample variance]] estimator named in his honour. This is the use of the factor ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 in the denominator of the formula, rather than just ''n''. This occurs when the ''sample mean'' rather than the ''population mean'' is used to centre the data and since the sample mean is a linear combination of the data the residual to the sample mean overcounts the number of degrees of freedom by the number of constraint equations \u2014 in this case one. ''(Also see [[Bessel's correction]])''.\n\nAn additional field of work was [[geodesy]].<ref>{{cite conference\n|first = T. |last = Viik\n|title = F.W.

This assumes the [[mediocrity principle]], by which the Earth is a typical [[planet]].\n\nThe second aspect of the Fermi paradox is the argument of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], it seems possible that at least some civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own [[star system]] and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe, of other intelligent life after 13.8&nbsp;billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific understanding of the nature of the universe itself is quite incomplete.\n\nThe Fermi paradox can be asked in two ways.<ref>See Hart for an example of \"no aliens are here\", and Webb for an example of the more general \"We see no signs of intelligence anywhere\".</ref> The first is, \"Why are no aliens or their artifacts found here on Earth, or in the Solar System?\" If [[interstellar travel]] is possible, even the \"slow\" kind nearly within the reach of Earth technology, then it would only take from 5 million to 50&nbsp;million years to colonize the galaxy.<ref name=cr>Crawford, I.A., [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=where-are-they \"Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all\"], '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38\u201343, (2000).</ref> This is relatively brief on a [[geological time|geological scale]], let alone a [[Timeline of the Big Bang|cosmological one]]. Since there are many stars older than the Sun, and since intelligent life might have evolved earlier elsewhere, the question then becomes why the galaxy has not been colonized already.

In the absence of an apparent natural cause, alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. It should be noted however that the most sensitive radio telescopes currently available on Earth would not be able to detect non-directional radio signals even at a fraction of a [[light-year]], so it is questionable whether any such signals could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization.  Such signals could be either \"accidental\" by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the [[Arecibo message]].

He proposed that a Dyson sphere could be a possible means: a shell or cloud of objects enclosing a star to absorb and utilize as much radiant energy as possible. Such a feat of [[astroengineering]] would drastically alter the observed [[spectroscopy|spectrum]] of the star involved, changing it at least partly from the normal [[emission line]]s of a natural [[stellar atmosphere]] to those of [[black body radiation]], probably with a peak in the [[infrared]].

A signal is much easier to detect if the signal energy is limited to either a [[narrowband|narrow]] range of frequencies, or directed at a specific part of the sky. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds to tens of thousands of light-years distance.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=December 1975 |pages=462\u2013466 |title=The Arecibo message of November, 1974 |author=The Staff at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103575901165 |bibcode = 1975Icar...26..462. |doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(75)90116-5 }}  \"A radio telescope in M13 operating at the transmission frequency, and pointed toward the Sun at the time the message arrives at the receiving site will observe a flux density from the message which will exceed the flux density of the Sun itself by a factor of roughly 10<sup>7</sup>. Indeed, at that unique time, the Sun will appear to the receptors to be by far the brightest star of the Milky Way.\"</ref> However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.\n\nThus to detect alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth observers either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien radio technology are much stronger than our own; that one of SETI's programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions in our general direction.\n\n=== Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time ===\nIt may be that alien civilizations are detectable through their radio emissions for only a short time, reducing the likelihood of spotting them.

It soon spread to conservatives among the [[Baptists]] and other denominations around 1910 to 1920.

The term was prefigured by ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a collection of twelve books on five subjects published in 1910 and funded by the brothers Milton and [[Lyman Stewart]], but coined by Curtis Lee Lawes, editor of ''The Watchman-Examiner'', who proposed in the wake of the 1920 pre-convention meeting of the Northern Baptist Convention (now the [[American Baptist Churches USA]]) that those fighting for the fundamentals of the faith be called \"fundamentalists.\"<ref>Curtis Lee Laws, \"Convention Side Lights,\" The Watchman-Examiner, 8, no. 27 (1 July 1920), p 834.</ref> ''The Fundamentals'' came to represent a ''[[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]]'' that appeared late in the 19th century within some Protestant denominations in the United States, and continued in earnest through the 1920s. The first formulation of American fundamentalist beliefs traces to the Niagara Bible Conference and, in 1910, to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, which distilled these into what became known as the ''five fundamentals'':<ref>George M.

Christensen's politics were left-wing, deriving from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], but she believed that leftist ideas had a formative influence on both Italian Fascism and German National-Socialism, whose totalitarian perversions were a betrayal of these movements' socialist roots. Elements of a leftist and libertarian racial-socialism could therefore be reclaimed from the fascism in which they had become encrusted.<ref>Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 261.</ref> However, Christensen was also convinced that the diseases of Western culture demanded a spiritual remedy. Mills' almost-forgotten writings inspired her with a programme for re-connecting with the gods and goddesses of the old Norse and Germanic pantheons, which she identified with the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] in [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of the racial [[collective unconscious]].

In 1987, McNallen's [[Asatru Free Assembly]] collapsed from prolonged internal tensions arising from his repudiation of Nazi sympathizers within the organization. A group of these, including [[Wyatt Kaldenberg]], then joined the Odinist Fellowship (as its [[Los Angeles]] chapter) and formed an association with [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], which led to a further rebuff since \"Else Christensen thought Metzger too racist, and members of the Arizona Kindred also wanted the Fellowship to be pro-white but not hostile to colored races and Jews\".<ref name=\"GC262\">Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 262.</ref> A series of defections from both of the main US-based organizations created secessionist groups with more radical agendas, among them Kaldenberg's ''Pagan Revival'' network and [[Jost Turner]]'s ''[[National Socialist Kindred]]''.<ref name=\"GC262\"/>\n\nKaplan and Weinberg note that \"the religious component of the Euro-American radical right subculture includes both pagan and Christian or pseudo-Christian elements,\" locating Satanist or Odinist Nazi Skinhead sects in the United States ([[Ben Klassen]]'s atheistic [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity Movement]]), Britain ([[David Myatt]]), Germany, Scandinavia and South Africa.<ref>Kaplan and Weinberg 1998: 88.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, some [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups and terrorists&mdash;including several with neo-fascist or neo-Nazi leanings&mdash;have built their ideologies around pagan religious imagery, including Odinism or Wotanism.

According to economist [[John Quiggin]], the standard features of \"economic fundamentalist rhetoric\" are \"dogmatic\" assertions and the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist.

Public Lecture, Faith and Reason Conference, San Antonio, TX. 2006.</ref>\n\nA criticism by [[Elliot N. Dorff]]:\n<blockquote>In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.<ref>Dorff, Elliot N. and Rosett, Arthur, A Living Tree; The Roots and Growth of Jewish Law, SUNY Press, 1988.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Howard Thurman]] was interviewed in the late 1970s for a BBC feature on religion. He told the interviewer:\n{{quote|I say that creeds, dogmas, and theologies are inventions of the mind. It is the nature of the mind to make sense out of experience, to reduce the conglomerates of experience to units of comprehension which we call principles, or ideologies, or concepts. Religious experience is dynamic, fluid, effervescent, yeasty. But the mind can't handle these so it has to imprison religious experience in some way, get it bottled up. Then, when the experience quiets down, the mind draws a bead on it and extracts concepts, notions, dogmas, so that religious experience can make sense to the mind. Meanwhile religious experience goes on experiencing, so that by the time I get my dogma stated so that I can think about it, the religious experience becomes an object of thought.<ref>[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1981/v38-2-criticscorner1.htm \"An Interview With Howard Thurman and Ronald Eyre\"], ''Theology Today'', Volume 38, Issue 2 (July 1981).</ref>}}\n\nInfluential criticisms of fundamentalism include [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]]'s books on Christian fundamentalism and [[Bassam Tibi]]'s analysis of Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nPolitical usage of the term \"fundamentalism\" has also been criticized. \"Fundamentalism\" has been used by political groups to attack their opponents, using the term flexibly depending on their political interests. According to Judith Nagata, a professor of Asia Research Institute in the [[National University of Singapore]], \"The Afghan ''mujahiddin'', locked in combat with the Soviet enemy in the 1980s, could be praised as 'freedom fighters' by their American backers at the time, while the present Taliban, viewed, among other things, as protectors of American enemy Osama bin Laden, are unequivocally 'fundamentalist'.\"<ref>Nagata, Judith. 2001.

Elin is [[Extraversion and introversion#Extroversion|outgoing]] and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly [[clinical depression|depressed]]. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\n\nAgnes's parents worry about their daughter's [[reclusive]] life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th [[party#Birthday party|birthday party]] for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party.\n\nElin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a [[lesbian]]. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\n\nAfter becoming [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from [[Self-harm|cutting herself]]. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in \u00c5m\u00e5l. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving \u00c5m\u00e5l and going to [[Stockholm]]. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to [[hitchhike]] to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car.\n\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her [[virginity]] during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to '[[coming out|out]]' their relationship to the school.\n\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk.

Many prominent security researchers favor full disclosure, whereas most vendors prefer coordinated disclosure. Non disclosure is generally favoured by commercial exploit vendors and [[Hacker (computer security)#Black hat|blackhat hackers]].<ref name=\"Moore2005\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=Cybercrime: Investigating High Technology Computer Crime|year=2005|publisher=Matthew Bender & Company|isbn=1-59345-303-5|page=258}}</ref>\n\n=== Coordinated disclosure ===\n\nProponents of coordinated disclosure believe that software vendors have the right to control vulnerability information concerning their products.<ref name=rfc>{{cite web|last=Christey|first=Steve|title=Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Process|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00|publisher=IETF|accessdate=29 April 2013|page=3.3.2}}</ref> The primary tenet of coordinated disclosure is that nobody should be informed about a vulnerability until the software vendor gives their permission. While there are often exceptions or variations of this policy, distribution must initially be limited and vendors are given privileged access to nonpublic research. Advocates for coordinated disclosure often prefer the weighted but less-descriptive term \u201c[[responsible disclosure]]\u201d coined by Microsoft Security Manager Scott Culp in his essay \u201cIt's Time to End Information Anarchy\u201d<ref name=culp>{{cite web |last=Culp |first=Scott |title=It\u2019s Time to End Information Anarchy |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/columns/security/noarch.asp |work=Technet Security |publisher=Microsoft TechNet |accessdate=29 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011109045330/http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=%2Ftechnet%2Fcolumns%2Fsecurity%2Fnoarch.asp |archivedate=November 9, 2001 |df= }}</ref> (referring to full disclosure).

As Microsoft explain, \"[Coordinated disclosure] serves everyone's best interests by ensuring that customers receive comprehensive, high-quality updates for security vulnerabilities but are not exposed to malicious attacks while the update is being developed.\"<ref name=mssec>{{cite web|last=Microsoft Security|title=Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure|url=https://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/report/disclosure.aspx|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Full disclosure ===\n\nFull disclosure is the policy of publishing information on vulnerabilities without restriction as early as possible, making the information accessible to the general public without restriction. In general, proponents of full disclosure believe that the benefits of freely available vulnerability research outweigh the risks, whereas opponents prefer to limit the distribution.\n\nThe free availability of vulnerability information allows users and administrators to understand and react to vulnerabilities in their systems, and allows customers to pressure vendors to fix vulnerabilities that vendors may otherwise feel no incentive to solve. There are some fundamental problems with coordinated disclosure that full disclosure can resolve.\n\n* If customers do not know about vulnerabilities, they cannot request patches, and vendors experience no economic incentive to correct vulnerabilities.\n* Administrators cannot make informed decisions about the risks to their systems, as information on vulnerabilities is restricted.\n* Malicious researchers who also know about the flaw, have a long period of time to continue exploiting the flaw.\n\nDiscovery of a specific flaw or vulnerability is not a mutually exclusive event, multiple researchers with differing motivations can and do discover the same flaws independently.\n\nThere is no standard way to make vulnerability information available to the public, researchers often use mailing lists dedicated to the topic, academic papers or industry conferences.\n\n=== Non disclosure ===\n\nNon disclosure is the principle that no vulnerability information should be shared, or should only be shared under non-disclosure agreement (either contractually or informally).\n\nCommon proponents of non-disclosure include commercial exploit vendors, researchers who intend to exploit the flaws they find,<ref name=sans /> and vendors who believe that any vulnerability information whatsoever assists attackers.\n\n=== Debate ===\n\n==== Arguments against coordinated disclosure ====\n\nResearchers in favour of coordinated disclosure believe that users cannot make use of advanced knowledge of vulnerabilities without guidance from the vendor, and that the majority is best served by limiting distribution of vulnerability information. Advocates argue that low-skilled attackers can use this information to perform sophisticated attacks that would otherwise be beyond their ability, and the potential benefit does not outweigh the potential harm caused by malevolent actors. Only when the vendor has prepared guidance that even the most unsophisticated users can digest should the information be made public.\n\nThis argument presupposes that vulnerability discovery is a mutually exclusive event, that only one person can discover a vulnerability. There are many examples of vulnerabilities being discovered simultaneously, often being exploited in secrecy before discovery by other researchers.<ref name=ac1d>{{cite web|last=B1tch3z|first=Ac1d|title=Ac1db1tch3z vs x86_64 Linux Kernel|url=http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Sep/268|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref> While there may exist users who cannot benefit from vulnerability information, full disclosure advocates believe this demonstrates a contempt for the intelligence of end users. While it's true that some users cannot benefit from vulnerability information, if they're concerned with the security of their networks they are in a position to hire an expert to assist them as you would hire a mechanic to help with a car.\n\n==== Arguments against non disclosure ====\n\nNon disclosure is typically used when a researcher intends to use knowledge of a vulnerability to attack computer systems operated by their enemies, or to trade knowledge of a vulnerability to a third party for profit, who will typically use it to attack their enemies.\n\nResearchers practicing non disclosure are generally not concerned with improving security or protecting networks. However, some proponents argue that they simply do not want to assist vendors, and claim no intent to harm others.\n\nWhile full and coordinated disclosure advocates declare similar goals and motivations, simply disagreeing on how best to achieve them, non disclosure is entirely incompatible.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full disclosure (computer security)}}\n[[Category:Computer security procedures]]", "sha1": "41j2pudxe8y53ocyqmx1g7zgygc0c4f"}}, {"title": "Feminist theology", "ns": "0", "id": "11587", "revision": {"id": "864327611", "parentid": "848622866", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T14:29:22Z", "contributor": {"username": "Caorongjin", "id": "1506993"}, "comment": "Remove unsourced materials", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the journal|Feminist Theology (journal)}}\n{{Feminism sidebar |Variants}}\n'''Feminist theology''' is a movement found in several religions, including [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[New Thought]], to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of those religions from a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective. Some of the goals of feminist [[theology]] include increasing the role of women among the [[clergy]] and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about [[God]], determining women's place in relation to career and [[motherhood]], and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts and [[matriarchal religion]].\n\n== Methodology ==\n\n===Development of theology===\nAccording to Grenz and Olson in their review of Feminist Theology, \"it was developed in three distinct steps. They begin with a critique of the past\u201d such that they review the ways women have been oppressed; \u201cthey seek alternative biblical and extrabiblical traditions that support\u201d the ideals Feminists are trying to advance; and finally \u201cfeminists set forth their own unique method of theology, which includes the revisioning of Christian categories.\u201d<ref>Grenz and Olson, p. 227.</ref> Grenz and Olson also mention, however, while all feminists agree there is a flaw in the system, there is disagreement over how far outside of the Bible and the Christian tradition women are willing to go to seek support for their ideals.<ref>Grenz and Olson, p. 229.</ref>\n\nIt has frequently been said that feminist theology draws on women's experience as a basic source of content as well as a criterion of truth.\nThere has been a tendency to treat this principle of \"experience\" as unique to feminist theology (or, perhaps to liberation theologies) and to see it as distant from \"objective\" source of truth of classical theologies. This seems to be a misunderstanding of the experimental base of all theological reflection.

Priestesses held dominion over aspects of [[Inca Empire|Incan]], [[Assyria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Religion in India|Indian]], and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] religions in the millennia prior to the inception of [[Patriarchal religion]].\n\n===Gender and God===\n{{main|Gender of God}}\nOthers who practice feminist spirituality may instead adhere to a feminist re-interpretation of Western monotheistic traditions. In those cases, the notion of [[God]] as having a male gender is rejected, and God is not referred to using male pronouns. Feminist spirituality may also object to images of God that they perceive as authoritarian, parental, or disciplinarian, instead emphasizing \"maternal\" attributes such as nurturing, acceptance, and creativity.\n\n[[Carol P. Christ]] is the author of the widely reprinted essay \"Why Women Need the Goddess\",<ref>{{cite web |title= per Carol P Christ biography for Signs Out of Time Project|url=http://www.belili.org/marija/bios/carol_christ.html}}</ref> which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme [[goddess]]. This essay was presented as the keynote address to an audience of over 500 at the \"Great Goddess Re-emerging\" conference at the [[University of Santa Cruz]] in the spring of 1978, and was first published in ''Heresies: The Great Goddess Issue'' (1978), pgs. 8-13.<ref name=\"goddessariadne.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goddessariadne.org/#!why-women-need-the-goddess-part-1/cufo|title=Goddess Tours Greece-Sacred Sites Tour-Goddess Pilgrimage Crete|website=Goddess Tours Greece-Sacred Sites Tour-Goddess Pilgrimage Crete|accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> Carol P.

Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judaism.\n\nVarious versions of feminist theology exist within the Jewish community.\n\nSome of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterisation of God within the [[siddur]] (Jewish prayerbook) and service.\n\nIn 1976, [[Rita Gross]] published the article \"Female God Language in a Jewish Context\" (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist [[Judith Plaskow]] considers \"probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Gender_and_Feminism/Feminist_Thought/Theology.shtml |title=Jewish Feminist Theology: A Survey |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhushara.com/book/torah/cardoza/ssin.htm |title=Standing at Sinai |publisher=Dhushara.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> &nbsp;Gross was Jewish herself at this time.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJs-aLqCiF8C&pg=PA200&dq=rita+gross+jew&hl=en&ei=j1I9T8y6Loy_0QGp4qHpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CDYQ6wEwADgU#v=onepage&q=rita%20gross%20jew&f=false |title=Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah: New Insights and Scholarship - Frederick Greenspahn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[Rabbi]] [[Rebecca Alpert]] (''Reform Judaism'', Winter 1991) comments:\n{{quote|The experience of praying with ''Siddur Nashim'' [the first Sabbath prayer book to refer to God using female pronouns and imagery]  ... transformed my relationship with God.

Was this the relationship that men have had with God for all these millennia? How wonderful to gain access to those feelings and perceptions.}} ''Siddur Nashim'' was self-published in 1976 by Naomi Janowitz and [[Margaret Wenig]].\n\nIn 1990 Rabbi [[Margaret Wenig]] wrote the sermon, \"God Is a Woman and She Is Growing Older\", which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California.<ref>[http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/MargaretWenig.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925104018/http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/MargaretWenig.shtml |date=September 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nRabbi [[Paula Reimers]] (\"Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother\", ''Conservative Judaism'' '''46''' (1993)) comments:\n{{quote|Those who want to use God/She language want to affirm womanhood and the feminine aspect of the deity. They do this by emphasizing that which most clearly distinguishes the female experience from the male.

Once God is called female, then, the metaphor of birth and the identification of the deity with nature and its processes become inevitable}}\n\nAhuva Zache affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (''Is God male, female, both or neither?

She has three doctorate degrees. One from St. Mary\u2019s College in sacred theology, and two from University of Fribourg, Switzerland in theology and philosophy. From 1966 till the end of her career she taught at Boston College. While in her early works Daly expressed a desire to reform Christianity from the inside, she would later come to the same point as several other feminists, that Christianity is not able to enact the necessary changes as it is. (Prologue Daly). \u201cOn November 14, 1971, when she was invited to be the first woman to preach at Harvard Memorial Chapel. She used the opportunity to denounce Christianity as irredeemable for women and to call for women (and men) to make an exodus from the Church. Almost all the women who attended this service walked out with her, as well as a few men.\u201d<ref>Ruether, p. 217.</ref> Her works include: ''The Church and the Second Sex'' (1968), ''Beyond God the Father'' (1973), ''Gyn/ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' (1978), ''Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy'' (1984), ''Webster\u2019s First Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language'' (1987), and ''Outercourse: The Be-Dazzling Voyage'' (1992).

From her, kings are born.\nFrom woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at all.\"\n\n\u2014 Guru Nanak\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{See also|Feminism in India#Hindu feminism|Kalavati tantra}}\nWithin Ancient Hinduism, women have been held in equal honour as men. [[Manusmriti]] for example states: ''The society that provides respect and dignity to women flourishes with nobility and prosperity. And a society that does not put women on such a high pedestal has to face miseries and failures regardless of how so much noble deeds they perform otherwise.'' Manusmrithi Chapter 3 Verse 56.\n\nWithin the [[Vedas]] the Hindu holy texts, women were given the highest possible respect and equality. The [[Vedic]] period was glorified by this tradition. Many [[rishis]] were women. Indeed, several of them authored many of the slokas in the Vedas. For instance, in the Rigveda there is a list of women rishis. Some of them are: [[Ghosha]], [[Godha]], [[Gargi]], [[Vishwawra]], Apala, Upanishad, Brahmjaya, [[Aditi]], [[Indrani]], Sarma, Romsha, [[Maitreyi]], [[Kathyayini]], [[Urvashi]], [[Lopamudra]], Yami, [[Shashwati]], Sri, Laksha and many others. In the Vedic period women were free to enter into [[brahmacharya]] just like men, and attain [[salvation]].\n\nDuring [[Hindu marriage]] ceremonies the following slokas are uttered by the grooms but, these days, their import little understood or ever attempted to understand.\n\n\"O bride! I accept your hand to enhance our joint good fortune. I pray to you to accept me as your husband and live with me until our old age. ...\" ''Rigveda Samhita'' Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9702\n\n\"O bride! May you be like the empress of your mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law (sisters and brothers of the groom). May your writ run in your house.\" ''Rigveda Samhita'' Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9712\n\nThis beautifully lyrical sloka from the Atharvaveda clearly states that the woman leads and the man follows: \"The Sun God follows the first illuminated and enlightened goddess Usha (dawn) in the same manner as men emulate and follow women.\" ''Athravaveda Samhita'', Part 2, Kanda 27, sukta 107, sloka 5705.\n\nWomen were considered to be the embodiment of great virtue and wisdom. Thus we have: \"O bride! May the knowledge of the Vedas be in front of you and behind you, in your centre and in your ends. May you conduct your life after attaining the knowledge of the Vedas. May you be benevolent, the harbinger of good fortune and health and live in great dignity and indeed illuminate your husband's home.\" ''Atharva Veda'' 14-1-64. Women were allowed full freedom of worship. \"The wife should do agnihotra (yagna), sandhya (puja) and all other daily religious rituals. If, for some reason, her husband is not present, the woman alone has full rights to do yagna\". ''Rigveda Samhita'', part 1, sukta 79, sloka 872.\n\nMoving on towards the Monotheistic era of Hinduism when such ideals such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]], a specific deity for feministic worship was bought about under the [[Shaktism]] branch. From a Hinduism point of view women are equal in all measures to men in comparison.\n\n===Neopaganism===\n{{main|Goddess movement|Dianic Wicca}}\nSome currents of [[Neopaganism]], in particular [[Wicca]], have a [[Dualistic cosmology|ditheistic]] concept of a single goddess and a single god, who in [[hieros gamos]] represent a united whole. [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Polytheistic reconstructionists]] focus on reconstructing polytheistic religions, including the various goddesses and figures associated with indigenous cultures.\n\nThe term ''[[thealogy]]'' is sometimes used in the context of the Neopagan Goddess movement, a pun on [[theology]] and ''thea'' \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac \"goddess\" intended to suggest a [[feminist]] approach to [[theism]].\n\nThe Goddess movement is a loose grouping of social and religious phenomena that grew out of [[second-wave feminism]], predominantly in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in the 1970s, and the metaphysical community as well. Spurred by the perception that women were not treated equitably in many religions, some women turned to a Female Deity as more in tune with their spiritual needs. Education in the Arts became a vehicle for the study of humanitarian philosophers like [[David Hume]] at that time. A unifying theme of this diverse movement is the femaleness of [[Deity]] (as opposed and contrasted to a [[patriarchal]] [[God]]).\n\n[[Goddess]] beliefs take many forms: some people in the Goddess movement recognize multiple goddesses; some also include gods; others honour what they refer to as \"the Goddess,\" which is not necessarily seen as monotheistic, but is often understood to be an inclusive, encompassing term incorporating many goddesses in many different cultures. The term \"the Goddess\" may also be understood to include a multiplicity of ways to view deity personified as female, or as a metaphor, or as a process. (Christ 1997, 2003) The term \"The Goddess\" may also refer to the concept of The One Divine Power, or the traditionally worshipped \"Great Goddess\" of ancient times.\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, feminism was influential in the rise of [[Neopaganism]] in the [[United States]], and particularly the [[Dianic tradition]]. Some feminists find the worship of a [[goddess]], rather than a [[god]], to be consonant with their views. Others are polytheists, and worship a number of goddesses. The collective set of beliefs associated with this is sometimes known as [[thealogy]] and sometimes referred to as the [[Goddess movement]].

Freeware (green) seldom expose their source codes.<ref name=\"wolfire2010\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Open-source-software-is-not-always-freeware |title=Open-source software is not always freeware |date=May 16, 2010 |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=David |last=Rosen |publisher=wolfire.com}}</ref>]]\nThe [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) defines \"open source software\" (i.e., free software or free and open-source software), as distinct from \"freeware\" or \"shareware\"; it is software where \"the Government does not have access to the original source code\".<ref name=\"dod-definition\">{{citation | url=http://dodcio.defense.gov/OpenSourceSoftwareFAQ.aspx#Q:_Are_.22non-commercial_software.22.2C_.22freeware.22.2C_or_.22shareware.22_the_same_thing_as_open_source_software.3F | title=Frequently Asked Questions regarding Open Source Software (OSS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) | quote=Also, do not use the terms \"freeware\" or \"shareware\" as a synonym for \"open source software\". DoD Instruction 8500.2, \u201cInformation Assurance (IA) Implementation\u201d, Enclosure 4, control DCPD-1, states that these terms apply to software where \"the Government does not have access to the original source code\".  The government does have access to the original source code of open source software, so these terms do not apply. | accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> The \"free\" in \"freeware\" refers to the price of the software, which is typically [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and distributed without source code. By contrast, the \"free\" in \"free software\" refers to freedoms granted users under the software license (for example, to run the program for any purpose, modify and redistribute the program to others), and such software may be sold at a price.\n\nAccording to the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), \"freeware\" is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition, although FSF asks that [[free software]] (libre; unrestricted and with source code available) should not be called freeware.<ref name=\"gnu\" />\nIn contrast the Oxford English Dictionary simply characterizes freeware as being \"available free of charge (sometimes with the suggestion that users should make a donation to the provider)\".<ref>{{OED|freeware}}</ref>\n\nSome freeware products are released alongside paid versions that either have more features or less restrictive licensing terms. This approach is known as [[freemium]] (\"free\" + \"premium\"), since the free version is intended as a promotion for the premium version.<ref name=\"freeisnot\"/> The two often share a code base, using a [[compiler flag]] to determine which is produced. For example, [[BBEdit]] has a [[BBEdit Lite]] edition which has fewer features. [[XnView]] is available free of charge for personal use but must be licensed for commercial use. The free version may be advertising supported, as was the case with the [[DivX]].\n\n{{Anchor|Registerware}}[[Ad-supported software]] and free registerware also bear resemblances to freeware. Ad-supported software does not ask for payment for a license, but displays advertising to either compensate for development costs or as a means of income. Registerware forces the user to subscribe with the publisher before being able to use the product.

While the heavens were variously described as being like an umbrella covering the Earth (the Kai Tian theory), or like a sphere surrounding it (the Hun Tian theory), or as being without substance while the heavenly bodies float freely (the Hs\u00fcan yeh theory), the Earth was at all times flat, although perhaps bulging up slightly.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Cullen |title=A Chinese Eratosthenes of the Flat Earth: A Study of a Fragment of Cosmology in Huai Nan tzu \u6dee \u5357 \u5b50 |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies |volume=39 |issue=1 |date=1976 |pages=106\u201327 [p. 107] |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00052137 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe model of an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] was often used by Chinese astronomers such as [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139 AD) to describe [[Celestial sphere|the heavens]] as spherical:\n<blockquote> The heavens are like a hen's egg and as round as a [[crossbow]] bullet; the Earth is like the yolk of the egg, and lies in the centre.<ref name=\"needham\">{{cite book|title=Science and Civilisation in China|last=Needham|first=Joseph|date=1959|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=0-521-05801-5|volume=3|location=|page=219|pages=|author-link=Joseph Needham}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis analogy with a curved egg led some modern historians, notably [[Joseph Needham]], to conjecture that Chinese astronomers were, after all, aware of the Earth's sphericity. The egg reference, however, was rather meant to clarify the relative position of the flat Earth to the heavens:\n\n<blockquote>In a passage of Zhang Heng's cosmogony not translated by Needham, Zhang himself says: \"Heaven takes its body from the Yang, so it is round and in motion. Earth takes its body from the Yin, so it is flat and quiescent\". The point of the egg analogy is simply to stress that the Earth is completely enclosed by Heaven, rather than merely covered from above as the Kai Tian describes. Chinese astronomers, many of them brilliant men by any standards, continued to think in flat-Earth terms until the seventeenth century; this surprising fact might be the starting-point for a re-examination of the apparent facility with which the idea of a spherical Earth found acceptance in fifth-century BC Greece.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Cullen |title=Joseph Needham on Chinese Astronomy |journal=[[Past & Present (journal)|Past & Present]] |volume=87 |date=1980 |issue= |pages=39\u201353 [p. 42] |jstor=650565 |doi=10.1093/past/87.1.39}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFurther examples cited by Needham supposed to demonstrate dissenting voices from the ancient Chinese consensus actually refer without exception to the Earth being square, not to it being flat.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Cullen |title=A Chinese Eratosthenes of the Flat Earth: A Study of a Fragment of Cosmology in Huai Nan tzu \u6dee \u5357 \u5b50 |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies |volume=39 |issue=1 |date=1976 |pages=106\u201327 [p. 108] |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00052137 }}</ref> Accordingly, the 13th-century scholar [[Li Zhi (mathematician)|Li Ye]], who argued that the movements of the round heaven would be hindered by a square Earth,<ref name=\"needham volume 3 498\"/> did not advocate a spherical Earth, but rather that its edge should be rounded off so as to be circular.<ref name=\"Cullen 1976, 109\">{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Cullen |title=A Chinese Eratosthenes of the Flat Earth: A Study of a Fragment of Cosmology in Huai Nan tzu \u6dee \u5357 \u5b50 |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies |volume=39 |issue=1 |date=1976 |pages=106\u201327 [p. 109] |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00052137 }}</ref> However, Needham disagrees, affirming that Li Ye believed the Earth to be spherical, similar in shape to the heavens but much smaller.<ref>Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling.

It is attested from the time of the Christian late-Roman emperor [[Theodosius II]] (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the ''Reichsapfel'' was used in 1191 at the coronation of [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Henry VI]]. However the word 'orbis' means 'circle' and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west till that of [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492. Additionally it could well be a representation of the entire 'world' or [[cosmos]].\n\nA recent study of medieval concepts of the sphericity of the Earth noted that \"since the eighth century, no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Klaus Anselm |last=Vogel |title=''Sphaera terrae'' \u2013 das mittelalterliche Bild der Erde und die kosmographische Revolution |publisher=PhD dissertation Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen |date=1995 |page=19 |url=http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/diss/2000/vogel/index.htm#inhalt }}</ref> However, the work of these intellectuals may not have had significant influence on public opinion, and it is difficult to tell what the wider population may have thought of the shape of the Earth, if they considered the question at all.\n\n====Europe: Late Middle Ages====\n{{Further|Spherical Earth#Medieval Europe}}\n[[Image:Sacrobosco-1550-B3r-detail01.jpg|thumb|left|Picture from a 1550 edition of ''[[De sphaera mundi|On the Sphere of the World]]'', the most influential [[astronomy]] textbook of 13th-century Europe]]\n[[Hermannus Contractus]] (1013\u20131054) was among the earliest Christian scholars to estimate the circumference of Earth with [[Eratosthenes]]' method.

In these explorations, the sun's position moved more northward the further south the explorers travel. Its position directly overhead at noon gave evidence for crossing the equator. These apparent solar motions in detail were more consistent with north-south curvature and a distant sun, than with any flat-Earth explanation. The ultimate demonstration came when [[Magellan\u2013Elcano circumnavigation|Ferdinand Magellan's expedition]] completed the first global circumnavigation in 1521. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], one of the few survivors of the voyage, recorded the loss of a day in the course of the voyage, giving evidence for east-west curvature.

One of his supporters, John Hampden, lost a bet to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in the famous [[Bedford Level Experiment]], which attempted to prove it. In 1877 Hampden produced a book, \"A New Manual of Biblical Cosmography\".<ref>{{cite book| title=The Discovery of America| date= 1892| first= John|last= Fiske| page= 267|url= https://archive.org/details/discoveryameric13fiskgoog}}\n</ref> Rowbotham also produced studies that purported to show that the effects of ships disappearing below the horizon could be explained by the laws of perspective in relation to the human eye.<ref>{{Cite book|author= Parallax (Samuel Birley Rowbotham)|title= Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe|edition= Third| place= London |publisher= Simpkin, Marshall, and Co.|date=1881|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/za/za32.htm}}</ref> In 1883 he founded Zetetic Societies in England and New York, to which he shipped a thousand copies of ''Zetetic Astronomy''.\n* [[William Carpenter (1830-1896)|William Carpenter]], a printer originally from [[Greenwich]], [[England]] (home of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] and central to the study of astronomy), was a supporter of Rowbotham.

A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth's convexity.

But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as a guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty!, This is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\"\n* [[John Jasper]], an American slave turned prolific [[preacher]], echoed his friend Carpenter's sentiments in his most famous sermon \"Der Sun do move\", preached over 250 times, always by invitation.

She held that the Bible was the unquestionable authority on the natural world and argued that one could not be a Christian and believe the Earth is a globe. Well-known members included [[E. W.

In general, Iranian languages are known from three periods, usually referred to as Old, Middle, and New (Modern) periods. These correspond to three eras in [[History of Iran|Iranian history]]; Old era being the period from sometime before Achaemenids, the Achaemenid era and sometime after Achaemenids (that is to 400\u2013300 BC), Middle era being the next period most officially Sassanid era and sometime in post-Sassanid era, and the New era being the period afterwards down to present day.<ref name=EI-IL-vi>{{harv|Skjaervo|2006}} vi(2).

Excerpt 2: ''New Persian, the descendant of Middle Persian and official language of Iranian states for centuries.\"</ref>\n\nThe known history of the Persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods:\n\n=== Old Persian ===\n{{Main|Old Persian}}\n[[File:Pers\u00e9polis. Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Old Persian]]]]\nAs a [[written language]], Old Persian is attested in royal [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] inscriptions. The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the [[Behistun Inscription]], dating to the time of king [[Darius I]] (reigned 522-486 BC).<ref name=s2008-80-1>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|pp=80\u20131}}</ref> Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now [[Iran]], [[Romania]] ([[Gherla]]),{{sfn|Kuhrt|2013|page=197}}{{sfn|Frye|1984|page=103}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|page=53}} [[Armenia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iraq]], [[Turkey]] and [[Egypt]].<ref>[http://www.avesta.org/op/op.htm Roland G.

Documentation. Old Persian.}}</ref>\n\nRelated to Old Persian, but from a different branch of the Iranian language family, was [[Avestan]], the language of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] liturgical texts.\n\n=== Middle Persian ===\n{{Main|Middle Persian}}\nThe complex [[grammatical conjugation]] and [[declension]] of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared, leaving only singular and plural, as did gender. Middle Persian developed the [[ez\u0101fe]] construction, expressed through ''\u012b'' (modern ''ye''), to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system.\n\nAlthough the \"middle period\" of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century BC. However, Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era (224\u2013651) inscriptions, so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty. Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, in the 6th or 7th century. From the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\nMiddle Persian is \"essentially, though not in every detail, a later form of the same dialect as Old Persian\".<ref>Nicholas Sims-Williams, \"The Iranian Languages\", in Steever, Sanford (ed.) (1993), ''The Indo-European Languages'', p. 129.</ref>\n\nThe native name of Middle Persian was ''Parsig'' or ''Parsik'', after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest, that is, \"of ''Pars''\", Old Persian ''Parsa'', New Persian ''[[Fars Province|Fars]]''. This is the origin of the name ''Farsi'' as it is today used to signify New Persian. Following the collapse of the Sassanid state, ''Parsik'' came to be applied exclusively to (either Middle or New) Persian that was written in the [[Arabic script]]. From about the 9th century onward, as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian, the older form of the language came to be erroneously called ''[[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]'', which was actually but one of the ''writing systems'' used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages. That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids (who were Persians, i.e. from the southwest) from the preceding Arsacids (who were Parthians, i.e. from the northeast). While [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] (eighth century) still distinguished between ''Pahlavi'' (i.e. Parthian) and ''Persian'' (in Arabic text: al-Farisiyah) (i.e. Middle Persian), this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date.\n\nGernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|title=The Major Languages of South Asia, the Middle East and Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXJ1RbE8-8C|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-93257-3}}, p. 82. \"The evolution of Persian as the culturally dominant language of major parts of the Near East, from Anatolia and Iran, to Central Asia, to northwest India until recent centuries, began with the political domination of these areas by dynasties originating in southwestern province of Iran, Pars, later Arabicised to Fars: first the Achaemenids (599\u2013331 BC) whose official language was Old Persian; then the Sassanids (c. AD 225\u2013651) whose official language was Middle Persian. Hence, the entire country used to be called Perse by the ancient Greeks, a practice continued to this day. The more general designation 'Iran(-shahr)\" derives from Old Iranian aryanam (Khshathra)' (the realm) of Aryans'. The dominance of these two dynasties resulted in Old and Middle-Persian colonies throughout the empire, most importantly for the course of the development of Persian, in the north-east i.e., what is now Khorasan, northern Afghanistan and Central Asia, as documented by the Middle Persian texts of the Manichean found in the oasis city of Turfan in Chinese Turkistan ([[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]]).

During this period, Persian was adopted as the lingua franca of the eastern Islamic nations.  Extensive contact with Arabic led to a large influx of Arab vocabulary. In fact, a writer of Classical Persian had at one's disposal the entire Arabic lexicon and could use Arab terms freely either for literary effect or to display erudition.  Classical Persian remained essentially unchanged until the nineteenth century, when the dialect of Teheran rose in prominence, having been chosen as the capital of Persia by the Qajar Dynasty in 1787. This Modern Persian dialect became the basis of what is now called Contemporary Standard Persian.

Following the Turko-Persian [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Ghaznavid]] conquest of [[South Asia]], Persian was firstly introduced in the region by Turkic Central Asians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=EQJHAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq=ghaznavids+brought+persian+to+south+asia&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=WSamVIHeGNLiavmygKAL&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=ghaznavids%20brought%20persian%20to%20south%20asia&f=false|title=South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref> The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties.<ref name=\"Sigfried J 1994. p 734\" /> For five centuries prior to the [[British Empire|British colonization]], Persian was widely used as a second language in the [[Indian subcontinent]], due to the admiration the Mughals (who were of [[Turco-Mongol]] origin) had for the foreign language. It took prominence as the language of culture and education in several Muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole \"official language\" under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperors]].\nBeginning in 1843, though, [[English language|English]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] gradually replaced Persian in importance on the subcontinent.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eternal Iran |year=2004 |last=Clawson |first=Patrick |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=6 |isbn=1-4039-6276-6}}</ref> Evidence of Persian's historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the Indian subcontinent. Words borrowed from Persian are still quite commonly used in certain Indo-Aryan languages, especially [[Urdu]], also historically known as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. There is also a small population of Zoroastrian [[Irani (India)|Iranis]] in India, who migrated around 16th\u201318th century to escape religious execution in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] and speak a Dari dialect.\n\n==== Contemporary Persian ====\n[[File:Persian keyboard layout, unshifted.gif|thumb|right|A variant of the Iranian standard ISIRI 9147 keyboard layout for Persian]]\nIn the 19th century, under the [[Qajar dynasty]], the dialect spoken in [[Tehran]] rose to prominence. This became the basis of what is now known as \"Contemporary Standard Persian\".\n\nThere is still substantial Arabic vocabulary, but many of these words have been integrated into Persian phonology and grammar. In addition, since the 19th{{nbsp}}century numerous [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]] terms have been borrowed, especially vocabulary related to technology. The Iranian National [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]] is responsible for evaluating neologisms in order to devise their Persian equivalents.\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are three modern varieties of standard Persian:\n*''[[Western Persian]]'' (''Persian'', ''Iranian Persian'', or ''Farsi'') is spoken in [[Iran]], and by minorities in [[Iraq]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] states.\n*''[[Dari language|Dari]]'' (''Dari Persian'', ''Afghan Persian'', or ''Dari'') is spoken in [[Afghanistan]].\n*''[[Tajik language|Tajiki]]'' (''Tajik Persian'') is spoken in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].\n\nAll these three varieties are based on the classic Persian literature and its literary tradition. There are also several local dialects from Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard Persian. The [[Hazaragi dialect]] (in Central Afghanistan and Pakistan), [[Herat]]i (in Western Afghanistan), Darwazi (in Afghanistan and Tajikistan), and the [[Tehrani accent]] (in Iran, the basis of standard Iranian Persian) are examples of these dialects. Persian-speaking peoples of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |title=Persian, Dari and Tajik |first=William |last=Beeman |work=[[Brown University]] |format=PDF |accessdate=30 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FVTN2MU2?url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |archivedate=30 March 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe following are some languages closely related to Persian, or in some cases are considered dialects:\n*[[Luri language|Luri]] (or ''Lori''), spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian provinces of [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]], [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province]], some western parts of [[Fars Province]] and some parts of [[Khuzestan Province]].\n*[[Lari language|Lari]] (in southern Iran)\n*[[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]], spoken in parts of Azerbaijan, Russia, and Transcaucasia.

Early New Persian had a series of five long vowels ({{IPAslink|i\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|u\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|\u0252\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|o\u02d0}} and {{IPAslink|e\u02d0}}) along with three short vowels {{IPAslink|\u00e6}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Thus, older contrasts such as {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u0113r'' \"lion\" vs. {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}  ''sh\u012br'' \"milk\", and {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u062f}} ''z\u016bd'' \"quick\" vs {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u0631}} ''z\u014dr'' \"strong\" were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words, ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d'' are preserved{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} or merged into the diphthongs {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[o\u028a]}} (which are descendants of the diphthongs {{IPA|[\u00e6\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6\u028a]}} in Early New Persian), instead of merging into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Examples of the exception can be found in words such as {{lang|fa|\u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646}} {{IPA|[ro\u028a\u0283\u00e6n]}} (bright).\n\nHowever, in Dari, the archaic distinction of {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (respectively known as {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''Y\u0101-ye majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''Y\u0101-ye ma'r\u016bf'') is still preserved as well as the distinction of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (known as {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''W\u0101w-e majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''W\u0101w-e ma'r\u016bf''). On the other hand, in standard Tajik, the length distinction has disappeared, and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged with {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} with {{IPA|/u/}}.<ref>Perry, J. R. (2005) ''A Tajik Persian Reference Grammar'' (Boston : Brill) {{ISBN|90-04-14323-8}}</ref> Therefore, contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian.\n\nAccording to most studies on the subject (e.g. Samareh 1977, Pisowicz 1985, Najafi 2001), the three vowels traditionally considered long ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u0252/}}) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts ({{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}) by position of articulation rather than by length. However, there are studies (e.g. Hayes 1979, Windfuhr 1979) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system, with {{IPA|/\u0252/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} phonologically long or bimoraic and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} phonologically short or monomoraic.\n\nThere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system (such as Toosarvandani 2004). That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity, which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Iranian language, which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature.\n\nThe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including Tajik).\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military, pastoral terms and political sector (titles, administration, etc.).<ref>Xavier Planhol, \"Land of Iran\", ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. \"The Turks, on the other hand, posed a formidable threat: their penetration into Iranian lands was considerable, to such an extent that vast regions adapted their language. This process was all the more remarkable since, in spite of their almost uninterrupted political domination for nearly 1,500 years, the cultural influence of these rough nomads on Iran's refined civilization remained extremely tenuous. This is demonstrated by the mediocre linguistic contribution, for which exhaustive statistical studies have been made (Doerfer). The number of Turkish or Mongol words that entered Persian, though not negligible, remained limited to 2,135, i.e., 3 percent of the vocabulary at the most. These new words are confined on the one hand to the military and political sector (titles, administration, etc.) and, on the other hand, to technical pastoral terms. The contrast with Arab influence is striking. While cultural pressure of the Arabs on Iran had been intense, they in no way infringed upon the entire Iranian territory, whereas with the Turks, whose contributions to Iranian civilization were modest, vast regions of Iranian lands were assimilated, notwithstanding the fact that resistance by the latter was ultimately victorious. Several reasons may be offered.\"</ref> New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian (e.g. {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634}} ''arte\u0161'' for \"army\", instead of the Uzbek {{lang|fa|\u0642\u0624\u0634\u06cc\u0646}} ''qo\u02bbshin''; {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0631\u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631}} ''sarla\u0161kar''; {{lang|fa|\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646}} ''dary\u0101b\u0101n''; etc.) in the 20th century.\nPersian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially other [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv|title=ARMENIA AND IRAN iv.

For example, in Iranian colloquial Persian (not in Afghanistan or Tajikistan), the phrase \"thank you\" may be expressed using the French word {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0631\u0633\u06cc}} ''merci'' (stressed, however, on the first syllable), the hybrid Persian-Arabic phrase {{lang|fa|\u0645\u062a\u0634\u06a9\u0651\u0631 \u0627\u0645}} ''mote\u0161akker am'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u062a\u0634\u06a9\u0651\u0631}} ''mote\u0161akker'' being \"thankful\" in Arabic, commonly pronounced ''mot\u010dakker'' in Persian, and the verb {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645}} ''am'' meaning \"I am\" in Persian), or by the pure Persian phrase {{lang|fa|\u0633\u067e\u0627\u0633\u200c\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0645}} ''sep\u0101s-goz\u0101r am''.\n\n== Orthography ==\n[[File:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Example showing Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq's (Persian) proportion rules.{{ref label | Smith1989 | 1 | a}}]]\n[[File:Dehkhoda note.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]]'s personal handwriting, a typical [[cursive]] Persian script.]]\n[[File:The word Persian in Pahlavi script.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The word Persian in the [[Book Pahlavi]] script]]\n\nThe vast majority of modern Iranian Persian and Dari text is written with the [[Arabic script]].

There also exist several [[Romanization of Persian|romanization systems for Persian]].\n\n=== Persian alphabet ===\n{{Main|Persian alphabet}}\n\nModern Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian are written using a modified variant of the [[Arabic alphabet]], which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in Arabic. After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], it took approximately 150 years before Persians adopted the Arabic script in place of the older alphabet. Previously, two different scripts were used, [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]], used for Middle Persian, and the [[Avestan alphabet]] (in Persian, D\u012bndapirak or Din Dabire\u2014literally: religion script), used for religious purposes, primarily for the [[Avestan]] but sometimes for Middle Persian.\n\nIn the modern Persian script, [[Vowel length|historically short vowels]] are usually not written, only the historically long ones are represented in the text, so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: Western Persian ''{{transl|fa|kerm}}'' \"worm\", ''{{transl|fa|karam}}'' \"generosity\", ''{{transl|fa|kerem}}'' \"cream\", and ''{{transl|fa|krom}}'' \"chrome\" are all spelled ''{{transl|fa|krm}}'' ({{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0631\u0645}}) in Persian. The reader must determine the word from context. The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as ''[[harakat]]'' is also used in Persian, although some of the symbols have different pronunciations. For example, a ''[[\u1e0dammah]]'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028a~u]}}, while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}. This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionaries.\n[[File:Persian typewriter keyboard layout.svg|thumb|Persian typewriter keyboard layout]]\nThere are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords. These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters. For example, there are four functionally identical letters for {{IPAslink|z}} ({{lang|fa|\u0632 \u0630 \u0636 \u0638}}), three letters for {{IPAslink|s}} ({{lang|fa|\u0633 \u0635 \u062b}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|t}} ({{lang|fa|\u0637 \u062a}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|h}} ({{lang|fa|\u062d \u0647}}).\nOn the other hand, there are four letters that don't exist in Arabic {{lang|fa| \u067e \u0686 \u0698 \u06af}}.\n\n==== Additions ====\nThe [[Persian alphabet]] adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

Name\n|-\n| {{IPA|/p/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u067e}}\n| ''pe''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u0686}}\n| ''\u010de (che)''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0292/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u0698}}\n| ''\u017ee (zhe or jhe)''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0261/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u06af}}\n| ''ge (g\u0101f)''\n|}\n\nHistorically, there was used also a special letter for the sound {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}. This letter is used no more as the /\u03b2/-sound changed to /b/, i.e. archaic \u0632\u06a4\u0627\u0646 /za\u03b2\u0101n/ > \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 /z\u00e6b\u0252n/ 'language'\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

Name\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u06a4}}\n| ''\u03b2e''\n|}\n\n==== Variations ====\nThe Persian alphabet also modifies some letters of the Arabic alphabet. For example, ''alef with hamza below'' (&nbsp;{{lang|ar|\u0625}}&nbsp;) changes to ''[[aleph|alef]]'' (&nbsp;{{lang|fa|\u0627}}&nbsp;); words using various [[hamza]]s get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644}} becomes {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0626\u0648\u0644}}) even though the latter is also correct in Arabic; and ''[[teh marbuta]]'' (&nbsp;{{lang|ar|\u0629}}&nbsp;) changes to ''[[he (letter)|heh]]'' (&nbsp;{{lang|fa|\u0647}}&nbsp;) or ''[[taw (letter)|teh]]'' (&nbsp;{{lang|fa|\u062a}}&nbsp;).\n\nThe letters different in shape are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

The alphabet was phased out in favor of [[Tajik Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"perry2005\" />\n\n[[Fingilish]] is Persian using [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is most commonly used in [[online chat|chat]], [[email]]s and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] applications. The orthography is not standardized, and varies among writers and even media (for example, typing 'aa' for the {{IPA|[\u0252]}} phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards, resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones).\n\n=== Tajik alphabet ===\n[[File:Akademijai ilmxhoi jumxhurii tojikiston.jpg|thumb|right|Tajiki advertisement for an academy]]\n{{Main|Tajik alphabet}}\n\nThe Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the [[Tajik language]] under the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the late 1930s, replacing the [[Tajik alphabet#Transliteration standards|Latin alphabet]] that had been used since the [[October Revolution]] and the Persian script that had been used earlier. After 1939, materials published in Persian in the Persian script were banned from the country.<ref name=\"perry2005\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.smallwars.quantico.usmc.mil/search/LessonsLearned/afghanistan/groundcombat.asp |title=Smallwars.quantico.usmc.mil |access-date=13 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122154531/http://www.smallwars.quantico.usmc.mil/search/LessonsLearned/afghanistan/groundcombat.asp |archive-date=22 January 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\nThe following text is from Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

She began to wear this tall-hat called a ziggurat complete with long flowing feathers and began to follow the French custom of putting red powder on her hair (Richards).\n\nIt was as the last character in [[William Congreve|Congreve's]] ''Love for Love'' that Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] painted the best-known of his half-dozen or more portraits of her (''illustration, left'').<ref>[http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1669236 \"Mrs Abington\" by Sir Joshua Reynolds Yale Center for British Arts]</ref>  In 1782 she left Drury Lane for [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].<ref name=EB/>  After an absence from the stage from 1790 until 1797, she reappeared, quitting it finally in 1799.<ref name=EB/>  Her ambition, personal wit and cleverness won her a distinguished position in society, in spite of her humble origin.\n\n==Notes==\n{{commons category}}\n{{reflist}}\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Abington, Frances}}\n*{{cite DNB|wstitle=Abington, Frances|first=Edward Dutton |last=Cook |volume=1|pages=53-54}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite ODNB|last=Oddey|first=Alison|title=Abington, Frances|id=51 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abington, Frances}}\n[[Category:1737 births]]\n[[Category:1815 deaths]]\n[[Category:English stage actresses]]\n[[Category:18th-century English actresses]]\n[[Category:English buskers]]", "sha1": "gl6n0vugb3a5zmvghhjen7kx79ebrq0"}}, {"title": "Free software definition", "ns": "0", "id": "11604", "redirect": {"title": "The Free Software Definition"}, "revision": {"id": "83898644", "parentid": "83898613", "timestamp": "2006-10-26T19:22:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "AntiVandalBot", "id": "1574574"}, "minor": "", "comment": "BOT - rv [[Special:Contributions/89.211.211.213|89.211.211.213]] ([[User talk:89.211.211.213|talk]]) to last version by Gronky", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[The Free Software Definition]]", "sha1": "5bl7gdanpfdj2lxz9sfhzu4j6nw55qa"}}, {"title": "Fundamtenal", "ns": "0", "id": "11607", "redirect": {"title": "Fundamental"}, "revision": {"id": "528977803", "parentid": "15909345", "timestamp": "2012-12-20T16:39:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Fundamental]]", "sha1": "hvciyo1l1h9gf5383ji5jx470qnh7xp"}}, {"title": "Fundamental tone", "ns": "0", "id": "11610", "redirect": {"title": "Fundamental frequency"}, "revision": {"id": "15909347", "parentid": "3167651", "timestamp": "2004-04-13T01:47:15Z", "contributor": {"username": "Hyacinth", "id": "17171"}, "comment": "#REDIRECT [[Fundamental frequency]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Fundamental frequency]]", "sha1": "bvuz5mgghnnd9e7tnwppjbp2oir9qi6"}}, {"title": "Fundamental dimensions/Forum", "ns": "0", "id": "11614", "redirect": {"title": "Base unit (measurement)"}, "revision": {"id": "675074692", "parentid": "292066632", "timestamp": "2015-08-08T02:24:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Quondum", "id": "12331483"}, "comment": "renamed target", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Base unit (measurement)]]", "sha1": "5eok8bxclgury6j2kbh25405m7hkda6"}}, {"title": "Finite field", "ns": "0", "id": "11615", "revision": {"id": "863370498", "parentid": "863370430", "timestamp": "2018-10-10T10:52:02Z", "contributor": {"username": "D.Lazard", "id": "12336988"}, "comment": "/* top */ even better", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Galois field|Galois field extensions|Galois extension}}\n{{more footnotes|date=February 2015}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''finite field''' or '''Galois field''' (so-named in honor of [[\u00c9variste Galois]]) is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] that contains a finite number of [[Element (mathematics)|elements]].  As with any field, a finite field is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules.  The most common examples of finite fields are given by the [[integers mod n|integers mod {{math|''p''}}]] when {{math|''p''}} is a prime number.\n\nFinite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including [[number theory]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[Galois theory]], [[finite geometry]], [[cryptography]] and [[coding theory]].\n\n== Definitions, first examples, and basic properties ==\nThe number of elements of a finite field is called its ''order''. A finite field of order {{math|''q''}} exists if and only if the order {{math|''q''}} is a [[prime power]] {{math|''p<sup>k</sup>''}} (where {{math|''p''}} is a [[prime number]] and {{math|''k''}} is a positive integer). All finite fields of a given order are [[isomorphic]].<ref name=\"moore\"/> In a field of order {{math|''p<sup>k</sup>''}}, adding {{math|''p''}} copies of any element always results in zero; that is, the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field is {{math|''p''}}. \n\nIn a finite field of order {{math|''q''}}, the [[polynomial]] {{math|''X<sup>q</sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}} has all {{math|''q''}} elements of the finite field as [[root of a polynomial|root]]s. The non-zero elements of a finite field form a [[multiplicative group]]. This group is [[cyclic group|cyclic]], so all non-zero elements can be expressed as powers of a single element called a [[primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] of the field.  (In general there will be several primitive elements for a given field.)\n\nA finite field is a finite set on which the four operations multiplication, addition, subtraction and division (excluding division by zero) are defined, satisfying the rules of arithmetic known as the [[field axioms]].  The simplest examples of finite fields are the fields of prime order: for each [[prime number]] {{math|''p''}}, the [[prime field]] {{math|GF(''p'')}} (also denoted {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}}, <math>\\mathbb{F}_{p}</math>, or {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}) of order (that is, size) {{math|''p''}} may be constructed as the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo {{mvar|p}}]]. \n\nThe elements of the prime field of order {{mvar|p}} may be represented by integers in the range {{math|0, ..., ''p'' \u2212 1}}. The sum, the difference and the product are computed by taking the [[Euclidean division|remainder]] by {{math|''p''}} of the integer result. The multiplicative inverse of an element may be computed by using the extended Euclidean algorithm (see {{slink|Extended Euclidean algorithm|Modular integers}}).\n\nLet {{math|''F''}} be a finite field. For any element {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}} and any [[integer]] {{math|''n''}}, denote by {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''x''}} the sum of {{math|''n''}} copies of {{math|''x''}}. The least positive {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}} exists and is a prime number; it is called the ''[[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]'' of the field.\n\nIf the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}}, one can define multiplication of an element {{mvar|k}} of {{math|GF(''p'')}} by an element {{mvar|x}} of {{math|''F''}} <math>(k,x)\\mapsto k\\cdot x</math> by choosing an integer representative for {{mvar|k}} and using repeated addition.  This multiplication makes {{math|''F''}} into a {{math|GF(''p'')}}-[[vector space]]. It follows that the number of elements of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p<sup>n</sup>''}} for some integer {{mvar|n}}.\n\nFor every prime number {{math|''p''}} and every positive integer {{math|''n''}}, there exist finite fields of order {{math|''p<sup>n</sup>''}}, and all fields of this order are [[isomorphic]] (see {{slink||Existence and uniqueness}} below). One may therefore identify all fields of order {{math|''p<sup>n</sup>''}}, which are therefore unambiguously denoted <math>\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</math>, {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p<sup>n</sup>''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''p<sup>n</sup>'')}}, where the letters GF stand for \"Galois field\".<ref>This notation was introduced by [[E. H. Moore]] in an address given in 1893 at the International Mathematical Congress held in Chicago {{harvnb|Mullen|Panario|2013|loc = p.&nbsp;10}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]\n:<math id=\"powersum\">(x+y)^p=x^p+y^p</math>\n(sometimes called the [[freshman's dream]]) is true in a field of characteristic {{math|''p''}} for every {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.  This follows from the [[binomial theorem]], as each [[binomial coefficient]] of the expansion of {{math|(''x'' + ''y'')<sup>''p''</sup>}}, except the first and the last, is a multiple of {{math|''p''}}.\n\nBy [[Fermat's little theorem]], if {{mvar|p}} is a prime number and {{mvar|x}} is in the field {{math|GF(''p'')}} then {{math|1=''x<sup>p</sup>'' = ''x''}}.  This implies the equality\n:<math>X^p-X=\\prod_{a\\in {\\rm GF}(p)} (X-a)</math>\nfor polynomials over {{math|GF(''p'')}}.  More generally, every element in {{math|GF(''p''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} satisfies the polynomial equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''<sup>''n''</sup></sup> \u2212 ''x'' = 0}}.\n\nAny finite field extension of a finite field is separable and simple.  That is, if {{math|''E''}} is a finite field and {{math|''F''}} is a subfield of {{math|''E''}}, then {{math|''E''}} is obtained from {{math|''F''}} by adjoining a single element whose [[Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory)|minimal polynomial]] is separable. To use a jargon, finite fields are [[perfect field|perfect]].\n\nA more general algebraic structure that satisfies all the other axioms of a field, but whose multiplication is not required to be commutative, is called a [[division ring]] (or sometimes ''skew field''). By [[Wedderburn's little theorem]], any finite division ring is commutative, and hence is a finite field.\n\n==Existence and uniqueness==\nLet {{math|1=''q'' = ''p<sup>n</sup>''}} be a [[prime power]], and {{math|''F''}} be the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:<math>P=X^q-X</math>\nover the prime field {{math|GF(''p'')}}. This means that {{math|''F''}} is a finite field of lowest order, in which {{math|''P''}} has {{math|''q''}} distinct roots (the roots are distinct, as the [[formal derivative]] of {{math|''P''}} is equal to {{math|\u22121}}). The [[#powersum|above identity]] shows that the sum and the product of two roots of {{math|''P''}} are roots of {{math|''P''}}, as well as the multiplicative inverse of a root of {{math|''P''}}. In other word, the roots of {{math|''P''}} form a field of order {{math|''q''}}, which is equal to {{math|''F''}} by the minimality of the splitting field.\n\nThe uniqueness up to isomorphism of splitting fields implies thus that all fields of order {{math|''q''}} are isomorphic.\n\nIn summary, we have the following classification theorem first proved in 1893 by [[E. H. Moore]]:<ref name=\"moore\">{{citation|first=E. H.|last=Moore|author-link=E. H. Moore|chapter=A doubly-infinite system of simple groups|editor=E. H.

In fact, the polynomial {{math|''X<sup>p<sup>m</sup></sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}} divides {{math|''X<sup>p<sup>n</sup></sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}} if and only if {{math|''m''}} is a divisor of {{math|''n''}}.\n\n== Explicit construction ==\n\n===Non-prime fields===\nGiven a prime power {{math|1=''q'' = ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} with {{math|''p''}} prime and {{math|''n'' > 1}}, the field {{math|GF(''q'')}} may be explicitly constructed in the following way. One chooses first an [[irreducible polynomial]] {{math|''P''}} in {{math|GF(''p'')[''X'']}} of degree {{math|''n''}} (such an irreducible polynomial always exists). Then the [[quotient ring]] \n:<math>{\\rm GF}(q) = {\\rm GF}(p)[X]/(P)</math>\nof the polynomial ring {{math|GF(''p'')[''X'']}} by the ideal generated by {{math|''P''}} is a field of order {{math|''q''}}.\n\nMore explicitly, the elements of {{math|GF(''q'')}} are the polynomials over {{math|GF(''p'')}} whose degree is strictly less than {{math|''n''}}. The addition and the subtraction are those of polynomials over {{math|GF(''p'')}}. The product of two elements is the remainder of the [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]] by {{math|''P''}} of the product in {{math|GF(''p'')[''X'']}}.\nThe multiplicative inverse of a non-zero element may be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm; see [[Extended Euclidean algorithm#Simple algebraic field extensions|Extended Euclidean algorithm \u00a7 Simple algebraic field extensions]].\n\nExcept in the construction of {{math|GF(4)}}, there are several possible choices for {{math|''P''}}, which produce isomorphic results. To simplify the Euclidean division, for {{math|''P''}} one commonly chooses polynomials of the form \n:<math>X^n+aX+b,</math>\nwhich make the needed Euclidean divisions very efficient. However, for some fields, typically in characteristic {{math|2}}, irreducible polynomials of the form {{math|''X<sup>n</sup>'' + ''aX'' + ''b''}} may not exist. In characteristic {{math|2}}, if the polynomial {{math|''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''X'' + 1}} is reducible, it is recommended to choose {{math|''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''X''<sup>''k''</sup> + 1}} with the lowest possible {{math|''k''}} that makes the polynomial irreducible. If all these [[trinomial]]s are reducible, one chooses \"pentanomials\" {{math|''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''X''<sup>''a''</sup> +  ''X''<sup>''b''</sup> +  ''X''<sup>''c''</sup> +  1}}, as polynomials of degree greater than {{math|1}}, with an even number of terms, are never irreducible in characteristic {{math|2}}, having {{math|1}} as a root.<ref>{{citation|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/dss/NISTReCur.pdf|title=Recommended Elliptic Curves for Government Use|pages=3|date=July 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn the next sections, we will show how this general construction method works for small finite fields.\n\n===Field with four elements===\nOver {{math|GF(2)}}, there is only one [[irreducible polynomial]] of degree {{math|2}}:\n:<math>X^2+X+1</math>\nTherefore, for {{math|GF(4)}} the construction of the preceding section must involve this polynomial, and\n:<math>{\\rm GF}(4) = {\\rm GF}(2)[X]/(X^2+X+1).</math>\n\nIf one denotes {{math|''a''}} a root of this polynomial in {{math|GF(4)}}, the tables of the operations in {{math|GF(4)}} are the following. There is no table for subtraction, because subtraction is identical to addition, as is the case for every field of characteristic 2. In the third table, for the division of {{math|''x''}} by {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''x''}} must be read on the left, and {{math|''y''}} on the top.\n\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 135px; height: 135px;\"\n|-\n! + !! 0 !! 1 !!

For {{math|1=''p'' = 2}}, this has been done in the preceding section. If {{math|''p''}} is an odd prime, there are always irreducible polynomials of the form {{math|1=''X''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''r''}}, with {{math|''r''}} in {{math|GF(''p'')}}.\n\nMore precisely, the polynomial {{math|1=''X''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''r''}} is irreducible over {{math|GF(''p'')}} if and only if {{math|''r''}} is a [[quadratic non-residue]] modulo {{math|''p''}} (this is almost the definition of a quadratic non-residue). There are <math>\\frac{p-1}{2}</math> quadratic non-residues modulo {{math|''p''}}. For example, {{math|2}} is a quadratic non-residue for {{math|1= ''p'' = 3, 5, 11, 13, ...}}, and {{math|3}} is a quadratic non-residue for {{math|1= ''p'' = 5, 7, 17, ...}}. If {{math|1=''p'' \u2261 3 mod 4}}, that is {{math|1=''p'' = 3, 7, 11, 19, ...}}, one may choose {{math|1= \u22121 \u2261 ''p'' \u2212 1}} as a quadratic non-residue, which allows us to have a very simple irreducible polynomial {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}.\n\nHaving chosen a quadratic non-residue {{math|''r''}}, let {{math|''\u03b1''}} be a symbolic square root of {{math|''r''}}, that is a symbol which has the property {{math|1=''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup> = ''r''}}, in the same way as the complex number {{math|''i''}} is a symbolic square root of {{math|\u22121}}. Then, the elements of {{math|GF(''p''<sup>2</sup>)}} are all the linear expressions\n:<math>a+b\\alpha,</math>\nwith {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} in {{math|GF(''p'')}}.

By [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], there exists a divisor {{math|''k''}} of {{math|''q'' \u2013 1}} such that {{math|1=''x<sup>k</sup>'' = 1}} for every non-zero {{math|''x''}} in {{math|GF(''q'')}}. As the equation {{math|1=''X<sup>k</sup>'' = 1}} has at most {{math|''k''}} solutions in any field, {{math|''q'' \u2013 1}} is the lowest possible value for {{math|''k''}}.\nThe [[Abelian group#Classification|structure theorem of finite abelian groups]] implies that this multiplicative group is [[cyclic group|cyclic]], that is, all non-zero elements are powers of a single element. In summary:\n:''The multiplicative group of the non-zero elements in'' {{math|GF(''q'')}} ''is cyclic, and there exist an element'' {{math|''a''}}, ''such that the'' {{math|''q'' \u2013 1}} ''non-zero elements of'' {{math|GF(''q'')}} ''are'' {{math|1= ''a'', ''a''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''a''<sup>''q''\u22122</sup>, ''a''<sup>''q''\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n\nSuch an element {{math|''a''}} is called a [[primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]]. Unless {{math|1=''q'' = 2, 3}}, the primitive element is not unique. The number of primitive elements is {{math|''\u03c6''(''q'' \u2212 1)}} where {{math|''\u03c6''}} is [[Euler's totient function]].\n\nThe result above implies that {{math|1=''x<sup>q</sup>'' = ''x''}} for every {{math|''x''}} in {{math|GF(''q'')}}. The particular case where {{math|''q''}} is prime is [[Fermat's little theorem]].\n\n=== Discrete logarithm ===\n\nIf {{math|''a''}} is a primitive element in {{math|GF(''q'')}}, then for any non-zero element {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there is a unique integer {{math|''n''}} with {{math|0 \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 ''q'' \u2212 2}} such that\n:{{math|1=''x'' = ''a<sup>n</sup>''}}.\nThis integer {{math|''n''}} is called the [[discrete logarithm]] of {{math|''x''}} to the base {{math|''a''}}.\n\nWhile {{math|''a<sup>n</sup>''}} can be computed very quickly, for example using [[exponentiation by squaring]], there is no known efficient algorithm for computing the inverse operation, the discrete logarithm. This has been used in various [[cryptographic protocol]]s, see [[Discrete logarithm]] for details.\n\nWhen the nonzero elements of {{math|GF(''q'')}} are represented by their discrete logarithms, multiplication and division are easy, as they reduce to addition and subtraction modulo {{math|''q'' \u2013 1}}. However, addition amounts to computing the discrete logarithm of {{math|''a''<sup>''m''</sup> + ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. The identity \n:{{math|1 = ''a''<sup>''m''</sup> + ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>(''a''<sup>''m''\u2212''n''</sup> + 1)}}\nallows one to solve this problem by constructing the table of the discrete logarithms of {{math|''a''<sup>''n''</sup> + 1}}, called [[Zech's logarithm]]s, for {{math|1 =''n'' = 0, ..., ''q'' \u2212 2}} (it is convenient to define the discrete logarithm of zero as being {{math|\u2212\u221e}}).\n\nZech's logarithms are useful for large computations, such as [[linear algebra]] over medium-sized fields, that is, fields that are sufficiently large for making natural algorithms inefficient, but not too large, as one has to pre-compute a table of the same size as the order of the field.\n\n===Roots of unity===\n\nEvery nonzero element of a finite field is a [[root of unity]], as {{math|1=''x''<sup>''q''\u22121</sup> = 1}} for every nonzero element of {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer, an {{math|''n''}}th '''primitive root of unity''' is a solution of the equation {{math|''x<sup>n</sup>'' {{=}} 1}} that is not a solution of the equation {{math|''x<sup>m</sup>'' {{=}} 1}} for any positive integer {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}. If {{math|''a''}} is a {{math|''n''}}th primitive root of unity in a field {{math|''F''}}, then {{math|''F''}} contains all the {{math|''n''}} roots of unity, which are {{math|1, ''a'', ''a''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''a''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}}.\n\nThe field {{math|GF(''q'')}} contains a {{math|''n''}}th primitive root of unity if and only if {{math|''n''}} is a divisor of {{math|''q'' \u2212 1}}; if {{math|''n''}} is a divisor of {{math|''q'' \u2212 1}}, then the number of primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity in {{math|GF(''q'')}} is {{math|''\u03c6''(''n'')}} ([[Euler's totient function]]). The number of {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity in {{math|GF(''q'')}} is {{math|gcd(''n'', ''q'' \u2212 1)}}.\n\nIn a field of characteristic {{math|''p''}}, every {{math|(''np'')}}th root of unity is also a {{math|''n''}}th root of unity. It follows that primitive {{math|(''np'')}}th roots of unity never exist in a field of characteristic {{math|''p''}}.\n\nOn the other hand, if {{math|''n''}} is [[coprime]] to {{math|''p''}}, the roots of the {{math|''n''}}th [[cyclotomic polynomial]] are distinct in every field of characteristic {{math|''p''}}, as this polynomial is a divisor of {{math|''X<sup>n</sup>'' \u2212 1}}, whose [[discriminant]] {{tmath|n^n}} is nonzero modulo {{mvar|p}}. It follows that the {{math|''n''}}th [[cyclotomic polynomial]] factors over {{math|GF(''p'')}} into distinct irreducible polynomials that have all the same degree, say {{math|''d''}}, and that {{math|GF(''p<sup>d</sup>'')}} is the smallest field of characteristic {{math|''p''}} that contains the {{math|''n''}}th primitive roots of unity.\n\n===Example: GF(64)===\nThe field {{math|GF(64)}} has several interesting properties that smaller fields do not share: it has two subfields such that neither is contained in the other; not all generators (elements with [[Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory)|minimal polynomial]] of degree {{math|6}} over {{math|GF(2)}}) are primitive elements; and the primitive elements are not all conjugate under the Galois group.\n\nThe order of this field being {{math|2<sup>6</sup>}}, and the divisors of {{math|6}} being {{math|1, 2, 3, 6}}, the subfields of {{math|GF(64)}} are {{math|GF(2)}}, {{math|1=GF(2<sup>2</sup>) = GF(4)}}, {{math|1=GF(2<sup>3</sup>) = GF(8)}}, and {{math|GF(64)}} itself. As {{math|2}} and {{math|3}} are [[coprime]], the intersection of {{math|GF(4)}} and {{math|GF(8)}} in {{math|GF(64)}} is the prime field {{math|GF(2)}}.\n\nThe union of {{math|GF(4)}} and {{math|GF(8)}} has thus {{math|10}} elements. The remaining {{math|54}} elements of {{math|GF(64)}} generate {{math|GF(64)}} in the sense that no other subfield contains any of them. It follows that they are roots of irreducible polynomials of degree {{math|6}} over {{math|GF(2)}}. This implies that, over {{math|GF(2)}}, there are exactly {{math|1=9 = {{sfrac|54|6}}}} irreducible monic polynomials of degree {{math|6}}. This may be verified by factoring {{math|''X''<sup>64</sup> \u2212 ''X''}} over {{math|GF(2)}}.\n\nThe elements of {{math|GF(64)}} are primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity for some {{math|''n''}} dividing {{math|63}}. As the 3rd and the 7th roots of unity belong to {{math|GF(4)}} and {{math|GF(8)}}, respectively, the {{math|54}} generators are primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity for some {{math|''n''}} in {{math|{9, 21, 63}<nowiki/>}}. [[Euler's totient function]] shows that there are {{math|6}} primitive {{math|9}}th roots of unity, {{math|12}} primitive {{math|21}}st roots of unity, and {{math|36}} primitive {{math|63}}rd roots of unity. Summing these numbers, one finds again {{math|54}} elements.\n\nBy factoring the [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s over {{math|GF(2)}}, one finds that:\n* The six primitive {{math|9}}th roots of unity are roots of \n::<math>X^6+X^3+1,</math>\n:and are all conjugate under the action of the Galois group.\n* The twelve primitive {{math|21}}st roots of unity are roots of \n::<math>(X^6+X^4+X^2+X+1)(X^6+X^5+X^4+X^2+1).</math>\n:They form two orbits under the action of the Galois group. As the two factors are [[reciprocal polynomial|reciprocal]] to each other, a root and its (multiplicative) inverse do not belong to the same orbit.\n* The {{math|36}} primitive elements of {{math|1=GF(64)}} are the roots of \n::<math>(X^6+X^4+X^3+X+1)(X^6+X+1)(X^6+X^5+1)(X^6+X^5+X^3+X^2+1)(X^6+X^5+X^2+X+1)(X^6+X^5+X^4+X+1),</math>\n:They split into 6 orbits of 6 elements under the action of the Galois group.\n\nThis shows that the best choice to construct {{math|GF(64)}} is to define it as {{math|GF(2)[''X'']/(''X''<sup>6</sup> + ''X'' + 1)}}. In fact, this generator is a primitive element, and this polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that produces the easiest Euclidean division.\n\n==Frobenius automorphism and Galois theory ==\n\nIn this section, {{math|''p''}} is a prime number, and {{math|1=''q'' = ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a power of {{math|''p''}}.\n\nIn {{math|GF(''q'')}}, the identity {{math|1=(''x'' + ''y'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''x<sup>p</sup>'' + ''y<sup>p</sup>''}} implies that the map\n:<math> \\varphi:x \\mapsto x^p</math>\nis a {{math|GF(''p'')}}-[[linear map|linear endomorphism]] and a [[field automorphism]] of {{math|GF(''q'')}}, which fixes every element of the subfield {{math|GF(''p'')}}. It is called the [[Frobenius automorphism]], after [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]].\n\nDenoting by {{math|''\u03c6<sup>k</sup>''}} the [[function composition|composition]] of {{math|''\u03c6''}} with itself {{math|''k''}} times, we have \n:<math> \\varphi^k:x \\mapsto x^{p^k}.</math>\nIt has been shown in the preceding section that {{math|''\u03c6<sup>n</sup>''}} is the identity. For {{math|0 < ''k'' < ''n''}}, the automorphism {{math|''\u03c6<sup>k</sup>''}} is not the identity, as, otherwise, the polynomial \n:<math>X^{p^k}-X</math>\nwould have more than {{math|''p<sup>k</sup>''}} roots.\n\nThere are no other {{math|GF(''p'')}}-automorphisms of {{math|GF(''q'')}}. In other words, {{math|GF(''p<sup>n</sup>'')}} has exactly {{math|''n''}} {{math|GF(''p'')}}-automorphisms, which are \n:<math>\\mathrm{Id}=\\varphi^0, \\varphi, \\varphi^2, \\ldots, \\varphi^{n-1}.</math>\n\nIn terms of [[Galois theory]], this means that {{math|GF(''p<sup>n</sup>'')}} is a [[Galois extension]] of {{math|GF(''p'')}}, which has a [[cyclic group|cyclic]] Galois group.\n\nThe fact that the Frobenius map is surjective implies that every finite field is [[perfect field|perfect]].\n\n==Polynomial factorization==\n{{main|Factorization of polynomials over finite fields}}\nIf {{math|''F''}} is a finite field, a non-constant [[monic polynomial]] with coefficients in {{math|''F''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|''F''}}, if it is not the product of two non-constant monic polynomials, with coefficients in {{math|''F''}}.\n\nAs every [[polynomial ring]] over a field is a [[unique factorization domain]], every monic polynomial over a finite field may be factored in a unique way (up to the order of the factors) into a product of irreducible monic polynomials.\n\nThere are efficient algorithms for testing polynomial irreducibility and factoring polynomials over finite field. They are a key step for factoring polynomials over the integers or the [[rational numbers]]. At least for this reason, every [[computer algebra system]] has functions for factoring polynomials over finite fields, or, at least, over finite prime fields.\n\n===Irreducible polynomials of a given degree===\nThe polynomial\n:<math>X^q-X</math> \nfactors into linear factors over a field of order {{math|''q''}}. More precisely, this polynomial is the product of all monic polynomials of degree one over a field of order {{math|''q''}}.\n\nThis implies that, if {{math|1=''q'' = ''p<sup>n</sup>''}} then {{math|''X<sup>q</sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}} is the product of all monic irreducible polynomials over {{math|GF(''p'')}}, whose degree divides {{math|''n''}}. In fact, if {{math|''P''}} is an irreducible factor over {{math|GF(''p'')}} of {{math|''X<sup>q</sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}}, its degree divides {{math|''n''}}, as its [[splitting field]] is contained in {{math|GF(''p''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}. Conversely, if {{math|''P''}} is an irreducible monic polynomial over {{math|GF(''p'')}} of degree {{math|''d''}} dividing {{math|''n''}}, it defines a field extension of degree {{math|''d''}}, which is contained in {{math|GF(''p''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, and all roots of {{math|''P''}} belong to {{math|GF(''p''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, and are roots of {{math|''X<sup>q</sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}}; thus {{math|''P''}} divides {{math|''X<sup>q</sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}}. As {{math|''X<sup>q</sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}} does not have any multiple factor, it is thus the product of all the irreducible monic polynomials that divide it.\n\nThis property is used to compute the product of the irreducible factors of each degree of polynomials over {{math|GF(''p'')}}; see [[Distinct degree factorization]].\n\n===Number of monic irreducible polynomials of a given degree over a finite field===\n\nThe number {{math|''N''(''q'', ''n'')}} of monic irreducible polynomials of degree {{math|''n''}} over \n{{math|GF(''q'')}} is given by<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobson|2009|loc=\u00a74.13}}</ref>\n:<math>N(q,n)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{d\\mid n} \\mu(d)q^{n/d},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''}} is the [[M\u00f6bius function]]. This formula is almost a direct consequence of above property of {{math|''X<sup>q</sup>'' \u2212 ''X''}}.\n\nBy the above formula, the number of irreducible (not necessarily monic) polynomials of degree {{math|''n''}} over {{math|GF(''q'')}} is {{math|(''q'' \u2212 1)''N''(''q'', ''n'')}}.\n\nA (slightly simpler) lower bound for {{math|''N''(''q'', ''n'')}} is\n:<math>N(q,n)\\geq\\frac{1}{n} \\left(q^n-\\sum_{p\\mid n, \\ p \\text{ prime}} q^{n/p}\\right).</math>\n\nOne may easily deduce that, for every {{math|''q''}} and every {{math|''n''}}, there is at least one irreducible polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} over {{math|GF(''q'')}}. This lower bound is sharp for {{math|1=''q'' = ''n'' = 2}}.\n\n== Applications ==\nIn [[cryptography]], the difficulty of the [[discrete logarithm problem]] in finite fields or in [[elliptic curves]] is the basis of several widely used protocols, such as the [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]] protocol. For example, in 2014 a secure internet connection to Wikipedia involved the elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman protocol ([[ECDHE]]) over a large finite field.<ref>This can be verified by looking at the information on the page provided by the browser.</ref> In [[coding theory]], many codes are constructed as [[linear subspace|subspace]]s of [[vector space]]s over finite fields.\n\nFinite fields are widely used in [[number theory]], as many problems over the integers may be solved by reducing them [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] one or several [[prime number]]s. For example, the fastest known algorithms for [[polynomial factorization]] and [[linear algebra]] over the field of [[rational number]]s proceed by reduction modulo one or several primes, and then reconstruction of the solution by using [[Chinese remainder theorem]], [[Hensel lifting]] or the [[LLL algorithm]].\n\nSimilarly many theoretical problems in number theory can be solved by considering their reductions modulo some or all prime numbers. See, for example, [[Hasse principle]]. Many recent developments of [[algebraic geometry]] were motivated by the need to enlarge the power of these modular methods. [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] is an example of a deep result involving many mathematical tools, including finite fields.\n\n== Extensions ==\n\n===Algebraic closure===\nA finite field {{math|'''F'''}} is not algebraically closed. To demonstrate this, consider the polynomial\n:<math>f(T)=1+\\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbf{F}} (T-\\alpha),</math>\nwhich has no roots in {{math|'''F'''}}, since {{math|1=''f''&thinsp;(''\u03b1'') = 1}} for all {{math|''\u03b1''}} in {{math|'''F'''}}.\n\nThe [[direct limit]] of the system:\n\n:{{math|{'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>, '''F'''<sub>''p''<sup>2</sup></sub>, ..., '''F'''<sub>''p<sup>n</sup>''</sub>, ...},}}\n\nwith inclusion, is an infinite field. It is the [[algebraic closure]] of all the fields in the system, and is denoted by: <math>\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}</math>.\n\nThe inclusions commute with the Frobenius map, as it is defined the same way on each field ({{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x<sup>&thinsp;p</sup>''&thinsp;}}), so the Frobenius map defines an automorphism of <math>\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}</math>, which carries all subfields back to themselves. In fact {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p<sup>n</sup>''</sub>}} can be recovered as the fixed points of the {{math|''n''}}th iterate of the Frobenius map.\n\nHowever unlike the case of finite fields, the Frobenius automorphism on <math>\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}</math> has infinite order, and it does not generate the full group of automorphisms of this field.  That is, there are automorphisms of <math>\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_p}</math> which are not a power of the Frobenius map. However, the group generated by the Frobenius map is a dense subgroup of the automorphism group in the [[Krull topology]].  Algebraically, this corresponds to the additive group {{math|'''Z'''}} being dense in the [[profinite integers]] (direct product of the {{math|''p''}}-adic integers over all primes {{math|''p''}}, with the [[product topology]]).\n\nIf we actually construct our finite fields in such a fashion that {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p<sup>n</sup>''</sub>}} is contained in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p<sup>m</sup>''</sub>}} whenever {{math|''n''}} divides {{math|''m''}}, then this direct limit can be constructed as the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all these fields. Even if we do not construct our fields this way, we can still speak of the algebraic closure, but some more delicacy is required in its construction.\n\n===Wedderburn's little theorem===\nA [[division ring]] is a generalization of field. Division rings are not assumed to be commutative. There are no non-commutative finite division rings: [[Wedderburn's little theorem]] states that all finite [[division ring]]s are commutative, hence finite fields. The result holds even if we relax associativity and consider [[alternative ring]]s, by the [[Artin\u2013Zorn theorem]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Shult | first=Ernest E. | title=Points and lines.

Where implemented, a franchiser licenses its know-how, procedures, intellectual property, use of its [[business model]], brand; and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee. In return the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations, typically set out in a Franchise Agreement.\n\nThe word \"franchise\" is of Anglo-French derivation\u2014from ''franc'', meaning free\u2014and is used both as a noun and as a (transitive) verb.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=franchise&allowed_in_frame=0 \"franchise\"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''</ref>\nFor the franchiser, use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy, compared to expansion through corporate owned outlets or \"[[chain store]]s\". Adopting a franchise system business growth strategy for the sale and distribution of goods and services minimizes the franchiser's capital investment and liability risk.\n\nAs with any business venture, franchising is not immune to risk. But if undertaken in the right way, franchising can be a vehicle of success for both the franchisor and franchisee.\n\nThirty-three countries have laws that explicitly regulate franchising, with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dlapiper.com/us/services/detail.aspx?service=256|title=International Franchise and Distribution|accessdate=2012-02-02|year=2012|work=DLA Piper|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402043832/http://www.dlapiper.com/us/services/detail.aspx?service=256|archivedate=2012-04-02|df=}}</ref>\nFranchising is also used as a [[foreign market entry modes|foreign market entry mode]].\n\n==History==\nThe boom in franchising did not take place until after [[World War II]]. Nevertheless, the rudiments of modern franchising date back to the [[Middle Ages]] when landowners made franchise-like agreements with tax collectors, who retained a percentage of the money they collected and turned the rest over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.franchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/History-of-Franchising.pdf|title=History of Franchising|last=|first=|date=|website=Franchoice.com|access-date=30 December 2017}}</ref> The practice ended around 1562 but spread to other endeavors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchise-chat.com/resources/where_it_all_began_the_evolution_of_franchising.htm|title=Where it all began.  The evolution of franchising. {{!}} Franchise-chat Resource Archive|website=Franchise-chat.com|access-date=2017-06-06}}</ref> For example, in 17th century England franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries. There was little growth in franchising, though, until the mid-19th century, when it appeared in the United States for the first time.\n\nOne of the first successful American franchising operations was started by an enterprising druggist named [[John Pemberton|John S. Pemberton]]. In 1886, he concocted a beverage comprising sugar, molasses, spices, and cocaine. Pemberton licensed selected people to bottle and sell the drink, which was an early version of what is now known as Coca-Cola. His was one of the earliest\u2014and most successful\u2014franchising operations in the United States.\n\nThe [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company]] implemented a franchising plan in the 1850s to distribute its sewing machines. The operation failed, though, because the company did not earn much money even though the machines sold well. The dealers, who had exclusive rights to their territories, absorbed most of the profits because of deep discounts. Some failed to push Singer products, so competitors were able to outsell the company. Under the existing contract, Singer could neither withdraw rights granted to franchisees nor send in its own salaried representatives. So, the company started repurchasing the rights it had sold. The experiment proved to be a failure. That may have been one of the first times a franchisor failed, but it was by no means the last. (Even Colonel Sanders did not initially succeed in his [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] franchising efforts.) Still, the Singer venture did not put an end to franchising.\n\nOther companies tried franchising in one form or another after the Singer experience. For example, several decades later, [[General Motors Corporation]] established a somewhat successful franchising operation in order to raise capital. Perhaps the father of modern franchising, though, is [[Louis K. Liggett]]. In 1902, Liggett invited a group of druggists to join a \"drug cooperative.\" As he explained to them, they could increase profits by paying less for their purchases, especially if they set up their own manufacturing company. His idea was to market private label products. About 40 druggists pooled $4,000 of their own money and adopted the name \"[[Rexall]]\". Sales soared, and Rexall became a franchisor. The chain's success set a pattern for other franchisors to follow.\n\nAlthough many business owners did affiliate with cooperative ventures of one type or another, there was little growth in franchising until the early 20th century, and what franchising there was did not take the same form as it does today. As the United States shifted from an agricultural to an industrial economy, manufacturers licensed individuals to sell automobiles, trucks, gasoline, beverages, and a variety of other products. The franchisees did little more than sell the products, though. The sharing of responsibility associated with contemporary franchising arrangement did not exist to any great extent. Consequently, franchising was not a growth industry in the United States.\n\nIt was not until the 1960s and 1970s that people began to take a close look at the attractiveness of franchising.

These three fees may be combined in a single 'management' fee. A fee for \"disclosure\" is separate and is always a \"front-end fee\".\n\nA franchise usually lasts for a fixed time period (broken down into shorter periods, which each require renewal), and serves a specific territory or geographical area surrounding its location. One franchisee may manage several such locations. Agreements typically last from five to thirty years, with premature cancellations or terminations of most contracts bearing serious consequences for franchisees. A franchise is merely a temporary business investment involving renting or leasing an opportunity, not the purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership. It is classified as a wasting asset due to the finite term of the license.\n\nFranchise fees are on average 6.7% with an additional average marketing fee of 2% <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.franchise.org/industrysecondary.aspx?id=31612|title=The Profile of Franchising Report Series III \u2013 Royalty and Advertising Fees|year=2006|work=International Franchise Association}}</ref> However, not all franchise opportunities are the same and many franchise organizations are pioneering new models that challenge antiquated structures and redefine success for the organization as well as the franchisee.\n\nA franchise can be exclusive, non-exclusive or \"sole and exclusive\".\n\nAlthough franchisor revenues and profit may be listed in a [[Franchise Disclosure Document|franchise disclosure document]] (FDD), no laws require an estimate of franchisee profitability, which depends on how intensively the franchisee \"works\" the franchise. Therefore, franchisor fees are typically based on \"gross revenue from sales\" and not on profits realized. See [[remuneration]].\n\nVarious tangibles and intangibles such as national or international [[advertising]], [[training]] and other support services are commonly made available by the franchisor.\n\nFranchise brokers help franchisors find appropriate franchisees.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Libava|first1=Joel|title=What is a Franchise Broker|url=https://www.sba.gov/blogs/what-franchise-broker|website=Small Business Administration|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=5 January 2012}}</ref> There are also main 'master franchisors' who obtain the rights to sub-franchise in a territory.\n\nAccording to the International Franchise Association approximately 44% of all businesses in the United States are franchisee-worked.\n\n==Rationale and risk shift==\nFranchising is one of the few means available to access [[venture capital]] without the need to give up control of the operation of the chain and build a distribution system for servicing it. After the brand and formula are carefully designed and properly executed, franchisors are able to sell franchises and expand rapidly across countries and continents using the capital and resources of their franchisees while reducing their own risk.\n\nThere is also risk for the people buying the franchises. However, failure rates are much lower for franchise businesses than independent business startups.<ref name=\"TimothyNoah\">{{cite web|last1=Noah|first1=Timothy|title=Disenfranchised: Why are Americans Still Buying Into the Franchise Dream|url=https://psmag.com/economics/disenfranchised-fast-food-workers-quiznos-73967|website=Pacific Standard|publisher=The Social Justice Foundation|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=4 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nFranchisor rules imposed by the franchising authority are becoming increasingly strict. Some franchisors are using minor rule violations to terminate contracts and seize the franchise without any reimbursement.<ref name=\"TimothyNoah\" />\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages of franchising as an entry mode ==\nFranchising brings with it several advantages and disadvantages for firms looking to expand into new areas and foreign markets. The primary advantage is that the firm does not have to bear the development cost and risks of opening a foreign market on its own, as the Franchisee is typically responsible for those costs and risks, putting the onus on the Franchisee to build a profitable operation as quickly as possible.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=International Business|last=Hill|first=Charles W.L.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|location=New York|pages=457}}</ref> Through franchising a firm has the potential of building a global presence quickly and also at a low cost and risk.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA primary disadvantage to franchising is quality control, as the franchisor wants the firm's brand name to convey a message to consumers about the quality and consistency of the firm's product.<ref name=\":0\" /> They want the consumer to experience the same quality regardless of location or franchise status.<ref name=\":0\" /> This can prove to be an issue with franchising, as a customer who had a bad experience at one franchise may assume that they will have the same experience at other locations with other services. Distance can make it difficult for firms to detect whether or not the franchises are of poor quality.<ref name=\":0\" /> One way around this disadvantage is to set up extra subsidiaries in each country or state in which the firm expands. This creates a smaller number of franchisees to oversee, which will reduce the quality control challenges.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Obligations of the parties==\nEach party to a franchise has several interests to protect.  The franchisor is involved in securing protection for the trademark, controlling the business concept and securing [[know-how]]. The franchisee is obligated to carry out the services for which the trademark has been made prominent or famous. There is a great deal of standardization required. The place of service has to bear the franchisor's signs, logos and trademark in a prominent place. The uniforms worn by the staff of the franchisee have to be of a particular design and color.  The service has to be in accordance with the pattern followed by the franchisor in the successful franchise operations. Thus, franchisees are not in full control of the business, as they would be in retailing.\n\nA service can be successful if equipment and supplies are purchased at a fair price from the franchisor or sources recommended by the franchisor. A coffee brew, for example, can be readily identified by the trademark if its raw materials come from a particular supplier.  If the franchisor requires purchase from her stores, it may come under [[anti-trust legislation]] or equivalent laws of other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maslynlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Supplier-Paper.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contractual and Business Aspects of Structuring Supplier Agreements|website=Maslynlaw.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> So too the purchase things like uniforms of personnel and signs, as well as the franchise sites, if they are owned or controlled by the franchisor.\n\nThe franchisee must carefully negotiate the license and must develop a marketing or business plan with the franchisor.  The fees must be fully disclosed and there should not be any hidden fees. The start-up costs and working capital must be known before the license is granted. There must be assurance that additional licensees will not crowd the \"territory\" if the franchise is worked according to plan. The franchisee must be seen as an independent merchant. It must be protected by the franchisor from any trademark infringement by third parties. A franchise attorney is required to assist the franchisee during negotiations.<ref>''Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer)'', 1996, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}</ref>\n\nOften the training period \u2013 the costs of which are in great part covered by the initial fee \u2013 is too short in cases where it is necessary to operate complicated equipment, and the franchisee has to learn on their own from instruction manuals. The training period must be adequate, but in low-cost franchises it may be considered expensive. Many franchisors have set up corporate universities to train staff online. This is in addition to providing literature, sales documents and email access.\n\nAlso, franchise agreements carry no guarantees or [[warranty|warranties]] and the franchisee has little or no recourse to legal intervention in the event of a dispute.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Should You Invest in a Franchise Opportunity|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/evaluating_franchise.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 July 2017}}</ref> Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor, who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge, in effect, that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk, and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor. Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor. Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated.\n\n==Regulations==\n===Australia===\nIn 2016 there was an estimated 1,120 franchise brands operating in Australia and an estimated 79,000 units operating in business format franchises, with a total brand turnover of approximately $146 billion and a sales revenue of approximately $66.5 billion.<ref name=\"FA2016\">{{cite web|title=Franchising Australia 2016|url=https://www.franchise.org.au/research.html|website=Franchise Council Of Australia|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> In 2016 the majority of franchise brands were retailers with the largest segment being non-food retailing, accounting for 26 percent of brands, a further 19 percent of brands were involved in food retailing, 15 percent of franchisors operated in administration and support services, 10 percent in other services, 7 percent in education and training and 7 percent in rental, hire and real estate services.<ref name=FA2016/> \n\nFranchising in Australia commenced in a significant way in the early 1970s under the influence of the franchised US fast food systems such as [[KFC]], [[Pizza Hut]], and [[McDonald's]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Franchising: An Introduction|url=https://www.franchise.org.au/franchising--an-introduction.html|website=Franchise Council Of Australia|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> It was however underway prior to this and a decade earlier in 1960 [[Leslie Joseph Hooker]], considered a pioneer of franchising, created Australia\u2019s first national real estate agency network of [[LJ Hooker|Hooker]] real estate agencies.<ref>{{cite web|title=L J Hooker, the man behind the brand|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lifematters/lj-hooker-the-man-behind-the-brand/3007464|website=ABC|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LJ Hooker's Heritage, History and Brand|url=https://www.ljhooker.com.au/about-us/lj-hookers-heritage-history-and-brand|website=LJ Hooker|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, franchising is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct, a mandatory [[code of conduct]] concluded under the [[Trade Practices Act 1974]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2008C00090%7Ctitle=Trade|title=Federal Register of Legislation \u2013 Australian Government|website=Legislation.gov.au|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref>\nThe ACCC regulates the Franchising Code of Conduct, which is a mandatory industry code that applies to the parties to a franchise agreement.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607140933/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 |archive-date=2015-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\nThis code requires franchisors to produce a disclosure document which must be given to a prospective franchisee at least 14 days before the franchise agreement is entered into.\n\nThe code also regulates the content of franchise agreements, for example in relation to marketing funds, a [[Standstill period|cooling-off period]], termination, and the [[resolution of disputes]] by [[mediation]].\n\n==== Franchising code of conduct ====\n\nOn 1 January 2015, the old Franchising Code was repealed and replaced with a new [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 Franchising Code of Conduct].

Around 11 percent of this total were foreign-based franchisors.\n\nThe Brazilian Franchise Law (Law No. 8955 of December 15, 1994) defines the franchise as a system in which the franchisor licenses the franchisee, for a payment, the right to use a trademark or patent along with the right to distribute products or services on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis.\nThe provision of a \"Franchise Offer Circular\", or disclosure document, is mandatory before execution of agreement and is valid for all of the Brazilian territory. Failure to disclose voids the agreement, which leads to refunds and serious payments for damages. The Franchise Law does not distinguish between Brazilian and foreign franchisors. The National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) is the registering authority. Indispensable documents are a Statement of Delivery (of disclosure documentation) and a Certification of Recording (INPI). The latter is necessary for payments. All sums may not be convertible into foreign currency. Certification may also mean compliance with Brazil's antitrust legislation.\n\nParties to international franchising may decide to adopt the English language for the document, as long as the Brazilian party knows English fluently and expressly acknowledges that fact, to avoid translation. The registration accomplishes three things:\n\n: * It make the agreement effective against third parties\n: * It permits the remittance of payments\n: * It qualifies the franchisee for tax deductions.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, recent legislation mandate better disclosure and fair treatment of franchisees. The regulations also ensure their right to form associations and launch collective action, even if they signed contracts prohibiting such moves.  Franchising in Canada involves 1,300 brands, 80,000 franchise units accounting for about 20% of all consumer spending.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Milner|first1=Brian|title=Pity the franchisees|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/why-buying-a-franchise-isnt-as-funor-profitableas-youthink/article37029319/|accessdate=22 November 2017|work=Report on Business|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===China===\nChina has the most franchises in the world but the scale of their operations is relatively small.

In a highly diversified society, (see [[Demographics of India]]) McDonald's is a success story despite its fare's differing from that of the rest of the world.<ref>''Patterns of Internationalization for Developing Country Enterprises  (Alliances and Joint Ventures)'' United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-1-106443-8}},</ref>\n\nSo far, franchise agreements are covered under two standard commercial laws: the Contract Act 1872 and the Specific Relief Act 1963, which provide for both specific enforcement of covenants in a contract and remedies in the form of damages for breach of contract.\n\n===Kazakhstan===\nIn Kazakhstan franchise turnover for 2013 is 2.5 billion US$ dollars per year.  Kazakhstan is the leader in Central Asia in the franchising market. There is a special law on franchising which went into effect in 2002. There are more than 300 franchise systems and the number of franchised outlets approaches 2000.<ref>B.Kissikov  [http://www.kazfranch.kz \"Franchising in Kazakhstan\"], Kazakhstan Franchise Association</ref> Kazakhstan franchising began with the emergence of a \"Coca-Cola\" factory, opened to sublicense a Turkish licensor of the same brand.  The plant was built in 1994. Other brands that are also present in Kazakhstan through the franchise system include Pepsi, Hilton, Marriott, Intercontinental, and Pizza Hut.\n\n===Europe===\nFranchising has grown rapidly in Europe in recent years, but the industry is largely unregulated.  Unlike the United States, the European Union has not adopted a uniform franchise law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31988R4087|title=EUR-Lex \u2013 31988R4087 \u2013 EN \u2013 EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref> Only six of the 28 member states have a pre-contractual disclosure law. They are France (1989), Spain (1996), Romania  (1997), Italy (2004) Sweden ( 2004) and Belgium (2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peralaw.com/franchise_disclosure.html|title=Franchise Disclosure Laws in the European Union|website=Peralaw.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Estonia and Lithuania have franchise laws that impose mandatory terms on franchise agreements.  In Spain there is also mandatory registration on a public registry. Although they have no franchise specific laws, Germany and those countries with a legal system based upon that of Germany, such as Austria, Greece and Portugal, probably impose the greatest regulatory burden on franchisors due to their tendency to treat franchisees as quasi consumers in certain circumstances and the willingness of the judiciary to use the concept of good faith to make pro-franchisee decisions. In the UK, the recent {{when|date=February 2015}} Papa John case shows that there is also a  need for pre-contractual disclosure and the Yam Seng case shows that there is a duty of good faith in franchise relationships.\n\nThe European Franchising Federation's Code of Ethics has been adopted by seventeen national franchise associations. However this has no legal force and enforcement by the national associations is neither uniform of rigorous. Commentators like Dr Mark Abell, in his book  \"The Law and Regulation of Franchising in the EU\" ( Published in 2013 by Edward Elgar {{ISBN|978 1 78195 2207}}) consider this lack of uniformity to be one of the greatest barriers to the franchising realising its potential in the EU.\n\nWhen adopting a European strategy  it is important that a franchisor takes expert legal advice.  Most often one of the principal tasks in Europe is to find retail space, which is not so significant a factor in the USA. This is where the franchise broker, or the master franchisor, plays an important role. Cultural factors are also relevant, as local populations tend to be heterogeneous.\n\n====France====\nFrance is one of Europe's largest markets. Similar to the United States, it has a long history of franchising, dating back to the 1930s. Growth came in the 1970s. The market is considered difficult for outside franchisors because of cultural characteristics, yet McDonald's and Century 21 are found everywhere. There are some 30 U.S. firms involved in franchising in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.org/franchise-news-detail.aspx?id=33190|title=France Serves as a Gateway to Europe \u2013 International Franchise Association|website=Franchise.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are no government agencies regulating franchises. The Loi Doubin Law of 1989 was the first European franchise disclosure law. Combined with Decree No. 91-337, it regulates disclosure, although the decree also applies to any person who provides to another person a corporate name, trademark or trade name or other business arrangements.  The law applies to \"exclusive or quasi-exclusive territory\". The disclosure document must be delivered at least 20 days before the execution of the agreement or any payments are made.\n\nThe specific and important disclosures to be made are:<ref name=EUFD>[http://www.peralaw.com/EU_Franchise_Disclosure.html EU Franchise Disclosure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527213507/http://www.peralaw.com/EU_Franchise_Disclosure.html |date=2014-05-27 }} ''peralaw.com''</ref>\n\n#  The date of the founding of the franchisor's enterprise and a summary of its business history and all information necessary to assess the business experience of the franchisor, including bankers,\n#  A description of the local market for the goods or services,\n#  The franchisor's financial statements for the previous two years,\n#  A list of all other franchisees currently in the network,\n#  All franchisees who have left the network during the preceding year, whether by termination or non-renewal, and\n#  The conditions for renewal, assignment, termination and the scope of exclusivity.\n\nInitially, there was some uncertainty whether any\nbreach of the provisions of the Doubin Law would\nenable the franchisee to walk away from the contract.\nHowever, the French supreme court (Cour de cassation)\neventually ruled that agreements should only be\nannulled where missing or incorrect information\naffected the decision of the franchisee to enter into the\nagreement. The burden of proof is on the franchisee.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffw.com/pdf/Franchise-disclosure-in-Europe.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235841/http://www.ffw.com/pdf/Franchise-disclosure-in-Europe.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 July 2011|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nDispute settlement features are only incorporated in some European countries. By not being rigorous, franchising is encouraged.\n\n====Italy====\nUnder Italian law franchise  <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofranchiselawyers.com/pdf/Comparative_Table_08_06_09%20printable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710204622/http://www.eurofranchiselawyers.com/pdf/Comparative_Table_08_06_09%20printable.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }} ''EuroFranchiseLawyers.com''</ref> is defined as an arrangement between two financially independent parties where a franchisee is granted, in exchange for a consideration, the right to market goods and services under particular trademarks.  In addition, articles dictate the form and content of the franchise agreement and define the documents that must be made available 30 days prior to execution. The franchisor must disclose:\n\n:a)  A summary of the franchise activities and operations,\n:b)  A list of franchisees currently operating in the franchise system in Italy,\n:c)  Year-by-year details of the changes in the number of franchisees for the previous three years in Italy,\n:d)  A summary of any court or arbitral proceedings in Italy related to the franchise system, and\n:e)  If requested by the franchisee, copies of franchisor's balance sheets for the previous three years, or since start-up if that period is shorter.\n\n====Norway====\nThere are no specific laws regulating franchising in Norway. However, the Norwegian Competition Act section 10 prohibits cooperation which may prevent, limit or diminish the competition. This may also apply to vertical cooperation such as franchising..\n\n====Russia====\nIn Russia, under chapter 54 of the Civil Code (passed 1996), franchise agreements are invalid unless written and registered, and franchisors cannot set standards or limits on the prices of the franchisee's goods. Enforcement of laws and resolution of contractual disputes is a problem:{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Dunkin' Donuts]] chose to terminate its contract with Russian franchisees who were selling vodka and meat patties contrary to their contracts, rather than pursue legal remedies.<ref>Anttonen, Noora, Mika Tuunanen, Ilan Alon (2005), \"The International Business Environments of Franchising in Russia,\" Academy of Marketing Science Review, (5), 1\u201318.</ref>\n\n====Spain====\nThe legal definition of franchising in Spain is an activity in which an undertaking, the franchisor, grants to another party, the franchisee, for a specific market and in exchange for financial compensation (either direct, indirect or both), the right to exploit an owned system to commercialize products or services already exploited by the franchisor with enough success and experience.\n\nThe Spanish Retail Trading Act regulates franchising.<ref>The offer and sale of franchises are governed in Spain by the Retail Trade Act 7/1996 of January 15 as amended by [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/03/02/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-3365.pdf Act 1/2010 of March 1]. Particularly Article 62 is applicable to franchise agreements. The Act is completed by the [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/03/13/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-4175.pdf Royal Decree 210/2010 of February 26 on Franchise Agreements].</ref> The contents of the franchise must include, at least:\n* The use of a common name or brand or any other intellectual property right and a uniform presentation of the premises or the transport means included in the agreement.\n* The communication by the franchisor to the franchise of certain technical knowledge or substantial and singular know-how that has to be owned by the franchisor, and\n* Technical or commercial assistance or both, provided by the franchisor to the franchisee during the agreement, without prejudice to any supervision faculty to which the parties could freely agree in the contract.\n\nIn Spain, the franchisor submits the disclosure information 20 days prior to signing the agreement or prior to any payment made by the franchisee to the franchisor. Franchisors are to disclose to the potential franchisee specific information in writing. This information has to be true and not misleading and include:\n* Identification of the franchisor;\n* Justification of ownership or license for use of any trademark or similar sign and judicial claims affecting them as well as the duration of the license;\n* General description of the sector in which the franchise operates;\n* Experience of the franchisor;\n* Contents and characteristics of the franchise and its exploitation;\n* Structure and extension of the network in Spain;\n* Essential elements of the franchise agreement.\n\nFranchisors (with some exceptions) should be registered in the Franchisors' Register and provide the requested information. According to the regulation in force in 2010 this obligation has to be met within three months after the start of its activities in Spain.<ref>See also Spain Chapter of ''[http://www.GettingTheDealThrough.com Getting the Deal Through. Franchise 2011]'' by [http://www.advocatia.net/profesional.asp?id=2 Ignacio Alonso]</ref>\n\n====Turkey====\n\nFranchising is a [[sui generis]] contract which bears the characteristics of several explicitly regulated contracts such as; agency, sales contract and so forth. The regulations concerning these kinds of contracts in Turkish Commercial Code and in Turkish Code of Obligations are applied to franchising. Franchising is described in doctrine and has several essential components such as; the independence of the franchisee from the franchisor, the use of know-how and the uniformity of product and services, standard use of the brand and logo, payment of a royalty fee, increasement of sales by the franchisee and continuity.\nFranchising may be for a determined or undetermined period of time. The undetermined one can only be annulled either by a notice before a reasonable amount of time or by a just cause. The franchising agreement with a determined time period ends within the end of the time period if not specified otherwise in the agreement. However, termination based on just cause is also foreseen for franchising agreement with a determined time period.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the United Kingdom there are no franchise-specific laws; franchises are subject to the same laws that govern other businesses.<ref>However the recent Pappa Johns case shows that the courts will expect clear disclosure of relevant facts by the franchisor before the franchisee signs up and the recent Yam Seng  case clearly establishes that the franchise relationship involves a duty of good faith. The Trading Schemes Act also regulates Multi tier franchises  [http://www.selectyourfranchise.com/franchise-blog/2009/10/franchise-agreements-subject-to-european-code-of-ethics/ Franchise agreements subject to European Code of ethics] (blog)</ref> There is some self-regulation through the British Franchise Association (BFA).\n\nThere are a number franchise businesses which are not members of the BFA and many which do not meet the BFA membership criteria. Part of the BFA's role in self-regulation is to work with franchisors through the application process and recommend changes which will lead to the franchise business meeting BFA standards.  A number of businesses that refer to themselves as franchises do not conform to the BFA Code of Ethics are therefore excluded from membership.\n\nOn 22 May 2007, hearings were held in the UK Parliament concerning citizen-initiated petitions for special regulation of franchising by the government of the UK due to losses incurred by citizens who had invested in franchises. The Minister of Industry, Margaret Hodge, conducted hearings but saw no need for any government regulation of franchising with the advice that government regulation of franchising might lull the public into a false sense of security. Mr Mark Prisk MP suggested that the costs of such regulation to the franchisee and franchisor could be prohibitive and would in any case provide a system which mirrored the work already being completed by the BFA. The Minister of Industry indicated that if due diligence were performed by the investors and the banks, the current laws governing business contracts in the UK offered sufficient protection for the public and the banks. The debate also made reference to the self-regulatory function performed by the BFA recognizing that the association \"punched above its weight\".<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Daily Hansard |date=22 May 2007 |pages= 363WH; [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0001.htm part 1], [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0002.htm part 2], [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0003.htm part 3] |title=Franchise Industry|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[Isaac Singer]], who made improvements to an existing model of a sewing machine in the 1850s, began one of the first franchising efforts in the United States, followed later by [[Coca-Cola]], [[Western Union]],  etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/For-Gol/Franchising.html|title=Franchising \u2013 benefits|website=Referenceforbusiness.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> and by agreements between automobile manufacturers and dealers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefranchiseking.com/issac-singer-the-first-franchise |title=It's Issac Singer's Fault |author= |publisher='The Franchise King' |page= |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nModern franchising came to prominence with the rise of franchise-based food service establishments.

The final agreement is always a negotiated document setting forth fees and other terms. Whereas elements of the disclosure may be available from third parties, only that provided by the franchisor can be depended upon. The U.S. Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is lengthy (300\u2013700 pp +) and detailed (see Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC) for elements of disclosure), and generally requires audited financial statements from the franchisor in a particular format, except in some circumstances, such as where a franchisor is new. It must include such data as the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the franchisees in the licensed territory (who may be contacted and consulted before negotiations), estimate of total franchise revenues and franchisor profitability.\n\nIndividual states may require the FDD to contain their own specific requirements, but the requirements in state disclosure documents must be in compliance with the federal rule that governs federal regulatory policy. There is no [[private right of action]] of action under the FTC rule for franchisor violation of the rule, but fifteen or more of the states have passed statutes that provide this right of action to franchisees when fraud can be proven under these special statutes. The majority of franchisors have inserted mandatory arbitration clauses into their agreements with their franchisees, some of which the U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with.\n\nThere is no federal registry of franchises or any federal filing requirements for information. States are the primary collectors of data on franchising companies and enforce laws and regulations regarding their presence and their spread in their jurisdictions.\n\nWhere the franchisor has many partners, the agreement may take the shape of a business format franchise \u2013 an agreement that is identical for all franchisees.\n\n==Social franchises==\nIn recent years, the idea of franchising has been picked up by the [[social enterprise]] sector, which hopes to simplify and expedite the process of setting up new businesses. A number of business ideas, such as soap making, wholefood retailing, aquarium maintenance, and hotel operation have been identified as suitable for adoption by social firms employing disabled and disadvantaged people.\n\nThe most successful examples are probably the ''Kringwinkel'' second-hand shops employing 5,000 people in Flanders, franchised by KOMOSIE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.komosie.be/|title=Home \u2013 Komosie|website=Komosie.be|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> the [[CAP Markets]], a steadily growing chain of 100 neighbourhood [[supermarket]]s in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cap-markt.de|title=CAP-Markt: CAP M\u00e4rkte|website=Cap-markt.de|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> and the Hotel Tritone in [[Trieste]], which inspired the Le Mat social franchise, now active in Italy and Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lemat.it/en/the-brand/le-mat-europe|title=Le Mat Europe \u2013 Pagine Statiche \u2013 Le Mat Europe|website=Lemat.it|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Social franchising]] also refers to a technique used by governments and aid donors to provide essential clinical health services in the developing world.\n\nSocial Franchise Enterprises objective is to achieve development goals by creating self sustainable activities by providing services and goods in un-served areas.

The scheme is named after its inventor, American physicist [[Richard Feynman]], and was first introduced in 1948. The interaction of sub-atomic particles can be complex and difficult to understand intuitively. Feynman diagrams give a simple visualization of what would otherwise be an arcane and abstract formula. As [[David Kaiser]] writes, \"since the middle of the 20th century, theoretical physicists have increasingly turned to this tool to help them undertake critical calculations\", and so \"Feynman diagrams have revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaiser |first=David |year=2005 |title=Physics and Feynman's Diagrams |url=http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/FdsAmSci.pdf |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=93 |page=156}}</ref> While the diagrams are applied primarily to [[quantum field theory]], they can also be used in other fields, such as [[solid-state physics|solid-state theory]].\n\nFeynman used [[Ernst Stueckelberg]]'s interpretation of the [[positron]] as if it were an electron moving backward in time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=76 |year=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749 |bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F |quote=\"In this solution, the \"negative energy states\" appear in a form which may be pictured (as by St\u00fcckelberg) in space-time as waves traveling away from the external potential backwards in time.

These integrals do, however, have a regular structure, and may be represented graphically as Feynman diagrams.\n\nA Feynman diagram is a contribution of a particular class of particle paths, which join and split as described by the diagram. More precisely, and technically, a Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a [[perturbative]] contribution to the [[transition amplitude]] or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory. Within the [[canonical quantization|canonical]] formulation of quantum field theory, a Feynman diagram represents a term in the [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the perturbative [[S-matrix|{{mvar|S}}-matrix]]. Alternatively, the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum field theory represents the transition amplitude as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state, in terms of either particles or fields. The transition amplitude is then given as the matrix element of the {{mvar|S}}-matrix between the initial and the final states of the quantum system.\n\n{{Quantum field theory}}\n\n== Motivation and history ==\n[[File:Kaon-Decay.svg|301px|thumb|right|In this diagram, a [[kaon]], made of an up and anti-strange quark, decays both [[Weak interaction|weakly]] and strongly into three [[pion]]s, with intermediate steps involving a [[W and Z bosons|W boson]] and a [[gluon]] (represented by the blue sine wave and green spiral, respectively).]]\n\nWhen calculating [[scattering cross-section]]s in [[particle physics]], the interaction between particles can be described by starting from a [[free field]] that describes the incoming and outgoing particles, and including an interaction [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] to describe how the particles deflect one another. The amplitude for scattering is the sum of each possible interaction history over all possible intermediate particle states. The number of times the interaction Hamiltonian acts is the order of the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation expansion]], and the time-dependent perturbation theory for fields is known as the [[Dyson series]]. When the intermediate states at intermediate times are energy [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstates]] (collections of particles with a definite momentum) the series is called [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)#Time-dependent perturbation theory|old-fashioned perturbation theory]].\n\nThe Dyson series can be alternatively rewritten as a sum over Feynman diagrams, where at each vertex both the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] are [[conservation law|conserved]], but where the length of the [[four-momentum|energy-momentum four-vector]] is not necessarily equal to the mass. The Feynman diagrams are much easier to keep track of than \u201cold-fashioned\u201d terms, because the old-fashioned way treats the particle and antiparticle contributions as separate. Each Feynman diagram is the sum of exponentially many old-fashioned terms, because each internal line can separately represent either a particle or an antiparticle. In a non-relativistic theory, there are no antiparticles and there is no doubling, so each Feynman diagram includes only one term.\n\nFeynman gave a prescription for calculating the amplitude ([[#Feynman rules|the Feynman rules, below]]) for any given diagram from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|field theory Lagrangian]]. Each internal line corresponds to a factor of the [[virtual particle]]'s [[propagator]]; each vertex where lines meet gives a factor derived from an interaction term in the Lagrangian, and incoming and outgoing lines carry an energy, momentum, and [[spin (physics)|spin]].\n\nIn addition to their value as a mathematical tool, Feynman diagrams provide deep physical insight into the nature of particle interactions. Particles interact in every way available; in fact, intermediate virtual particles are allowed to propagate faster than light. The probability of each final state is then obtained by summing over all such possibilities. This is closely tied to the [[functional integral]] formulation of [[quantum mechanics]], also invented by Feynman\u2014see [[path integral formulation]].\n\nThe na\u00efve application of such calculations often produces diagrams whose amplitudes are [[infinity|infinite]], because the short-distance particle interactions require a careful limiting procedure, to include particle [[self-interaction]]s. The technique of [[renormalization]], suggested by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] and [[Hans Bethe]] and implemented by [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]], Feynman, [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] compensates for this effect and eliminates the troublesome infinities. After renormalization, calculations using Feynman diagrams match experimental results with very high accuracy.\n\nFeynman diagram and path integral methods are also used in [[statistical mechanics]] and can even be applied to [[classical mechanics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |authors=R.

In [[quantum field theories]] the Feynman diagrams are obtained from [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] by Feynman rules.\n\n[[Dimensional regularization]] is a method for [[regularization (physics)|regularizing]] [[integral]]s in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams; it assigns values to them that are [[meromorphic function]]s of an auxiliary complex parameter {{mvar|d}}, called the dimension.  Dimensional regularization writes a [[Feynman integral]] as an integral depending on the spacetime dimension {{mvar|d}} and spacetime points.\n\n== Particle-path interpretation ==\nA Feynman diagram is a representation of quantum field theory processes in terms of [[Elementary particle|particle]] interactions. The particles are represented by the lines of the diagram, which can be squiggly or straight, with an arrow or without, depending on the type of particle. A point where lines connect to other lines is a ''vertex'', and this is where the particles meet and interact: by emitting or absorbing new particles, deflecting one another, or changing type.\n\nThere are three different types of lines: ''internal lines'' connect two vertices, ''incoming lines'' extend from \"the past\" to a vertex and represent an initial state, and ''outgoing lines'' extend from a vertex to \"the future\" and represent the final state (the latter two are also known as ''external lines''). Traditionally, the bottom of the diagram is the past and the top the future; other times, the past is to the left and the future to the right. When calculating [[correlation functions]] instead of [[scattering amplitude]]s, there is no past and future and all the lines are internal. The particles then begin and end on little x's, which represent the positions of the operators whose correlation is being calculated.\n\nFeynman diagrams are a pictorial representation of a contribution to the total amplitude for a process that can happen in several different ways. When a group of incoming particles are to scatter off each other, the process can be thought of as one where the particles travel over all possible paths, including paths that go backward in time.\n\nFeynman diagrams are often confused with [[spacetime diagram]]s and [[bubble chamber]] images because they all describe particle scattering. Feynman diagrams are [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] that represent the interaction of particles rather than the physical position of the particle during a scattering process. Unlike a bubble chamber picture, only the sum of all the Feynman diagrams represent any given particle interaction; particles do not choose a particular diagram each time they interact. The law of summation is in accord with the [[quantum superposition|principle of superposition]]\u2014every diagram contributes to the total amplitude for the process.\n\n== Description ==\n\n[[File:Feynman diagram general properties.svg|350px|thumb|General features of the scattering process A + B \u2192 C + D:\n<br />\u2022 internal lines <span style=\"color:red;\">'''(red)'''</span> for intermediate particles and processes, which has a propagator factor (\"prop\"), external lines <span style=\"color:orange;\">'''(orange)'''</span> for incoming/outgoing particles to/from vertices '''(black)''',\n<br />\u2022 at each vertex there is 4-momentum conservation using delta functions, 4-momenta entering the vertex are positive while those leaving are negative, the factors at each vertex and internal line are multiplied in the amplitude integral,\n<br />\u2022 space {{math|'''x'''}} and time {{mvar|t}} axes are not always shown, directions of external lines correspond to passage of time.\n\n]]\n\nA Feynman diagram represents a perturbative contribution to the amplitude of a quantum transition from some initial quantum state to some final quantum state.\n\nFor example, in the process of electron-positron annihilation the initial state is one electron and one positron, the final state: two photons.\n\nThe initial state is often assumed to be at the left of the diagram and the final state at the right (although other conventions are also used quite often).\n\nA Feynman diagram consists of points, called vertices, and lines attached to the vertices.\n\nThe particles in the initial state are depicted by lines sticking out in the direction of the initial state (e.g., to the left), the particles in the final state are represented by lines sticking out in the direction of the final state (e.g., to the right).\n\nIn [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] there are two types of particles: matter particles such as electrons or positrons (called [[fermions]]) and exchange particles (called [[gauge bosons]]). They are represented in Feynman diagrams as follows:\n# Electron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex (\u2192\u2022).\n# Electron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (\u2022\u2192).\n# Positron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (\u2190\u2022).\n# Positron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex: (\u2022\u2190).\n# Virtual Photon in the initial and the final state is represented by a wavy line (<big>~\u2022</big> and <big>\u2022~</big>).\n\nIn QED a vertex always has three lines attached to it: one bosonic line, one fermionic line with arrow toward the vertex, and one fermionic line with arrow away from the vertex.\n\nThe vertices might be connected by a bosonic or fermionic [[propagator]]. A bosonic propagator is represented by a wavy line connecting two vertices (\u2022~\u2022). A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line (with an arrow in one or another direction) connecting two vertices, (\u2022\u2190\u2022).\n\nThe number of vertices gives the order of the term in the perturbation series expansion of the transition amplitude.\n\n=== Electron\u2013positron annihilation example ===\n[[File:Feynman EP Annihilation.svg|thumb|Feynman diagram of electron/positron annihilation]]\n\nThe electron\u2013positron annihilation interaction:\n\n:e<sup>+</sup> e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 2\u03b3\n\nhas a contribution from the second order Feynman diagram shown adjacent:\n\nIn the initial state (at the bottom; early time) there is one electron (e<sup>\u2212</sup>) and one positron (e<sup>+</sup>) and in the final state (at the top; late time) there are two photons (\u03b3).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Canonical quantization formulation ==\nThe [[probability amplitude]] for a transition of a quantum system from the initial state {{math|{{ket|''i''}}}} to the final state {{math|{{ket| ''f'' }}}} is given by the matrix element\n\n:<math>S_{fi}=\\langle f|S|i\\rangle\\;,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|S}} is the [[S-matrix|{{mvar|S}}-matrix]].\n\nIn the canonical quantum field theory the {{mvar|S}}-matrix is represented within the [[interaction picture]] by the perturbation series in the powers of the interaction Lagrangian,\n\n:<math>S=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{i^n}{n!}\\int\\prod_{j=1}^n d^4 x_j T\\prod_{j=1}^n L_v\\left(x_j\\right)\\equiv\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}S^{(n)}\\;,\n</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|L<sub>v</sub>}} is the interaction Lagrangian and {{mvar|T}} signifies the time-ordered product of operators.\n\nA Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a term in the [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the time-ordered product in the {{mvar|n}}th order term {{math|''S''<sup>(''n'')</sup>}} of the {{mvar|S}}-matrix,\n\n:<math>T\\prod_{j=1}^nL_v\\left(x_j\\right)=\\sum_{\\text{all possible} \\atop \\text{contractions}}(\\pm)N\\prod_{j=1}^nL_v\\left(x_j\\right)\\;,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|N}} signifies the [[Normal order|normal-product]] of the operators and (\u00b1) takes care of the possible sign change when commuting the fermionic operators to bring them together for a contraction (a [[propagator]]).\n\n=== Feynman rules ===\nThe diagrams are drawn according to the Feynman rules, which depend upon the interaction Lagrangian.

In order to make sense, the field theory should have a well-defined [[ground state]], and the integral should be performed a little bit rotated into imaginary time, i.e. a [[Wick rotation]].\n\n=== Scalar field Lagrangian ===\nA simple example is the free relativistic scalar field in {{mvar|d}} dimensions, whose action integral is:\n:<math> S = \\int \\tfrac12 \\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi\\, d^dx \\,.</math>\n\nThe probability amplitude for a process is:\n\n:<math> \\int_A^B e^{iS}\\, D\\phi\\,, </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are space-like hypersurfaces that define the boundary conditions. The collection of all the {{math|''\u03c6''(''A'')}} on the starting hypersurface give the initial value of the field, analogous to the starting position for a point particle, and the field values {{math|''\u03c6''(''B'')}} at each point of the final hypersurface defines the final field value, which is allowed to vary, giving a different amplitude to end up at different values. This is the field-to-field transition amplitude.\n\nThe path integral gives the expectation value of operators between the initial and final state:\n\n:<math> \\int_A^B e^{iS} \\phi(x_1) \\cdots \\phi(x_n) \\,D\\phi = \\left\\langle A\\left| \\phi(x_1) \\cdots \\phi(x_n) \\right|B \\right\\rangle\\,,</math>\n\nand in the limit that A and B recede to the infinite past and the infinite future, the only contribution that matters is from the ground state (this is only rigorously true if the path-integral is defined slightly rotated into imaginary time). The path integral can be thought of as analogous to a probability distribution, and it is convenient to define it so that multiplying by a constant doesn't change anything:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int e^{iS} \\phi(x_1) \\cdots \\phi(x_n) \\,D\\phi }{ \\displaystyle\\int e^{iS} \\,D\\phi } = \\left\\langle 0 \\left| \\phi(x_1) \\cdots \\phi(x_n) \\right|0\\right\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\nThe normalization factor on the bottom is called the ''partition function'' for the field, and it coincides with the statistical mechanical partition function at zero temperature when rotated into imaginary time.\n\nThe initial-to-final amplitudes are ill-defined if one thinks of the continuum limit right from the beginning, because the fluctuations in the field can become unbounded. So the path-integral can be thought of as on a discrete square lattice, with lattice spacing {{mvar|a}} and the limit {{math|''a'' \u2192 0}} should be taken carefully{{clarify|date=May 2016}}. If the final results do not depend on the shape of the lattice or the value of {{mvar|a}}, then the continuum limit exists.\n\n=== On a lattice ===\nOn a lattice, (i), the field can be expanded in [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]:\n:<math>\\phi(x) = \\int \\frac{dk}{(2\\pi)^d} \\phi(k) e^{ik\\cdot x} = \\int_k \\phi(k) e^{ikx}\\,.</math>\n\nHere the integration domain is over {{mvar|k}} restricted to a cube of side length {{math|{{sfrac|2\u03c0|''a''}}}}, so that large values of {{mvar|k}} are not allowed. It is important to note that the {{mvar|k}}-measure contains the factors of 2{{pi}} from Fourier transforms, this is the best standard convention for {{mvar|k}}-integrals in QFT. The lattice means that fluctuations at large {{mvar|k}} are not allowed to contribute right away, they only start to contribute in the limit {{math|''a'' \u2192 0}}. Sometimes, instead of a lattice, the field modes are just cut off at high values of {{mvar|k}} instead.\n\nIt is also convenient from time to time to consider the space-time volume to be finite, so that the {{mvar|k}} modes are also a lattice. This is not strictly as necessary as the space-lattice limit, because interactions in {{mvar|k}} are not localized, but it is convenient for keeping track of the factors in front of the {{mvar|k}}-integrals and the momentum-conserving delta functions that will arise.\n\nOn a lattice, (ii), the action needs to be discretized:\n:<math> S= \\sum_{\\langle x,y\\rangle} \\tfrac12 \\big(\\phi(x) - \\phi(y) \\big)^2\\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}}}} is a pair of nearest lattice neighbors {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. The discretization should be thought of as defining what the derivative {{math|\u2202<sub>''\u03bc''</sub>''\u03c6''}} means.\n\nIn terms of the lattice Fourier modes, the action can be written:\n:<math>S= \\int_k \\Big( \\big(1-\\cos(k_1)\\big) +\\big(1-\\cos(k_2)\\big) + \\cdots + \\big(1-\\cos(k_d)\\big) \\Big)\\phi^*_k \\phi^k\\,.</math>\nFor {{mvar|k}} near zero this is:\n:<math>S = \\int_k \\tfrac12 k^2 \\left|\\phi(k)\\right|^2\\,.</math>\n\nNow we have the continuum Fourier transform of the original action. In finite volume, the quantity {{mvar|d<sup>d</sup>k}} is not infinitesimal, but becomes the volume of a box made by neighboring Fourier modes, or {{math|<big><big>(</big></big>{{sfrac|2\u03c0|''V''}}<big><big>)</big></big>{{su|p=''d''|b=&nbsp;}}}}.\n\nThe field {{mvar|\u03c6}} is real-valued, so the Fourier transform obeys:\n\n:<math> \\phi(k)^* = \\phi(-k)\\,.</math>\n\nIn terms of real and imaginary parts, the real part of {{math|''\u03c6''(''k'')}} is an [[even function]] of {{mvar|k}}, while the imaginary part is odd. The Fourier transform avoids double-counting, so that it can be written:\n\n:<math> S = \\int_k \\tfrac12 k^2 \\phi(k) \\phi(-k)</math>\n\nover an integration domain that integrates over each pair {{math|(''k'',\u2212''k'')}} exactly once.\n\nFor a complex scalar field with action\n\n:<math> S = \\int \\tfrac12 \\partial_\\mu\\phi^* \\partial^\\mu\\phi \\,d^dx</math>\n\nthe Fourier transform is unconstrained:\n\n:<math> S = \\int_k \\tfrac12 k^2 \\left|\\phi(k)\\right|^2</math>\n\nand the integral is over all {{mvar|k}}.\n\nIntegrating over all different values of {{math|''\u03c6''(''x'')}} is equivalent to integrating over all Fourier modes, because taking a Fourier transform is a unitary linear transformation of field coordinates. When you change coordinates in a multidimensional integral by a linear transformation, the value of the new integral is given by the determinant of the transformation matrix. If\n:<math> y_i = A_{ij} x_j\\,,</math>\n\nthen\n:<math>\\det(A) \\int dx_1\\, dx_2 \\cdots\\, dx_n = \\int dy_1\\, dy_2 \\cdots\\, dy_n\\,.</math>\n\nIf {{mvar|A}} is a rotation, then\n:<math>A^\\mathrm{T} A = I</math>\nso that {{math|det ''A'' {{=}} \u00b11}}, and the sign depends on whether the rotation includes a reflection or not.\n\nThe matrix that changes coordinates from {{math|''\u03c6''(''x'')}} to {{math|''\u03c6''(''k'')}} can be read off from the definition of a Fourier transform.\n\n:<math> A_{kx} = e^{ikx} \\,</math>\n\nand the Fourier inversion theorem tells you the inverse:\n\n:<math> A^{-1}_{kx} = e^{-ikx} \\,</math>\n\nwhich is the complex conjugate-transpose, up to factors of 2{{pi}}. On a finite volume lattice, the determinant is nonzero and independent of the field values.\n:<math> \\det A = 1 \\,</math>\n\nand the path integral is a separate factor at each value of {{mvar|k}}.\n\n:<math> \\int \\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{2} \\sum_k k^2 \\phi^*(k) \\phi(k) \\right)\\, D\\phi = \\prod_k \\int_{\\phi_k} e^{\\frac{i}{2} k^2 \\left|\\phi_k \\right|^2\\, d^dk} \\,</math>\n\nThe factor {{mvar|d<sup>d</sup>k}} is the infinitesimal volume of a discrete cell in {{mvar|k}}-space, in a square lattice box\n:<math>d^dk = \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)^d\\,,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|L}} is the side-length of the box. Each separate factor is an oscillatory Gaussian, and the width of the Gaussian diverges as the volume goes to infinity.\n\nIn imaginary time, the ''Euclidean action'' becomes positive definite, and can be interpreted as a probability distribution. The probability of a field having values {{mvar|\u03c6<sub>k</sub>}} is\n:<math> e^{\\int_k - \\tfrac12 k^2 \\phi^*_k \\phi_k} = \\prod_k e^{- k^2 \\left|\\phi_k\\right|^2\\, d^dk}\\,. </math>\n\nThe expectation value of the field is the statistical expectation value of the field when chosen according to the probability distribution:\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\phi(x_1) \\cdots \\phi(x_n) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{ \\displaystyle\\int e^{-S} \\phi(x_1) \\cdots \\phi(x_n)\\, D\\phi} {\\displaystyle\\int e^{-S}\\, D\\phi}</math>\n\nSince the probability of {{mvar|\u03c6<sub>k</sub>}} is a product, the value of {{mvar|\u03c6<sub>k</sub>}} at each separate value of {{mvar|k}} is independently Gaussian distributed. The variance of the Gaussian is {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''<sup>2</sup>''d<sup>d</sup>k''}}}}, which is formally infinite, but that just means that the fluctuations are unbounded in infinite volume. In any finite volume, the integral is replaced by a discrete sum, and the variance of the integral is {{math|{{sfrac|''V''|''k''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.\n\n=== Monte Carlo ===\nThe path integral defines a probabilistic algorithm to generate a Euclidean scalar field configuration. Randomly pick the real and imaginary parts of each Fourier mode at wavenumber {{mvar|k}} to be a Gaussian random variable with variance {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''<sup>2</sup>}}}}. This generates a configuration {{math|''\u03c6<sub>C</sub>''(''k'')}} at random, and the Fourier transform gives {{math|''\u03c6<sub>C</sub>''(''x'')}}. For real scalar fields, the algorithm must generate only one of each pair {{math|''\u03c6''(''k''), ''\u03c6''(\u2212''k'')}}, and make the second the complex conjugate of the first.\n\nTo find any correlation function, generate a field again and again by this procedure, and find the statistical average:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle \\phi(x_1) \\cdots \\phi(x_n) \\right\\rangle = \\lim_{|C|\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{ \\displaystyle\\sum_C \\phi_C(x_1) \\cdots \\phi_C(x_n) }{|C| } </math>\n\nwhere {{math|{{abs|''C''}}}} is the number of configurations, and the sum is of the product of the field values on each configuration. The Euclidean correlation function is just the same as the correlation function in statistics or statistical mechanics. The quantum mechanical correlation functions are an analytic continuation of the Euclidean correlation functions.\n\nFor free fields with a quadratic action, the probability distribution is a high-dimensional Gaussian, and the statistical average is given by an explicit formula. But the [[Monte Carlo method]] also works well for bosonic interacting field theories where there is no closed form for the correlation functions.\n\n=== Scalar propagator ===\nEach mode is independently Gaussian distributed. The expectation of field modes is easy to calculate:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle \\phi_k \\phi_{k'}\\right\\rangle = 0 \\,</math>\n\nfor {{math|''k'' \u2260 ''k''\u2032}}, since then the two Gaussian random variables are independent and both have zero mean.\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle\\phi_k \\phi_k \\right\\rangle = \\frac{V}{k^2} </math>\n\nin finite volume {{mvar|V}}, when the two {{mvar|k}}-values coincide, since this is the variance of the Gaussian. In the infinite volume limit,\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle\\phi(k) \\phi(k')\\right\\rangle = \\delta(k-k') \\frac{1}{k^2} </math>\n\nStrictly speaking, this is an approximation: the lattice propagator is:\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle\\phi(k) \\phi(k')\\right\\rangle = \\delta(k-k') \\frac{1}{2\\big(d - \\cos(k_1) + \\cos(k_2) \\cdots + \\cos(k_d)\\big) }</math>\n\nBut near {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}, for field fluctuations long compared to the lattice spacing, the two forms coincide.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the delta functions contain factors of 2{{pi}}, so that they cancel out the 2{{pi}} factors in the measure for {{mvar|k}} integrals.\n\n:<math>\\delta(k) = (2\\pi)^d \\delta_D(k_1)\\delta_D(k_2) \\cdots \\delta_D(k_d) \\,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b4<sub>D</sub>''(''k'')}} is the ordinary one-dimensional Dirac delta function. This convention for delta-functions is not universal\u2014some authors keep the factors of 2{{pi}} in the delta functions (and in the {{mvar|k}}-integration) explicit.\n\n=== Equation of motion ===\nThe form of the propagator can be more easily found by using the equation of motion for the field. From the Lagrangian, the equation of motion is:\n\n:<math> \\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu \\phi = 0\\,</math>\n\nand in an expectation value, this says:\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu\\partial^\\mu \\left\\langle \\phi(x) \\phi(y)\\right\\rangle =0</math>\n\nWhere the derivatives act on {{mvar|x}}, and the identity is true everywhere except when {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} coincide, and the operator order matters. The form of the singularity can be understood from the canonical commutation relations to be a delta-function. Defining the (Euclidean) ''Feynman propagator'' {{math|\u0394}} as the Fourier transform of the time-ordered two-point function (the one that comes from the path-integral):\n\n:<math> \\partial^2 \\Delta (x) = i\\delta(x)\\,</math>\n\nSo that:\n\n:<math> \\Delta(k) = \\frac{i}{k^2}</math>\n\nIf the equations of motion are linear, the propagator will always be the reciprocal of the quadratic-form matrix that defines the free Lagrangian, since this gives the equations of motion. This is also easy to see directly from the path integral. The factor of {{mvar|i}} disappears in the Euclidean theory.\n\n==== Wick theorem ====\n{{Main article|Wick's theorem}}\nBecause each field mode is an independent Gaussian, the expectation values for the product of many field modes obeys ''Wick's theorem'':\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle \\phi(k_1) \\phi(k_2) \\cdots \\phi(k_n)\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nis zero unless the field modes coincide in pairs. This means that it is zero for an odd number of {{mvar|\u03c6}}, and for an even number of {{mvar|\u03c6}}, it is equal to a contribution from each pair separately, with a delta function.\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\phi(k_1) \\cdots \\phi(k_{2n})\\right\\rangle = \\sum \\prod_{i,j} \\frac{\\delta\\left(k_i - k_j\\right) }{k_i^2 } </math>\n\nwhere the sum is over each partition of the field modes into pairs, and the product is over the pairs. For example,\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle \\phi(k_1) \\phi(k_2) \\phi(k_3) \\phi(k_4) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\delta(k_1 -k_2)}{k_1^2}\\frac{\\delta(k_3-k_4)}{k_3^2} + \\frac{\\delta(k_1-k_3)}{k_3^2}\\frac{\\delta(k_2-k_4)}{k_2^2} + \\frac{\\delta(k_1-k_4)}{k_1^2}\\frac{\\delta(k_2 -k_3)}{k_2^2}</math>\n\nAn interpretation of Wick's theorem is that each field insertion can be thought of as a dangling line, and the expectation value is calculated by linking up the lines in pairs, putting a delta function factor that ensures that the momentum of each partner in the pair is equal, and dividing by the propagator.\n\n==== Higher Gaussian moments \u2014 completing Wick's theorem ====\nThere is a subtle point left before Wick's theorem is proved\u2014what if more than two of the phis have the same momentum? If it's an odd number, the integral is zero; negative values cancel with the positive values. But if the number is even, the integral is positive. The previous demonstration assumed that the phis would only match up in pairs.\n\nBut the theorem is correct even when arbitrarily many of the {{mvar|\u03c6}} are equal, and this is a notable property of Gaussian integration:\n:<math> I = \\int e^{-ax^2/2}dx = \\sqrt\\frac{2\\pi}{a} </math>\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial^n}{\\partial a^n } I = \\int \\frac{x^{2n}}{2^n} e^{-ax^2/2}dx = \\frac{1\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\ldots \\cdot (2n-1) }{ 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\ldots \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\cdot 2\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;} \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\, a^{-\\frac{2n+1}{2}}</math>\n\nDividing by {{mvar|I}},\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle x^{2n}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int x^{2n} e^{-a x^2/2} }{\\displaystyle \\int e^{-a x^2/2} } = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\ldots \\cdot (2n-1) \\frac{1}{a^n} </math>\n:<math> \\left\\langle x^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{a} </math>\n\nIf Wick's theorem were correct, the higher moments would be given by all possible pairings of a list of {{math|2''n''}} different {{mvar|x}}:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle x_1 x_2 x_3 \\cdots x_{2n} \\right\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere the {{mvar|x}} are all the same variable, the index is just to keep track of the number of ways to pair them. The first {{mvar|x}} can be paired with {{math|2''n'' \u2212 1}} others, leaving {{math|2''n'' \u2212 2}}. The next unpaired {{mvar|x}} can be paired with {{math|2''n'' \u2212 3}} different {{mvar|x}} leaving {{math|2''n'' \u2212 4}}, and so on. This means that Wick's theorem, uncorrected, says that the expectation value of {{math|''x''<sup>2''n''</sup>}} should be:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle x^{2n} \\right\\rangle = (2n-1)\\cdot(2n-3)\\ldots \\cdot5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 \\left\\langle x^2\\right\\rangle^n </math>\n\nand this is in fact the correct answer. So Wick's theorem holds no matter how many of the momenta of the internal variables coincide.\n\n==== Interaction ====\nInteractions are represented by higher order contributions, since quadratic contributions are always Gaussian. The simplest interaction is the quartic self-interaction, with an action:\n\n:<math> S = \\int \\partial^\\mu \\phi \\partial_\\mu\\phi +\\frac {\\lambda}{ 4!} \\phi^4. </math>\n\nThe reason for the combinatorial factor 4! will be clear soon. Writing the action in terms of the lattice (or continuum) Fourier modes:\n\n:<math> S = \\int_k k^2 \\left|\\phi(k)\\right|^2 + \\int_{k_1k_2k_3k_4} \\phi(k_1) \\phi(k_2) \\phi(k_3)\\phi(k_4) \\delta(k_1+k_2+k_3 + k_4) = S_F + X. </math>\n\nWhere {{mvar|S<sub>F</sub>}} is the free action, whose correlation functions are given by Wick's theorem. The exponential of {{mvar|S}} in the path integral can be expanded in powers of {{mvar|\u03bb}}, giving a series of corrections to the free action.\n\n:<math> e^{-S} = e^{-S_F} \\left( 1 + X + \\frac{1}{2!} X X + \\frac{1}{3!} X X X + \\cdots \\right) </math>\n\nThe path integral for the interacting action is then a power series of corrections to the free action. The term represented by {{mvar|X}} should be thought of as four half-lines, one for each factor of {{math|''\u03c6''(''k'')}}. The half-lines meet at a vertex, which contributes a delta-function that ensures that the sum of the momenta are all equal.\n\nTo compute a correlation function in the interacting theory, there is a contribution from the {{mvar|X}} terms now. For example, the path-integral for the four-field correlator:\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\phi(k_1) \\phi(k_2) \\phi(k_3) \\phi(k_4) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int e^{-S} \\phi(k_1)\\phi(k_2)\\phi(k_3)\\phi(k_4) D\\phi }{ Z}</math>\n\nwhich in the free field was only nonzero when the momenta {{mvar|k}} were equal in pairs, is now nonzero for all values of {{mvar|k}}. The momenta of the insertions {{math|''\u03c6''(''k<sub>i</sub>'')}} can now match up with the momenta of the {{mvar|X}}s in the expansion. The insertions should also be thought of as half-lines, four in this case, which carry a momentum {{mvar|k}}, but one that is not integrated.\n\nThe lowest-order contribution comes from the first nontrivial term {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''S<sub>F</sub>''</sup>''X''}} in the Taylor expansion of the action. Wick's theorem requires that the momenta in the {{mvar|X}} half-lines, the {{math|''\u03c6''(''k'')}} factors in {{math|X}}, should match up with the momenta of the external half-lines in pairs. The new contribution is equal to:\n\n:<math> \\lambda \\frac{1}{ k_1^2} \\frac{1}{ k_2^2} \\frac{1}{ k_3^2} \\frac{1}{ k_4^2}\\,. </math>\n\nThe 4! inside {{math|X}} is canceled because there are exactly 4! ways to match the half-lines in {{mvar|X}} to the external half-lines. Each of these different ways of matching the half-lines together in pairs contributes exactly once, regardless of the values of {{math|''k''<sub>1,2,3,4</sub>}}, by Wick's theorem.\n\n==== Feynman diagrams ====\nThe expansion of the action in powers of {{mvar|X}} gives a series of terms with progressively higher number of {{mvar|X}}s. The contribution from the term with exactly {{mvar|n}} {{mvar|X}}s is called {{mvar|n}}th order.\n\nThe {{mvar|n}}th order terms has:\n# {{math|4''n''}} internal half-lines, which are the factors of {{math|''\u03c6''(''k'')}} from the {{mvar|X}}s. These all end on a vertex, and are integrated over all possible {{mvar|k}}.\n# external half-lines, which are the come from the {{math|''\u03c6''(''k'')}} insertions in the integral.\n\nBy Wick's theorem, each pair of half-lines must be paired together to make a ''line'', and this line gives a factor of\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\delta(k_1 + k_2)}{k_1^2} </math>\n\nwhich multiplies the contribution. This means that the two half-lines that make a line are forced to have equal and opposite momentum. The line itself should be labelled by an arrow, drawn parallel to the line, and labeled by the momentum in the line {{mvar|k}}. The half-line at the tail end of the arrow carries momentum {{mvar|k}}, while the half-line at the head-end carries momentum {{mvar|\u2212''k''}}. If one of the two half-lines is external, this kills the integral over the internal {{mvar|k}}, since it forces the internal {{mvar|k}} to be equal to the external {{mvar|k}}. If both are internal, the integral over {{mvar|k}} remains.\n\nThe diagrams that are formed by linking the half-lines in the {{mvar|X}}s with the external half-lines, representing insertions, are the Feynman diagrams of this theory. Each line carries a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, the propagator, and either goes from vertex to vertex, or ends at an insertion. If it is internal, it is integrated over. At each vertex, the total incoming {{mvar|k}} is equal to the total outgoing {{mvar|k}}.\n\nThe number of ways of making a diagram by joining half-lines into lines almost completely cancels the factorial factors coming from the Taylor series of the exponential and the 4! at each vertex.\n\n==== Loop order ====\nA forest diagram is one where all the internal lines have momentum that is completely determined by the external lines and the condition that the incoming and outgoing momentum are equal at each vertex. The contribution of these diagrams is a product of propagators, without any integration. A tree diagram is a connected forest diagram.\n\nAn example of a tree diagram is the one where each of four external lines end on an {{mvar|X}}. Another is when three external lines end on an {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining half-line joins up with another {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining half-lines of this {{mvar|X}} run off to external lines. These are all also forest diagrams (as every tree is a forest); an example of a forest that is not a tree is when eight external lines end on two {{mvar|X}}s.\n\nIt is easy to verify that in all these cases, the momenta on all the internal lines is determined by the external momenta and the condition of momentum conservation in each vertex.\n\nA diagram that is not a forest diagram is called a ''loop'' diagram, and an example is one where two lines of an {{mvar|X}} are joined to external lines, while the remaining two lines are joined to each other. The two lines joined to each other can have any momentum at all, since they both enter and leave the same vertex. A more complicated example is one where two {{mvar|X}}s are joined to each other by matching the legs one to the other. This diagram has no external lines at all.\n\nThe reason loop diagrams are called loop diagrams is because the number of {{mvar|k}}-integrals that are left undetermined by momentum conservation is equal to the number of independent closed loops in the diagram, where independent loops are counted as in [[homology theory]]. The homology is real-valued (actually {{math|'''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>}} valued), the value associated with each line is the momentum. The boundary operator takes each line to the sum of the end-vertices with a positive sign at the head and a negative sign at the tail. The condition that the momentum is conserved is exactly the condition that the boundary of the {{mvar|k}}-valued weighted graph is zero.\n\nA set of valid {{mvar|k}}-values can be arbitrarily redefined whenever there is a closed loop. A closed loop is a cyclical path of adjacent vertices that never revisits the same vertex. Such a cycle can be thought of as the boundary of a hypothetical 2-cell. The {{mvar|k}}-labellings of a graph that conserve momentum (i.e. which has zero boundary) up to redefinitions of {{mvar|k}} (i.e. up to boundaries of 2-cells) define the first homology of a graph. The number of independent momenta that are not determined is then equal to the number of independent homology loops. For many graphs, this is equal to the number of loops as counted in the most intuitive way.\n\n==== Symmetry factors ====\nThe number of ways to form a given Feynman diagram by joining together half-lines is large, and by Wick's theorem, each way of pairing up the half-lines contributes equally. Often, this completely cancels the factorials in the denominator of each term, but the cancellation is sometimes incomplete.\n\nThe uncancelled denominator is called the ''symmetry factor'' of the diagram. The contribution of each diagram to the correlation function must be divided by its symmetry factor.\n\nFor example, consider the Feynman diagram formed from two external lines joined to one {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining two half-lines in the {{mvar|X}} joined to each other. There are 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3 ways to join the external half-lines to the {{mvar|X}}, and then there is only one way to join the two remaining lines to each other. The {{mvar|X}} comes divided by {{nowrap|4! {{=}} 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2}}, but the number of ways to link up the {{mvar|X}} half lines to make the diagram is only 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3, so the contribution of this diagram is divided by two.\n\nFor another example, consider the diagram formed by joining all the half-lines of one {{mvar|X}} to all the half-lines of another {{mvar|X}}. This diagram is called a ''vacuum bubble'', because it does not link up to any external lines. There are 4! ways to form this diagram, but the denominator includes a 2! (from the expansion of the exponential, there are two {{mvar|X}}s) and two factors of 4!. The contribution is multiplied by {{sfrac|4!|2 \u00d7 4! \u00d7 4!}} =&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|48}}.\n\nAnother example is the Feynman diagram formed from two {{mvar|X}}s where each {{mvar|X}} links up to two external lines, and the remaining two half-lines of each {{mvar|X}} are joined to each other. The number of ways to link an {{mvar|X}} to two external lines is 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3, and either {{mvar|X}} could link up to either pair, giving an additional factor of 2. The remaining two half-lines in the two {{mvar|X}}s can be linked to each other in two ways, so that the total number of ways to form the diagram is {{nowrap|4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2}}, while the denominator is {{nowrap|4! \u00d7 4! \u00d7 2!}}. The total symmetry factor is 2, and the contribution of this diagram is divided by 2.\n\nThe symmetry factor theorem gives the symmetry factor for a general diagram: the contribution of each Feynman diagram must be divided by the order of its group of automorphisms, the number of symmetries that it has.\n\nAn [[automorphism]] of a Feynman graph is a permutation {{mvar|M}} of the lines and a permutation {{mvar|N}} of the vertices with the following properties:\n\n# If a line {{mvar|l}} goes from vertex {{mvar|v}} to vertex {{mvar|v\u2032}}, then {{math|''M''(''l'')}} goes from {{math|''N''(''v'')}} to {{math|''N''(''v\u2032'')}}. If the line is undirected, as it is for a real scalar field, then {{math|''M''(''l'')}} can go from {{math|''N''(''v\u2032'')}} to {{math|''N''(''v'')}} too.\n# If a line {{mvar|l}} ends on an external line, {{math|''M''(''l'')}} ends on the same external line.\n# If there are different types of lines, {{math|''M''(''l'')}} should preserve the type.\n\nThis theorem has an interpretation in terms of particle-paths: when identical particles are present, the integral over all intermediate particles must not double-count states that differ only by interchanging identical particles.\n\nProof: To prove this theorem, label all the internal and external lines of a diagram with a unique name. Then form the diagram by linking a half-line to a name and then to the other half line.\n\nNow count the number of ways to form the named diagram. Each permutation of the {{mvar|X}}s gives a different pattern of linking names to half-lines, and this is a factor of {{math|''n''!}}. Each permutation of the half-lines in a single {{mvar|X}} gives a factor of 4!. So a named diagram can be formed in exactly as many ways as the denominator of the Feynman expansion.\n\nBut the number of unnamed diagrams is smaller than the number of named diagram by the order of the automorphism group of the graph.\n\n==== Connected diagrams: ''linked-cluster theorem'' ====\nRoughly speaking, a Feynman diagram is called ''connected'' if all vertices and propagator lines are linked by a sequence of vertices and propagators of the diagram itself. If one views it as an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|undirected graph]] it is connected. The remarkable relevance of such diagrams in QFTs is due to the fact that they are sufficient to determine the [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|quantum partition function]] {{math|''Z''[''J'']}}. More precisely, connected Feynman diagrams determine\n\n:<math>i W[J]\\equiv \\ln Z[J].</math>\n\nTo see this, one should recall that\n\n:<math> Z[J]\\propto\\sum_k{D_k}</math>\n\nwith {{mvar|D<sub>k</sub>}} constructed from some (arbitrary) Feynman diagram that can be thought to consist of several connected components {{mvar|C<sub>i</sub>}}. If one encounters {{mvar|n<sub>i</sub>}} (identical) copies of a component {{mvar|C<sub>i</sub>}} within the Feynman diagram {{mvar|D<sub>k</sub>}} one has to include a ''symmetry factor'' {{mvar|''n<sub>i</sub>''!}}. However, in the end each contribution of a Feynman diagram {{mvar|D<sub>k</sub>}} to the partition function has the generic form\n\n:<math>\\prod_i \\frac{C_{i}^{n_i} }{ n_i!} </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|i}} labels the (infinitely) many connected Feynman diagrams possible.\n\nA scheme to successively create such contributions from the {{mvar|D<sub>k</sub>}} to {{math|''Z''[''J'']}} is obtained by\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{1}{0!}+\\frac{C_1}{1!}+\\frac{C^2_1}{2!}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1+C_2+\\frac{1}{2}C^2_2+\\cdots\\right)\\cdots </math>\n\nand therefore yields\n\n:<math>Z[J]\\propto\\prod_i{\\sum^\\infty_{n_i=0}{\\frac{C_i^{n_i}}{n_i!}}}=\\exp{\\sum_i{C_i}}\\propto \\exp{W[J]}\\,.</math>\n\nTo establish the ''normalization'' {{math|''Z''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} exp ''W''[0] {{=}} 1}} one simply calculates all connected ''vacuum diagrams'', i.e., the diagrams without any ''sources'' {{mvar|J}} (sometimes referred to as ''external legs'' of a Feynman diagram).\n\n==== Vacuum bubbles ====\nAn immediate consequence of the linked-cluster theorem is that all vacuum bubbles, diagrams without external lines, cancel when calculating correlation functions. A correlation function is given by a ratio of path-integrals:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle \\phi_1(x_1) \\cdots \\phi_n(x_n)\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int e^{-S} \\phi_1(x_1) \\cdots\\phi_n(x_n)\\, D\\phi }{\\displaystyle \\int e^{-S}\\, D\\phi}\\,.</math>\n\nThe top is the sum over all Feynman diagrams, including disconnected diagrams that do not link up to external lines at all. In terms of the connected diagrams, the numerator includes the same contributions of vacuum bubbles as the denominator:\n\n:<math> \\int e^{-S}\\phi_1(x_1)\\cdots\\phi_n(x_n)\\, D\\phi = \\left(\\sum E_i\\right)\\left( \\exp\\left(\\sum_i C_i\\right) \\right)\\,.</math>\n\nWhere the sum over {{mvar|E}} diagrams includes only those diagrams each of whose connected components end on at least one external line. The vacuum bubbles are the same whatever the external lines, and give an overall multiplicative factor. The denominator is the sum over all vacuum bubbles, and dividing gets rid of the second factor.\n\nThe vacuum bubbles then are only useful for determining {{mvar|Z}} itself, which from the definition of the path integral is equal to:\n\n:<math> Z= \\int e^{-S} D\\phi = e^{-HT} = e^{-\\rho V} </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the energy density in the vacuum. Each vacuum bubble contains a factor of {{math|''\u03b4''(''k'')}} zeroing the total {{mvar|k}} at each vertex, and when there are no external lines, this contains a factor of {{math|''\u03b4''(0)}}, because the momentum conservation is over-enforced. In finite volume, this factor can be identified as the total volume of space time. Dividing by the volume, the remaining integral for the vacuum bubble has an interpretation: it is a contribution to the energy density of the vacuum.\n\n==== Sources ====\nCorrelation functions are the sum of the connected Feynman diagrams, but the formalism treats the connected and disconnected diagrams differently. Internal lines end on vertices, while external lines go off to insertions. Introducing ''sources'' unifies the formalism, by making new vertices where one line can end.\n\nSources are external fields, fields that contribute to the action, but are not dynamical variables. A scalar field source is another scalar field {{mvar|h}} that contributes a term to the (Lorentz) Lagrangian:\n\n:<math> \\int h(x) \\phi(x)\\, d^dx = \\int h(k) \\phi(k)\\, d^dk \\,</math>\n\nIn the Feynman expansion, this contributes H terms with one half-line ending on a vertex. Lines in a Feynman diagram can now end either on an {{mvar|X}} vertex, or on an {{mvar|H}} vertex, and only one line enters an {{mvar|H}} vertex. The Feynman rule for an {{mvar|H}} vertex is that a line from an {{mvar|H}} with momentum {{mvar|k}} gets a factor of {{math|''h''(''k'')}}.\n\nThe sum of the connected diagrams in the presence of sources includes a term for each connected diagram in the absence of sources, except now the diagrams can end on the source. Traditionally, a source is represented by a little \"\u00d7\" with one line extending out, exactly as an insertion.\n\n:<math> \\log\\big(Z[h]\\big) = \\sum_{n,C} h(k_1) h(k_2) \\cdots h(k_n) C(k_1,\\cdots,k_n)\\,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''C''(''k''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''k<sub>n</sub>'')}} is the connected diagram with {{mvar|n}} external lines carrying momentum as indicated. The sum is over all connected diagrams, as before.\n\nThe field {{mvar|h}} is not dynamical, which means that there is no path integral over {{mvar|h}}: {{mvar|h}} is just a parameter in the Lagrangian, which varies from point to point. The path integral for the field is:\n\n:<math> Z[h] = \\int e^{iS + i\\int h\\phi}\\, D\\phi \\,</math>\n\nand it is a function of the values of {{mvar|h}} at every point. One way to interpret this expression is that it is taking the Fourier transform in field space. If there is a probability density on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the Fourier transform of the probability density is:\n\n:<math> \\int \\rho(y) e^{i k y}\\, d^n y = \\left\\langle e^{i k y} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\prod_{i=1}^{n} e^{ih_i y_i}\\right\\rangle \\,</math>\n\nThe Fourier transform is the expectation of an oscillatory exponential. The path integral in the presence of a source {{mvar|''h''(''x'')}} is:\n\n:<math> Z[h] = \\int e^{iS} e^{i\\int_x h(x)\\phi(x)}\\, D\\phi = \\left\\langle e^{i h \\phi }\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nwhich, on a lattice, is the product of an oscillatory exponential for each field value:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle \\prod_x e^{i h_x \\phi_x}\\right\\rangle </math>\n\nThe fourier transform of a delta-function is a constant, which gives a formal expression for a delta function:\n\n:<math> \\delta(x-y) = \\int e^{ik(x-y)}\\, dk </math>\n\nThis tells you what a field delta function looks like in a path-integral. For two scalar fields {{mvar|\u03c6}} and {{mvar|\u03b7}},\n\n:<math> \\delta(\\phi - \\eta) = \\int e^{ i h(x)\\big(\\phi(x) -\\eta(x)\\big)\\,d^dx}\\, Dh\\,, </math>\n\nwhich integrates over the Fourier transform coordinate, over {{mvar|h}}. This expression is useful for formally changing field coordinates in the path integral, much as a delta function is used to change coordinates in an ordinary multi-dimensional integral.\n\nThe partition function is now a function of the field {{mvar|h}}, and the physical partition function is the value when {{mvar|h}} is the zero function:\n\nThe correlation functions are derivatives of the path integral with respect to the source:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle\\phi(x)\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h(x)} Z[h] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h(x)} \\log\\big(Z[h]\\big)\\,.</math>\n\nIn Euclidean space, source contributions to the action can still appear with a factor of {{mvar|i}}, so that they still do a Fourier transform.\n\n=== Spin {{sfrac|1|2}}; \"photons\" and \"ghosts\" ===\n\n==== Spin {{sfrac|1|2}}: Grassmann integrals ====\nThe field path integral can be extended to the Fermi case, but only if the notion of integration is expanded. A [[Berezin integral|Grassmann integral]] of a free Fermi field is a high-dimensional [[determinant]] or [[Pfaffian]], which defines the new type of Gaussian integration appropriate for Fermi fields.\n\nThe two fundamental formulas of Grassmann integration are:\n\n:<math> \\int e^{M_{ij}{\\bar\\psi}^i \\psi^j}\\, D\\bar\\psi\\, D\\psi= \\mathrm{Det}(M)\\,, </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|M}} is an arbitrary matrix and {{math|''\u03c8'', {{overline|''\u03c8''}}}} are independent Grassmann variables for each index {{mvar|i}}, and\n\n:<math> \\int e^{\\frac12 A_{ij} \\psi^i \\psi^j}\\, D\\psi = \\mathrm{Pfaff}(A)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|A}} is an antisymmetric matrix, {{mvar|\u03c8}} is a collection of Grassmann variables, and the {{sfrac|1|2}} is to prevent double-counting (since {{math|''\u03c8<sup>i</sup>\u03c8<sup>j</sup>'' {{=}} \u2212''\u03c8<sup>j</sup>\u03c8<sup>i</sup>''}}).\n\nIn matrix notation, where {{mvar|{{overline|\u03c8}}}} and {{mvar|{{overline|\u03b7}}}} are Grassmann-valued row vectors, {{mvar|\u03b7}} and {{mvar|\u03c8}} are Grassmann-valued column vectors, and {{mvar|M}} is a real-valued matrix:\n\n:<math> Z = \\int e^{\\bar\\psi M \\psi + \\bar\\eta \\psi + \\bar\\psi \\eta}\\, D\\bar\\psi\\, D\\psi = \\int e^{\\left(\\bar\\psi+\\bar\\eta M^{-1}\\right)M \\left(\\psi+ M^{-1}\\eta\\right) - \\bar\\eta M^{-1}\\eta}\\, D\\bar\\psi\\, D\\psi = \\mathrm{Det}(M) e^{-\\bar\\eta M^{-1}\\eta}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere the last equality is a consequence of the translation invariance of the Grassmann integral. The Grassmann variables {{mvar|\u03b7}} are external sources for {{mvar|\u03c8}}, and differentiating with respect to {{mvar|\u03b7}} pulls down factors of {{mvar|{{overline|\u03c8}}}}.\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle\\bar\\psi \\psi\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar\\eta} Z |_{\\eta=\\bar\\eta=0} = M^{-1}</math>\n\nagain, in a schematic matrix notation. The meaning of the formula above is that the derivative with respect to the appropriate component of {{mvar|\u03b7}} and {{mvar|{{overline|\u03b7}}}} gives the matrix element of {{math|''M''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}. This is exactly analogous to the bosonic path integration formula for a Gaussian integral of a complex bosonic field:\n\n:<math> \\int e^{\\phi^* M \\phi + h^* \\phi + \\phi^* h } \\,D\\phi^*\\, D\\phi = \\frac{e^{h^* M^{-1} h} }{ \\mathrm{Det}(M)}</math>\n:<math> \\left\\langle\\phi^* \\phi\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h^*}Z |_{h=h^*=0} = M^{-1} \\,.</math>\n\nSo that the propagator is the inverse of the matrix in the quadratic part of the action in both the Bose and Fermi case.\n\nFor real Grassmann fields, for [[Majorana fermion]]s, the path integral a Pfaffian times a source quadratic form, and the formulas give the square root of the determinant, just as they do for real Bosonic fields. The propagator is still the inverse of the quadratic part.\n\nThe free Dirac Lagrangian:\n\n:<math> \\int \\bar\\psi\\left(\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_{\\mu} - m \\right) \\psi </math>\n\nformally gives the equations of motion and the anticommutation relations of the Dirac field, just as the Klein Gordon Lagrangian in an ordinary path integral gives the equations of motion and commutation relations of the scalar field. By using the spatial Fourier transform of the Dirac field as a new basis for the Grassmann algebra, the quadratic part of the Dirac action becomes simple to invert:\n\n:<math> S= \\int_k \\bar\\psi\\left( i\\gamma^\\mu k_\\mu - m \\right) \\psi\\,. </math>\n\nThe propagator is the inverse of the matrix {{mvar|M}} linking {{math|''\u03c8''(''k'')}} and {{math|''{{overline|\u03c8}}''(''k'')}}, since different values of {{mvar|k}} do not mix together.\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle\\bar\\psi(k') \\psi (k) \\right\\rangle = \\delta (k+k')\\frac{1} {\\gamma\\cdot k - m}  = \\delta(k+k')\\frac{\\gamma\\cdot k+m }{ k^2 - m^2} </math>\n\nThe analog of Wick's theorem matches {{mvar|\u03c8}} and {{mvar|{{overline|\u03c8}}}} in pairs:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle\\bar\\psi(k_1) \\bar\\psi(k_2) \\cdots \\bar\\psi(k_n) \\psi(k'_1) \\cdots \\psi(k_n)\\right\\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathrm{pairings}} (-1)^S \\prod_{\\mathrm{pairs}\\; i,j} \\delta\\left(k_i -k_j\\right) \\frac{1}{\\gamma\\cdot k_i - m}</math>\n\nwhere S is the sign of the permutation that reorders the sequence of {{mvar|{{overline|\u03c8}}}} and {{mvar|\u03c8}} to put the ones that are paired up to make the delta-functions next to each other, with the {{mvar|{{overline|\u03c8}}}} coming right before the {{mvar|\u03c8}}. Since a {{math|''\u03c8'', ''{{overline|\u03c8}}''}} pair is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, it doesn't matter what order the pairs are in. If more than one {{math|''\u03c8'', ''{{overline|\u03c8}}''}} pair have the same {{mvar|k}}, the integral is zero, and it is easy to check that the sum over pairings gives zero in this case (there are always an even number of them). This is the Grassmann analog of the higher Gaussian moments that completed the Bosonic Wick's theorem earlier.\n\nThe rules for spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} Dirac particles are as follows: The propagator is the inverse of the Dirac operator, the lines have arrows just as for a complex scalar field, and the diagram acquires an overall factor of \u22121 for each closed Fermi loop. If there are an odd number of Fermi loops, the diagram changes sign. Historically, the \u22121 rule was very difficult for Feynman to discover. He discovered it after a long process of trial and error, since he lacked a proper theory of Grassmann integration.\n\nThe rule follows from the observation that the number of Fermi lines at a vertex is always even. Each term in the Lagrangian must always be Bosonic. A Fermi loop is counted by following Fermionic lines until one comes back to the starting point, then removing those lines from the diagram. Repeating this process eventually erases all the Fermionic lines: this is the Euler algorithm to 2-color a graph, which works whenever each vertex has even degree. Note that the number of steps in the Euler algorithm is only equal to the number of independent Fermionic homology cycles in the common special case that all terms in the Lagrangian are exactly quadratic in the Fermi fields, so that each vertex has exactly two Fermionic lines. When there are four-Fermi interactions (like in the Fermi effective theory of the [[weak nuclear interaction]]s) there are more {{mvar|k}}-integrals than Fermi loops. In this case, the counting rule should apply the Euler algorithm by pairing up the Fermi lines at each vertex into pairs that together form a bosonic factor of the term in the Lagrangian, and when entering a vertex by one line, the algorithm should always leave with the partner line.\n\nTo clarify and prove the rule, consider a Feynman diagram formed from vertices, terms in the Lagrangian, with Fermion fields. The full term is Bosonic, it is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, so the order in which the vertices appear is not important. The Fermi lines are linked into loops, and when traversing the loop, one can reorder the vertex terms one after the other as one goes around without any sign cost. The exception is when you return to the starting point, and the final half-line must be joined with the unlinked first half-line. This requires one permutation to move the last {{mvar|{{overline|\u03c8}}}} to go in front of the first {{mvar|\u03c8}}, and this gives the sign.\n\nThis rule is the only visible effect of the exclusion principle in internal lines. When there are external lines, the amplitudes are antisymmetric when two Fermi insertions for identical particles are interchanged. This is automatic in the source formalism, because the sources for Fermi fields are themselves Grassmann valued.\n\n==== Spin 1: photons ====\nThe naive propagator for photons is infinite, since the Lagrangian for the A-field is:\n\n:<math> S = \\int \\tfrac14 F^{\\mu\\nu} F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\int -\\tfrac12\\left(\\partial^\\mu A_\\nu \\partial_\\mu A^\\nu - \\partial^\\mu A_\\mu \\partial_\\nu A^\\nu \\right)\\,.</math>\n\nThe quadratic form defining the propagator is non-invertible. The reason is the [[gauge invariance]] of the field; adding a gradient to {{mvar|A}} does not change the physics.\n\nTo fix this problem, one needs to fix a gauge. The most convenient way is to demand that the divergence of {{mvar|A}} is some function {{mvar|f}}, whose value is random from point to point. It does no harm to integrate over the values of {{mvar|f}}, since it only determines the choice of gauge. This procedure inserts the following factor into the path integral for {{mvar|A}}:\n\n:<math> \\int \\delta\\left(\\partial_\\mu A^\\mu - f\\right) e^{-\\frac{f^2}{2} }\\, Df\\,. </math>\n\nThe first factor, the delta function, fixes the gauge. The second factor sums over different values of {{mvar|f}} that are inequivalent gauge fixings. This is simply\n\n:<math> e^{- \\frac{\\left(\\partial_\\mu A_\\mu\\right)^2}{2}}\\,.</math>\n\nThe additional contribution from gauge-fixing cancels the second half of the free Lagrangian, giving the Feynman Lagrangian:\n\n:<math> S= \\int \\partial^\\mu A^\\nu \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu </math>\n\nwhich is just like four independent free scalar fields, one for each component of {{mvar|A}}. The Feynman propagator is:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle A_\\mu(k) A_\\nu(k') \\right\\rangle = \\delta\\left(k+k'\\right) \\frac{g_{\\mu\\nu}}{ k^2 }.</math>\n\nThe one difference is that the sign of one propagator is wrong in the Lorentz case: the timelike component has an opposite sign propagator. This means that these particle states have negative norm\u2014they are not physical states. In the case of photons, it is easy to show by diagram methods that these states are not physical\u2014their contribution cancels with longitudinal photons to only leave two physical photon polarization contributions for any value of {{mvar|k}}.\n\nIf the averaging over {{mvar|f}} is done with a coefficient different from {{sfrac|1|2}}, the two terms don't cancel completely. This gives a covariant Lagrangian with a coefficient <math>\\lambda</math>, which does not affect anything:\n\n:<math> S= \\int \\tfrac12\\left(\\partial^\\mu A^\\nu \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\lambda \\left(\\partial_\\mu A^\\mu\\right)^2\\right)</math>\n\nand the covariant propagator for QED is:\n\n:<math>\\left \\langle A_\\mu(k) A_\\nu(k') \\right\\rangle =\\delta\\left(k+k'\\right)\\frac{g_{\\mu\\nu} - \\lambda\\frac{k_\\mu k_\\nu }{ k^2} }{ k^2}.</math>\n\n==== Spin 1: non-Abelian ghosts ====\nTo find the Feynman rules for non-Abelian gauge fields, the procedure that performs the gauge fixing must be carefully corrected to account for a change of variables in the path-integral.\n\nThe gauge fixing factor has an extra determinant from popping the delta function:\n\n:<math> \\delta\\left(\\partial_\\mu A_\\mu - f\\right) e^{-\\frac{f^2}{2}} \\det M </math>\n\nTo find the form of the determinant, consider first a simple two-dimensional integral of a function {{mvar|f}} that depends only on {{mvar|r}}, not on the angle {{mvar|\u03b8}}. Inserting an integral over {{mvar|\u03b8}}:\n\n:<math> \\int f(r)\\, dx\\, dy = \\int f(r) \\int d\\theta\\, \\delta(y) \\left|\\frac{dy}{d\\theta}\\right|\\, dx\\, dy </math>\n\nThe derivative-factor ensures that popping the delta function in {{mvar|\u03b8}} removes the integral. Exchanging the order of integration,\n\n:<math> \\int f(r)\\, dx\\, dy = \\int d\\theta\\, \\int f(r) \\delta(y) \\left|\\frac{dy}{d\\theta}\\right|\\, dx\\, dy </math>\n\nbut now the delta-function can be popped in {{mvar|y}},\n\n:<math> \\int f(r)\\, dx\\, dy = \\int d\\theta_0\\, \\int f(x) \\left|\\frac{dy}{d\\theta}\\right|\\, dx\\,. </math>\n\nThe integral over {{mvar|\u03b8}} just gives an overall factor of 2{{pi}}, while the rate of change of {{mvar|y}} with a change in {{mvar|\u03b8}} is just {{mvar|x}}, so this exercise reproduces the standard formula for polar integration of a radial function:\n\n:<math> \\int f(r)\\, dx\\, dy = 2\\pi \\int f(x) x\\, dx </math>\n\nIn the path-integral for a nonabelian gauge field, the analogous manipulation is:\n\n:<math> \\int DA \\int \\delta\\big(F(A)\\big) \\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial G}\\right)\\, DG e^{iS} = \\int DG \\int \\delta\\big(F(A)\\big)\\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{ \\partial G}\\right) e^{iS} \\,</math>\n\nThe factor in front is the volume of the gauge group, and it contributes a constant, which can be discarded. The remaining integral is over the gauge fixed action.\n\n:<math> \\int \\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{ \\partial G}\\right)e^{iS_{GF}}\\, DA \\,</math>\n\nTo get a covariant gauge, the gauge fixing condition is the same as in the Abelian case:\n\n:<math> \\partial_\\mu A^\\mu = f \\,,</math>\n\nWhose variation under an infinitesimal gauge transformation is given by:\n\n:<math> \\partial_\\mu\\, D_\\mu \\alpha \\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03b1}} is the adjoint valued element of the Lie algebra at every point that performs the infinitesimal gauge transformation. This adds the Faddeev Popov determinant to the action:\n\n:<math> \\det\\left(\\partial_\\mu\\, D_\\mu\\right) \\,</math>\n\nwhich can be rewritten as a Grassmann integral by introducing ghost fields:\n\n:<math> \\int e^{\\bar\\eta \\partial_\\mu\\, D^\\mu \\eta}\\, D\\bar\\eta\\, D\\eta \\,</math>\n\nThe determinant is independent of {{mvar|f}}, so the path-integral over {{mvar|f}} can give the Feynman propagator (or a covariant propagator) by choosing the measure for {{mvar|f}} as in the abelian case. The full gauge fixed action is then the Yang Mills action in Feynman gauge with an additional ghost action:\n\n:<math> S= \\int \\operatorname{Tr} \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu \\partial^\\mu A^\\nu + f^i_{jk} \\partial^\\nu A_i^\\mu A^j_\\mu A^k_\\nu + f^i_{jr} f^r_{kl} A_i A_j A^k A^l + \\operatorname{Tr} \\partial_\\mu \\bar\\eta \\partial^\\mu \\eta + \\bar\\eta A_j \\eta \\,</math>\n\nThe diagrams are derived from this action. The propagator for the spin-1 fields has the usual Feynman form. There are vertices of degree 3 with momentum factors whose couplings are the structure constants, and vertices of degree 4 whose couplings are products of structure constants. There are additional ghost loops, which cancel out timelike and longitudinal states in {{mvar|A}} loops.\n\nIn the Abelian case, the determinant for covariant gauges does not depend on {{mvar|A}}, so the ghosts do not contribute to the connected diagrams.\n\n== Particle-path representation ==\nFeynman diagrams were originally discovered by Feynman, by trial and error, as a way to represent the contribution to the S-matrix from different classes of particle trajectories.\n\n=== Schwinger representation<!--'Schwinger representation' redirects here--> ===\nThe Euclidean scalar propagator has a suggestive representation:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{p^2+m^2} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\tau\\left(p^2 + m^2\\right)}\\, d\\tau </math>\n\nThe meaning of this identity (which is an elementary integration) is made clearer by Fourier transforming to real space.\n\n:<math> \\Delta(x) = \\int_0^\\infty d\\tau e^{-m^2\\tau} \\frac{1}{ ({4\\pi\\tau})^{d/2}}e^\\frac{-x^2}{ 4\\tau}</math>\n\nThe contribution at any one value of {{mvar|\u03c4}} to the propagator is a Gaussian of width {{math|{{sqrt|''\u03c4''}}}}. The total propagation function from 0 to {{mvar|x}} is a weighted sum over all proper times {{mvar|\u03c4}} of a normalized Gaussian, the probability of ending up at {{mvar|x}} after a random walk of time {{mvar|\u03c4}}.\n\nThe path-integral representation for the propagator is then:\n\n:<math> \\Delta(x) = \\int_0^\\infty d\\tau \\int DX\\, e^{- \\int\\limits_0^{\\tau} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{2} + m^2\\right) d\\tau'} </math>\n\nwhich is a path-integral rewrite of the '''Schwinger representation'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.\n\nThe Schwinger representation is both useful for making manifest the particle aspect of the propagator, and for symmetrizing denominators of loop diagrams.\n\n=== Combining denominators ===\nThe Schwinger representation has an immediate practical application to loop diagrams. For example, for the diagram in the {{math|''\u03c6''<sup>4</sup>}} theory formed by joining two {{mvar|x}}s together in two half-lines, and making the remaining lines external, the integral over the internal propagators in the loop is:\n\n: <math> \\int_k \\frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \\frac{1}{ (k+p)^2 + m^2} \\,.</math>\n\nHere one line carries momentum {{mvar|k}} and the other {{math|''k'' + ''p''}}. The asymmetry can be fixed by putting everything in the Schwinger representation.\n\n:<math> \\int_{t,t'} e^{-t(k^2+m^2) - t'\\left((k+p)^2 +m^2\\right) }\\, dt\\, dt'\\,. </math>\n\nNow the exponent mostly depends on {{math|''t'' + ''t''\u2032}},\n\n:<math> \\int_{t,t'} e^{-(t+t')(k^2+m^2) - t' 2p\\cdot k -t' p^2}\\,, </math>\n\nexcept for the asymmetrical little bit. Defining the variable {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''t'' + ''t''\u2032}} and {{math|''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''t''\u2032|''u''}}}}, the variable {{mvar|u}} goes from 0 to {{math|\u221e}}, while {{mvar|v}} goes from 0 to 1. The variable {{mvar|u}} is the total proper time for the loop, while {{mvar|v}} parametrizes the fraction of the proper time on the top of the loop versus the bottom.\n\nThe Jacobian for this transformation of variables is easy to work out from the identities:\n\n:<math> d(uv)= dt'\\quad du = dt+dt'\\,,</math>\n\nand \"wedging\" gives\n\n:<math> u\\, du \\wedge dv = dt \\wedge dt'\\,</math>.\n\nThis allows the {{mvar|u}} integral to be evaluated explicitly:\n\n:<math> \\int_{u,v} u e^{-u \\left( k^2+m^2 + v 2p\\cdot k + v p^2\\right)} = \\int \\frac{1}{\\left(k^2 + m^2 + v 2p\\cdot k - v p^2\\right)^2}\\, dv </math>\n\nleaving only the {{mvar|v}}-integral. This method, invented by Schwinger but usually attributed to Feynman, is called ''combining denominator''. Abstractly, it is the elementary identity:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{AB}= \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\big( vA+ (1-v)B\\big)^2}\\, dv </math>\n\nBut this form does not provide the physical motivation for introducing {{mvar|v}}; {{mvar|v}} is the proportion of proper time on one of the legs of the loop.\n\nOnce the denominators are combined, a shift in {{mvar|k}} to {{math|''k''\u2032 {{=}} ''k'' + ''vp''}} symmetrizes everything:\n\n:<math> \\int_0^1 \\int\\frac{1}{\\left(k^2 + m^2 + 2vp \\cdot k + v p^2\\right)^2}\\, dk\\, dv = \\int_0^1 \\int \\frac{1}{\\left(k'^2 + m^2 + v(1-v)p^2\\right)^2}\\, dk'\\, dv</math>\n\nThis form shows that the moment that {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}} is more negative than four times the mass of the particle in the loop, which happens in a physical region of Lorentz space, the integral has a cut. This is exactly when the external momentum can create physical particles.\n\nWhen the loop has more vertices, there are more denominators to combine:\n\n:<math> \\int dk\\, \\frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \\frac{1}{(k+p_1)^2 + m^2} \\cdots \\frac{1}{(k+p_n)^2 + m^2}</math>\n\nThe general rule follows from the Schwinger prescription for {{mvar|''n'' + 1}} denominators:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{D_0 D_1 \\cdots D_n} = \\int_0^\\infty \\cdots\\int_0^\\infty e^{-u_0 D_0 \\cdots -u_n D_n}\\, du_0 \\cdots du_n \\,.</math>\n\nThe integral over the Schwinger parameters {{mvar|u<sub>i</sub>}} can be split up as before into an integral over the total proper time {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''u''<sub>0</sub> + ''u''<sub>1</sub> \u2026 + ''u<sub>n</sub>''}} and an integral over the fraction of the proper time in all but the first segment of the loop {{math|''v<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''u<sub>i</sub>''|''u''}}}} for {{math|''i'' \u2208 {{mset|1,2,\u2026,''n''}}}}. The {{mvar|v<sub>i</sub>}} are positive and add up to less than 1, so that the {{mvar|v}} integral is over an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional simplex.\n\nThe Jacobian for the coordinate transformation can be worked out as before:\n\n:<math> du = du_0 + du_1 \\cdots + du_n \\,</math>\n:<math> d(uv_i) = d u_i \\,.</math>\n\nWedging all these equations together, one obtains\n\n:<math> u^n\\, du \\wedge dv_1 \\wedge dv_2 \\cdots \\wedge dv_n = du_0 \\wedge du_1 \\cdots \\wedge du_n \\,.</math>\n\nThis gives the integral:\n\n:<math> \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{\\mathrm{simplex}} u^n e^{-u\\left(v_0 D_0 + v_1 D_1 + v_2 D_2 \\cdots + v_n D_n\\right)}\\, dv_1\\cdots dv_n\\, du\\,, </math>\n\nwhere the simplex is the region defined by the conditions\n:<math>v_i>0 \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^n v_i < 1 </math>\nas well as\n:<math>v_0 = 1-\\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\\,.</math>\nPerforming the {{mvar|u}} integral gives the general prescription for combining denominators:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{ D_0 \\cdots D_n } = n! \\int_{\\mathrm{simplex}} \\frac{1}{ \\left(v_0 D_0 +v_1 D_1 \\cdots + v_n D_n\\right)^{n+1}}\\, dv_1\\, dv_2 \\cdots dv_n </math>\n\nSince the numerator of the integrand is not involved, the same prescription works for any loop, no matter what the spins are carried by the legs. The interpretation of the parameters {{mvar|v<sub>i</sub>}} is that they are the fraction of the total proper time spent on each leg.\n\n=== Scattering ===\nThe correlation functions of a quantum field theory describe the scattering of particles. The definition of \"particle\" in relativistic field theory is not self-evident, because if you try to determine the position so that the uncertainty is less than the [[compton wavelength]], the uncertainty in energy is large enough to produce more particles and antiparticles of the same type from the vacuum. This means that the notion of a single-particle state is to some extent incompatible with the notion of an object localized in space.\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]] gave a mathematical definition for single-particle states: they are a collection of states that form an irreducible representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group. Single particle states describe an object with a finite mass, a well defined momentum, and a spin. This definition is fine for protons and neutrons, electrons and photons, but it excludes quarks, which are permanently confined, so the modern point of view is more accommodating: a particle is anything whose interaction can be described in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have an interpretation as a sum over particle trajectories.\n\nA field operator can act to produce a one-particle state from the vacuum, which means that the field operator {{mvar|''\u03c6''(''x'')}} produces a superposition of Wigner particle states. In the free field theory, the field produces one particle states only. But when there are interactions, the field operator can also produce 3-particle, 5-particle (if there is no +/\u2212 symmetry also 2, 4, 6 particle) states too. To compute the scattering amplitude for single particle states only requires a careful limit, sending the fields to infinity and integrating over space to get rid of the higher-order corrections.\n\nThe relation between scattering and correlation functions is the LSZ-theorem: The scattering amplitude for {{mvar|n}} particles to go to {{mvar|m}} particles in a scattering event is the given by the sum of the Feynman diagrams that go into the correlation function for {{math|''n'' + ''m''}} field insertions, leaving out the propagators for the external legs.\n\nFor example, for the {{math|''\u03bb\u03c6''<sup>4</sup>}} interaction of the previous section, the order {{mvar|\u03bb}} contribution to the (Lorentz) correlation function is:\n\n:<math> \\left\\langle \\phi(k_1)\\phi(k_2)\\phi(k_3)\\phi(k_4)\\right\\rangle = \\frac{i}{k_1^2}\\frac{i}{k_2^2} \\frac{i}{k_3^2} \\frac{i}{k_4^2} i\\lambda \\,</math>\n\nStripping off the external propagators, that is, removing the factors of {{math|{{sfrac|''i''|''k''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, gives the invariant scattering amplitude {{mvar|M}}:\n\n:<math> M = i\\lambda \\,</math>\n\nwhich is a constant, independent of the incoming and outgoing momentum. The interpretation of the scattering amplitude is that the sum of {{math|{{abs|''M''}}<sup>2</sup>}} over all possible final states is the probability for the scattering event. The normalization of the single-particle states must be chosen carefully, however, to ensure that {{mvar|M}} is a relativistic invariant.\n\nNon-relativistic single particle states are labeled by the momentum {{mvar|k}}, and they are chosen to have the same norm at every value of {{mvar|k}}. This is because the nonrelativistic unit operator on single particle states is:\n\n:<math> \\int dk\\, |k\\rangle\\langle k|\\,. </math>\n\nIn relativity, the integral over the {{mvar|k}}-states for a particle of mass m integrates over a hyperbola in {{math|''E'',''k''}} space defined by the energy\u2013momentum relation:\n\n:<math> E^2 - k^2 = m^2 \\,.</math>\n\nIf the integral weighs each {{mvar|k}} point equally, the measure is not Lorentz-invariant. The invariant measure integrates over all values of {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|E}}, restricting to the hyperbola with a Lorentz-invariant delta function:\n\n:<math> \\int \\delta(E^2-k^2 - m^2) |E,k\\rangle\\langle E,k|\\, dE\\, dk = \\int {dk \\over 2 E} |k\\rangle\\langle k|\\,.</math>\n\nSo the normalized {{mvar|k}}-states are different from the relativistically normalized {{mvar|k}}-states by a factor of\n:<math>\\sqrt{E} = \\left(k^2-m^2\\right)^\\frac14\\,.</math>\n\nThe invariant amplitude {{mvar|M}} is then the probability amplitude for relativistically normalized incoming states to become relativistically normalized outgoing states.\n\nFor nonrelativistic values of {{mvar|k}}, the relativistic normalization is the same as the nonrelativistic normalization (up to a constant factor {{math|{{sqrt|''m''}}}}). In this limit, the {{math|''\u03c6''<sup>4</sup>}} invariant scattering amplitude is still constant. The particles created by the field {{mvar|\u03c6}} scatter in all directions with equal amplitude.\n\nThe nonrelativistic potential, which scatters in all directions with an equal amplitude (in the [[Born approximation]]), is one whose Fourier transform is constant\u2014a delta-function potential. The lowest order scattering of the theory reveals the non-relativistic interpretation of this theory\u2014it describes a collection of particles with a delta-function repulsion. Two such particles have an aversion to occupying the same point at the same time.\n\n== Nonperturbative effects ==\nThinking of Feynman diagrams as a perturbation series, nonperturbative effects like tunneling do not show up, because any effect that goes to zero faster than any polynomial does not affect the Taylor series. Even bound states are absent, since at any finite order particles are only exchanged a finite number of times, and to make a bound state, the binding force must last forever.\n\nBut this point of view is misleading, because the diagrams not only describe scattering, but they also are a representation of the short-distance field theory correlations. They encode not only asymptotic processes like particle scattering, they also describe the multiplication rules for fields, the [[operator product expansion]]. Nonperturbative tunneling processes involve field configurations that on average get big when the coupling constant gets small, but each configuration is a coherent superposition of particles whose local interactions are described by Feynman diagrams. When the coupling is small, these become collective processes that involve large numbers of particles, but where the interactions between each of the particles is simple.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThis means that nonperturbative effects show up asymptotically in resummations of infinite classes of diagrams, and these diagrams can be locally simple. The graphs determine the local equations of motion, while the allowed large-scale configurations describe non-perturbative physics. But because Feynman propagators are nonlocal in time, translating a field process to a coherent particle language is not completely intuitive, and has only been explicitly worked out in certain special cases. In the case of nonrelativistic bound states, the [[Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation]] describes the class of diagrams to include to describe a relativistic atom. For quantum chromodynamics, the Shifman Vainshtein Zakharov sum rules describe non-perturbatively excited long-wavelength field modes in particle language, but only in a phenomenological way.\n\nThe number of Feynman diagrams at high orders of perturbation theory is very large, because there are as many diagrams as there are graphs with a given number of nodes. Nonperturbative effects leave a signature on the way in which the number of diagrams and resummations diverge at high order. It is only because non-perturbative effects appear in hidden form in diagrams that it was possible to analyze nonperturbative effects in string theory, where in many cases a Feynman description is the only one available.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The use of the above diagram of the virtual particle producing a [[quark]]\u2013[[antiquark]] pair was featured in the television sit-com ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', in the episode \"The Bat Jar Conjecture\".\n* ''[[PhD Comics]]'' of January 11, 2012, shows Feynman diagrams that ''visualize and describe quantum academic interactions'', i.e. the paths followed by Ph.D. students when interacting with their advisors.<ref>[[Jorge Cham]], [http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1461 Academic Interaction \u2013 Feynman Diagrams], January 11, 2012.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Julian Schwinger#Schwinger and Feynman]]\n* [[Antiparticle|Stueckelberg\u2013Feynman interpretation]]\n* [[Penguin diagram]]\n* [[Path integral formulation]]\n* [[Propagator]]\n* [[List of Feynman diagrams]]\n* [[Angular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n* {{cite web |first1=Gerardus |last1='t Hooft |first2=Martinus |last2=Veltman |title=Diagrammar |series=CERN Yellow Report |year=1973 |url=http://preprints.cern.ch/cgi-bin/setlink?base=cernrep&categ=Yellow_Report&id=1973-009}}\n* {{cite book |first=David |last=Kaiser |title=Drawing Theories Apart: The Dispersion of Feynman Diagrams in Postwar Physics |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2005 |ISBN=0-226-42266-6}}\n* {{cite book |first=Martinus |last=Veltman |title=Diagrammatica: The Path to Feynman Diagrams |series=Cambridge Lecture Notes in Physics |ISBN=0-521-45692-4}} (expanded, updated version of 't Hooft & Veltman, 1973, cited above)\n* {{cite work |first=Mark |last=Srednicki |title=Quantum Field Theory |url=http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html |series=Script |year=2006}}\n* {{cite book |last=Schweber |first=S.

[[John T. Edge]], an American food writer, explains how writers in the genre view its topic: \"Food is essential to life. It\u2019s arguably our nation\u2019s biggest industry. Food, not sex, is our most frequently indulged pleasure. Food\u2014too much, not enough, the wrong kind, the wrong frequency\u2014is one of our society\u2019s greatest causes of disease and death.\"<ref>Edge, John T. [http://www.creativenonfiction.org/thejournal/articles/issue41/edge.html \"Between the Lines: Picnic in the Democrative Forest,\" ''Creative Nonfiction''; Issue 41, 2011.] Retrieved on April 25, 2012.</ref>  Another American food writer, [[Mark Kurlansky]], links this vision of food directly to food writing, giving the genre's scope and range when he observes: \u201cFood is about agriculture, about ecology, about man\u2019s relationship with nature, about the climate, about nation-building, cultural struggles, friends and enemies, alliances, wars, religion. It is about memory and tradition and, at times, even about sex.\u201d<ref>Kurlansky, Mark. ''Choice Cuts: a Savory Selection of Food Writing from around the World and throughout History''.  New York: Penguin, 2002, p. 1.</ref>  \n\nBecause food writing is topic centered, it is not a [[genre]] in itself, but writing that uses a wide range of traditional genres, including [[recipe]]s, [[journalism]], [[memoir]], and [[Travel literature|travelogues]]. Food writing can refer to poetry and fiction, such as Marcel Proust\u2019s ''[[\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (''In Search of Lost Time''), with its famous passage in which the narrator recollects his childhood memories as a result of sipping tea and eating a [[madeleine (cake)|madeleine]]; or [[Robert Burns]]' poem \"[[Address to a Haggis]]\", 1787. [[Charles Dickens]] is notable as a novelist who wrote memorably about food, e.g., in his ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843).\n\nOften, however, food writing is used to specify writing that takes a more literary approach to food, such as that of the famous American food writer [[M. F. K. Fisher]], who describes her writing about food as follows:\n\n<blockquote>It seems to me our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it ... and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied ... and it is all one.<ref>Fisher, M. F. K. ''The Gastronomical Me''. New York: North Point, 1989, p. ix.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this literary sense, food writing aspires toward more than merely communicating information about food; it also aims to provide readers with an aesthetic experience. Yet another American food writer, [[Adam Gopnik]], divides such food writing into two categories, \"the mock epic and the mystical microcosmic,\" and provides examples of their most noted practitioners: \n\n<blockquote>The mock epic ([[A. J. Liebling]], [[Calvin Trillin]], the French writer [[Robert Courtine]], and any good restaurant critic) is essentially comic and treats the small ambitions of the greedy eater as though they were big and noble, spoofing the idea of the heroic while raising the minor subject to at least temporary greatness. The mystical microcosmic, of which [[Elizabeth David]] and M. F. K. Fisher are the masters, is essentially poetic, and turns every remembered recipe into a meditation on hunger and the transience of its fulfillment.<ref>[[Gopnik, Adam]].

It came into wide use in the 1990s and, unlike \"sports writing\", or \"nature writing\", has yet to be included in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref>[http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=food+writing&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=5&smoothing=3 Ngram Viewer.] Retrieved on June 20, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.oed.com/ ''Oxford English Dictionary''.]  Retrieved on June 20, 2011.</ref> Consequently, definitions of food writing when applied to historical works are retrospective. Classics of food writing, such as the 18th-century French gastronome [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]]'s ''[[La physiologie du go\u00fbt]]'' (''The Physiology of Taste''), pre-date the term and have helped to shape its meaning.\n\n==In academia==\nFood writer [[Michael Pollan]] holds the Knight Professorship of Science and Environmental Journalism at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and since 2013 has directed the 11th Hour Food and Farming Journalism Fellowship Program.<ref>[http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/foodfellows/ ''The UC Berkeley-11th Hour Food and Farming Journalism Fellowship''.] Retrieved on December 16, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[University of South Florida St. Petersburg]] began a graduate certificate program in Food Writing and Photography, created by longtime ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' food and travel editor Janet K.

The aerial journey was simulated by an 18-minute ride on a [[conveyor system]], carrying 552 seated spectators at a time, covering a \u2153-mile winding path through the model, along with light, sound, and color effects. The ride moved at a rate of approximately {{convert|120|feet|abbr=on}} per minute or {{convert|1.36|mph|abbr=on}}, allowing spectators to look down through a continuous curved pane of glass towards the model. The virtue of this elevated position allowed spectators to see multiple scales simultaneously, viewing city blocks in proportion to a highway system, as well as artificially controlled trees in glass domes. This scale was modeled off 408 topographical sections based on aerial photographs of different regions of the U.S. provided by [[Fairchild Aircraft Ltd.]].<ref name= c />\n\n==Reception==\nBefore General Motors invited Bel Geddes to submit a proposal for the exhibit, they had planned to put in another [[production line]] as was featured at their exhibit in the [[Century of Progress|Century of Progress Exposition]] of 1933 in Chicago. However, after they heard Bel Geddes outline his project all other plans were scrapped as they favored his design for its appeal to a broader audience.<ref name=\"b\" /><ref>Herman, Arthur.

He was the brother of [[Alessandro Sforza|Alessandro]], whom he often fought alongside.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nFrancesco Sforza was born in [[San Miniato]], [[Tuscany]], one of the seven illegitimate sons of the condottiero [[Muzio Sforza]] and [[Lucia da Torsano]]. He spent his childhood in [[Tricarico]] (in the modern [[Basilicata]]), the marquisate of which he was granted in 1412 by King [[Ladislaus of Naples]]. In 1418, he married [[Polissena Ruffo]], a [[Calabria|Calabrese]] noblewoman.\n\nFrom 1419, he fought alongside his father, soon gaining fame for being able to bend metal bars with his bare hands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/700503203|title=Mercenaries : soldiers of fortune, from ancient Greece to today's private military companies|last=Lee.|first=Lanning, Michael|date=2005|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=9780307416049|location=New York|oclc=700503203}}</ref> He later proved himself to be an expert tactician and very skilled field commander. After the death of his father during the [[War of L'Aquila]], he participated in the [[Braccio da Montone]]'s final defeat in that campaign;  he fought subsequently for the Neapolitan army and then for [[Pope Martin V]] and the [[Duke of Milan]], [[Filippo Maria Visconti]]. After some successes, he fell in disgrace and was sent to the castle of [[Mortara, Lombardy|Mortara]] as a prisoner ''de facto''. He regained his status after leading an expedition against [[Lucca]].\n\nIn 1431, after a period during which he fought again for the [[Papal States]], he led the Milanese army against [[Venice]]; the following year the duke's daughter, [[Bianca Maria Visconti|Bianca Maria]], was betrothed to him. Despite these moves, the wary Filippo Maria never ceased to be distrustful of Sforza. The allegiance of mercenary leaders was dependent, of course, on pay; in 1433-1435, Sforza led the Milanese attack on the Papal States, but when he conquered [[Ancona]], in the [[Marche]], he changed sides, obtaining the title of vicar of the city directly from [[Pope Eugene IV]]. In 1436-39, he served variously both [[Florence]] and Venice.\n\nIn 1440, his fiefs in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] were occupied by King [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]], and, to recover the situation, Sforza reconciled himself with Filippo Visconti. On 25 October 1441, in [[Cremona]], he could finally marry Bianca Maria. The following year, he allied with [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], pretender to the throne of Naples, and marched against southern Italy. After some initial setbacks, he defeated the Neapolitan commander Niccol\u00f2 Piccinino, who had invaded his possessions in Romagna and Marche, through the help of [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]] (who had married his daughter Polissena) and the Venetians, and could return to Milan.\n\nSforza later found himself warring against [[Francesco Piccinino]] (whom he defeated at the [[Battle of Montolmo]] in 1444) and, later, the alliance of Visconti, Eugene IV, and Malatesta, who had allegedly murdered Polissena. With the help of Venice, Sforza was again victorious and, in exchange for abandoning the Venetians, received the title of ''capitano generale'' (commander-in-chief) of the Duchy of Milan's armies.\n\n===Duke of Milan===\nAfter the duke died without a male heir in 1447, fighting broke out to restore the so-called [[Ambrosian Republic]].<ref name=\"Lucas\">Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' (Harper Bros.: New York, 1960) p. 268.</ref> The name Ambrosian Republic takes its name from [[St. Ambrose]], the [[patron saint]] of Milan.<ref name=\"Lucas\" /> [[Agnese del Maino]], his wife's mother, convinced the condottiero who held [[Pavia]] to restore it to him.<ref>{{cite book | authors=Echols and Williams | pages=21\u201322 }}</ref>\n\nHe also received the seigniory of other cities of the duchy, including [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], and started to carefully plan the conquest of the ephemeral republic, allying with [[William VIII of Montferrat]] and (again) Venice. In 1450, after years of famine, riots raged in the streets of Milan and the city's senate decided to entrust to him the duchy. Sforza entered the city as Duke on 26 February.  It was the first time that such a title was handed over by a lay institution. While the other Italian states gradually recognized Sforza as the legitimate Duke of Milan, he was never able to obtain official investiture from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. That did not come to the Sforza Dukes until 1494, when Emperor Maximilian formally invested Francesco's son, [[Ludovico Sforza|Ludovico]], as Duke of Milan.\n\nUnder his rule (which was moderate and skillful), Sforza modernised the city and duchy. He created an efficient system of taxation that generated enormous revenues for the government, his court became a center of [[Renaissance]] learning and culture, and the people of Milan grew to love him. In Milan, he founded the [[Ospedale Maggiore]], restored the [[Palazzo dell'Arengo]], and had the [[Naviglio d'Adda]], a channel connecting with the [[Adda River]], built.\n\nDuring Sforza's reign, Florence was under the command of [[Cosimo de' Medici]] and the two rulers became close friends. This friendship eventually manifested in first the [[Peace of Lodi]] and then the [[Italian League]], a multi-polar defensive alliance of Italian states that succeeded in stabilising almost all of Italy for its duration. After the peace, Sforza renounced part of the conquests in eastern Lombardy obtained by his condottieri [[Bartolomeo Colleoni]], [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], and [[Roberto Sanseverino]] after 1451. As King Alfonso of Naples was among the signatories of the treaty, Sforza also abandoned his long support of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevin]] pretenders to Naples. He also aimed to conquer [[Genoa]], then an Angevin possession; when a revolt broke out there in 1461, he had [[Spinetta Campofregoso]] elected as [[doge of Genoa|Doge]], as his puppet. Sforza occupied Genoa and [[Savona]] in 1464.\n\nSforza was the first European ruler to follow a foreign policy based on the concept of the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], and the first native Italian ruler to conduct extensive diplomacy outside the peninsula to counter the power of threatening states such as France. Sforza's policies succeeded in keeping foreign powers from dominating Italian politics for the rest of the century.\n\nSforza suffered from [[hydropsy]] and [[gout]]. In 1462, rumours spread that he was dead and a riot exploded in Milan. He however survived for four more years, finally dying in March 1466. He was succeeded as duke by his son, [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]].\n\nFrancesco's successor Ludovico  commissioned [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to design an [[Leonardo's horse|equestrian statue]] as part of a monument to Francesco I Sforza. A clay model of a horse which was to be used as part of the design was completed by Leonardo in 1492&nbsp;\u2014 but the statue was never built. In 1999 the horse alone was cast from Leonardo's original designs in bronze and placed in Milan outside the racetrack of Ippodromo del Galoppo.\n\n==Culture==\nFrancesco Sforza is mentioned several times in [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s book ''[[The Prince]]''; he is generally praised in that work for his ability to hold his country and as a warning to a prince not to use [[mercenary]] troops.\n\nHe was a moderate patron of the arts. The main humanist of his court was the writer [[Francesco Filelfo]].\nHis best works were mentioned in chapters 7, 12, and 14.\n\n==Issue==\nFrancesco Sforza with his second wife [[Bianca Maria Visconti]] had nine children, seven sons and two daughters:\n* [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza|Galeazzo Maria]] (24 January 1444 \u2014 26 December 1476), Duke of Milan from 1466 to 1476.\n* [[Ippolita Maria Sforza|Ippolita Maria]] (18 April 1446 \u2014 20 August 1484), wife of [[Alfonso II of Naples]] and mother of [[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella of Aragon]], who was to marry Galeazzo's heir.\n* Filippo Maria (12 December 1449 \u2014 1492), Count of Corsica.\n* Sforza Maria (18 August 1451 \u2014 29 July 1479), Duke of Bari from 1464 to 1479.\n* Francesco Galeazzo Maria (5 August 1453/54 \u2014 died young).\n* [[Ludovico Sforza|Ludovico Maria]] (3 August 1452 \u2014 27 May 1508), Duke of Bari from 1479 to 1494 and Duke of Milan from 1494 to 1499.\n* [[Ascanio Maria Sforza|Ascanio Maria]] (3 March 1455 \u2014 28 May 1505), Abbot of Chiaraville, Bishop of Pavia, Cremona, Pesaro, and Novara and Cardinal.\n* Elisabetta Maria (10 June 1456 \u2014 1473), wife of [[William VIII, Marquess of Montferrat|Guglielmo VIII Paleologo]], Margrave of Montferrat.\n* Ottaviano Maria (30 April 1458 \u2014 1477), Count of Lugano, who drowned while escaping arrest.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | title=An annotated index of medieval women | authors= Anne Echols and Marty Williams| year=1992 | publisher=Markus Wiener Publishing, Inc }}\n* {{cite book|first=Claudio|last=Rendina|title=I capitani di ventura|publisher=Netwon Compton|location=Rome|year=1994}}\n* Antonio Menniti Ippolito, Francesco I Sforza, duca di Milano, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, L, Roma 1998, pp.&nbsp;1\u201315.\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-new}} \n{{s-ttl|title=[[Duke of Milan]]|years=1450\u20131466}} \n{{s-aft|after= [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sforza, Francesco 01}}\n[[Category:1401 births]]\n[[Category:1466 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Pisa]]\n[[Category:House of Sforza|Francesco 1]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Milan|Francesco 1]]\n[[Category:Condottieri]]\n[[Category:Knights of the Garter]]\n[[Category:15th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:Burials at Milan Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Deaths from edema]]\n[[Category:Republic of Venice generals]]", "sha1": "grr1i1y09wggmpdqie5qsim9ywpvupf"}}, {"title": "Folk dance", "ns": "0", "id": "11624", "revision": {"id": "866125918", "parentid": "866125638", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T12:23:01Z", "contributor": {"username": "AWG97", "id": "26394121"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Indonesia */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Dansa tradicional valenciana - Museu Valenci\u00e0 d'Etnologia.jpg|thumb|270px|Traditional Valencian dances]]\nA '''folk dance''' is developed by people that reflect the life of the people of a certain country or region. Not all ethnic dances are folk dances. For example, [[ritual dance]]s or dances of ritual origin are not considered to be folk dances. Ritual dances are usually called \"Religious dances\" because of their purpose.\nThe terms \"ethnic\" and \"traditional\" are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance. In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones. If some dances, such as [[polka]], cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between \"folk\" and \"ballroom dance\", ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention.\n==Background==\nThey share some or all of the following attributes:\n\n*Dances are usually held at folk dance gatherings or social functions by people with little or no professional training, often to traditional music.\n*Dances not generally designed for public performance or the stage, though they may later be arranged and set for stage performances.\n*Execution dominated by an inherited tradition from various international cultures rather than innovation (though folk traditions change over time).\n*New dancers often learn informally by observing others or receiving help from others.\nMore controversially, some people define folk dancing as dancing for which there is no governing body or dancing for which there are no competitive or professional institutions. The term \"folk dance\" is sometimes applied to dances of historical importance in European culture and history; typically originating before the 20th century. For other cultures the terms \"ethnic dance\" or \"traditional dance\" are sometimes used, although the latter terms may encompass [[ceremonial dance]]s.\n\nThere are a number of modern dances, such as hip hop dance, that evolve spontaneously, but the term \"folk dance\" is generally not applied to them, and the terms \"street dance\" or \"vernacular dance\" are used instead. The term \"folk dance\" is reserved for dances which are to a significant degree bound by tradition and originated in the times when the distinction existed between the dances of \"common folk\" and the dances of the modern ballroom dances originated from folk ones.\n\n==Europe==\nVarieties of European folk dances include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Ball de bastons]]\n*[[Barn dance]]\n*[[Bulgarian dances]]\n**[[Pravo|Pravo horo]]\n**[[Paidushko horo]]\n**[[Gankino horo]]\n**[[Daychovo horo]]\n**Rachenitza\n*[[C\u00e9ilidh]]\n*[[Clogging]]\n*[[English country dance]]\n*[[Fandango]]\n*[[Fest noz]]\n*[[Freilekhs]]\n*[[Georgian dance|Georgian folk dances]]\n*[[Greek dances]]\n*[[Hora (dance)|Hora]]\n*[[International folk dance]]\n* [[Irish dance]]\n* [[Italian folk dance]]\n**[[Tarantella]]\n**[[Calabrian Tarantella]]\n**[[Pizzica]]\n**[[Monferrina]]\n**[[Ballu tundu]]\n*[[Jota (music)|Jota]]\n*[[Maypole dance]]\n*[[Morris dance]]\n**[[Nantgarw tradition|Welsh Morris dance]]\n*[[Polka]]\n*[[Polonaise|Polonez]]\n*[[Russian folk dances]]\n*[[Turkish dance]]\n*[[Ukrainian dance]]\n*[[Verbu\u0148k]]\n*Nordic [[Polska (dance)|polska]] dance\n*[[Square dance]]\n*[[Sword dance]]\n*[[Weapon dance]]\n*[[Kolo (dance)|Kolo]]\n{{div col end}}\nSword dances include Longsword dances and rapper dancing. Some [[choreographed]] dances such as [[contra dance]], [[Scottish country dance]], and [[modern Western square dance]], are called folk dances, though this is not true in the strictest sense. [[Country dance]] overlaps with contemporary folk dance and ballroom dance. Most country dances and ballroom dances originated from folk dances, with gradual refinement over the years.\n\nPeople familiar with folk dancing can often determine what country a dance is from even if they have not seen that particular dance before. Some countries' dances have features that are unique to that country, although neighboring countries sometimes have similar features.  For example, the [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n [[Schuhplattler|schuhplattling dance]] consists of slapping the body and shoes in a fixed pattern, a feature that few other countries' dances have.\n\nFolk dances sometimes evolved long before current political boundaries, so that certain dances are shared by several countries.  For example, some Serbian, Bulgarian, and Croatian dances share the same or similar dances, and sometimes even use the same name and music for those dances.\n\n[[International folk dance]] groups exist in cities and college campuses in many countries, in which dancers learn folk dances from many cultures for recreation.\n\n[[Balfolk]] events are [[social dance]] events with live music in Western and Central Europe, originating in the folk revival of the 1970s and becoming more popular since about 2000, where popular European partner dances from the end of the 19th century such as the [[schottische]], [[polka]], [[mazurka]] and [[waltz]] are danced, with additionally other European folk dances, mainly from France, but also from Sweden, Spain and other countries.\n\n==Middle East, Central Asia and South Asia==\n* [[Attan]] - The national dance of Pakistan.

Dostoevsky's literary works explore [[human psychology]] in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of [[Russian Empire|19th-century Russia]], and engage with a variety of [[philosophical]] and [[religious]] themes. His most acclaimed works include ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), ''[[The Idiot]]'' (1869), [[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|''Demons'']] (1872) and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880). Dostoevsky's oeuvre consists of 11 novels, three novellas, 17 short stories and numerous other works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest [[psychologist]]s in [[world literature]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dostoevsky the Thinker: A Philosophical Study|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23116-dostoevsky-the-thinker/|last=Scanlan|first=James Patrick|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8014-3994-0}}</ref> His 1864 novella ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' is considered to be one of the first works of [[existentialism|existentialist]] literature.\n\nBorn in [[Moscow]] in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through [[fairy tales]] and [[legend]]s, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute]]. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'', which gained him entry into [[St. Petersburg]]'s literary circles. Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group that discussed banned books critical of \"[[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]]\", he was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later ''[[A Writer's Diary]]'', a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a [[gambling addiction]], which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers.\n\nDostoevsky was influenced by a wide variety of philosophers and authors including [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]], [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Plato]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Vissarion Belinsky|Belinsky]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]], [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]]. His writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians like [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] as well as philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages. \n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{double image|left|Maria Fyodorovna Dostoyevskaya.jpg|116|Mikhail Andreyevich Dostoyevsky.jpg|116|Maria Fyodorovna Dostoyevskaya|Mikhail Andreyevich Dostoyevsky}}\n\nDostoevsky's parents were part of a multi-ethnic and multi-denominational noble family, its branches including [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christians, [[Poland|Polish]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435|url=http://www.klassika.ru/cgi-bin/bio.pl?type=search&string=%C4%EE%F1%F2%EE%E5%E2%F1%EA%E8%E9|work=Klassika.ru}}</ref> The family traced its roots back to a [[Tatar peoples|Tatar]], Aslan Chelebi-[[Morza|Murza]], who in 1389 defected from the [[Golden Horde]] and joined the forces of [[Dmitry Donskoy]], the first prince of [[Muscovy]] to openly challenge the Mongol authority in the region,<ref>Robert Geraci, \"Islam\" in Deborah A.

From there he was assigned to a Moscow hospital, where he served as military doctor, and in 1818, he was appointed a senior physician. In 1819 he married Maria Nechayeva. The following year, he took up a post at the Mariinsky Hospital for the poor. After the birth of his first two sons, [[Mikhail Dostoyevsky|Mikhail]] and Fyodor, he was promoted to collegiate assessor, a position which raised his legal status to that of the nobility and enabled him to acquire a small estate in Darovoye, a town about 150&nbsp;km (100 miles) from Moscow, where the family usually spent the summers.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=11}} Dostoevsky's parents subsequently had six more children: Varvara (1822\u20131892), Andrei (1825\u20131897), Lyubov (born and died 1829), Vera (1829\u20131896), Nikolai (1831\u20131883) and Aleksandra (1835\u20131889).<ref>{{cite book|last=Terras|first=Victor|title=Handbook of Russian Literature|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=VjKh2gkCudAC|page=102}}|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|page=102|isbn=0-300-04868-8}}</ref>{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=1\u20135}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=6\u201322}}\n<!--Both of his parents may have had Tatar ancestry as well.{{sfn|Lavrin|1947|p=7}}{{sfn|Hingley|1978|p=17}}-->\n\n== Childhood (1821\u20131835) ==\nFyodor Dostoevsky, born on {{OldStyleDate|11 November|1821|30 October}}, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky and Maria Dostoevskaya (born Nechayeva). He was raised in the family home in the grounds of the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor, which was in a lower class district on the edges of Moscow.{{sfn|Bloom|2004|p=9}} Dostoevsky encountered the patients, who were at the lower end of the Russian social scale, when playing in the hospital gardens.{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=72}}\n\nDostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age. From the age of three, he was reading heroic sagas, fairy tales and legends by his nanny, Alena Frolovna, an especially influential figure in his upbringing and love for fictional stories.{{sfn|Leatherbarrow|2002|p=23}} When he was four his mother used the Bible to teach him to read and write. His parents introduced him to a wide range of literature, including Russian writers [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzin]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] and [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]]; [[Gothic fiction]] such as [[Ann Radcliffe]]; romantic works by [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; heroic tales by [[Cervantes]] and [[Walter Scott]]; and [[Homer]]'s [[epic poetry|epics]].{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=6\u201311}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=23\u201354}} Although his father's approach to education has been described as strict and harsh,{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|p=4}} Dostoevsky himself reports that his imagination was brought alive by nightly readings by his parents.{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=72}}\n\nSome of his childhood experiences found their way into his writings. When a nine-year-old girl had been raped by a drunk, he was asked to fetch his father to attend to her. The incident haunted him, and the theme of the desire of a mature man for a young girl appears in ''The Devils'', ''The Brothers Karamazov'', ''Crime and Punishment'', and other writings.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=61}} An incident involving a family servant, or [[Serfdom in Russia|serf]], in the estate in Darovoye, is described in \"[[The Peasant Marey]]\": when the young Dostoevsky imagines hearing a wolf in the forest, Marey, who is working nearby, comforts him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruttenburg |first=Nancy |date=4 January 2010 |title=Dostoevsky's Democracy |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=MLKbtdvf2fUC|page=76}} |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=76\u201377}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Dostoevsky had a delicate physical constitution, his parents described him as hot-headed, stubborn and cheeky.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=6}} In 1833, Dostoevsky's father, who was profoundly religious, sent him to a French boarding school and then to the Chermak boarding school. He was described as a pale, introverted dreamer and an over-excitable romantic.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=39}} To pay the school fees, his father borrowed money and extended his private medical practice. Dostoevsky felt out of place among his aristocratic classmates at the Moscow school, and the experience was later reflected in some of his works, notably ''[[The Raw Youth|The Adolescent]]''.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=14\u20135}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=23\u201354}}\n\n== Youth (1836\u20131843) ==\n[[File:Image dost 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Dostoevsky as a [[Military engineering|military engineer]]]]\n\nOn 27 September 1837 Dostoevsky's mother died of [[tuberculosis]]. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail to St Petersburg to attend the free [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute]], forcing the brothers to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members. Mikhail was refused admission on health grounds and was sent to the Academy in [[Reval]], Estonia.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=17\u201323}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u201390}}\n\nDostoevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics and military engineering and his preference for drawing and architecture. As his friend [[Konstantin Trutovsky]] once said, \"There was no student in the entire institution with less of a military bearing than F. M. Dostoyevsky. He moved clumsily and jerkily; his uniform hung awkwardly on him; and his knapsack, shako and rifle all looked like some sort of fetter he had been forced to wear for a time and which lay heavily on him.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=2}} Dostoevsky's character and interests made him an outsider among his 120 classmates: he showed bravery and a strong sense of justice, protected newcomers, aligned himself with teachers, criticised corruption among officers and helped poor farmers. Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected by his classmates. His reclusiveness and interest in religion earned him the nickname \"Monk [[Photius]]\".{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=24\u20137}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u2013111}}\n\nSigns of Dostoevsky's epilepsy may have first appeared on learning of the death of his father on 16 June 1839,{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=59}} although the reports of a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] originated from accounts written by his daughter (later expanded by [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>Reik, Theodor (1940).

His father's official cause of death was an [[apoplectic]] stroke, but a neighbour, Pavel Khotiaintsev, accused the father's serfs of murder. Had the serfs been found guilty and sent to [[Siberia]], Khotiaintsev would have been in a position to buy the vacated land. The serfs were acquitted in a trial in [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], but Dostoevsky's brother Andrei perpetuated the story.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=109}} After his father's death, Dostoevsky continued his studies, passed his exams and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy. He visited Mikhail in Reval, and frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets. During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=31\u20136}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u2013111}}\n\nOn 12 August 1843 Dostoevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment owned by Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as \"no less good-natured and no less courteous than his brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, became vexed, forgot good manners, and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of self-awareness\".{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=114\u20135}} Dostoevsky's first completed literary work, a translation of [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Eug\u00e9nie Grandet]]'', was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th and 7th volume of the journal ''Repertoire and Pantheon'',{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=104}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Grossman |first=Leonid |year=2011 |title=\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 |language=Russian |trans-title=Dostoyevsky  |publisher=[[AST (publisher)|AST]] |page=536}}</ref> followed by several other translations.

His friend [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, took the manuscript to the poet [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], who in turn showed it to the renowned and influential literary critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]]. Belinsky described it as Russia's first \"[[social novel]]\".{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=73}} ''Poor Folk'' was released on 15 January 1846 in the ''St Petersburg Collection'' [[almanac]] and became a commercial success.{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=113\u201357}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=42\u20139}}\n\nDostoevsky felt that his military career would endanger his now flourishing literary career, so he wrote a letter asking to resign his post. Shortly thereafter, he wrote his second novel, ''[[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|The Double]]'', which appeared in the journal ''Notes of the Fatherland'' on 30 January 1846, before being published in February. Around the same time, Dostoevsky discovered socialism through the writings of French thinkers [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], [[Cabet]], [[Proudhon]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Through his relationship with Belinsky he expanded his knowledge of the philosophy of socialism. He was attracted to its logic, its sense of justice and its preoccupation with the destitute and the disadvantaged. However, his relationship with Belinsky became increasingly strained as Belinsky's [[atheism]] and dislike of religion clashed with Dostoevsky's Russian Orthodox beliefs. Dostoevsky eventually parted with him and his associates.{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=159\u201382}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=53\u20135}}\n\nAfter ''The Double'' received negative reviews, Dostoevsky's health declined and he had more frequent seizures, but he continued writing. From 1846 to 1848 he released several short stories in the magazine ''Annals of the Fatherland'', including \"[[Mr. Prokharchin]]\", \"The Landlady\", \"A Weak Heart\", and \"[[White Nights (short story)|White Nights]]\". These stories were unsuccessful, leaving Dostoevsky once more in financial trouble, so he joined the [[Utopian Socialism|utopian socialist]] Betekov circle, a tightly knit community which helped him to survive.

In 1846, on the recommendation of the poet [[Aleksey Pleshcheyev]],{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=115\u201321}} he joined the [[Petrashevsky Circle]], founded by [[Mikhail Petrashevsky]], who had proposed social reforms in Russia. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] once wrote to [[Alexander Herzen]] that the group was \"the most innocent and harmless company\" and its members were \"systematic opponents of all revolutionary goals and means\".{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=59}} Dostoevsky used the circle's library on Saturdays and Sundays and occasionally participated in their discussions on freedom from censorship and the abolition of [[serfdom]].{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=239\u201346, 259\u2013346}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=58\u201369}}\n\nIn 1849, the first parts of ''[[Netochka Nezvanova (novel)|Netochka Nezvanova]]'', a novel Dostoevsky had been planning since 1846, were published in ''Annals of the Fatherland'', but his banishment ended the project.

Dostoevsky was accused of reading works by Belinsky, including the banned ''Letter to Gogol'',<ref name=Belinsky>Belinsky, Vissarion (1847).

Antonelli, the government agent who had reported the group, wrote in his statement that at least one of the papers criticised Russian politics and religion. Dostoevsky responded to these charges by declaring that he had read the essays only \"as a literary monument, neither more nor less\"; he spoke of \"personality and human egoism\" rather than of politics. Even so, he and his fellow \"conspirators\" were arrested on 23 April 1849 at the request of Count [[Alexey Fyodorovich Orlov|A. Orlov]] and Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas&nbsp;I]], who feared a revolution like the [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825 in Russia and the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Europe. The members were held in the well-defended [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], which housed the most dangerous convicts.{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=121\u201333}}{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=6\u201368}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=72\u20139}}\n\nThe case was discussed for four months by an investigative commission headed by the Tsar, with Adjutant General [[Ivan Nabokov]], senator Prince [[Pavel Gagarin]], Prince [[Vasily Andreyevich Dolgorukov|Vasili Dolgorukov]], General [[Yakov Rostovtsev]] and General [[Leonty Dubelt]], head of the secret police. They sentenced the members of the circle to death by firing squad, and the prisoners were taken to Semyonov Place in St Petersburg on 23 December 1849 where they were split into three-man groups. Dostoevsky was the third in the second row; next to him stood Pleshcheyev and Durov. The execution was stayed when a cart delivered a letter from the Tsar commuting the sentence.\n\nDostoevsky served four years of exile with hard labour at a [[katorga]] prison camp in [[Omsk]], Siberia, followed by a term of compulsory military service. After a fourteen-day sleigh ride, the prisoners reached [[Tobolsk]], a prisoner way station. Despite the circumstances, Dostoevsky consoled the other prisoners, such as the Petrashevist Ivan Yastrzhembsky, who was surprised by Dostoevsky's kindness and eventually abandoned his decision to commit suicide. In Tobolsk, the members received food and clothes from the Decembrist women, as well as several copies of the [[New Testament]] with a ten-ruble banknote inside each copy. Eleven days later, Dostoevsky reached Omsk{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=6\u201368}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=79\u201396}} together with just one other member of the Petrashevsky Circle, the poet [[Sergei Durov]].{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=113}} Dostoevsky described his barracks:\n\n{{quote|In summer, intolerable closeness; in winter, unendurable cold.

He was only permitted to read his New Testament Bible. In addition to his seizures, he had [[haemorrhoid]]s, lost weight and was \"burned by some fever, trembling and feeling too hot or too cold every night\". The smell of the privy pervaded the entire building, and the small bathroom had to suffice for more than 200 people. Dostoevsky was occasionally sent to the military hospital, where he read newspapers and Dickens novels. He was respected by most of the other prisoners, and despised by some because of his [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] statements.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=131}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=96\u2013108}}\n\n=== Release from prison and first marriage (1854\u20131866) ===\nAfter his release on 14 February 1854, Dostoevsky asked Mikhail to help him financially and to send him books by [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Guizot]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].{{sfn|Frank|1988|pp=8\u201320}} ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|The House of the Dead]]'', based on his experience in prison, was published in 1861 in the journal Vremya&nbsp;\u2013 it was the first published novel about Russian prisons.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|pp=107\u201321}} Before moving in mid-March to [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]], where he was forced to serve in the Siberian Army Corps of the Seventh Line Battalion, Dostoevsky met geographer [[Pyotr Semyonov]] and ethnographer [[Shokan Walikhanuli]]. Around November 1854, he met Baron {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Egorovich Wrangel|de|3=Alexander Jegorowitsch Wrangel}}, an admirer of his books, who had attended the aborted execution. They both rented houses in the Cossack Garden outside Semipalatinsk. Wrangel remarked that Dostoevsky \"looked morose. His sickly, pale face was covered with freckles, and his blond hair was cut short. He was a little over average height and looked at me intensely with his sharp, grey-blue eyes. It was as if he were trying to look into my soul and discover what kind of man I was.\"{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=112\u20133}}{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=165\u2013267}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=108\u201313}}\n\nIn Semipalatinsk, Dostoevsky tutored several schoolchildren and came into contact with upper-class families, including that of Lieutenant-Colonel Belikhov, who used to invite him to read passages from newspapers and magazines. During a visit to Belikhov, Dostoevsky met the family of Alexander Ivanovich Isaev and Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva and fell in love with the latter. Alexander Isaev took a new post in [[Novokuznetsk|Kuznetsk]], where he died in August 1855. Maria and her son then moved with Dostoevsky to [[Barnaul]]. In 1856 Dostoevsky sent a letter through Wrangel to General Eduard Totleben, apologising for his activity in several utopian circles. As a result, he obtained the right to publish books and to marry, although he remained under police surveillance for the rest of his life. Maria married Dostoevsky in Semipalatinsk on 7 February 1857, even though she had initially refused his marriage proposal, stating that they were not meant for each other and that his poor financial situation precluded marriage. Their family life was unhappy and she found it difficult to cope with his seizures. Describing their relationship, he wrote: \"Because of her strange, suspicious and fantastic character, we were definitely not happy together, but we could not stop loving each other; and the more unhappy we were, the more attached to each other we became\". They mostly lived apart.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=168}} In 1859 he was released from military service because of deteriorating health and was granted permission to return to Russia, first to [[Tver]], where he met his brother for the first time in ten years, and then to St Petersburg.{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=175\u2013221}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=115\u201363}}\n\n[[File:Dostoevskij 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dostoevsky in Paris, 1863]]\n\n\"A Little Hero\" (Dostoevsky's only work completed in prison) appeared in a journal, but \"Uncle's Dream\" and \"The Village of Stepanchikovo\" were not published until 1860.

In London, he met [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]] and visited the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]]. He travelled with [[Nikolay Strakhov]] through Switzerland and several North Italian cities, including Turin, Livorno, and Florence.

He met his second love, [[Apollinaria Suslova|Polina Suslova]], in Paris and lost nearly all his money gambling in Wiesbaden and Baden-Baden. In 1864 his wife Maria and brother Mikhail died, and Dostoevsky became the lone parent of his stepson Pasha and the sole supporter of his brother's family. The failure of ''[[Epoch (Russian magazine)|Epoch]]'', the magazine he had founded with Mikhail after the suppression of ''Vremya'', worsened his financial situation, although the continued help of his relatives and friends averted bankruptcy.{{sfn|Frank|1988|pp=197\u2013211, 283\u201394, 248\u2013365}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=151\u201375}}\n\n=== Second marriage and honeymoon (1866\u20131871) ===\nThe first two parts of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' were published in January and February 1866 in the periodical ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'',{{sfn|Frank|2009|p=462}} attracting at least 500 new subscribers to the magazine.{{sfn|Leatherbarrow|2002|p=83}}\n\nDostoevsky returned to Saint Petersburg in mid-September and promised his editor, [[Fyodor Stellovsky]], that he would complete ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]'', a short novel focused on [[problem gambling|gambling addiction]], by November, although he had not yet begun writing it. One of Dostoevsky's friends, Milyukov, advised him to hire a secretary. Dostoevsky contacted [[stenography|stenographer]] Pavel Olkhin from Saint Petersburg, who recommended his pupil, the twenty-year-old [[Anna Snitkina|Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina]].

The 7,000 rubles he had earned from ''Crime and Punishment'' did not cover their debts, forcing Anna to sell her valuables. On 14 April 1867, they began a delayed honeymoon in Germany with the money gained from the sale. They stayed in Berlin and visited the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], where he sought inspiration for his writing. They continued their trip through Germany, visiting [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Heidelberg]] and [[Karlsruhe]].

In April 1871, Dostoevsky made a final visit to a gambling hall in Wiesbaden. Anna claimed that he stopped gambling after the birth of their second daughter, but this is a subject of debate.{{efn|Another reason for his abstinence might have been the closure of casinos in Germany in 1872 and 1873 (it was not until the rise of Adolf Hitler that they were reopened){{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=245}} or his entering a synagogue that he confused with a gambling hall.

Their son Fyodor was born on 16 July, and they moved to an apartment near the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|Institute of Technology]] soon after. They hoped to cancel their large debts by selling their rental house in Peski, but difficulties with the tenant resulted in a relatively low selling price, and disputes with their creditors continued.

[[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], future Imperial High Commissioner of the [[Most Holy Synod]], influenced Dostoevsky's political progression to conservatism. Around early 1872 the family spent several months in [[Staraya Russa]], a town known for its [[mineral spa]].

''Demons'' was finished on 26 November and released in January 1873 by the \"Dostoyevsky Publishing Company\", which was founded by Dostoevsky and his wife. Although they only accepted cash payments and the bookshop was in their own apartment, the business was successful, and they sold around 3,000 copies of ''Demons''. Anna managed the finances. Dostoevsky proposed that they establish a new periodical, which would be called ''A Writer's Diary'' and would include a collection of essays, but funds were lacking, and the ''Diary'' was published in [[Vladimir Meshchersky]]'s ''The Citizen'', beginning on 1 January, in return for a salary of 3,000 rubles per year. In the summer of 1873, Anna returned to Staraya Russa with the children, while Dostoevsky stayed in St Petersburg to continue with his ''Diary''.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=38\u2013118}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=269\u201389}}\n\nIn March 1874, Dostoevsky left ''The Citizen'' because of the stressful work and interference from the Russian bureaucracy. In his fifteen months with ''The Citizen'', he had been taken to court twice: on 11 June 1873 for citing the words of Prince Meshchersky without permission, and again on 23 March 1874. Dostoevsky offered to sell a new novel he had not yet begun to write to ''The Russian Messenger'', but the magazine refused. Nikolay Nekrasov suggested that he publish ''A Writer's Diary'' in ''Notes of the Fatherland''; he would receive 250 rubles for each printer's sheet&nbsp;\u2013 100 more than the text's publication in ''The Russian Messenger'' would have earned. Dostoevsky accepted. As his health began to decline, he consulted several doctors in St Petersburg and was advised to take a cure outside Russia. Around July, he reached Ems and consulted a physician, who diagnosed him with acute [[catarrh]]. During his stay he began ''The Adolescent''. He returned to Saint Petersburg in late July.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=120\u201347}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=273\u201395}}\n\nAnna proposed that they spend the winter in Staraya Russa to allow Dostoevsky to rest, although doctors had suggested a second visit to Ems because his health had previously improved there. On 10 August 1875 his son Alexey was born in Staraya Russa, and in mid-September the family returned to Saint Petersburg. Dostoevsky finished ''The Adolescent'' at the end of 1875, although passages of it had been serialised in ''Notes of the Fatherland'' since January. ''The Adolescent'' chronicles the life of Arkady Dolgoruky, the illegitimate child of the landowner Versilov and a peasant mother. It deals primarily with the relationship between father and son, which became a frequent theme in Dostoevsky's subsequent works.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=149\u201397}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=273\u2013302}}\n\n=== Last years (1876\u20131881) ===\nIn early 1876, Dostoevsky continued work on his ''Diary''. The book includes numerous essays and a few short stories about society, religion, politics and ethics. The collection sold more than twice as many copies as his previous books. Dostoevsky received more letters from readers than ever before, and people of all ages and occupations visited him. With assistance from Anna's brother, the family bought a [[dacha]] in Staraya Russa. In the summer of 1876, Dostoevsky began experiencing shortness of breath again. He visited Ems for the third time and was told that he might live for another 15 years if he moved to a healthier climate. When he returned to Russia, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] ordered Dostoevsky to visit his palace to present the ''Diary'' to him, and he asked him to educate his sons, Sergey and Paul. This visit further increased Dosteyevsky's circle of acquaintances. He was a frequent guest in several salons in Saint Petersburg and met many famous people, including Princess [[Sophia Tolstaya]], [[Yakov Polonsky]], [[Sergei Witte]], [[Alexey Suvorin]], [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Ilya Repin]].{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=199\u2013280}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=303\u20136}}\n\nDostoevsky's health declined further, and in March 1877 he had four epileptic seizures. Rather than returning to Ems, he visited Maly Prikol, a manor near [[Kursk]]. While returning to St Petersburg to finalise his ''Diary'', he visited Darovoye, where he had spent much of his childhood. In December he attended Nekrasov's funeral and gave a speech. He was appointed an honorary member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], from which he received an honorary certificate in February 1879. He declined an invitation to an international congress on copyright in Paris after his son Alyosha had a severe epileptic seizure and died on 16 May. The family later moved to the apartment where Dostoevsky had written his first works. Around this time, he was elected to the board of directors of the Slavic Benevolent Society in Saint Petersburg. That summer, he was elected to the honorary committee of the [[Association Litt\u00e9raire et Artistique Internationale]], whose members included [[Victor Hugo]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Paul Heyse]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Anthony Trollope]], [[Henry Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Dostoevsky made his fourth and final visit to Ems in early August 1879. He was diagnosed with early-stage [[pulmonary emphysema]], which his doctor believed could be successfully managed, but not cured.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=320\u2013375}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=307\u201349}}\n\n[[File:Dostoyevsky's funeral.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|Dostoevsky's funeral]]\n\nOn 3 February 1880 Dostoevsky was elected vice-president of the Slavic Benevolent Society, and he was invited to speak at the unveiling of the Pushkin memorial in Moscow. On 8 June he delivered [[Dostoyevsky's Pushkin Speech|his speech]], giving an impressive performance that had a significant emotional impact on his audience. His speech was met with thunderous applause, and even his long-time rival Turgenev embraced him. [[Konstantin Staniukovich]] praised the speech in his essay \"The Pushkin Anniversary and Dostoyevsky's Speech\" in ''[[:ru:\u0414\u0435\u043b\u043e (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430)|The Business]]'', writing that \"the language of Dostoyevsky's [Pushkin Speech] really looks like a sermon.

Suslova's dalliance with a Spaniard in late spring and Dostoevsky's gambling addiction and age ended their relationship. He later described her in a letter to Nadezhda Suslova as a \"great egoist. Her egoism and her vanity are colossal. She demands ''everything'' of other people, all the perfections, and does not pardon the slightest imperfection in the light of other qualities that one may possess\", and later stated \"I still love her, but I do not want to love her any more. She doesn't deserve this love&nbsp;...\"{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=168}} In 1858 Dostoevsky had a romance with comic actress Aleksandra Ivanovna Schubert.

She wrote that he \"became very attracted to me\".{{sfn|Frank|1988|pp=18\u20139}}{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=183\u20134}}\n\nThrough a worker in ''Epoch'', Dostoevsky learned of the Russian-born Martha Brown (n\u00e9e Elizaveta Andreyevna Chlebnikova), who had had affairs with several westerners. Her relationship with Dostoevsky is known only through letters written between November 1864 and January 1865.{{sfn|Frank|2009|pp=445\u20136}}{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=45\u20136}} In 1865, Dostoevsky met [[Anne Jaclard|Anna Korvin-Krukovskaya]]. Their relationship is not verified; Anna Dostoevskaya spoke of a good affair, but Korvin-Krukovskaya's sister, the mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]], thought that Korvin-Krukovskaya had rejected him.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=169}}\n\n=== Political beliefs ===\nIn his youth, Dostoevsky enjoyed reading [[Nikolai Karamzin]]'s ''History of the Russian State'', which praised conservatism and Russian independence, ideas that Dostoevsky would embrace later in life. Before his arrest for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, Dostoevsky remarked, \"As far as I am concerned, nothing was ever more ridiculous than the idea of a [[Republicanism|republican]] government in Russia.\" In an 1881 edition of his ''Diaries'', Dostoevsky <!-- \"favoured republicanism\" Contradictory? --> stated that the Tsar and the people should form a unity: \"For the people, the tsar is not an external power, not the power of some conqueror&nbsp;... but a power of all the people, an all-unifying power the people themselves desired.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183\u201389}}\n\nWhile critical of serfdom, Dostoevsky was skeptical about the creation of a [[constitutional monarchy|constitution]], a concept he viewed as unrelated to Russia's history. He described it as a mere \"gentleman's rule\" and believed that \"a constitution would simply enslave the people\". He advocated social change instead, for example removal of the feudal system and a weakening of the divisions between the peasantry and the affluent classes. His ideal was a [[utopia]]n, Christianized Russia where \"if everyone were actively Christian, not a single social question would come up&nbsp;... If they were Christians they would settle everything\".{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}} He thought democracy and [[oligarchy]] were poor systems; of France he wrote, \"the oligarchs are only concerned with the interest of the wealthy; the democrats, only with the interest of the poor; but the interests of society, the interest of all and the future of France as a whole\u2014no one there bothers about these things.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}} He maintained that political parties ultimately led to social discord. In the 1860s, he discovered ''[[Pochvennichestvo]]'', a movement similar to [[Slavophilism]] in that it [[Anti-Europeanism|rejected Europe's culture]] and contemporary philosophical movements, such as nihilism and materialism. ''Pochvennichestvo'' differed from Slavophilism in aiming to establish, not an isolated Russia, but a more open state modelled on the Russia of [[Peter the Great]].{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}}\n\nIn his incomplete article \"Socialism and Christianity\", Dostoevsky claimed that civilisation (\"the second stage in human history\") had become degraded, and that it was moving towards liberalism and losing its faith in God. He asserted that the traditional concept of Christianity should be recovered. He thought that contemporary western Europe had \"rejected the single formula for their salvation that came from God and was proclaimed through revelation, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself', and replaced it with practical conclusions such as, {{'}}''Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous''{{'}} [Every man for himself and God for all], or \"scientific\" slogans like '[[Survival of the fittest|the struggle for survival]]{{'\"}}.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183\u201389}} He considered this crisis to be the consequence of the collision between communal and individual interests, brought about by a decline in religious and moral principles.\n\nDostoevsky distinguished three \"enormous world ideas\" prevalent in his time: Roman Catholicism, [[Protestantism]] and [[Russian Orthodox]]y. He claimed that Catholicism had continued the tradition of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and had thus become anti-Christian and proto-socialist, inasmuch as the Church's interest in political and mundane affairs led it to abandon the idea of Christ. For Dostoevsky, socialism was \"the latest incarnation of the Catholic idea\" and its \"natural ally\".{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=185}} He found [[Protestantism]] self-contradictory and claimed that it would ultimately lose power and spirituality. He deemed Russian Orthodoxy to be the ideal form of Christianity.\n\nFor all that, to place politically Dostoevsky is not that simple, but: as a Christian, he rejected the atheistic socialism; as a traditionalist, he rejected the destruction of the institutions and, as a pacifist, any violent method or upheaval led by both progressives or reactionaries.\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]], Dostoevsky asserted that war might be necessary if salvation were to be granted. He wanted the Muslim [[Ottoman Empire]] eliminated and the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] restored, and he hoped for the liberation of [[Balkan]] Slavs and their unification with the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183\u201389}}\n\n=== Racial beliefs ===\n\nJewish characters in Dostoevsky's works have been described as displaying negative stereotypes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/dostoevsky-and-the-jews/|title=Dostoevsky and the Jews|last1=Eberstadt|first1=Fernanda|magazine=Commentary Magazine|date=1987}}</ref> In a letter to Arkady Kovner from 1877, a Jew who had accused Dostoevsky of antisemitism, he replied with the following:<blockquote>\"I am not an enemy of the Jews at all and never have been.

Several critics, such as [[Nikolay Dobrolyubov]], [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], viewed his writing as excessively psychological and philosophical rather than artistic. Others found fault with chaotic and disorganised plots, and others, like Turgenev, objected to \"excessive psychologising\" and too-detailed naturalism. His style was deemed \"prolix, repetitious and lacking in polish, balance, restraint and good taste\". [[Saltykov-Shchedrin]], Tolstoy, [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] and others criticised his puppet-like characters, most prominently in ''The Idiot'', ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (''The Possessed'', ''The Devils'')<ref name=\"Demons-Possessed\">The 1872 novel \u2033Demons\u2033, {{lang-ru|\u0411\u0435\u0441\u044b}}, ''B\u00e9sy'', by Fyodor Dostoevsky is sometimes also titled ''The Possessed'' or ''The Devils''</ref> and ''The Brothers Karamazov''. These characters were compared to those of Hoffmann, an author whom Dostoevsky admired.{{sfn|Terras|1998|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nBasing his estimation on stated criteria of enduring art and individual genius, Nabokov judges Dostoevsky \"not a great writer, but rather a mediocre one\u2014with flashes of excellent humour but, alas, with wastelands of literary platitudes in between\". Nabokov complains that the novels are peopled by \"neurotics and lunatics\" and states that Dostoevsky's characters do not develop: \"We get them all complete at the beginning of the tale and so they remain.\" He finds the novels full of contrived \"surprises and complications of plot\", which are effective when first read, but on second reading, without the shock and benefit of these surprises, appear loaded with \"glorified clich\u00e9\".<ref name=Nabokov>{{cite book|last=Nabokov|first=Vladamir|title=Lectures on Russian Literature|year=1981|publisher=Harvest Book/Harcourt|isbn=0-15-602776-3|pages=97\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n=== Reputation ===\n[[File:Tala Birell-Douglass Dumbrille in Crime and Punishment.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Publicity still from the 1935 film ''[[Crime and Punishment (1935 American film)|Crime and Punishment]]'']][[File:Columbo Peter Falk 1973.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Peter Falk's [[Columbo]] character was partially inspired by Porfiry Petrovich from ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'']]\n\nDostoevsky's books have been translated into more than 170 languages.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=foreword}} The German translator Wilhelm Wolfsohn published one of the first translations, parts of ''Poor Folk'', in an 1846\u20131847 magazine,{{sfn|Meier-Gr\u00e4fe|1988|p=492}} and a French translation followed.

Princess Varvara Dmitrevna Obolenskaya was among the first to propose staging ''Crime and Punishment''. Dostoevsky did not refuse permission, but he advised against it, as he believed that \"each art corresponds to a series of poetic thoughts, so that one idea cannot be expressed in another non-corresponding form\". His extensive explanations in opposition to the transposition of his works into other media were groundbreaking in fidelity criticism. He thought that just one episode should be dramatised, or an idea should be taken and incorporated into a separate plot.{{sfn|Burry|2011|p=3}} According to critic Alexander Burry, some of the most effective adaptions are [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s opera ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]'s opera ''[[From the House of the Dead]]'', [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Idiot (1951 film)|The Idiot]]'' and [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s film ''[[The Possessed (1988 film)|The Possessed]]''.{{sfn|Burry|2011|p=5}}\n\nIn later years director [[Janek Ambros]] adapted \"[[The Grand Inquisitor]]\" into Nazi Croatia (The [[Ustasa]] Regime) during World War II {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for claim|date=August 2018}} and the television detective character of [[Columbo]] was partially inspired by ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' character Porfiry Petrovich.<ref name=\"latimes1\">{{Cite journal |last=Sachs |first=Mark |date=2003-01-28 |title=Dostoevsky, a touch of Columbo |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/28/entertainment/et-tips28 |journal=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], passages of Dostoevsky books were sometimes shortened, although only two books were censored: ''Demons''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opentextnn.ru/censorship/russia/sov/libraries/books/blium/ilp/?id=344|title=[\u0414-\u0417] |work=Forbidden Books of Russian Writers and Literary Scientists, 1917\u20131991|publisher=}}</ref> and ''Diary of a Writer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opentextnn.ru/censorship/russia/sov/libraries/books/blium/ilp/kritik/?id=579|title=3.3. \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 \u043e\u0431 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445|publisher=|work=Forbidden Books of Russian Writers and Literary Scientists, 1917\u20131991}}</ref> His philosophy, particularly in ''Demons'', was deemed anti-capitalist but also anti-Communist and reactionary.{{sfn|Bloshteyn|2007|pp=7\u20138}} The idea that Dostoevsky's writings were strictly censored under Soviet leadership is a myth: the writer was very popular and well received in the Soviet Union, his books selling over 34.4 million copies from 1917 to 1981, around 540 thousand copies per year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} According to historian Boris Ilizarov, Stalin read Dostoevsky's ''The Brothers Karamazov'' several times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gazeta-pravda.ru/content/view/115/ |title=\u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0451 \u043e\u0442 \u044e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0430\u0441\u0430 |language=Russian |trans-title=Fids from a young Papuan |author=Vladimir Bushin |publisher=[[Pravda]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201750/http://gazeta-pravda.ru/content/view/115/ |archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nDostoevsky's works of fiction include 15 novels and novellas, 17 short stories, and 5 translations. Many of his longer novels were first published in [[Serial (literature)|serialised form]] in literary magazines and journals. The years given below indicate the year in which the novel's final part or first complete book edition was published. In English many of his novels and stories are known by different titles.\n\n=== Major works ===\n==== ''Poor Folk'' ====\n{{Main|Poor Folk}}\n\n''Poor Folk'' is an [[epistolary novel]] that describes the relationship between the small, elderly official Makar Devushkin and the young seamstress Varvara Dobroselova, remote relatives who write letters to each other. Makar's tender, sentimental adoration for Varvara and her confident, warm friendship for him explain their evident preference for a simple life, although it keeps them in humiliating poverty. An unscrupulous merchant finds the inexperienced girl and hires her as his housewife and guarantor. He sends her to a manor somewhere on a steppe, while Makar alleviates his misery and pain with alcohol.\n\nThe story focuses on poor people who struggle with their lack of self-esteem. Their misery leads to the loss of their inner freedom, to dependence on the social authorities, and to the extinction of their individuality. Dostoevsky shows how poverty and dependence are indissolubly aligned with deflection and deformation of self-esteem, combining inward and outerward suffering.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=69\u2013103}}\n\n==== ''Notes from Underground'' ====\n{{Main|Notes from Underground}}\n\n''Notes from Underground'' is split into two stylistically different parts, the first essay-like, the second in narrative style. The protagonist and [[first-person narrator]] is an unnamed 40-year-old civil servant known as The Underground Man. The only known facts about his situation are that he has quit the service, lives in a basement flat on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg and finances his livelihood from a modest inheritance.\n\nThe first part is a record of his thoughts about society and his character. He describes himself as vicious, squalid and ugly; the chief focuses of his [[polemic]] are the \"modern human\" and his vision of the world, which he attacks severely and cynically, and towards which he develops aggression and vengefulness. He considers his own decline natural and necessary. Although he emphasises that he does not intend to publish his notes for the public, the narrator appeals repeatedly to an ill-described audience, whose questions he tries to address.\n\nIn the second part he describes scenes from his life that are responsible for his failure in personal and professional life and in his love life. He tells of meeting old school friends, who are in secure positions and treat him with condescension. His aggression turns inward on to himself and he tries to humiliate himself further. He presents himself as a possible saviour to the poor prostitute Lisa, advising her to reject self-reproach when she looks to him for hope. Dostoevsky added a short commentary saying that although the storyline and characters are fictional, such things were inevitable in contemporary society.\n\nThe Underground Man was very influential on philosophers. His alienated existence from the mainstream influenced [[modernist literature]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Halliwell|first=Martin|title=Transatlantic Modernism: Moral Dilemmas in Modernist Fiction|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=RXLT4Gu4aQ4C|page=13}}|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0-7486-2393-0|page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eysteinsson|first=\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur|title=The Concept of Modernism|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=peKRAu4U458C|page=29}}|year=1990|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8077-9|page=29}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Crime and Punishment'' ====\n{{Main|Crime and Punishment}}\n\n''Crime and Punishment'' describes [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov|Rodion Raskolnikov]]'s life, from the murder of a pawnbroker and her sister, through spiritual regeneration with the help of Sonya (a \"[[hooker with a heart of gold]]\"), to his sentence in Siberia. Strakhov liked the novel, remarking that \"Only ''Crime and Punishment'' was read in 1866\" and that Dostoevsky had managed to portray a Russian person aptly and realistically.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=183}} Otherwise, it received a mixed reception from critics, with most of the negative responses coming from nihilists. [[Grigory Eliseev]] of the radical magazine ''[[The Contemporary]]'' called the novel a \"fantasy according to which the entire student body is accused without exception of attempting murder and robbery\".{{sfn|Frank|1997|p=45, 60\u2013182}}\n\n==== ''The Idiot'' ====\n{{Main|The Idiot}}\n\nThe novel's protagonist, the 26-year-old [[Prince Myshkin]], returns to Russia after several years at a Swiss sanatorium. Scorned by Saint Petersburg society for his trusting nature and naivety, he finds himself at the center of a struggle between a beautiful kept woman, Nastasya, and a jealous but pretty young girl, Aglaya, both of whom win his affection. Unfortunately, Myshkin's goodness precipitates disaster, leaving the impression that, in a world obsessed with money, power and sexual conquest, a sanatorium may be the only place for a saint. Myshkin is the personification of a \"relatively beautiful man\", namely Christ. Coming \"from above\" (the Swiss mountains), he physically resembles common depictions of [[Jesus Christ]]: slightly larger than average, with thick, blond hair, sunken cheeks and a thin, almost entirely white goatee. Like Christ, Myshkin is a teacher, confessor and mysterious outsider. Passions such as greed and jealousy are alien to him. In contrast to those around him, he puts no value on money and power. He feels compassion and love, sincerely, without judgment. His relationship with the immoral Nastasya is obviously inspired by Christ's relationship with [[Mary Magdalene]]. He is called \"Idiot\" because of such differences.{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=241\u2013363}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=274\u2013309}}\n\n==== ''Demons'' ====\n{{Main|Demons (Dostoevsky novel)}}\n\nThe story of ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (sometimes also titled ''The Possessed'' or ''The Devils'')<ref name=\"Demons-Possessed\" /> is based largely on the murder of Ivan Ivanov by \"People's Vengeance\" members in 1869. It was influenced by the [[Book of Revelation]]. The secondary characters, Pyotr and Stepan Verkhovensky, are based on [[Sergey Nechayev|Sergei Nechayev]] and [[Timofey Granovsky]] respectively.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=310\u2013322}} The novel takes place in a provincial Russian setting, primarily on the estates of Stepan Verkhovensky and Varvara Stavrogina. Stepan's son Pyotr is an aspiring revolutionary conspirator who attempts to organise revolutionaries in the area. He considers Varvara's son Nikolai central to his plot, because he thinks that Nikolai lacks sympathy for mankind. Pyotr gathers conspirators such as the philosophising Shigalyov, the suicidal Kirillov and the former military man Virginsky. He schemes to consolidate their loyalty to him and each other by murdering Ivan Shatov, a fellow conspirator. Pyotr plans to have Kirillov, who is committed to killing himself, take credit for the murder in his suicide note. Kirillov complies and Pyotr murders Shatov, but his scheme goes awry. Pyotr escapes, but the remainder of his aspiring revolutionary crew is arrested. In the denouement, Nikolai kills himself, tortured by his own misdeeds.\n\n==== ''The Brothers Karamazov'' ====\n{{Main|The Brothers Karamazov}}\n\nAt nearly 800 pages, ''The Brothers Karamazov'' is Dostoevsky's largest work. It received both critical and popular acclaim and is often cited as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=390\u2013441}} Composed of 12 \"books\", the novel tells the story of the novice [[Alyosha Karamazov]], the non-believer Ivan Karamazov and the soldier Dmitri Karamazov. The first books introduce the Karamazovs. The main plot is the death of their father Fyodor, while other parts are philosophical and religious arguments by Father Zosima to Alyosha.{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=567\u2013705}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=337\u2013414}}\n\nThe most famous chapter is \"[[The Grand Inquisitor]]\", a [[parable]] told by Ivan to Alyosha about Christ's [[Second Coming]] in [[Seville]], Spain, in which Christ is imprisoned by a ninety-year-old Catholic [[Grand Inquisitor]]. Instead of answering him, Christ gives him a kiss, and the Inquisitor subsequently releases him, telling him not to return. The tale was misunderstood as a defence of the Inquisitor, but some, such as [[Romano Guardini]], have argued that the Christ of the parable was Ivan's own interpretation of Christ, \"the idealistic product of the unbelief\". Ivan, however, has stated that he is against Christ. Most contemporary critics and scholars agree that Dostoevsky is attacking Roman Catholicism and socialist atheism, both represented by the Inquisitor.

This term is deliberately used by [[Robert L. Saucy]] in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?''.<ref name=\"grudem et al.\">{{cite book |last= Saucy |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L.

Carson: Biographical Sketch |work= Monergism.com |publisher= Christian Publication Resource Foundation |location= Portland, OR |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}</ref> In dealing with the claims of [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|Warfield]], particularly \"Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased,\"{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} Carson asserts, \"But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so.\"{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, \"Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith.\"{{sfn|Carson|1987|pages=174\u20135}}\n\nThe second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as [[cessationism]], its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. [[Richard Gaffin]] argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy's in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today''? In his book ''Perspectives on Pentecost''{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}} Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that \"the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church.\"{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|pages=113\u20134}} Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying \"At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14,15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on.\"{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|page=114}}\n\n===Fraud===\nSkeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a [[quackery|quack]] practice in which the \"healers\" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} [[James Randi]]'s ''[[The Faith Healers]]'' investigates Christian evangelists such as [[Peter Popoff]], who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants' lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html|title=Some Thoughts about Faith Healing|website=www.quackwatch.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes.{{efn|\"[Some] faith-healers have been less than careful in their use of funds sent to them for specific purposes.\"[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} Physicist [[Robert L.

In this show, Derren trained a scuba diver trainer picked from the general public to be a faith healer and took him to Texas to successfully deliver a faith healing session to a congregation.<ref name=\"metro-derren-brown\">{{cite news |url= http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041421/http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303/ |dead-url= no |archive-date= February 15, 2013 |title= Derren Brown: Miracles For Sale was deceptively entertaining polio |newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date= April 25, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nThere have also been legal controversies.

In this first phase of his career, Lang alternated between films such as ''[[Der M\u00fcde Tod]]'' (\"The Weary Death\") and popular thrillers such as ''[[Die Spinnen]]'' (\"The Spiders\"), combining popular genres with Expressionist techniques to create an unprecedented synthesis of popular entertainment with [[art film|art cinema]].\n\nIn 1920, he met his future wife, the writer [[Thea von Harbou]]. She and Lang co-wrote all of his movies from 1921 through 1933, including ''[[Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler]]'' (Dr. Mabuse the Gambler; 1922), which ran for over four hours in two parts in the original version and was the first in the [[Dr. Mabuse]] trilogy, the five-hour ''[[Die Nibelungen: Siegfried|Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924), the famous 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', and the science fiction film ''[[Woman in the Moon]]'' (1929). ''Metropolis'' went far over budget and nearly destroyed the Ufa which was bought by right-wing businessman and politician [[Alfred Hugenberg]]. It was a financial flop as well as his last silent films ''[[Spione|Spies]]'' (1928) and ''Woman in the Moon'' produced by Lang's own company.\n\n[[File:Fritz Lang und Thea von Harbou, 1923 od. 1924.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Fritz Lang and [[Thea von Harbou]] in their Berlin flat, 1923 or 1924]]\n\nIn 1931 independent producer [[Seymour Nebenzahl]] hired Lang to direct ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' for [[Nero-Film]]. His first \"[[talkie|talking]]\" picture, considered by many film scholars to be a masterpiece of the early sound era, ''M'' is a disturbing story of a child murderer ([[Peter Lorre]] in his first starring role) who is hunted down and brought to rough justice by Berlin's criminal underworld. ''M'' remains a powerful work; it was [[M (1951 film)|remade]] in 1951 by [[Joseph Losey]], but this version had little impact on audiences, and has become harder to see than the original film.\n\nDuring the climactic final scene in ''M'', Lang allegedly threw Peter Lorre down a flight of stairs in order to give more authenticity to Lorre's battered look. Lang, who was known for being hard to work with, epitomized the stereotype of the tyrannical German film director, a type embodied also by [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Otto Preminger]]. His wearing a [[monocle]] added to the stereotype.\n\nIn the films of his German period, Lang produced a coherent oeuvre that established the characteristics later attributed to [[film noir]], with its recurring themes of psychological conflict, paranoia, fate and moral ambiguity.\n\nAt the end of 1932, Lang started filming ''[[The Testament of Dr. Mabuse]]''. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in January 1933, and by March 30, the new regime banned it as an incitement to public disorder. ''Testament'' is sometimes deemed an anti-Nazi film as Lang had put phrases used by the Nazis into the mouth of the title character.\n\nLang was worried about the advent of the Nazi regime, partly because of his Jewish heritage,<ref name=\"religion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pl/Fritz_Lang.html|title=The religion of director Fritz Lang|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> whereas his wife and screenwriter [[Thea von Harbou]] had started to sympathize with the Nazis in the early 1930s and joined the [[NSDAP]] in 1940. They soon divorced. Lang's fears would be realized following his departure from Austria, as under the [[Nuremberg Laws]] he would be identified as a Jew even though his mother was a converted Roman Catholic, and he was raised as such.\n\n===Emigration===\nAccording to Lang, propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] called Lang to his offices to inform him that ''[[The Testament of Dr Mabuse]]'' was being banned but that he was nevertheless so impressed by Lang's abilities as a filmmaker (especially ''Metropolis''), he was offering Lang a position as the head of German film studio [[Universum Film AG|UFA]]. Lang had stated that it was during this meeting that he had decided to leave for Paris \u2013 but that the banks had closed by the time the meeting was over. Lang has stated that he fled that very evening.<ref>Michel Ciment: ''Fritz Lang, Le meurtre et la loi, Ed. Gallimard, Collection [[D\u00e9couvertes Gallimard]] (vol. 442), 04/11/2003.

From the beginning Lang was struggling with restrictions in the US.

He made twenty-three features in his 20-year American career, working in a variety of genres at every major studio in Hollywood, and occasionally producing his films as an independent. Lang's American films were often compared unfavorably to his earlier works by contemporary critics, but the restrained Expressionism of these films is now seen as integral to the emergence and evolution of American genre cinema, ''[[film noir]]'' in particular. Lang's 1945 film ''[[Scarlet Street]]'' is considered a central film in the genre.\n\nOne of his most famous ''films noir'' is the police drama ''[[The Big Heat]]'' (1953), noted for its uncompromising brutality, especially for a scene in which [[Lee Marvin]] throws scalding coffee on [[Gloria Grahame]]'s face. As Lang's visual style simplified, in part due to the constraints of the Hollywood studio system, his worldview became increasingly pessimistic, culminating in the cold, geometric style of his last American films, ''[[While the City Sleeps (1956 film)|While the City Sleeps]]'' (1956) and ''[[Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956 film)|Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1956).\n\nFinding it difficult to find congenial production conditions and backers in Hollywood, particularly as his health declined with age, Lang contemplated retirement. The German producer [[Artur Brauner]] had expressed interest in remaking ''[[The Indian Tomb (1921 film)|The Indian Tomb]]'' (from an original story by Thea von Harbou, that Lang had developed in the 1920s which had ultimately been directed by [[Joe May]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Plass|first=Ulrich| title = Dialectic of Regression: Theador W Adorno and Fritz Lang| journal = [[Telos (journal)|Telos]]| volume = 149 | page = 131 | date = Winter 2009}}</ref>  So Lang returned to Germany,<ref name=\"gold195912\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1959-12/Galaxy_1959_12#page/n5/mode/2up | title=Of All Things | work=Galaxy | date=December 1959 | accessdate=15 June 2014 | author=Gold, H.

Following the production, Brauner was  preparing for a remake of ''[[The Testament of Dr. Mabuse]]'' when Lang approached him with the idea of adding a new original film to the series. The result was ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]]'' (1960), whose success led to a series of new Mabuse films, which were produced by Brauner (including the remake of ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse''), though Lang did not direct any of the sequels. ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]]'' can be viewed as the marriage between the director's early experiences with expressionist techniques in Germany with the spartan style already visible in his late American work.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Lang was approaching blindness during the production,<ref>[[Robert Bloch]]. \"In Memoriam: Fritz Lang\" in Bloch's ''Out of My Head''.

These include regulating lasers, cellular phones, condoms and control of disease on products ranging from certain household [[pet]]s to [[sperm donation]] for [[assisted reproduction]].\n\nThe FDA is led by the [[Commissioner of Food and Drugs]], appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The Commissioner reports to the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]].

Consumer Safety Officers, more commonly called Investigators, are the individuals who inspect production and warehousing facilities, investigate complaints, illnesses, or outbreaks, and review documentation in the case of medical devices, drugs, biological products, and other items where it may be difficult to conduct a physical examination or take a physical sample of the product.\n\nThe Office of Regulatory Affairs is divided into five regions, which are further divided into 20 districts. Districts are based roughly on the geographic divisions of the [[United States federal court system|federal court system]]. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. ORA also includes the Agency's network of regulatory laboratories, which analyze any physical samples taken.  Though samples are usually food-related, some laboratories are equipped to analyze drugs, cosmetics, and radiation-emitting devices.\n\nThe Office of Criminal Investigations was established in 1991 to investigate criminal cases. Unlike ORA Investigators, OCI Special Agents are armed, and don't focus on technical aspects of the regulated industries. OCI agents pursue and develop cases where individuals and companies have committed criminal actions, such as fraudulent claims, or knowingly and willfully shipping known adulterated goods in interstate commerce. In many cases, OCI pursues cases involving [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] violations (e.g., conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, mail fraud), in addition to prohibited acts as defined in Chapter III of the FD&C Act. OCI Special Agents often come from other criminal investigations backgrounds, and work closely with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Assistant Attorney General]], and even [[Interpol]]. OCI receives cases from a variety of sources\u2014including ORA, local agencies, and the FBI\u2014and works with ORA Investigators to help develop the technical and science-based aspects of a case.  OCI is a smaller branch, comprising about 200 agents nationwide.\n\nThe FDA frequently works with other federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]], and [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]. Often local and state government agencies also work with the FDA to provide regulatory inspections and enforcement action.\n\n==Scope and funding==\nThe FDA regulates more than US${{Format price|2400000000000}} worth of consumer goods, about 25% of consumer expenditures in the [[United States]]. This includes $466 billion in food sales, $275 billion in drugs, $60 billion in cosmetics and $18 billion in vitamin supplements. Much of these expenditures are for goods imported into the United States; the FDA is responsible for monitoring imports.<ref name=\"NYT-2Nov08\"/>\n\nThe FDA's federal budget request for fiscal year (FY) 2012 totaled $4.36 billion,<ref name=train/> while the proposed 2014 budget is $4.7 billion.<ref name=wright2013/>  About $2 billion of this budget is generated by user fees.

The requested budget authority was an increase of $50.7 million more than the FY 2008 funding&nbsp;\u2013 about a three percent increase.

Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are \"FDA Compliant\" or \"FDA Acceptable\".\n\n===Medications===\n[[File:FDA Bldg 51 - Main Entrance (5161374834).jpg|thumb|FDA Building 51 houses the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.]]\nThe [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs.  A drug is considered \"new\" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different [[excipient]]s or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. The most rigorous requirements apply to ''new molecular entities'': drugs that are not based on existing medications.\n\n====New medications====\nNew drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a [[new drug application]] (NDA).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/NewDrugApplicationNDA/ | title = New Drug Application (NDA) | publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = November 20, 2012}}</ref> Critics, however, argue that the FDA standards are not sufficiently rigorous, allowing unsafe or ineffective drugs to be approved.<ref>{{citation |title=Medical Nihilism |author=Jacob Stegenga |publisher=OUP |year=2018 |isbn= 9780198747048 | url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/medical-nihilism-9780198747048?cc=hr&lang=en&}}</ref> New drugs are available only by prescription by default.  A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first.  A drug that is approved is said to be \"safe and effective when used as directed\".\n\nSome very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols, as was the case during the 2015 Ebola epidemic with the use, by prescription and authorization, of [[ZMapp]] and other experimental treatments, and for new drugs that can be used to treat debilitating and/or very rare conditions for which no existing remedies or drugs are satisfactory, or where there has not been an advance in a long period of time. The studies are progressively longer, gradually adding more individuals as they progress from stage I to stage III, normally over a period of years, and normally involve drug companies, the government and its laboratories, and often medical schools and hospitals and clinics. However, any exceptions to the aforementioned process are subject to strict review and scrutiny and conditions, and are only given if a substantial amount of research and at least some preliminary human testing has shown that they are believed to be somewhat safe and possibly effective.\n\n=====Advertising and promotion=====\nThe FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion reviews and regulates prescription drug advertising and promotion through surveillance activities and issuance of enforcement letters to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Advertising and promotion for over-the-counter drugs is regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].\n\nThe drug advertising regulation<ref>21 CFR 202: Prescription Drug Advertising.</ref> contains two broad requirements: (1) a company may advertise or promote a drug only for the specific indication or medical use for which it was approved by FDA. Also, an advertisement must contain a \"fair balance\" between the benefits and the risks (side effects) of a drug.\n\nThe term [[off-label]] refers to drug usage for indications other than those approved by the FDA.\n\n=====Postmarket safety surveillance=====\nAfter NDA approval, the sponsor must review and report to the FDA every patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis.<ref>21 CFR 314.80: Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences</ref>\nThe FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its [[MedWatch]] program.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program]. Accessed October 9, 2007</ref> These reports are called \"spontaneous reports\" because reporting by consumers and health professionals is voluntary.\n\nWhile this remains the primary tool of [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarket safety surveillance]], FDA requirements for postmarketing risk management are increasing.\nAs a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional [[clinical trials]], called Phase IV trials.\nIn some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans (\"Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy\" or \"REMS\") for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=LS|last2=Loh|first2=M|last3=Perrone|first3=J|title=Assuring safety of inherently unsafe medications: the FDA risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.|journal=Journal of medical toxicology : official journal of the American College of Medical Toxicology|date=June 2014|volume=10|issue=2|pages=165\u201372|doi=10.1007/s13181-013-0374-z|pmid=24414251|pmc=4057549}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=WV|last2=Bramlet|first2=DA|last3=Ross|first3=JL|last4=Underberg|first4=JA|title=JCL roundtable: Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.|journal=Journal of clinical lipidology|date=October 14, 2016 |volume=10|issue=6|pages=1288\u20131296|doi=10.1016/j.jacl.2016.10.007|pmid=27919344}}</ref>  For example, [[thalidomide]] can cause birth defects but has uses that outweigh the risks if men and women taking the drugs do not conceive a child; a REMS program for thalidomide mandates an auditable process to ensure that people taking the drug take action to avoid pregnancy; many [[opioid]] drugs have REMS programs to avoid addiction and diversion of drugs.<ref name=Nelson/>  There is also a REMS program called [[iPLEDGE]] for the drug, [[isotretinoin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kovitwanichkanont|first1=T|last2=Driscoll|first2=T|title=A comparative review of the isotretinoin pregnancy risk management programs across four continents.|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|date=6 March 2018|doi=10.1111/ijd.13950|pmid=29508918}}</ref>\n\n====Generic drugs====\nGeneric drugs are chemical equivalents of [[name-brand]] drugs whose patents have expired.<ref name=\"TNBK\"/> In general, they are less expensive than their name brand counterparts, are manufactured and marketed by other companies and, in the 1990s, accounted for about a third of all prescriptions written in the United States.<ref name=\"TNBK\"/>\nFor approval of a generic drug, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug.<ref name=\"Therapeutic Equivalance of Generic Drugs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm073182.htm |title=Therapeutic Equivalence of Generic Drugs|accessdate=August 30, 2012|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |year=1998}}</ref>  This is called an \"ANDA\" ([[Abbreviated New Drug Application]]).

The oversight subcommitee of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee|United States House Energy and Commerce Committee]] resulted from a complaint brought against the FDA by [[Mylan Laboratories Inc.]] of Pittsburgh. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. Mylan eventually filed suit against two former FDA employees and four drug-manufacturing companies, charging that corruption within the federal agency resulted in [[racketeering]] and in violations of [[antitrust law]]. \"The order in which new generic drugs were approved was set by the FDA employees even before drug manufacturers submitted applications\" and, according to Mylan, this illegal procedure was followed to give preferential treatment to certain companies. During the summer of 1989, three FDA officials (Charles Y. Chang, David J. Brancato, Walter Kletch) pleaded guilty to criminal charges of accepting bribes from generic drugs makers, and two companies ([[Par Pharmaceutical]] and its subsidiary Quad Pharmaceuticals)<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/12/business/fda-details-problems-at-drug-makers.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=F.D.A.

Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of New York, which sought approval of a generic version of the drug [[Dyazide]], a medication for high blood pressure, submitted Dyazide, rather than its generic version, for the FDA tests. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. Dozens of drugs were eventually suspended or recalled by manufacturers. In the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] filed securities fraud charges against the Bolar Pharmaceutical Company, a major generic manufacturer based in Long Island, New York.<ref name=\"TNBK\"/>\n\n====Over-the-counter drugs====\nOver-the-counter (OTC) drugs like [[aspirin]] are drugs and combinations that do not require a doctor's prescription.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/UCM148055.pdf Regulation of Nonprescription Drug Products] FDA.

New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs.\n\nThe original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 [[Biologics Control Act]], with additional authority established by the 1944 [[Public Health Service Act]]. Along with these Acts, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the [[National Institutes of Health]]; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972.\n\n===Medical and radiation-emitting devices===\n[[File:FDA Bldg 62 - Exterior (5161375340).jpg|thumb|The Center for Devices and Radiological Health]]\nThe [[Center for Devices and Radiological Health]] (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all [[medical device]]s, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/ucm300639.htm CDRH Mission, Vision and Shared Values] Retrieved August 30, 2012.</ref> The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&C Act, and it includes products from the simple [[toothbrush]] to complex devices such as implantable [[neurostimulator]]s. CDRH also oversees the safety performance of non-medical devices that emit certain types of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Examples of CDRH-regulated devices include [[cellular phones]], [[Airport security|airport baggage screening equipment]], [[television|television receivers]], [[microwave oven]]s, [[tanning booth]]s, and [[laser|laser products]].\n\nCDRH regulatory powers include the authority to require certain technical reports from the manufacturers or importers of regulated products, to require that radiation-emitting products meet mandatory safety performance standards, to declare regulated products defective, and to order the recall of defective or noncompliant products. CDRH also conducts limited amounts of direct product testing.\n\n====\"FDA-Cleared\" vs \"FDA-Approved\"====\nClearance requests are for medical devices that prove they are \"substantially equivalent\" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate \"safety and efficacy\", for example it may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Both aspects need to be proved or provided by the submitter to ensure proper procedures are followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194460.htm|title=What does it mean when FDA \"clears\" or \"approves\" a medical device?|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cosmetics===\nCosmetics are regulated by the [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]], the same branch of the FDA that regulates food. Cosmetic products are not, in general, subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless they make \"structure or function claims\" that make them into drugs (see [[Cosmeceutical]]). However, all color additives must be specifically FDA approved before manufacturers can include them in cosmetic products sold in the U.S. The FDA regulates cosmetics labeling, and cosmetics that have not been safety tested must bear a warning to that effect.\n\nThough the cosmetic industry is predominantly responsible in ensuring the safety of its products, the FDA also has the power to intervene when necessary to protect the public but in general does not require pre-market approval or testing.  Companies are required to place a warning note on their products if they have not been tested.  Experts in cosmetic ingredient reviews also play a role in monitoring safety through influence on the use of ingredients, but also lack legal authority.  Overall the organization has reviewed about 1,200 ingredients and has suggested that several hundred be restricted, but there is no standard or systemic method for reviewing chemicals for safety and a clear definition of what is meant by 'safety' so that all chemicals are tested on the same basis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ross G |title=A perspective on the safety of cosmetic products: a position paper of the American Council on Science and Health |journal=Int.

The history of the FDA can be traced to the latter part of the 19th century and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Division of Chemistry]], later its '''Bureau of Chemistry.''' Under [[Harvey Washington Wiley]], appointed chief chemist in 1883, the Division began conducting research into the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs on the American market. Wiley's advocacy came at a time when the public had become aroused to hazards in the marketplace by [[muckraker|muckraking]] journalists like [[Upton Sinclair]], and became part of a general trend for increased federal regulations in matters pertinent to public safety during the [[Progressive Era]].<ref name = \"FDAHist\"/> The 1902 [[Biologics Control Act]] was put in place after a [[diphtheria]] antitoxin\u2014derived from tetanus-contaminated serum\u2014was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri.

The resulting proposed law was unable to get through the [[Congress of the United States]] for five years, but was rapidly enacted into law following the public outcry over the 1937 [[Elixir sulfanilamide|Elixir Sulfanilamide]] tragedy, in which over 100 people died after using a drug formulated with a toxic, untested solvent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|title=Medical Disasters and the Growth of FDA|date=February 2010|page=7|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/policy_reports/2010-02-10-fda.pdf|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] signed the new [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FD&C Act) into law on June 24, 1938. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. Soon after passage of the 1938 Act, the FDA began to designate certain drugs as safe for use only under the supervision of a medical professional, and the category of \"[[Prescription drug|prescription-only]]\" drugs was securely codified into law by the 1951 [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]].

Vioxx was approved by the FDA in 1999, and was initially hoped to be safer than previous NSAIDs, due to its reduced risk of intestinal tract bleeding. However, a number of pre- and post-marketing studies suggested that Vioxx might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, and this was conclusively demonstrated by results from the APPROVe trial in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib in a colorectal adenoma chemoprevention trial|last=Bresalier |first=RS |pmid=15713943 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa050493 |volume=352 |date=March 2005 |journal=N.

The example of Vioxx has been prominent in an ongoing debate over whether new drugs should be evaluated on the basis of their absolute safety, or their safety relative to existing treatments for a given condition.

This became a major concern of [[pediatrician]]s as evidence accumulated that the physiological response of children to many drugs differed significantly from those drugs' effects on adults. Children react different to the drugs because of many reason, including size, weight, etc. There were several reasons that not many medical trials were done with children. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective.<ref name = \"PedReg\"/>\n\nAlso, because children were thought to be ethically restricted in their ability to give [[informed consent]], there were increased governmental and institutional hurdles to approval of these clinical trials, as well as greater concerns about [[legal liability]]. Thus, for decades, most medicines prescribed to children in the U.S. were done so in a non-FDA-approved, \"off-label\" manner, with dosages \"extrapolated\" from adult data through body weight and body-surface-area calculations.<ref name = \"PedReg\"/>\n\nAn initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. However, this new rule was successfully preempted in federal court as exceeding the FDA's statutory authority.<ref name=\"PedReg\">{{Cite journal|author=Politis P |year=2005 |title=Transition From the Carrot to the Stick: The Evolution of Pharmaceutical Regulations Concerning Pediatric Drug Testing |journal=Widener Law Review |volume=12 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nWhile this debate was unfolding, Congress used the 1997 [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act]] to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The act reauthorizing these provisions, the 2002 [[Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act]], allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate.<ref name=\"PedReg\"/>\n\n===Priority review voucher (PRV)===\nThe [[priority review voucher]] is a provision of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (HR 3580) signed by President [[George W.

Equivalently, a subfield is a subset that contains 1, and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and taking the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of a nonzero element of ''L''.\n\nAs {{math|1=1 \u2013 1 = 0}}, the latter definition implies ''K'' and ''L'' have the same zero element.\n\nFor example, the field of [[rational number]]s is a subfield of the [[real number]]s, which is itself a subfield of the complex numbers. More generally, the field of rational numbers is (or is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to) a subfield of any field of [[characteristic of a ring|characteristic]] 0.\n\nThe [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of a subfield is the same as the characteristic of the larger field.\n\n==Extension field==\n\nIf ''K'' is a subfield of ''L'', then ''L'' is an '''extension field''' or simply '''extension''' of ''K'', and this pair of fields is a '''field extension'''. Such a field extension is denoted ''L'' / ''K'' (read as \"''L'' over ''K''\").\n\nIf ''L'' is an extension of ''F'' which is in turn an extension of ''K'', then ''F'' is said to be an '''intermediate field''' (or '''intermediate extension''' or '''subextension''') of ''L'' / ''K''.\n\nGiven a field extension {{nowrap|''L'' / ''K''}}, the larger field ''L'' is a ''K''-[[vector space]]. The [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of this vector space is called the [[degree of a field extension|'''degree''' of the extension]] and is denoted by [''L''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''K'']. \n\nThe degree of an extension is 1 if and only if the two fields are equal. In this case, the extension is a '''trivial extension'''. Extensions of degree 2 and 3 are called '''quadratic extensions''' and '''cubic extensions''', respectively. A '''finite extension''' is an extension that has a finite degree. The degree of a finite extension {{nowrap|''L'' / ''K''}} is denoted {{nowrap|[''L'' : ''K'']}}\n\nGiven two extensions {{nowrap|''L'' / ''K''}} and {{nowrap|''M'' / ''L''}}, the extension {{nowrap|''M'' / ''K''}} is finite if and only if both {{nowrap|''L'' / ''K''}} and {{nowrap|''M'' / ''L''}} are finite. In this case, one has\n:<math>[M : K]=[M : L]\\cdot[L : K].</math>\n\nGiven a field extension ''L'' / ''K'' and a subset ''S'' of ''L'', there is a smallest subfield of ''L'' that contains ''K'' and ''S''. It is the intersection of all subfields of ''L'' that contain K and S, and is denoted by ''K''(''S''). One says that ''K''(''S'') is the field ''generated'' by ''S'' over ''K'', and that ''S'' is a [[generating set]] of ''K''(''S'') over ''K''. When <math>S=\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}</math> is finite, one writes <math>K(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)</math> instead of <math>K(\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}),</math> and one says that ''K''(''S'') is finitely generated over ''K''. If ''S'' consists of a single element ''s'', the extension {{nowrap|''K''(''s'') / ''K''}} is called a [[simple extension]]<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=298}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Herstein|1964|p=193}}</ref> and ''s'' is called a [[primitive element (field theory)|primitive element]] of the extension.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=363}}</ref>\n\nAn extension field of the form {{nowrap|''K''(''S'')}} is often said to result from the ''{{vanchor|adjunction}}'' of ''S'' to ''K''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=319}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Herstein|1964|p=169}}</ref>\n\nIn [[characteristic of a ring|characteristic]] 0, every finite extension is a simple extension. This is the [[primitive element theorem]], which does not hold true for fields of non-zero characteristic.\n\nIf a simple extension {{nowrap|''K''(''s'') / ''K''}} is not finite, the field ''K''(''s'') is isomorphic to the field of [[rational fraction]]s in ''s'' over ''K''.\n\n== Caveats ==\nThe notation ''L'' / ''K'' is purely formal and does not imply the formation of a [[quotient ring]] or [[quotient group]] or any other kind of division. Instead the slash expresses the word \"over\". In some literature the notation ''L'':''K'' is used.\n\nIt is often desirable to talk about field extensions in situations where the small field is not actually contained in the larger one, but is naturally embedded. For this purpose, one abstractly defines a field extension as an [[injective function|injective]] [[ring homomorphism]] between two fields.\n''Every'' non-zero ring homomorphism between fields is injective because fields do not possess nontrivial proper ideals, so field extensions are precisely the [[morphism]]s in the [[category of fields]].\n\nHenceforth, we will suppress the injective homomorphism and assume that we are dealing with actual subfields.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe field of complex numbers <math>\\Complex</math> is an extension field of the field of [[real number]]s <math>\\R,</math> and <math>\\R</math> in turn is an extension field of the field of rational numbers <math>\\Q.</math> Clearly then, <math>\\Complex/\\Q</math> is also a field extension. We have <math>[\\Complex:\\R]=2</math> because <math>\\{1, i\\}</math> is a basis, so the extension <math>\\Complex/\\R</math> is finite. This is a simple extension because <math>\\Complex =\n \\R (i).</math> <math>[\\R:\\Q] =\\mathfrak c</math> (the [[cardinality of the continuum]]), so this extension is infinite.\n\nThe field \n\n:<math>\\Q(\\sqrt{2}) = \\{ a + b\\sqrt{2} \\mid a,b \\in \\Q \\},</math>\n\nis an extension field of <math>\\Q,</math> also clearly a simple extension. The degree is 2 because <math>\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}</math> can serve as a basis. \n\nThe field\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Q(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) &= \\Q (\\sqrt{2}) (\\sqrt{3}) = \\left\\{ a+b\\sqrt{3} \\mid a,b \\in \\Q(\\sqrt{2}) \\right\\} \\\\\n&= \\left\\{ a + b \\sqrt{2} + c\\sqrt{3} + d\\sqrt{6} \\mid a,b,c, d \\in \\Q\\right\\},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nis an extension field of both <math>\\Q(\\sqrt{2})</math> and <math>\\Q,</math> of degree 2 and 4 respectively. It is also a simple extension, as one can show that \n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\Q(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) &= \\Q (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})  \\\\\n&= \\left\\{ a + b (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) + c (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^2 + d(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^3 \\mid a,b,c, d \\in \\Q\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFinite extensions of <math>\\Q</math> are also called [[algebraic number field]]s and are important in [[number theory]].\nAnother extension field of the rationals, which is also important in number theory, although not a finite extension, is the field of [[p-adic number]]s <math>\\Q_p</math> for a prime number ''p''.\n\nIt is common to construct an extension field of a given field ''K'' as a [[quotient ring]] of the [[polynomial ring]] ''K''[''X''] in order to \"create\" a [[root of a function|root]] for a given polynomial ''f''(''X''). Suppose for instance that ''K'' does not contain any element ''x'' with ''x''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121. Then the polynomial <math>X^2+1</math> is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in ''K''[''X''], consequently the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by this polynomial is [[maximal ideal|maximal]], and <math>L = K[X]/(X^2+1)</math> is an extension field of ''K'' which ''does'' contain an element whose square is \u22121 (namely the residue class of ''X'').\n\nBy iterating the above construction, one can construct a [[splitting field]] of  any polynomial from ''K''[''X'']. This is an extension field ''L'' of ''K'' in which the given polynomial splits into a product of linear factors.\n\nIf ''p'' is any [[prime number]] and ''n'' is a positive integer, we have a [[finite field]] GF(''p''<sup>''n''</sup>) with ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> elements; this is an extension field of the finite field <math>\\text{GF}(p) = \\Z/p\\Z</math> with ''p'' elements.\n\nGiven a field ''K'', we can consider the field ''K''(''X'') of all [[rational function]]s in the variable ''X'' with coefficients in ''K''; the elements of ''K''(''X'') are fractions of two [[polynomial]]s over ''K'', and indeed ''K''(''X'') is the [[field of fractions]] of the polynomial ring ''K''[''X'']. This field of rational functions is an extension field of ''K''. This extension is infinite.\n\nGiven a [[Riemann surface]] ''M'', the set of all [[meromorphic function]]s defined on ''M'' is a field, denoted by <math>\\Complex(M).</math> It is a transcendental extension field of <math>\\Complex</math> if we identify every complex number with the corresponding [[constant function]] defined on ''M''. More generally, given an [[algebraic variety]] ''V'' over some field ''K'', then the [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of ''V'', consisting of the rational functions defined on ''V'' and denoted by ''K''(''V''), is an extension field of ''K''.\n\n== Algebraic extension ==\n{{main|Algebraic extension|Algebraic element}}\nAn element ''x'' of a field extension {{nowrap|''L'' / ''K''}} is algebraic over ''K'' if it is a [[root of a function|root]] of a nonzero [[polynomial]] with coefficients in ''K''. For example, <math>\\sqrt 2</math> is algebraic over the rational numbers, because it is a root of <math>x^2-2.</math> If an element ''x'' of ''L'' is algebraic over ''K'', the [[monic polynomial]] of lowest degree that has ''x'' as a root is called the [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of ''x''. This minimal polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over ''K''.\n\nAn element ''s'' of ''L'' is algebraic over ''K'' if and only if the simple extension {{nowrap|''K''(''s'') /''K''}} is a finite extension. In this case the degree of the extension equals the degree of the minimal polynomial, and a basis of the ''K''-[[vector space]] ''K''(''s'') consists of <math>1, s, s^2, \\ldots, s^{d-1},</math> where ''d'' is the degree of the minimal polynomial.\n\nThe set of the elements of ''L'' that are algebraic over ''K'' form a subextension, which is called the [[algebraic closure]] of ''K'' in ''L''. This results from the preceding characterization: if ''s'' and ''t'' are algebraic, the extensions {{nowrap|''K''(''s'') /''K''}} and {{nowrap|''K''(''s'')(''t'') /''K''(''s'')}} are finite. Thus {{nowrap|''K''(''s'', ''t'') /''K''}} is also finite, as well as the sub extensions {{nowrap|''K''(''s'' \u00b1 ''t'') /''K''}}, {{nowrap|''K''(''st'') /''K''}} and {{nowrap|''K''(1/''s'') /''K''}} (if {{nowrap|''s'' \u2260 0}}. It follows that {{nowrap|''s'' \u00b1 ''t''}}, ''st'' and 1/''s'' are all algebraic.\n\nAn ''algebraic extension'' {{nowrap|''L'' / ''K''}} is an extension such that every element of ''L'' is algebraic over ''K''. Equivalently, an algebraic extension is an extension that is generated by algebraic elements. For example, <math>\\Q(\\sqrt 2, \\sqrt 3)</math> is an algebraic extension of <math>\\Q</math>, because <math>\\sqrt 2</math> and <math>\\sqrt 3</math> are algebraic over <math>\\Q.</math>\n\nA simple extension is algebraic [[if and only if]] it is finite. This implies that an extension is algebraic if and only if it is the union of its finite subextensions, and that every finite extension is algebraic. \n\nEvery field ''K'' has an algebraic closure, which is [[up to]] an isomorphism the largest extension field of ''K'' which is algebraic over ''K'', and also the smallest extension field such that every polynomial with coefficients in ''K'' has a root in it. For example, <math>\\Complex</math> is an algebraic closure of <math>\\R,</math> but not an algebraic closure of <math>\\Q,</math> as it is not algebraic over <math>\\Q</math> (for example {{pi}} is not algebraic over <math>\\Q</math>).\n\n==Transcendental extension==\n\nGiven a field extension {{nowrap|''L'' / ''K''}}, a subset ''S'' of ''L'' is called [[algebraically independent]] over ''K'' if no non-trivial polynomial relation with coefficients in ''K'' exists among the elements of ''S''. The largest cardinality of an algebraically independent set is called the [[transcendence degree]] of ''L''/''K''. It is always possible to find a set ''S'', algebraically independent over ''K'', such that ''L''/''K''(''S'') is algebraic. Such a set ''S'' is called a [[transcendence basis]] of ''L''/''K''. All transcendence bases have the same cardinality, equal to the transcendence degree of the extension. An extension ''L''/''K'' is said to be '''{{visible anchor|purely transcendental}}''' if and only if there exists a transcendence basis ''S'' of ''L''/''K'' such that ''L'' = ''K''(''S''). Such an extension has the property that all elements of ''L'' except those of ''K'' are transcendental over ''K'', but, however, there are extensions with this property which are not purely transcendental\u2014a class of such extensions take the form ''L''/''K'' where both ''L'' and ''K'' are algebraically closed. In addition, if ''L''/''K'' is purely transcendental and ''S'' is a transcendence basis of the extension, it doesn't necessarily follow that ''L'' = ''K''(''S''). For example, consider the extension <math>\\Q(x, \\sqrt{x})/\\Q,</math> where ''x'' is transcendental over <math>\\Q.</math> The set <math>\\{x\\}</math> is algebraically independent since ''x'' is transcendental. Obviously, the extension <math>\\Q(x, \\sqrt{x})/\\Q(x)</math> is algebraic, hence <math>\\{x\\}</math> is a transcendence basis. It doesn't generate the whole extension because there is no polynomial expression in <math>x</math> for <math>\\sqrt{x}</math>. But it is easy to see that <math>\\{\\sqrt{x}\\}</math> is a transcendence basis that generates <math>\\Q(x, \\sqrt{x}),</math> so this extension is indeed purely transcendental.)\n\n== Normal, separable and Galois extensions ==\nAn algebraic extension ''L''/''K'' is called [[normal extension|normal]] if every [[irreducible polynomial]] in ''K''[''X''] that has a root in ''L'' completely factors into linear factors over ''L''. Every algebraic extension ''F''/''K'' admits a normal closure ''L'', which is an extension field of ''F'' such that ''L''/''K'' is normal and which is minimal with this property.\n\nAn algebraic extension ''L''/''K'' is called [[separable extension|separable]] if the minimal polynomial of every element of ''L'' over ''K'' is [[separable polynomial|separable]], i.e., has no repeated roots in an algebraic closure over ''K''. A [[Galois extension]] is a field extension that is both normal and separable.\n\nA consequence of the [[primitive element theorem]] states that every finite separable extension has a primitive element (i.e. is simple).\n\nGiven any field extension ''L''/''K'', we can consider its '''automorphism group''' Aut(''L''/''K''), consisting of all field [[automorphism]]s ''\u03b1'': ''L'' \u2192 ''L'' with ''\u03b1''(''x'') = ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''K''. When the extension is Galois this automorphism group is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension. Extensions whose Galois group is [[abelian group|abelian]] are called [[abelian extension]]s.\n\nFor a given field extension ''L''/''K'', one is often interested in the intermediate fields ''F'' (subfields of ''L'' that contain ''K''). The significance of Galois extensions and Galois groups is that they allow a complete description of the intermediate fields: there is a [[bijection]] between the intermediate fields and the [[subgroup]]s of the Galois group, described by the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]].\n\n== Generalizations ==\nField extensions can be generalized to [[ring extensions]] which consist of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and one of its [[subring]]s. A closer non-commutative analog are [[central simple algebra]]s (CSAs) \u2013 ring extensions over a field, which are [[simple algebra]] (no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, just as for a field) and where the center of the ring is exactly the field. For example, the only finite field extension of the real numbers is the complex numbers, while the quaternions are a central simple algebra over the reals, and all CSAs over the reals are [[Brauer equivalent]] to the reals or the quaternions. CSAs can be further generalized to [[Azumaya algebra]]s, where the base field is replaced by a commutative [[local ring]].\n\n== Extension of scalars ==\n{{main|Extension of scalars}}\nGiven a field extension, one can \"[[Extension of scalars|extend scalars]]\" on associated algebraic objects. For example, given a real vector space, one can produce a complex vector space via [[complexification]]. In addition to vector spaces, one can perform extension of scalars for [[associative algebra]]s defined over the field, such as polynomials or [[group algebra]]s and the associated [[group representation]]s. Extension of scalars of polynomials is often used implicitly, by just considering the coefficients as being elements of a larger field, but may also be considered more formally. Extension of scalars has numerous applications, as discussed in [[extension of scalars#Applications|extension of scalars: applications]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Field theory (mathematics)|Field theory]]\n* [[Glossary of field theory]]\n* [[Tower of fields]]\n* [[Primary extension]]\n* [[Regular extension]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{ citation | first1 = John B. | last1 = Fraleigh | year = 1976 | isbn = 0-201-01984-1 | title = A First Course In Abstract Algebra | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]] | location = Reading }}\n* {{ citation | first1 = I.

It is used in the \"bucket\" fill tool of [[paint program]]s to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as [[Go (game)|Go]] and [[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]] for determining which pieces are cleared.\n\n\n==The algorithm==\n[[Image:Recursive Flood Fill 8 (aka).gif|right|thumb|Recursive flood fill with 8 directions]]\nThe flood-fill algorithm takes three parameters: a start node, a target color, and a replacement color. The algorithm looks for all nodes in the array that are connected to the start node by a path of the target color and changes them to the replacement color. There are many ways in which the flood-fill algorithm can be structured, but they all make use of a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] or [[stack (data structure)|stack]] data structure, explicitly or implicitly.\n\nDepending on whether we consider nodes touching at the corners connected or not, we have two variations: eight-way and four-way respectively.\n\n=== Stack-based recursive implementation (four-way) ===\n\nOne implicitly stack-based ([[recursion|recursive]]) flood-fill implementation (for a two-dimensional array) goes as follows:\n\n '''Flood-fill''' (node, target-color, replacement-color):\n  1. If ''target-color'' is equal to ''replacement-color'', return.\n  2. If the color of ''node'' is not equal to ''target-color'', return.\n  3. Set the color of ''node'' to ''replacement-color''.\n  4.

Return.\n\nThough easy to understand, the implementation of the algorithm used above is impractical in languages and environments where stack space is severely constrained (e.g. [[Java applet]]s).\n\n===Alternative implementations===\n\nAn explicitly queue-based implementation (sometimes called \"Forest Fire algorithm\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpdPDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA158 |title=Applied Computer Science |last=Torbert |first=Shane |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-30864-7 |edition=2nd |publication-date=2016-06-01 |pages=158 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30866-1 |lccn=2016936660 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221185356/https://books.google.com/books?id=HpdPDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA158 |archivedate=2016-12-21 |df= }}</ref>) is shown in pseudo-code below.

Continue looping until ''Q'' is exhausted.\n  14. Return.\n\nMost practical implementations use a loop for the west and east directions as an optimization to avoid the overhead of stack or queue management:\n\n '''Flood-fill''' (node, target-color, replacement-color):\n  1.

Using this additional array as an [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] allows the edges of the filled region to blend somewhat smoothly with the not-filled region.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Fixed-memory method (right-hand fill method)==\nA method exists that uses essentially no memory for [[Pixel connectivity|four-connected]] regions by pretending to be a painter trying to paint the region without painting themselves into a corner. This is also a method for solving mazes. The four pixels making the primary boundary are examined to see what action should be taken. The painter could find themselves in one of several conditions:\n\n# All four boundary pixels are filled.\n# Three of the boundary pixels are filled.\n# Two of the boundary pixels are filled.\n# One boundary pixel is filled.\n# Zero boundary pixels are filled.\n\nWhere a path or boundary is to be followed, the right-hand rule is used. The painter follows the region by placing their right-hand on the wall (the boundary of the region) and progressing around the edge of the region without removing their hand.\n\nFor case #1, the painter paints (fills) the pixel the painter is standing upon and stops the algorithm.\n\nFor case #2, a path leading out of the area exists. Paint the pixel the painter is standing upon and move in the direction of the open path.\n\nFor case #3, the two boundary pixels define a path which, if we painted the current pixel, may block us from ever getting back to the other side of the path. We need a \"mark\" to define where we are and which direction we are heading to see if we ever get back to exactly the same pixel. If we already created such a \"mark\", then we preserve our previous mark and move to the next pixel following the right-hand rule.\n\nA mark is used for the first 2-pixel boundary that is encountered to remember where the passage started and in what direction the painter was moving. If the mark is encountered again and the painter is traveling in the same direction, then the painter knows that it is safe to paint the square with the mark and to continue in the same direction. This is because (through some unknown path) the pixels on the other side of the mark can be reached and painted in the future. The mark is removed for future use.\n\nIf the painter encounters the mark but is going in a different direction, then some sort of loop has occurred, which caused the painter to return to the mark. This loop must be eliminated. The mark is picked up, and the painter then proceeds in the direction indicated previously by the mark using a left-hand rule for the boundary (similar to the right-hand rule but using the painter's left hand). This continues until an intersection is found (with three or more open boundary pixels). Still using the left-hand rule the painter now searches for a simple passage (made by two boundary pixels). Upon finding this two-pixel boundary path, that pixel is painted. This breaks the loop and allows the algorithm to continue.\n\nFor case #4, we need to check the opposite 8-connected corners to see whether they are filled or not. If either or both are filled, then this creates a many-path intersection and cannot be filled. If both are empty, then the current pixel can be painted and the painter can move following the right-hand rule.\n\nThe algorithm trades time for memory. For simple shapes it is very efficient. However, if the shape is complex with many features, the algorithm spends a large amount of time tracing the edges of the region trying to ensure that all can be painted.\n\nThis algorithm was first available commercially in 1981 on a Vicom Image Processing system manufactured by Vicom Systems, Inc. The classic recursive flood fill algorithm was available on this system as well.\n\n=== Pseudocode ===\nThis is a pseudocode implementation of an optimal fixed-memory flood-fill algorithm written in structured English:\n\n'''The variables:'''\n     cur, mark, and mark2 each hold either pixel coordinates or a null value\n          NOTE: when mark is set to null, do not erase its previous coordinate value.\n                Keep those coordinates available to be recalled if necessary.\n     cur-dir, mark-dir, and mark2-dir each hold a direction (left, right, up, or down)\n     backtrack and findloop each hold boolean values\n     count is an integer\n\n'''The algorithm:'''\n\n(NOTE: All directions (front, back, left, right) are relative to cur-dir)\n\n set cur to starting pixel\n set cur-dir to default direction\n clear mark and mark2 (set values to null)\n set backtrack and findloop to false\n \n while front-pixel is empty\n  move forward\n end while\n \n jump to START\n \n MAIN LOOP:\n  move forward\n  if right-pixel is empty\n   if backtrack is true and findloop is false and either front-pixel or left-pixel is empty\n    set findloop to true\n   end if\n   turn right\n PAINT:\n   move forward\n  end if\n START:\n  set count to number of non-diagonally adjacent pixels filled (front/back/left/right ONLY)\n  if count is not 4\n   do\n    turn right\n   while front-pixel is empty\n   do\n    turn left\n   while front-pixel is filled\n  end if\n  switch count\n   case 1\n    if backtrack is true\n     set findloop to true\n    else if findloop is true\n     if mark is null\n      restore mark\n     end if\n    else if front-left-pixel and back-left-pixel are both empty\n     clear mark\n     fill cur\n     jump to PAINT\n    end if\n   end case\n   case 2\n    if back-pixel is filled\n     if front-left-pixel is not filled\n      clear mark\n      fill cur\n      jump to PAINT\n     end if\n    else if mark is not set\n     set mark to cur\n     set mark-dir to cur-dir\n     clear mark2\n     set findloop and backtrack to false\n    else\n     if mark2 is not set\n      if cur is at mark\n       if cur-dir is the same as mark-dir\n        clear mark\n        turn around\n        fill cur\n        jump to PAINT\n       else\n        set backtrack to true\n        set findloop to false\n        set cur-dir to mark-dir\n       end if\n      else if findloop is true\n       set mark2 to cur\n       set mark2-dir to cur-dir\n      end if\n     else\n      if cur is at mark\n       set cur to mark2\n       set cur-dir to mark2-dir\n       clear mark and mark2\n       set backtrack to false\n       turn around\n       fill cur\n       jump to PAINT\n      else if cur at mark2\n       set mark to cur\n       set cur-dir and mark-dir to mark2-dir\n       clear mark2\n      end\n     end if\n    end if\n   end case\n   case 3\n    clear mark  \n    fill cur\n    jump to PAINT\n   end case\n   case 4\n    fill cur\n    done\n   end case\n  end switch\n end MAIN LOOP\n\n==Scanline fill== <!-- [[Scanline fill]] redirects here -->\n\n[[Image:Smiley fill.gif|right|thumb|212px|Scanline fill (click to view animation)]]\n\nThe algorithm can be sped up by filling lines. Instead of pushing each potential future pixel coordinate on the stack, it inspects the neighbour lines (previous and next) to find adjacent segments that may be filled in a future pass; the coordinates (either the start or the end) of the line segment are pushed on the stack. In most cases this scanline algorithm is at least an order of magnitude faster than the per-pixel one.\n\n'''Efficiency''': each pixel is checked once.\n\n==Vector implementations==\nVersion 0.46 of [[Inkscape]] includes a bucket fill tool, giving output similar to ordinary bitmap operations and indeed using one: the canvas is rendered, a flood fill operation is performed on the selected area and the result is then traced back to a path. It uses the concept of a [[boundary value problem|boundary condition]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Large-scale behaviour==\n\n{{double image|right|Wfm floodfill animation queue.gif|200|Wfm floodfill animation stack.gif|200|Four-way flood fill using a queue for storage|Four-way flood fill using a stack for storage}}\n\nThe primary technique used to control a flood fill will either be data-centric or process-centric. A data-centric approach can use either a stack or a queue to keep track of seed pixels that need to be checked. A process-centric algorithm must necessarily use a stack.\n\nA 4-way flood-fill algorithm that uses the adjacency technique and a queue as its seed pixel store yields an expanding lozenge-shaped fill.\n\n'''Efficiency''': 4 pixels checked for each pixel filled (8 for an 8-way fill).\n\nA 4-way flood-fill algorithm that use the adjacency technique and a stack as its seed pixel store yields a linear fill with \"gaps filled later\" behaviour. This approach can be particularly seen in older 8-bit computer games, such as those created with ''[[Graphic Adventure Creator]]''.\n\n'''Efficiency''': 4 pixels checked for each pixel filled (8 for an 8-way fill).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Breadth-first search]]\n* [[Depth-first search]]\n* [[Graph traversal]]\n* [[Connected-component labeling]]\n* [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://gpolo.awardspace.info/fill/main.html Didactical Javascript implementation of scanline polygon fill], by Guilherme Polo.\n* [http://lodev.org/cgtutor/floodfill.html Sample implementations for recursive and non-recursive, classic and scanline flood fill], by Lode Vandevenne.\n* [http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2008/06/06/flash-flood-fill-implementation/ Flash flood fill implementation], by Emanuele Feronato.\n* [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/GDI/QuickFill.aspx QuickFill: An efficient flood fill algorithm.], by John R.

He later became associated with patronage of animals and the [[natural environment]], and it became customary for Catholic and Anglican churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his [[feast day]] of 4 October.

At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets.

It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for [[Apulia]] to enlist in the army of [[Walter III, Count of Brienne]]. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life.<ref name=\"ODCC Francis\"/> According to [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions. In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, \"Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen\", meaning his \"Lady Poverty\".<ref name=\"cefa\"/> \n[[File:Sassetta 001.jpg|thumb|''Saint Francis Abandons His Father''.

He said he had a mystical [[visions of Jesus and Mary|vision of Jesus Christ]] in the forsaken country chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]], just outside Assisi, in which the [[San Damiano cross|Icon of Christ Crucified]] said to him, \"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.\" He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose.<ref name=\"chest54\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;54\u201356</ref> When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nIn order to avoid his father's wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month. When he returned to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the [[Bishop of Assisi]], Francis renounced his father and his [[Property|patrimony]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n \nFor the next couple of months Francis wandered as a beggar in the hills behind Assisi. He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a [[penitent]], during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometer from Rivotorto, today on private property and once again in ruin); and the [[Porziuncola]], the little chapel of [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]] in the plain just below the town.<ref name=\"cefa\"/> This later became his favorite [[Dwelling|abode]].<ref name=\"chest54\"/> By degrees he took to nursing [[leper]]s, in the [[lazar house]]s near [[Assisi]].\n\n===Founding of the Franciscan Orders===\n====The Friars Minor====\nOne morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the \"Commissioning of the Twelve\" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around him with a knotted rope and went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n \nHis example drew others to him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a [[simple living|simple life]] in the deserted [[lazar house]] of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of [[Umbria]], making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n[[File:Legend of St. Francis by Giotto.jpg|thumb|left|The Pope approving the statutes of the Order of the Franciscans, by [[Giotto]], 1295\u20131300]]\nIn 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (\"friars\"), the ''Regula primitiva'' or \"Primitive Rule\", which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was \"To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps\". He then led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from [[Pope Innocent III]] to found a new religious Order.<ref name=\"chest107\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;107\u2013108</ref> Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent&nbsp;III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance. The group was [[tonsure]]d.<ref name=\"Francis of Assisi and His World\">Galli(2002), pp.&nbsp;74\u201380</ref> This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier. Though a number of the Pope's counselors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order. This occurred, according to tradition, on April 16, 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]].<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> The group, then the \"Lesser Brothers\" (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order'' or the ''Seraphic Order''), were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, although he was later ordained a deacon.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n====The Poor Clares and the Third Order====\n[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil17.jpg|thumb|St. Clare is received by St. Francis, Josep Benlliure]]\nFrom then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations.  Hearing Francis preaching in the church of [[Assisi Cathedral|San Rufino]] in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman [[Clare of Assisi]] became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling. Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order, which he joined. On the night of [[Palm Sunday]], March 28, 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies.<ref name=\"chest110\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;110\u2013111</ref> This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a [[religious habit]], or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her in a nearby monastery of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns until he could provide a suitable retreat for her, and for her younger sister, [[Agnes of Assisi|Caterina]], and the other young women who had joined her. Later he transferred them to San Damiano,<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> to a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as [[Poor Clares]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nFor those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance]], a fraternity composed of either [[laity]] or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took [[religious vows]]. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy. The Third Order is now titled the [[Secular Franciscan Order]].\n\n===Travels===\nDetermined to bring the Gospel to all peoples of the World, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On May 8, 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of [[La Verna]] (Alverna) as a gift from [[Count]] Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as \u201ceminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind\u201d.<ref>Fioretti quoted in: St. Francis, ''The Little Flowers, Legends, and Lauds'', trans. N. Wydenbruck, ed.

Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them [[Tommaso da Celano]], who would later write the biography of St. Francis), and some well-educated men joined his Order. In 1215, Francis may have gone to Rome for the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], but that is not certain. During this time, he probably met a [[canon (priest)|canon]], [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzman]]<ref name=\"chest126\">Chesterton (1924), p.126</ref> (later to be Saint Dominic, the founder of the Friars Preachers, another [[Catholic religious order]]). In 1217, he offered to go to France. Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy.\n\nIn 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the [[Fifth Crusade]] where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of [[Damietta]] {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile. The Sultan, [[al-Kamil]], a nephew of [[Saladin]], had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on August 29, 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks.<ref>Runciman, Steven.

The scene in the fresco adopts a position midway between the two extremes. Since the idea was put forward by the German art historian, Friedrich Rintelen in 1912,<ref>Friedrich Rintelen, ''Giotto und die Giotto-apokryphen'', (1912)</ref> many scholars have expressed doubt that Giotto was the author of the Upper Church frescoes.\n\nAccording to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis.<ref>For grants of various permissions and privileges to Francis as attributed by later sources, see, e.g., Tolan, pp. 258\u2013263.

See Tolan, pp. 168</ref> The Franciscan Order has been present in the [[Holy Land]] almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions from the [[Mameluke]] Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]], and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from [[Pope Clement VI]] in 1342.<ref>Bulla ''Gratias agimus'', commemorated by Pope John Paul II in a [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1992/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19921130_p-schalluuck_it.html Letter] dated November 30, 1992.

On the Franciscan presence, including an historical overview, see, generally the official website at [http://www.custodia.org/default.asp?id=425 ''Custodia''] and [[Custodian of the Holy Land]]</ref>\n\n===Reorganization of the Franciscan Order and death===\nBy this time, the growing Order of friars was divided into [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in [[Morocco]], Francis returned to Italy via [[Venice]].<ref name=\"b162\">Bonaventure (1867), p.&nbsp;162</ref> Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the \"First Rule\" or \"Rule Without a [[Papal Bull]]\" (''Regula prima'', ''Regula non bullata''), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nOn September 29, 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on March 10, 1221, and was buried there. When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans. Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life.\n\nThe reports of miracles ceased. Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as [[Vicar]] of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the \"First Rule\", creating the \"Second Rule\" or \"Rule With a Bull\", which was approved by Pope Honorius III on November 29, 1223. As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars \"to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity\". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order. Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as [[Catania]] in Sicily and afterwards as far north as [[Bologna]].\n[[File:Cigoli, san francesco.jpg|thumb|Francis considered his [[stigmata]] part of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]''.<ref name=Goff>Le Goff, Jacques.

Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. \"Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ.\"<ref name=\"chest131\">Chesterton (1924), p.131</ref> Suffering from these stigmata and from [[trachoma]], Francis received care in several cities ([[Siena]], [[Cortona]], [[Nocera Umbra|Nocera]]) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where it all began, feeling the end approaching, he spent the last days of his life dictating his spiritual Testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, October 3, 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), ''\"Voce mea ad Dominum\"''.\n<!-- [[File:Traslaci\u00f3n de San Francisco de As\u00eds, de Benet Mercad\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The Passing of Saint Francis of Assisi (1866), by [[Benet Mercad\u00e9]]]] -->\nOn July 16, 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope [[Gregory IX]] (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in Assisi. Francis was buried on May 25, 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]], and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.\n\n==Character and legacy==\nIt has been argued that no one else in history was as dedicated as Francis to imitate the life, and carry out the work of Christ, in Christ\u2019s own way\u2014. This is important in understanding Francis' character and his affinity for the Eucharist and respect for the priests who carried out the sacrament.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nHe and his followers celebrated and even venerated poverty. Poverty was so central to his character that in his last written work, the Testament, he said that absolute personal and corporate poverty was the essential lifestyle for the members of his Order.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nHe believed that nature itself was the mirror of God.

He believed that all creatures should praise God (a common theme in the Psalms) and the people have a duty to protect and enjoy nature as both the stewards of God's creation and as creatures ourselves.<ref name=\"b78\"/> Many of the stories that surround the life of Saint Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment.<ref name=\"b78\">Bonaventure (1867), pp.&nbsp;78\u201385</ref>\n\n[[File:St Francis Statue 2.JPG|thumb|left|A garden statue of Francis of Assisi with birds]]\nAn incident illustrating the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the \"Fioretti\" (\"Little Flowers\"), a collection of [[legend]]s and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. One day, while Francis was traveling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to \"wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.\"<ref name=\"b78\"/> The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.\n\nAnother legend from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' tells that in the city of [[Gubbio]], where Francis lived for some time, was a [[Wolf of Gubbio|wolf \"terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals\".]] Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at Francis' feet.\n\n\"Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil\", said Francis. \"All these people accuse you and curse you ... But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people.\" Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had \u201cdone evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner [[Gubbio]] was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.\n\nThree quarters of a millennium after his death, St Francis remains an important figure and symbol in and out of Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. On November 29, 1979, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Saint Francis the Patron Saint of Ecology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |title=Inter Sanctos (Apostolic Letter AAS 71) |author=[[Pope John Paul II]] |date=November 29, 1979 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809222858/http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>  During the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that Saint Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder \"not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us.\" The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, January 1, 1990, the saint of Assisi \"offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ...\" He went on to make the point that: \"As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation \u2013 animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon \u2013 to give honor and praise to the Lord.

However, the Air Force's leadership understood that its budget would not allow it to purchase enough F-15 aircraft to satisfy all of its missions.<ref>Bjorkman, Eileen, Small fast and in your face, Air & Space, Feb/March 2014, pp. 28\u201335</ref> The Advanced Day Fighter concept, renamed ''F-XX'', gained civilian political support under the reform-minded Deputy Secretary of Defense [[David Packard]], who favored the idea of competitive [[prototype|prototyping]]. As a result, in May 1971, the Air Force Prototype Study Group was established, with Boyd a key member, and two of its six proposals would be funded, one being the [[Lightweight Fighter program|Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF). The [[Request for Proposal]]s issued on 6 January 1972 called for a {{convert|20000|lb|kg|sigfig =2|adj =mid}} class air-to-air day fighter with a good turn rate, acceleration, and range, and optimized for combat at speeds of Mach 0.6\u20131.6 and altitudes of {{convert|30000|\u2013|40000|ft|sigfig=2}}. This was the region where USAF studies predicted most future air combat would occur. The anticipated average flyaway cost of a production version was $3&nbsp;million.  This production plan, though, was only notional, as the USAF had no firm plans to procure the winner.<ref>Peacock 1997, pp. 9\u201310.</ref><ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 7\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Finalists selected and flyoff====\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|A right-side view of a YF-16 (foreground) and a [[Northrop YF-17]], each armed with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles|alt=Two jet aircraft flying together over mountain range and cloud]]\n\nFive companies responded, and in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics' Model 401 and Northrop's P-600 for the follow-on prototype development and testing phase. GD and Northrop were awarded contracts worth $37.9&nbsp;million and $39.8&nbsp;million to produce the YF-16 and [[Northrop YF-17|YF-17]], respectively, with first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974. To overcome resistance in the Air Force hierarchy, the ''Fighter Mafia'' and other LWF proponents successfully advocated the idea of complementary fighters in a high-cost/low-cost force mix. The \"high/low mix\" would allow the USAF to be able to afford sufficient fighters for its overall fighter force structure requirements. The mix gained broad acceptance by the time of the prototypes' flyoff, defining the relationship of the LWF and the F-15.<ref>Peacock 1997, pp. 10\u201311.</ref><ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe YF-16 was developed by a team of General Dynamics engineers led by [[Robert H.

Its 90-minute [[maiden flight]] was made at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at [[Edwards AFB]], California, on 2 February 1974. Its actual first flight occurred accidentally during a high-speed taxi test on 20 January 1974. While gathering speed, a roll-control oscillation caused a fin of the port-side wingtip-mounted missile and then the starboard [[stabilator]] to scrape the ground, and the aircraft then began to veer off the runway. The test pilot, Phil Oestricher, decided to lift off to avoid a potential crash, safely landing six minutes later. The slight damage was quickly repaired and the official first flight occurred on time. The YF-16's first supersonic flight was accomplished on 5 February 1974, and the second YF-16 prototype first flew on 9 May 1974. This was followed by the first flights of Northrop's YF-17 prototypes on 9 June and 21 August 1974, respectively. During the flyoff, the YF-16s completed 330 [[sorties]] for a total of 417 flight hours;<ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> the YF-17s flew 288 sorties, covering 345 hours.<ref>Jenkins 2000, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===Air Combat Fighter competition===\nIncreased interest turned the LWF into a serious acquisition program.

The USAF also needed to replace its [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter-bombers. The U.S. Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy, and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program that would be a navalized fighter-bomber variant of the LWF. The four NATO allies had formed the \"Multinational Fighter Program Group\" (MFPG) and pressed for a U.S. decision by December 1974; thus, the USAF accelerated testing.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 14\u201315, 19\u201320.</ref><ref name=Richardson_p14/><ref name=Peacock_p12-3/>\n\n[[File:YF-16 VASC.JPG|thumb|YF-16 on display at the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]]]]\nTo reflect this serious intent to procure a new fighter-bomber, the LWF program was rolled into a new Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition in an announcement by [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[James R. Schlesinger]] in April 1974. The ACF would not be a pure fighter, but [[Multirole combat aircraft|multi-role]], and Schlesinger made it clear that any ACF order would be in addition to the F-15, which extinguished opposition to the LWF.<ref name=Richardson_p14>Richardson 1990, p. 14.</ref><ref name=Peacock_p12-3>Peacock 1997, pp. 12\u201313.</ref><ref name=\"f-16.net\">{{cite web |title=YF-16 The Birth of a Fighter|url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article25.html|website=www.f-16.net|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref>  ACF also raised the stakes for GD and Northrop because it brought in competitors intent on securing what was touted at the time as \"the arms deal of the century\".<ref>D\u00f6rfer, Ingemar.

Northrop offered the P-530 Cobra, which was similar to the YF-17. The Jaguar and Cobra were dropped by the MFPG early on, leaving two European and the two U.S. candidates. On 11 September 1974, the U.S. Air Force confirmed plans to order the winning ACF design to equip five tactical fighter wings.  Though computer modeling predicted a close contest, the YF-16 proved significantly quicker going from one maneuver to the next, and was the unanimous choice of those pilots that flew both aircraft.<ref>Coram 2002, p. 305.</ref>\n\nOn 13 January 1975, [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[John L.

Another advantage of the YF-16 \u2013 unlike the YF-17 \u2013 was its use of the [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] turbofan engine, the same [[aircraft engine|powerplant]] used by the F-15; such commonality would lower the cost of engines for both programs.<ref>Richardson 1990, p. 13.</ref> Secretary McLucas announced that the USAF planned to order at least 650, possibly up to 1,400 production F-16s.

The stall issue had been raised during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the [[Langley Research Center]] revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated there was a real concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.<ref>Chambers, Joseph R.

Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision.<ref name=\"JAWA\"/><ref>Peacock 1997, p. 99.</ref> The F-16's [[Ejection seat#Egress systems|ACES II]] [[Zero-zero ejection seat|zero/zero ejection seat]] is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30\u00b0; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13\u201315\u00b0. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage.<ref>Albano, J.

To enhance the pilot's degree of control of the aircraft during high-''g'' combat maneuvers, various switches and function controls were moved to centralized \"[[HOTAS|hands on throttle-and-stick]] (HOTAS)\" controls upon both the controllers and the throttle. Hand pressure on the side-stick controller is transmitted by electrical signals via the FBW system to adjust various flight control surfaces to maneuver the F-16. Originally the side-stick controller was non-moving, but this proved uncomfortable and difficult for pilots to adjust to, sometimes resulting in a tendency to \"over-rotate\" during takeoffs, so the control stick was given a small amount of \"play\". Since introduction on the F-16, HOTAS controls have become a standard feature on modern fighters.<ref name=\"GS F-16 design\">Pike, John.

Its slotted [[planar array]] antenna was designed to be compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low [[Pulse repetition frequency|pulse-repetition frequency]] (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-[[Clutter (radar)|clutter]] environment, and in [[look-down/shoot-down]] employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the [[X band]], and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful [[signal processing]], higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming]] environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avitop.com/interact/radar.htm|title=The AN/APG-66 Radar.|author=John Raahauge|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[AN/APG-68]], an evolution of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground [[moving target indication]], sea target, and [[track while scan]] (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin [[LANTIRN|Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night]] (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide [[continuous-wave radar]] (CW) target illumination for [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active radar-homing]] (SARH) missiles like the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing [[VHSIC|Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit]] (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and [[terrain-following radar]] (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.<ref name=\"JAWA\"/>\n\nThe F-16E/F is outfitted with Northrop Grumman's [[AN/APG-80]] [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) radar.<ref>Kopp, Carlo.

However, the F-16N has a strengthened wing and is capable of carrying an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod on the starboard wingtip.

Their EW fit consists of an ALR-69 radar warning receiver (RWR) and an ALE-40 chaff/flare dispenser. The F-16Ns and (T)F-16Ns have the standard Air Force tailhook and undercarriage and are not aircraft carrier capable.  Production totaled 26 airframes, of which 22 are single-seat F-16Ns and 4 are twin-seat TF-16Ns. The initial batch of aircraft were in service between 1988 and 1998. At that time, hairline cracks were discovered in several bulkheads and the Navy did not have the resources to replace them, so the aircraft were eventually retired, with one aircraft sent to the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[NAS Pensacola]], Florida, and the remainder placed in storage at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]].  These aircraft were later replaced by embargoed ex-Pakistani F-16s in 2003.  The original inventory of F-16Ns were previously operated by adversary squadrons at [[NAS Oceana]], Virginia; [[NAS Key West]], Florida and the former [[NAS Miramar]], California.  The current F-16A/B aircraft are operated by the [[Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center]] at [[NAS Fallon]], Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article22.html|title=F-16 Versions \u2013 (T)F-16N |publisher= |accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrsw/installations/nas_fallon/about/nsawc.html|title=Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222307/http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrsw/installations/nas_fallon/about/nsawc.html|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=1100&tid=1150&ct=1|title=The US Navy \u2013 Fact File: F-16A/B Fighting Falcon Fighter|author=Dan Petty|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:QF-16.JPG|thumb|right|A USAF QF-16A, on its first unmanned test flight, over the Gulf of Mexico]]\n; F-16V: At the 2012 Singapore Air Show Lockheed Martin unveiled plans for the new F-16V variant with the V suffix for its Viper nickname.

However, in 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the contractor had immunity to lawsuits, overturning the previous judgment. The court did remand the plaintiff's claim of electrical malfunction as the cause, noting that General Dynamics and the USAF knew about chafing of instrumentation wiring, which they had not initially disclosed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/878/1311/166713/ |title=United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit. \u2013 878 F.2d 1311.|work=Justia Law |accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> The accident and subsequent trial was the subject of the 1992 film ''[[Afterburn (film)|Afterburn]]''.<ref>Schindehette, Susan.

It met from May to July 381 in the [[Hagia Irene|Church of Hagia Irene]] and was affirmed as ecumenical in 451 at the [[Council of Chalcedon]].\n\n==Background==\nWhen Theodosius ascended to the imperial throne in 380, he began on a campaign to bring the Eastern Church back to Nicene Christianity. Theodosius wanted to further unify the entire empire behind the orthodox position and decided to convene a church council to resolve matters of faith and discipline.<ref name = \"Ruether\">{{citation |authorlink=Rosemary Radford Ruether |last=Ruether |first=Rosemary Radford |title=Gregory of Nazianzus: Rhetor and Philosopher | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1969}}</ref>{{rp |45}} [[Gregory Nazianzus]] was of similar mind, wishing to unify Christianity. In the spring of 381 they convened the Second Ecumenical Council in Constantinople.\n\n===Theological context===\nThe [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325 had not ended the [[Arianism|Arian]] controversy which it had been called to clarify. [[Arius]] and his sympathizers, e.g. [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] were admitted back into the church after ostensibly accepting the Nicene creed. [[Athanasius]], bishop of Alexandria, the most vocal opponent of Arianism, was ultimately exiled through the machinations of Eusebius of Nicomedia. After the death of [[Constantine I]] in 337 and the accession of his Arian-leaning son [[Constantius II]], open discussion of replacing the Nicene creed itself began. Up until about 360, theological debates mainly dealt with the divinity of the Son, the second person of the [[Trinity]]. However, because the Council of Nicaea had not clarified the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]], the third person of the Trinity, it became a topic of debate. The [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonians]] denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit. This was also known as Pneumatomachianism.\n\n[[Nicene Christianity]] also had its defenders: apart from Athanasius, the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]' Trinitarian discourse was influential in the council at [[Constantinople]]. [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]], another pro-Nicene theologian, proved controversial. Possibly in an over-reaction to Arianism and its teaching that Christ was not God, he taught that Christ consisted of a human body and a divine mind, rejecting Christ having a human mind.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Alister McGrath |last=McGrath |first=Alister |year=1998 |title=Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |chapter=The Patristic Period |isbn=0-631-20843-7 }}</ref> He was charged with confounding the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], and with giving in to the heretical ways of [[Sabellius]]. [[Basil of Caesarea]] accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. His views were condemned in a [[Synod]] at [[Alexandria]], under [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the [[Polemian]]s and the [[Antidicomarianite]]s.\n\n===Geopolitical context===\nTheodosius' strong commitment to Nicene Christianity involved a calculated risk because Constantinople, the imperial capital of the Eastern Empire, was solidly Arian.

It is roughly equivalent to the [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|Nicene Creed]] plus two additional articles: an article on the Holy Spirit\u2014describing Him as \"the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, and Who spoke through the prophets\"\u2014and an article about the Church, baptism, and the resurrection of the dead. (For the full text of both creeds, see [[Nicene Creed#Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381|Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381]].)\n\nHowever, scholars are not agreed on the connection between the Council of Constantinople and the Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed. Some modern scholars believe that this creed, or something close to it, was stated by the bishops at Constantinople, but not promulgated as an official act of the council. Scholars also dispute whether this creed was simply an expansion of the Creed of Nicaea, or whether it was an expansion of another traditional creed similar but not identical to the one from Nicaea.<ref>{{cite web |title = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/413955/Nicene-Creed |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> In 451&nbsp;CE, the [[Council of Chalcedon]] referred to this creed as \"the creed ... of the 150 saintly fathers assembled in Constantinople\",<ref>{{cite book |title=Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils |editor-first=Norman |editor-last=Tanner |editor2-first=Giuseppe |editor2-last=Alberigo |location= Washington, DC |publisher=Georgetown University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-87840-490-2 |page=84 }}</ref> indicating that this creed was associated with Constantinople (381) no later than 451&nbsp;CE.\n\n===Christology===\nThis council condemned [[Arianism]] which began to die out with further condemnations at a [[council of Aquileia, 381|council of Aquileia]] by [[Ambrose of Milan]] in 381.

He notes that all three of the presiding bishops came from the East.

It confirmed the reinstatement of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] as [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nIt has been accepted by handful [[Eastern Orthodox]] as an eighth [[Ecumenical Council]].{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=103}}{{Unreliable fringe source|date=February 2018}} \n\n==Background==\n\nThe Council settled the dispute that had broken out after the deposition of [[Ignatios of Constantinople|Ignatius]] as [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] in 858. Ignatius, himself appointed to his office in an uncanonical manner, opposed [[Caesar (title)#Byzantine Empire|Caesar]] [[Bardas]], who had deposed the regent [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]]. In response, Bardas' nephew, the youthful Emperor [[Michael III]] engineered Ignatius's deposition and confinement on the charge of treason. The patriarchal throne was filled with [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], a renowned scholar and kinsman of Bardas. The deposition of Ignatius without a formal ecclesiastical trial and the sudden promotion of Photios caused scandal in the church. [[Pope Nicholas I]] and the western bishops took up the cause of Ignatios and condemned Photios's election as uncanonical. In 863, at a synod in Rome the pope deposed Photios, and reappointed Ignatius as the rightful patriarch. However, Photius enjoined the support of the Emperor and responded by calling a Council and excommunicating the pope.\n\nThis state of affairs changed when Photius's patrons, Bardas and Emperor Michael III, were murdered in 866 and 867, respectively, by [[Basil I|Basil the Macedonian]], who now usurped the throne. Photios was deposed as patriarch, not so much because he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Bardas and Michael, but because Basil was seeking an alliance with the Pope and the western emperor. Photios was removed from his office and banished about the end of September 867, and Ignatios was reinstated on 23 November. Photios was condemned by a [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|Council held at Constantinople]] from 5 October 869 to 28 February 870. Photius was deposed and barred from the patriarchal office, while Ignatius was reinstated.\n\n==The Council of 879\u2013880==\n\nAfter the death of Ignatius in 877, the Emperor made Photius again Patriarch of Constantinople.<ref>\"Photius.\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005. Quote: \"It was only after Ignatius' death (877) that Photius, by order of the Emperor, once more became Patriarch.\"</ref> Another Council was convened in 879, held at Constantinople, comprising the representatives of all the five patriarchates, including that of Rome (all in all 383 bishops). A. Edward Siecienski writes: \"In 879 the emperor called for another council to meet in Constantinople in the hopes that the new pope, [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] (872-882) would recognize the validity of Photius's claim upon the patriarchate. This council, sometimes called the eighth ecumenical in the East was attended by the papal legates (who had brought with them a gift from the pope\u2014a [[pallium]] for Photius) and by over 400 bishops, and who immediately confirmed Photius as rightful patriarch.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=103}} The granting of a pallium is a sign of papal approval and the pope's legates \"immediately\" confirmed Photius without awaiting a decision of the council.\n\nThe council also implicitly condemned the addition of the [[Filioque]] to the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], an addition rejected at that time in Rome: \"The Creed (without the ''filioque'') was read out and a condemnation pronounced against those who 'impose on it their own invented phrases [\u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f51\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2] and put this forth as a common lesson to the faithful or to those who return from som kind of heresy and display the audacity to falsify completely [\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b7] the antiquity of this sacred and venerable ''Horos'' [Rule] with illegitimate words, or additions, or subtractions'.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=104}} Eastern Orthodox Christians argue that thereby the council condemned not only the addition of the [[Filioque clause]] to the creed but also denounced the clause as heretical (a view strongly espoused by Photius in his polemics against Rome), while Roman Catholics separate the two and insist on the theological orthodoxy of the clause. According to non-Catholic Philip Schaff, \"To the Greek acts was afterwards added a (pretended) letter of Pope John VIII. to Photius, declaring the Filioque to be an addition which is rejected by the church of Rome, and a blasphemy which must be abolished calmly and by degrees.\"<ref name=Schaff/>\n\n==Confirmation and further reception==\n\nWhether and how far the council was confirmed by Pope John VIII is also a matter of dispute: The council was held in the presence of [[papal legate]]s, who approved of the proceedings, Roman Catholic historian Fr. Francis Dvornik argues that Pope accepted the acts of the council and annulled those of the Council of 869\u2013870. Other Catholic historians, such as Warren Carroll, dispute this view, arguing that the pope rejected the council. Siecienski says that the Pope gave only a qualified assent to the acts of the council.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=104}} Philip Schaff opines that the Pope, deceived by his legates about the actual proceedings, first applauded the Emperor but later denounced the council.<ref name=\"Schaff\">[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/4_ch05.htm Philip Schaff, Conflict of the Eastern and Western Churches]</ref> In any case, the Pope had already accepted the reinstatement of Photius as Patriarch.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=103}} However, later, in the wake of further conflicts between East and West in the 11th century, the council was repudiated.\n\nOn 8 March 870, three days after the end of the council, the Papal and Eastern delegates met with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] ambassadors led by the [[kavhan]] [[Peter (diplomat)|Peter]] to decide the status of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]]. Since the Bulgarians were not satisfied with the positions of the Pope after prolonged negotiations, they reached favorable agreement with the Byzantines and the decision was taken that the Bulgarian Church should become Eastern Orthodox.<ref>Zlatarski, ''History of the Bulgarian State during the Middle Ages'', vol. 1, ch. 2, Sofia, 1971, p. 159</ref>\n\nThe [[Photian Schism]] (863\u2013867) that led to the councils of 869 and 879 represents a break between East and West.

His father, from whom he received his middle name, was born in 1871 also in Vienna. He was a medical doctor employed by the municipal ministry of health with a passion for [[botany]], about which he wrote a number of monographs. August von Hayek was also a part-time botany lecturer at the [[University of Vienna]]. His mother was born in 1875 to a wealthy conservative and land-owning family. As her mother died several years prior to Hayek's birth, Felicitas received a significant inheritance, which provided as much as half of her and her husband's income during the early years of their marriage. Hayek was the oldest of three brothers, Heinrich (1900\u20131969) and Erich (1904\u20131986), who were one-and-a-half and five years younger than him.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=7}}\n\nHis father's career as a university professor influenced Hayek's goals later in life.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|pp=7\u20138}} Both of his grandfathers, who lived long enough for Hayek to know them, were scholars. [[:de:Franz von Juraschek|Franz von Juraschek]] was a leading economist in [[Austria-Hungary]] and a close friend of [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]], one of the founders of the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]].<ref>Note: Von Juraschek was a statistician and was later employed by the Austrian government.</ref> Hayek's paternal grandfather, [[Gustav von Hayek|Gustav Edler von Hayek]], taught natural sciences at the Imperial ''Realobergymnasium'' (secondary school) in Vienna. He wrote systematic works in biology, some of which are relatively well known.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=8}}\n\nOn his mother's side, Hayek was second cousin to the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. His mother often played with Wittgenstein's sisters and had known him well. As a result of their family relationship, Hayek became one of the first to read Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' when the book was published in its original German edition in 1921. Although he met Wittgenstein on only a few occasions, Hayek said that Wittgenstein's philosophy and methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and thought.<ref>Ebenstein, p. 245</ref> In his later years, Hayek recalled a discussion of philosophy with Wittgenstein when both were officers during World War I.<ref>''Hayek on Hayek: an autobiographical dialogue'', By Friedrich August Hayek, Routledge, 1994, p. 51</ref> After Wittgenstein's death, Hayek had intended to write a biography of Wittgenstein and worked on collecting family materials and later assisted biographers of Wittgenstein.<ref>''Young Ludwig: Wittgenstein's life'', 1889\u20131921, Brian McGuinness, Oxford University Press, 2005 p. xii</ref> He was related to Wittgenstein on the non-Jewish side of the [[Wittgenstein family]]. Since his youth, Hayek frequently socialized with Jewish intellectuals and he mentions that people often speculated whether he was also of Jewish ancestry. That made him curious, so he spent some time researching his ancestors and found out that he has no Jewish ancestors for five generations in all directions.<ref>Hayek on Hayek: an autobiographical dialogue, By Friedrich August Hayek, Routledge, 1994, p. 53</ref> Surname [[Hayek]] is German spelling of Czech surname [[H\u00e1jek]].\n\nHayek displayed an intellectual and academic bent from a very young age. He read fluently and frequently before going to school.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=9}} At his father's suggestion, as a teenager he read the genetic and evolutionary works of [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[August Weismann]] and the philosophical works of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]].<ref name=UCLA>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/nobelprizewinnin00haye |title=UCLA Oral History 1978 Interviews with Friedrich Hayek, pp. 32\u201338 |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> In school, Hayek was much taken by one instructor's lectures on [[Aristotle's ethics]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0226320625| last1 = Kresge| first1 = Stephen| last2 = Wenar| first2 = Leif| title = Hayek on Hayek: An Autobiographical Dialogue| date = 2005-07-22}}{{rp|39}}</ref> In his unpublished autobiographical notes, Hayek recalled a division between him and his younger brothers who were only a few years younger than him, but he believed that they were somehow of a different generation.

For a short time, when the University of Vienna closed he studied in [[Constantin von Monakow]]'s Institute of Brain Anatomy, where Hayek spent much of his time [[staining]] brain cells. Hayek's time in Monakow's lab and his deep interest in the work of [[Ernst Mach]] inspired his first intellectual project, eventually published as ''The Sensory Order'' (1952).

Between 1923 and 1924, Hayek worked as a research assistant to Professor [[Jeremiah Jenks]] of [[New York University]], compiling macroeconomic data on the American economy and the operations of the Federal Reserve.<ref>A. J. Tebble, ''F.A. Hayek'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\n{{Austrian School sidebar|people}}\nInitially sympathetic to Wieser's [[democratic socialism]], Hayek's economic thinking shifted away from socialism and toward the [[classical liberalism]] of Carl Menger after reading von Mises' book ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism]]''. It was sometime after reading ''Socialism'' that Hayek began attending von Mises' private seminars, joining several of his university friends, including [[Fritz Machlup]], [[Alfred Schutz]], [[Felix Kaufmann]] and [[Gottfried Haberler]], who were also participating in Hayek's own more general and private seminar. It was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]], with whom he retained a long-standing relationship.<ref>Federici, Michael.

Upon his arrival in London, Hayek was quickly recognised as one of the leading economic theorists in the world and his development of the economics of processes in time and the co-ordination function of prices inspired the ground-breaking work of [[John Hicks]], [[Abba P.

Well beyond that single public conflict, regarding the economics of extending the length of production to the economics of labour inputs, Hayek and Keynes disagreed on many essential economics matters. Their economic disagreements were both practical and fundamental in nature.

During his time at Chicago, Hayek worked on the philosophy of science, economics, political philosophy and the history of ideas. Hayek's economics notes from this period have yet to be published. Hayek received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1954.<ref>[http://www.libertystory.net/LSTHINKHAYEKLIFE.htm Biography] at LibertyStory.net</ref>\n\nAfter editing a book on [[John Stuart Mill]]'s letters he planned to publish two books on the liberal order, ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]'' and \"The Creative Powers of a Free Civilization\" (eventually the title for the second chapter of ''The Constitution of Liberty'').<ref>Ebenstein, p. 195.</ref> He completed ''The Constitution of Liberty'' in May 1959, with publication in February 1960.

Preliminary drafts of the book were completed by 1970, but Hayek chose to rework his drafts and finally brought the book to publication in three volumes in 1973, 1976 and 1979.\n\n[[File:BuildingUniversitySalzburg1.jpg|thumb|260px|University of Salzburg (below, foreground) since the mid 1980s as seen from city center]]\nHayek became a professor at the [[University of Salzburg]] from 1969 to 1977 and then returned to Freiburg, where he spent the rest of his days.

Writing to ''The Times'', Hayek said: \"May one who has devoted a large part of his life to the study of the history and the principles of liberalism point out that a party that keeps a socialist government in power has lost all title to the name 'Liberal'. Certainly no liberal can in future vote 'Liberal'\".<ref>\"Letters to the Editor: Liberal pact with Labour\", ''The Times'' (31 March 1977), p. 15.</ref> Hayek was criticised by Liberal politicians [[Gladwyn Jebb]] and [[Andrew Phillips, Baron Phillips of Sudbury|Andrew Phillips]], who both claimed that the purpose of the pact was to discourage socialist legislation.\n\nLord Gladwyn pointed out that the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|German Free Democrats]] were in coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]].<ref>\"Letters to the Editor: Liberal pact with Labour\", ''The Times'' (2 April 1977), p. 15.</ref> However, Hayek was defended by Professor [[Antony Flew]], who stated that\u2014unlike the British Labour Party\u2014the German Social Democrats had since the late 1950s abandoned public ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange and had instead embraced the [[social market economy]].<ref>\"Letters to the Editor: German socialist aims\", ''The Times'' (13 April 1977), p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Hayek came into conflict with Liberal Party leader [[David Steel]], who claimed that liberty was possible only with \"social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth and power, which in turn require a degree of active government intervention\" and that the Conservative Party were more concerned with the connection between liberty and private enterprise than between liberty and democracy. Hayek claimed that a limited democracy might be better than other forms of limited government at protecting liberty, but that an unlimited democracy was worse than other forms of unlimited government because \"its government loses the power even to do what it thinks right if any group on which its majority depends thinks otherwise\".\n\nHayek stated that if the Conservative leader had said \"that free choice is to be exercised more in the market place than in the ballot box, she has merely uttered the truism that the first is indispensable for individual freedom while the second is not: free choice can at least exist under a dictatorship that can limit itself but not under the government of an unlimited democracy which cannot\".<ref>\"Letters to the Editor: The dangers to personal liberty\", ''The Times'' (11 July 1978), p. 15.</ref>\n\n=== Influence on central European politics ===\nPresident [[Ronald Reagan]] listed Hayek as among the two or three people who most influenced his philosophy and welcomed Hayek to the White House as a special guest.<ref>Martin Anderson, \"Revolution\" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1988), p. 164</ref> In the 1970s and 1980s, the writings of Hayek were also a major influence on many of the leaders of the \"velvet\" revolution in Central Europe during the collapse of the old [[Soviet Empire]]. Some supporting examples include the following:\n\n::There is no figure who had more of an influence, no person had more of an influence on the intellectuals behind the Iron Curtain than Friedrich Hayek.

[[Ludwig von Mises]] had earlier applied the concept of [[marginal utility]] to the value of money in his ''[[Theory of Money and Credit]]'' (1912) in which he also proposed an explanation for \"industrial fluctuations\" based on the ideas of the old [[British Currency School]] and of Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]]. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the [[Austrian business cycle theory|Austrian theory of the business cycle]]. Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as ''Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle''. There, Hayek argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his ''Prices and Production'' (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the [[central bank]]'s inflationary [[Credit cycle|credit expansion]] and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low [[interest rate]]s. Hayek claimed that \"the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process\".\n\nHayek's analysis was based on [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]]'s concept of the \"average period of production\"<ref>See the chapter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fkVHIn8y8qkC&pg=PA7 \"The collaboration with Keynes and the controversy with Hayek,\"], Heinz D.

In accordance with the reasoning later outlined in his essay \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945), Hayek argued that a monopolistic governmental agency like a central bank can neither possess the relevant information which should govern supply of money, nor have the ability to use it correctly.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Collected Works of F.A.

Eager to promote alternatives to what he regarded as the narrow approach of the school of economic thought that then dominated the English-speaking academic world (centred at the [[University of Cambridge]] and deriving largely from the work of [[Alfred Marshall]]), Robbins invited Hayek to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931. According to Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek's theory of the time-structure of capital and of the business cycle initially \"fascinated the academic world\" and appeared to offer a less \"facile and superficial\" understanding of [[macroeconomics]] than the Cambridge school's.<ref name=\"Kaldor1942\">{{cite journal | author=Nicholas Kaldor | title=Professor Hayek and the Concertina-Effect | journal=Economica | volume=9 | year=1942 | pages =359\u201382 | jstor=2550326 | doi=10.2307/2550326 | issue=36}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1931, Hayek critiqued [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s ''[[A Treatise on Money|Treatise on Money]]'' (1930) in his \"Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J.

After 1941, he continued to publish works on the economics of information, political philosophy, the theory of law and psychology, but seldom on macroeconomics. At the [[University of Chicago]], Hayek was not part of the economics department and did not influence the rebirth of neoclassical theory that took place there (see [[Chicago school of economics]]). When in 1974 he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Myrdal, the latter complained about being paired with an \"ideologue\". [[Milton Friedman]] declared himself \"an enormous admirer of Hayek, but not for his economics. I think ''Prices and Production'' is a very flawed book. I think his [''Pure Theory of Capital''] is unreadable. On the other hand, ''The Road to Serfdom'' is one of the great books of our time\".<ref name=\"Garrison\"/>\n\n=== The economic calculation problem ===\n{{main|Economic calculation problem}}\nBuilding on the earlier work of Mises and others, Hayek also argued that while in centrally planned economies an individual or a select group of individuals must determine the distribution of resources, these planners will never have enough information to carry out this allocation reliably. This argument, first proposed by [[Max Weber]], says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the [[price]] mechanism in free markets (see [[economic calculation problem]]).\n\nIn 1935, Hayek published ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', a collection of essays from an earlier debate that had been initiated by Mises. Hayek included Mises's essay in which Mises argued that rational planning was impossible under socialism.\n\nSome socialists such as [[H. D. Dickinson]] and [[Oskar Lange]] responded by invoking [[general equilibrium theory]], which they argued disproved Mises's thesis. They noted that the difference between a planned and a free market system lay in who was responsible for solving the equations. They argued that if some of the prices chosen by socialist managers were wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling them to adjust the prices up or down, just as in a free market. Through such a trial and error, a socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of a free market system while avoiding its many problems.\n\nHayek challenged this vision in a series of contributions. In \"Economics and Knowledge\" (1937), he pointed out that the standard equilibrium theory assumed that all agents have full and correct information. However, in the real world different individuals have different bits of knowledge and furthermore some of what they believe is wrong.\n\nIn \"[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]\" (1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge, allowing society's members to achieve diverse and complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous [[self-organization]]. He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place.<ref>Hein Schreuder, \"Coase, Hayek and Hierarchy\", In: S. Lindenberg et Hein Schreuder, dir., Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Organization Studies, Pergamon Press</ref> Thus, Hayek set the stage for [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]]'s later contrast between markets and hierarchies as alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions.<ref>[[Douma, Sytse]] and [[Hein Schreuder]], 2013. \"Economic Approaches to Organizations\". 5th edition. London: Pearson {{ISBN|0273735292}}, {{ISBN|978-0273735298}}</ref> He used the term [[catallaxy]] to describe a \"self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation\". Hayek's research into this argument was specifically cited by the Nobel Committee in its press release awarding Hayek the Nobel prize.<ref name=\"Economics Prize For Works In Economic Theory And Inter-Disciplinary Research\"/>\n\n=== Criticism of collectivism ===\n[[File:Individualism and Economic Order (Hayek book) cover art.jpg|thumb|180px|Front cover art for Hayek's book ''Individualism and Economic Order'', 1948]]\nHayek was one of the leading academic critics of collectivism in the 20th century. Hayek argued that all forms of collectivism (even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind. In Hayek's view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the [[rule of law]], with as little arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards [[totalitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Ha-Joon|title=Economics: The User's Guide|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|location=London|isbn=978-0718197032|language=English|chapter=4}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Road to Serfdom'', Hayek wrote:{{quote|Although our modern socialists' promise of greater freedom is genuine and sincere, in recent years observer after observer has been impressed by the unforeseen consequences of socialism, the extraordinary similarity in many respects of the conditions under \"communism\" and \"fascism\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hayek, FA. ''The Road to Serfdom'', Ch. 9</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nHayek posited that a central planning authority would have to be endowed with powers that would impact and ultimately control social life because the knowledge required for centrally planning an economy is inherently decentralised, and would need to be brought under control.\n\nThough Hayek did argue that the state should provide law centrally, others have pointed out that this contradicts his arguments about the role of judges in \"discovering\" the law, suggesting that Hayek would have supported decentralized provision of legal services.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|last2=Zywicki|first2=Todd|title=Hayekian Anarchism|journal=George Mason University Law and Economics Research Paper Series|date=January 20, 2011|volume=11|issue=6|ssrn=1744364}}</ref>\n\nHayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy, specifically in creating a safety net, saying: <blockquote>There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/hayek_on_social_insurance.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Hayek on Social Insurance}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Investment and choice ===\nPerhaps more fully than any other economist, Hayek investigated the [[rational choice theory|choice theory]] of investment. He examined the inter-relations between non-permanent production goods and \"latent\" or potentially economic permanent resources, building on the choice theoretical insight that \"processes that take more time will evidently not be adopted unless they yield a greater return than those that take less time\".<ref>''The Pure Theory of Capital'' ([https://mises.org/books/puretheory.pdf pdf]), Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1941/2007 (Vol. 12 of the Collected Works): p. 90.</ref>\n\nHayek's work on the [[microeconomics]] of the choice theoretics of investment, non-permanent goods, potential permanent resources and economically-adapted permanent resources mark a central dividing point between his work in areas of [[macroeconomics]] and that of almost all other economists. Hayek's work on the macroeconomic subjects of [[central planning]], trade cycle theory, the division of knowledge and entrepreneurial adaptation especially, differ greatly from the opinions of macroeconomic \"[[Alfred Marshall|Marshallian]]\" economists who follow the tradition of [[John Maynard Keynes]] and the microeconomic \"[[L\u00e9on Walras|Walrasian]]\" economists who follow the tradition of [[Abba Lerner]].\n\n=== Philosophy of science ===\n{{see also|The Counter-Revolution of Science}}\nDuring World War II, Hayek began the Abuse of Reason project. His goal was to show how a number of then-popular doctrines and beliefs had a common origin in some fundamental misconceptions about the social science.<ref name=\"auto\">Caldwell, Bruce. \"Hayek, Friedrich August von (1899\u20131992).\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Third Edition. Eds. Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. Palgrave Macmillan, 2018.</ref> In his [[philosophy of science]], which has much in common with that of his good friend [[Karl Popper]], Hayek was highly critical of what he termed \"[[scientism]]\", a false understanding of the methods of science that has been mistakenly forced upon the social sciences, but that is contrary to the practices of genuine science. Usually, scientism involves combining the philosophers' ancient demand for demonstrative justification with the associationists' false view that all scientific explanations are simple two-variable linear relationships.\n\nHayek points out that much of science involves the explanation of complex multivariable and nonlinear phenomena{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} and the social science of economics and undesigned order compares favourably with such complex sciences as Darwinian biology. These ideas were developed in ''[[The Counter-Revolution of Science]]'' in 1952 and in some of Hayek's later essays in the philosophy of science such as \"Degrees of Explanation\" (1955) and \"The Theory of Complex Phenomena\" (1964).\n\nIn ''Counter-Revolution'', for example, Hayek observed that the hard sciences attempt to remove the \"human factor\" to obtain objective and strictly controlled results: {{quote|[T]he persistent effort of modern Science has been to get down to \"objective facts,\" to cease studying what men thought about nature or regarding the given concepts as true images of the real world, and, above all, to discard all theories which pretended to explain phenomena by imputing to them a directing mind like our own. Instead, its main task became to revise and reconstruct the concepts formed from ordinary experience on the basis of a systematic testing of the phenomena, so as to be better able to recognize the particular as an instance of a general rule.|Friedrich Hayek|''The Counter-Revolution of Science'' (Chapter II, \"The Problem and the Method of the Natural Sciences\")}}\n\nMeanwhile, the soft sciences are attempting to measure [[praxeology|human action]] itself:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/freeman/detail/book-review-the-counter-revolution-of-science-studies-on-the-abuse-of-reason-by-f-a-hayek|title=Book Review: The Counter-revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason by F.

But if we tried to do so for the purposes of explaining human action, we would confine ourselves to less than we know about the situation.|Friedrich Hayek|''The Counter-Revolution of Science'' (Chapter III, \"The Subjective Character of the Data of the Social Sciences\")}}\n\nHe notes that these are mutually exclusive and that [[social science]]s should not attempt to impose [[positivist]] methodology, nor to claim objective or definite results:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_8g8eK-Q5kC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59#v=onepage&q=%22counter-revolution+of+science%22+positivism|title=The Moral Foundations of Civil Society|first=Wilhelm|last=R\u00c3\u00b6pke|publisher=Transaction Publishers|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychology ===\nIn ''The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology'' (1952), Hayek independently developed a \"[[Hebbian learning]]\" model of learning and memory\u2014an idea he first conceived in 1920 prior to his study of economics. Hayek's expansion of the \"Hebbian synapse\" construction into a global brain theory has received attention in neuroscience, [[cognitive science]], computer science, behavioural science and [[evolutionary psychology]] by scientists such as [[Gerald Edelman]] and [[Joaquin Fuster]].<ref>[[Gerald Edelman]], Neural Darwinism, 1987, p. 25</ref><ref>Joaquin Fuster, Memory in the Cerebral Cortex: An Empirical Approach to Neural Networks in the Human and Nonhuman Primate. Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 1995, p. 87-88</ref><ref>Joaquin Fuster, \"Network Memory\", Trends in Neurosciences, 1997. Vol. 20, No. 10. (Oct.): 451\u201359.</ref>\n\n''The Sensory Order'' can be viewed as a development of his attack on scientism. Hayek posited two orders, namely the sensory order that we experience and the natural order that natural science has revealed. Hayek thought that the sensory order actually is a product of the brain. He described the brain as a very complex yet self-ordering hierarchical classification system, a huge network of connections. Because of these nature of the classifier system, richness of our sensory experience can exist. Hayek's description posed problems to [[behaviorism]], whose proponents took the sensory order as fundamental.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== Social and political philosophy ===\nIn the latter half of his career, Hayek made a number of contributions to [[social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]] which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge<ref>{{cite book|author=Hayek|url= |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society \u2013 A selected essay reprint |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from [[epistemological]] concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic and free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be \"a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it\".<ref>''Individualism and Economic Order'', p. 11</ref>\n\nAlthough Hayek believed in a society governed by laws, he disapproved of the notion of \"[[social justice]]\". He compared the market to a game in which \"there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust\"<ref>''The Mirage of Social Justice'', chap. 10</ref> and argued that \"social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content\".<ref name=hayek1948ch12>''The Mirage of Social Justice'', chap. 12</ref> Likewise, \"the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning\".<ref>''The Constitution of Liberty'', chap. 6</ref> He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom, saying that \"the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society\".<ref name=hayek1948ch12/>\n\n==== Spontaneous order ====\n{{main|Spontaneous order}}\nHayek viewed the [[free price system]] not as a conscious invention (that which is intentionally designed by man), but as spontaneous order or what Scottish philosopher [[Adam Ferguson]] referred to as \"the result of human action but not of human design\".<ref name=\"Ferguson1767\">{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Adam|title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society|publisher=T.

He explained that [[price signals]] are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate [[tacit knowledge]] or [[dispersed knowledge]] to each other to solve the economic calculation problem. [[Alain de Benoist]] of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' (New Right) produced a highly critical essay on Hayek's work in an issue of ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'', citing the flawed assumptions behind Hayek's idea of \"[[spontaneous order]]\" and the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and totalising implications of his [[Free market|free-market]] ideology.<ref>{{cite journal |last=de Benoist |first=Alain |authorlink=Alain de Benoist |title=Hayek: A Critique |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |year=1998 |issue=110}}</ref>\n\nHayek's concept of the market as a spontaneous order has been recently applied to ecosystems to defend a broadly non-interventionist policy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|ssrn = 2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey}}</ref> Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|ssrn = 2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 2\u201311}}</ref> On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements.

This analysis of ecosystems as spontaneous orders does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders. As such, one need not endorse Hayek's analysis of markets to endorse ecosystems as spontaneous orders.\n\n==== Hayek's views on social safety nets ====\nWith regard to a [[social safety net]], Hayek advocated \"some provision for those threatened by the extremes of indigence or starvation due to circumstances beyond their control\" and argued that the \"necessity of some such arrangement in an industrial society is unquestioned\u2014be it only in the interest of those who require protection against acts of desperation on the part of the needy\".<ref>{{citation|first=Friedrich|last=Hayek|editor-first=Ronald|editor-last=Hamowy|editor-link=Ronald Hamowy|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|place=[[Chicago]]|edition=Definitive|year=2011|page=405|origyear=1960|isbn=978-0-226-31539-3}}</ref> Summarizing Hayek's views on the topic, journalist [[Nicholas Wapshott]] has argued that \"[Hayek] advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance, enforced, if not directly provided, by the state\".<ref>{{citation|first=Nicholas|last=Wapshott|author-link=Nicholas Wapshott|title=Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics|publisher=[[W.

There are difficult questions about the precise standard which should thus be assured... but there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody. Indeed, for a considerable part of the population of [[England]] this sort of security has long been achieved.\n\nNor is there any reason why the state should not assist... individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance \u2013 where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks \u2013 the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.... [And] there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of [[Individualism#Political individualism|individual freedom]]. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make the provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.<ref>{{Citation|first=Friedrich|last=Hayek|editor-first=Bruce|editor-last=Caldwell|editor-link=Bruce Caldwell (economist)|title=[[The Road to Serfdom]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|place=[[Chicago]]|edition=Definitive|year=2007|pages=147\u201348|origyear=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32055-7}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn 1973, Hayek reiterated in ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'': <blockquote>There is no reason why in a free society government should not assure to all, protection against severe deprivation in the form of an [[Guaranteed minimum income|assured minimum income]], or a [[Basic income|floor below which nobody need to descend]]. To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves.  So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]].<ref>{{Citation|first=Friedrich|last=Hayek|title=[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|place=[[Chicago]]|volume=2|year=1976|page=87|isbn=978-0-226-32083-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Hayek's liberalism and skepticism ====\nArthur M. Diamond argues Hayek's problems arise when he goes beyond claims that can be evaluated within economic science. Diamond argued: <blockquote>The human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited in its ability to synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. Here is where the tension develops, for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market. He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation. It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Arthur M.|title=F. A.

The unresolved dilemma of his political philosophy is how to mount a systematic defence of liberalism if one emphasizes the limited capacity of reason.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kukathas|first1=Chandran|title=Hayek and Modern Liberalism|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=215}}</ref> [[Norman P.

Hayek'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), pp. 347\u201348</ref>\n\n==== Hayek's views on dictatorship ====\n{{wikiquote|Friedrich Hayek and dictatorship}}\nHayek sent [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] a copy of ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]'' (1960) in 1962. Hayek hoped that his book\u2014this \"preliminary sketch of new constitutional principles\"\u2014\"may assist\" Salazar \"in his endeavour to design a constitution which is proof against the abuses of democracy\".<ref name=\"Farrant, Andrew 2012\">Farrant, Andrew, Edward McPhail, and Sebastian Berger. \"Preventing the \"Abuses\" of Democracy: Hayek, the \"Military Usurper\" and Transitional Dictatorship in Chile?.\" American Journal of Economics and Sociology 71.3 (2012): 513\u201338.</ref>\n\nHayek visited Chile in the 1970s and 1980s during the [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|Government Junta]] of general [[Augusto Pinochet]] and accepted being appointed Honorary Chairman of the [[Centro de Estudios P\u00fablicos]], the think tank formed by the economists who transformed Chile into a free market economy.<ref name=\"Farrant, Andrew 2012\"/>\n\nAsked about the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|liberal non-democratic rule]] by a Chilean interviewer, Hayek is translated from German to Spanish to English as having said the following: <blockquote>As long term institutions, I am totally against dictatorships. But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. [...] Personally I prefer a liberal dictatorship to democratic government devoid of liberalism. My personal impression \u2013 and this is valid for South America \u2013 is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government.{{fact|date=October 2018}}</blockquote>\n\nIn a letter to the ''[[London Times]]'', he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had \"not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under [[Salvador Allende|Allende]]\".<ref>Greg Grandin, professor of history, New York University, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t5itdZ7oycUC&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172#v=onepage ''Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States, and the Rise of the New Imperialism]'', pp. 172\u201373, Metropolitan, 2006, {{ISBN|0805077383}}.</ref><ref>Dan Avn\u00f4n, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6TmN-9qAmQC ''Liberalism and its Practice]'', p. 56, Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0415193540}}.</ref> Hayek admitted that \"it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only hope there is\", but he explained that \"[i]t is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust. But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this. And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy\".\n\nFor Hayek, the distinction between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and he was at pains to emphasise his opposition to totalitarianism, noting that the concept of transitional dictatorship which he defended was characterised by authoritarianism, not totalitarianism. For example, when Hayek visited Venezuela in May 1981, he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende\". For Hayek, the word \"totalitarian\" signifies something very specific, namely the intention to \"organize the whole of society\" to attain a \"definite social goal\" which is stark in contrast to \"liberalism and individualism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coreyrobin.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hayekchile.pdf|title=Preventing the \"Abuses\" of Democracy: Hayek, the \"Military Usurper\" and Transitional Dictatorship in Chile?|publisher=[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and recognition ==\nHayek's influence on the development of economics is widely acknowledged. With regard to the popularity of his Nobel acceptance lecture, Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after [[Kenneth Arrow]]) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics. Hayek wrote critically there of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Skarbek|first1=David|title=F. A. Hayek's Influence on Nobel Prize Winners|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|date=2009|volume=22|issue=1}}</ref> A number of [[Nobel Laureates]] in economics, such as [[Vernon L. Smith|Vernon Smith]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]], recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist.{{refn | Smith\n* {{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Vernon|title=Reflections on Human Action after 50 years|journal=Cato Journal|date=1999|volume=9|issue=2|quote=Hayek, in my view, is the leading economic thinker of the 20th century.}}\nSimon\n* {{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Herbert|title=The Sciences of the Artificial|date=1981|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge|edition=2nd|quote=\"No one has characterized market mechanisms better than Friedrich von Hayek\"}}{{rp|41}}\n}} Another Nobel winner, [[Paul Samuelson]], believed that Hayek was worthy of his award, but nevertheless claimed that \"there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's ''Prices and Production'' had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927\u20131931 (and the 1931\u20132007) historical scene\".<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2008.07.001 | volume=69 | title=A few remembrances of Friedrich von Hayek (1899\u20131992) | journal=Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization | pages=1\u20134| year=2009 | last1=Samuelson | first1=Paul A }}</ref> Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher [[Joseph Schumpeter]] to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.<ref>The collected scientific papers of Paul A. Samuelson, Volume 5, p. 315.</ref>\n\nHayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of [[growth theory]], [[information economics]] and the theory of spontaneous order. The \"informal\" economics presented in [[Milton Friedman]]'s massively influential popular work ''[[Free to Choose]]'' (1980) is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945) in his graduate seminars.\n\nIn 1944, he was elected as a Fellow of the [[British Academy]]<ref>Fritz Machlup, ''Essays on Hayek'', Routledge, 2003. p. 14.</ref> after he was nominated for membership by Keynes.<ref>Sylvia Nasar, ''Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius'', Simon and Schuster, 2011, p. 402</ref>\n\nHarvard economist and former Harvard University President [[Lawrence Summers]] explains Hayek's place in modern economics: \"What's the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the [un]hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy\".<ref>Lawrence Summers, quoted in ''The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and the Marketplace that Is Remaking the Modern World'', by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw. New York: Simon & Schuster. 1998, pp. 150\u201351.</ref>\n\nBy 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], a group of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] who sought to oppose [[socialism]]. Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarian]] and [[free-market]] [[think tank]] that inspired [[Thatcherism]]. He was in addition a member of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Philadelphia Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phillysoc.org/DistinguishedMembers.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118151439/http://phillysoc.org/DistinguishedMembers.pdf |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps [[Alfred Tarski]]\".<ref>See Hacohen, 2000.</ref> Popper dedicated his ''Conjectures and Refutations'' to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, ''Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics'', to Popper and in 1982 said that \"ever since his ''Logik der Forschung'' first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology\".<ref>See Weimer and Palermo, 1982</ref> Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.<ref>See Birner, 2001, and for the mutual influence they had on each other's ideas on evolution, Birner 2009</ref>\n\nHayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote: <blockquote>My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek's powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it....<ref>Milton & Rose Friedman, ''Two Lucky People: Memoirs'' (U. of Chicago Press), 1998. p. 333</ref></blockquote>\n\nHayek's greatest intellectual debt was to [[Carl Menger]], who pioneered an approach to social explanation similar to that developed in Britain by [[Bernard Mandeville]] and the Scottish moral philosophers in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. He had a wide-reaching influence on contemporary economics, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology and anthropology. For example, Hayek's discussion in ''The Road to Serfdom'' (1944) about truth, falsehood and the use of language influenced some later opponents of [[postmodernism]].<ref>e.g., Wolin 2004</ref>\n\n=== Hayek and conservatism ===\nHayek received new attention in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of conservative governments in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. After winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] appointed [[Keith Joseph]], the director of the Hayekian [[Centre for Policy Studies]], as her secretary of state for industry in an effort to redirect parliament's economic strategies. Likewise, [[David Stockman]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s most influential financial official in 1981, was an acknowledged follower of Hayek.<ref>Kenneth R. Hoover, ''Economics as Ideology: Keynes, Laski, Hayek, and the Creation of Contemporary Politics'' (2003), p. 213</ref>\n\nHayek wrote an essay, \"Why I Am Not a Conservative\" (included as an appendix to ''The Constitution of Liberty''), in which he disparaged conservatism for its inability to adapt to changing human realities or to offer a positive political program, remarking: \"Conservatism is only as good as what it conserves\". Although he noted that modern day [[conservatism]] shares many opinions on economics with classical liberals, particularly a belief in the [[free market]], he believed it is because conservatism wants to \"stand still\" whereas [[classical liberalism|liberalism]] embraces the free market because it \"wants to go somewhere\". Hayek identified himself as a classical liberal, but noted that in the United States it had become almost impossible to use \"liberal\" in its original definition and the term \"[[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]]\" has been used instead. In this text, Hayek also opposed conservatism for \"its hostility to [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and its proneness to a strident [[nationalism]]\", with its frequent association with [[imperialism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Why I Am Not a Conservative |publisher=LewRockwell.com |date= |accessdate=12 October 2011 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dieteman/dieteman31.html}}</ref>\n\nHayek also found libertarianism a term \"singularly unattractive\" and offered the term \"Old [[British Whig Party|Whig]]\" (a phrase borrowed from [[Edmund Burke]]) instead. In his later life, he said: \"I am becoming a Burkean Whig\". However, Whiggery as a political doctrine had little affinity for classical political economy, the tabernacle of the Manchester School and William Gladstone.<ref>E. H. H. Green, ''Ideologies of Conservatism. Conservative Political Ideas in the Twentieth Century'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 259.</ref> His essay has served as an inspiration to other liberal-minded economists wishing to distinguish themselves from conservative thinkers, for example [[James M. Buchanan]]'s essay \"Why I, Too, Am Not a Conservative: The Normative Vision of Classical Liberalism\".\n\nHis opponents have attacked Hayek as a leading promoter of [[neoliberalism]]. A British journalist, [[Samuel Brittan]], concluded in 2010 that \"Hayek's book [''The Constitution of Liberty''] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals\".<ref name=\"brittan\">Samuel Brittan, \"The many faces of liberalism,\" [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/529c55fe-06df-11df-b058-00144feabdc0.html ft.com], 22 January 2010</ref> Brittan adds that although [[Raymond Plant, Baron Plant of Highfield|Raymond Plant]] (2009) comes out in the end against Hayek's doctrines, Plant gives ''The Constitution of Liberty'' a \"more thorough and fair-minded analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents\".<ref name=\"brittan\" />\n\nIn ''Why F A Hayek is a Conservative'',<ref>\"Why F A Hayek is a Conservative\" Eamonn Butler and Madsen Pirie (eds) ''Hayek on the Fabric of Human Society'' (Adam Smith Institute, 1987)</ref> British policy analyst [[Madsen Pirie]] claims Hayek mistakes the nature of the conservative outlook. Conservatives, he says, are not averse to change, but like Hayek they are highly averse to change being imposed on the social order by people in authority who think they know how to run things better. They wish to allow the market to function smoothly and give it the freedom to change and develop. It is an outlook, says Pirie, that Hayek and conservatives both share.\n\n=== Hayek and policy discussions ===\nHayek's ideas on spontaneous order and the importance of prices in dealing with the knowledge problem has inspired a debate on economic development and transition economies after the fall of the Berlin wall. For instance, [[Peter Boettke]]<ref>P. Boettke, \"Why Perestroika Failed\", ''The Politics and Economics of Socialist Transformation'', Routledge (1993): https://books.google.com/books?id=4y6IAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=WHY%20PERESTROIKA%20FAILED%20The%20Politics%20and%20Economics%20of%20Socialist%20Transformation&f=false.</ref> elaborated in detail on why reforming socialism failed and the Soviet Union broke down. Ronald McKinnon<ref>McKinnon, Spontaneous Order on the Road Back from Socialism: An Asian Perspective. American Economic Review (1992): https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117371</ref> uses Hayekian ideas to describe challenges of transition from a centralized state and planned economy to a market economy. Former World Bank Chief Economist William Easterly emphasizes why foreign aid tends to have no effect at best in bestsellers such as White Man's Burden.<ref>W. Easterly, The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good: https://books.google.com/books?id=Dcj_Ju1wICkC</ref>\n\nSince the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|2007\u20132008 financial crisis]], there is a renewed interest in Hayek's core explanation of boom-and-bust cycles, which serves as an alternative explanation to that of the savings glut as launched by Bernanke. Economists at the Bank of International Settlements, e.g. William White, emphasize the importance of Hayekian insights and the impact of monetary policies and credit growth as root causes of financial cycles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2009/12/pdf/white.pdf |title=Data |website=www.imf.org |format=PDF}}</ref> A.

Monetary policy and mounting regulation is argued to have undermined the innovative forces of the market economies. Quantitative easing following the financial crises is argued to have not only conserved structural distortions in the economy, leading to a fall in trend-growth. It also created new distortions and contributes to distributional conflicts.<ref>Hoffmann and Schnabl, Adverse Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy, Cato Journal 2016, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2747865</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn August 1926, Hayek married Helen Berta Maria von Fritsch (1901\u20131960), a secretary at the civil service office where Hayek worked, on the rebound upon hearing of his cousin's marriage. They had two children together.<ref>Ebenstein, p. 44.</ref> Upon the close of World War  II, Hayek restarted a relationship with his cousin, who had married since they first met, but kept it secret until 1948.

Subsequently, he became manager for the development of the [[IBM System/360]] family of computers and the [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] software package. During this time he coined the term [[computer architecture]].\n\nIn 1964, Brooks accepted an invitation to come to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and founded the University's computer science department.

The phrase is often shortened to ''continuo'', and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the ''continuo group''.\n\nThe makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers, and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]], [[guitar]], [[Regal (instrument)|regal]], or [[harp]]. In addition, any number of instruments which play in the [[bass (music)|bass]] register may be included, such as [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[viol|bass viol]], or [[bassoon]]. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as [[opera]]s, and organ for [[sacred music]]. Typically performers match the [[Family (musical instruments)|instrument families]] used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds, but restricting it to cello and/or [[double bass]] if only strings are involved. [[Harp]]s, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) [[Monteverdi]] calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a [[bass violin]] in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of [[Positive organ|''organo di legno'']] and ''[[chitarrone]]'', while [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] stands watch to the sound of a regal.\n\nThe keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player ''realizes'' a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead [[melody]] and any [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate [[Motive (music)|motives]] found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in [[staff notation]] for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in [[historically informed performance]], however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nBasso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, continued to be used in many works, mostly (but not limited to) sacred choral works, of the [[Classical music era|classical]] period (up to around 1800).<ref>\"[http://thegreathistoryofarts.weebly.com/classical-era.html Classical Era (1750-1820)]\", ''TheGreatHistoryofArts.Weebly.com''. Accessed: 27 July 2017.</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}<!--Source emphasizes the rapid decline of continuo practice in the Classical Era, and does not say what sort of music might have proved most resistant to this discontinuance.--> An example is [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s Concerto in D minor for flute, strings and basso continuo. Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: [[mass (music)|mass]]es by [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]], for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Figured bass notation==\nA part notated with figured bass consists of a [[bass line]] notated with [[Musical note|note]]s on a [[musical staff]] plus added numbers and [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s (or in some cases [[Backslash|(back)slash]]es added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what [[interval (music)|interval]]s above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which [[Inverted chord|inversions]] of which chords are to be played.\n\nThe phrase ''[[tasto solo]]'' indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason ''tasto solo'' had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a [[root-position]] triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B{{music|natural}} in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a [[first inversion]] [[dominant chord]] (spelled B\u2013D\u2013G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).\n\nComposers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious. Early composers such as [[Claudio Monteverdi]] often specified the octave by the use of [[interval (music)|compound intervals]] such as 10, 11, and 15.\n\n===Numbers===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Common Conventional Symbols for Figured Bass\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: Silver\" |[[Triad (music)|Triads]]\n|-\n! align=\"center\" | Inversion\n! align=\"center\" | Intervals\nabove [[Bass note|bass]]\n! align=\"center\" | Symbol\n! align=\"center\" | Example\n|-\n|[[Root position]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{su|p=5|b=3}}\n| align=\"center\" | None\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |<score lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n     \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c' {\n                \\clef treble \\time 3/4\n                <e g c>4 <c g' c> <c e g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n           \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\time 3/4\n                c4 e g\n                }\n  \\figures {\n    < _ >4 <6> <6 4>\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n|-\n|[[First inversion|1st inversion]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{su|p=6|b=3}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|6 chord}}\n|-\n|[[Second inversion|2nd inversion]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{su|p=6|b=4}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|64 chord}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: Silver\" |[[Seventh chord|Seventh chords]]\n|-\n! align=\"center\" | Inversion\n! align=\"center\" | Intervals\nabove bass\n! align=\"center\" | Symbol\n! align=\"center\" | Example\n|-\n|Root position\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|7|{{SubSup||3|5}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|7 chord}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |<score lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n     \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c' {\n                \\clef treble \\time 4/4\n                <b d f>4 <g d' f> <b f' g > <b d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n           \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\time 4/4\n                g4 b d f\n                }\n  \\figures {\n    <7>4 <6 5> <4 3> <4 2>\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n|-\n|1st inversion\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|6|{{SubSup||3|5}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|65 chord}}\n|-\n|2nd inversion\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|6|{{SubSup||3|4}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|43 chord}}\n|-\n|[[Third inversion|3rd inversion]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|6|{{SubSup||2|4}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|42 chord}} or {{music|2 chord}}\n|}\n\nContemporary figured bass abbreviations for triads and seventh chords are shown in the table to the right.\n\nThe numbers indicate the number of [[Scale (music)|scale]] steps above the given bass-line that a note should be played.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/courses/MU182A/upload/Figured-Bass-Notation.pdf|title=Figured Bass Notation|last=Vigil|first=R|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref> For example:\n\n:<score>{ \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\time 6/4 \\clef bass << { c1 } \\figures { < 6 4 >1 } >> }</score>\n\nHere, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above it should be played, that is an F and an A.

From the figured bass-writer's perspective, this bass note is obviously a [[third inversion]] [[seventh chord]], so the [[sixth interval]] is viewed as an interval that the player should automatically infer. In many cases entire figures can be left out, usually where the chord is obvious from the [[chord progression|progression]] or the melody.\n\nSometimes the chord changes but the bass note itself is held.

Bach]] (BWV 443). {{audio|Figured bass.mid|Play}}]]{{clear}}\n\n== History ==\n\nImprovised organ accompaniments for choral works were common by the late 16th century, and separate organ parts showing only a bass line date back to at least 1587.  In the mid-16th century, some Italian church composers began to write [[polychoral]] works. These pieces, for two or more [[choir]]s, were created in recognition of particularly festive occasions, or else to take advantage of certain architectural properties of the buildings in which they were performed which created natural [[reverberation]]. With eight or more [[polyphony|polyphonic]] voice parts to keep track of in performance, works in polychoral style required some sort of instrumental [[accompaniment]]. They were also known as ''cori spezzati'', since the choirs were structured in musically independent or interlocking parts, and may sometimes also have been placed in physically different locations.\n\nThe concept of allowing two or more concurrently performing choirs to be independent structurally would probably not have arisen had there not been an already existing practice of choral accompaniment in church.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Financial and administrative records indicate the presence of organs in churches dates back to the 15th century, although their precise use is not known. Many first-person accounts of church services from the 15th and 16th centuries imply organ accompaniment in some portions of the liturgy, as well as indicating that the [[a cappella|unaccompanied]] practice of the ''[[Sistine Chapel Choir|Cappella Sistina]]'' was somewhat unusual. By early in the 16th century, it seems that accompaniment by organ at least in smaller churches was commonplace, and commentators of the time lamented on occasion the declining quality of church choirs. Even more tellingly, many manuscripts, especially from the middle of the century and later, feature written-out organ accompaniments. It is this last observation which leads directly to the foundations of continuo practice, in a somewhat similar one called ''basso seguente'' or \"following bass\".\n\nWritten-out accompaniments are found most often in early polychoral works (those composed, obviously, before the onset of [[concertato|concerted]] style and its explicit instrumental lines), and generally consist of a complete reduction (to what would later be called the \"grand staff\") of one choir\u2019s parts.  In addition to this, however, for those parts of the music during which that choir rested was presented a single line consisting of the lowest note being sung at any given time, which could be in any vocal part.  Even in early concerted works by the Gabrielis ([[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]]), [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and others, the lowest part, that which modern performers colloquially call \"continuo\", is actually a \"basso seguente\", though slightly different, since with separate instrumental parts, the lowest note of the moment in the instrumental parts is often lower than any being sung.\n\nThe first known published instance of a basso seguente was a book of [[Introit]]s and [[Alleluia]]s by the Venetian [[Placido Falconio]] from 1575. What is known as \"figured\" continuo, which also features a bass line that because of its structural nature may differ from the lowest note in the upper parts, developed over the next quarter-century. The composer [[Lodovico Grossi da Viadana|Lodovico Viadana]] is often credited with the first publication of such a continuo, in a 1602 collection of motets that according to his own account had been originally written in 1594. Viadana\u2019s continuo, however, did not include figures. The earliest extant part with sharp and flat signs above the staff is a [[motet]] by [[Giovanni Croce]], also from 1594.\n\nFollowing and figured basses developed concurrently in secular music; such [[madrigal]] (a song style) composers as [[Emilio de' Cavalieri]] and [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] began in the late 16th century to write works explicitly for a soloist with accompaniment, following an already standing practice of performing multi-voice madrigals this way, and also responding to the rising influence at certain aristocratic courts of featuring popular individual singers.  This tendency toward solo-with-accompaniment texture in [[secular vocal music]] (non-religious music) culminated in the genre of [[monody]], just as in sacred vocal music it resulted in the [[sacred concerto]] for various forces including few voices and even solo voices. The use of numerals to indicate accompanying sonorities in accompaniment parts began with the earliest [[opera]]s, composed by Cavalieri and [[Giulio Caccini]].\n\nThese new genres, just as the polychoral one probably was, were indeed made possible by the existence of a semi- or fully independent bass line.  In turn, the separate bass line, with figures added above to indicate other chordal notes, shortly became \"[[Functional harmony|functional]],\" as the sonorities became \"harmonies,\" (see [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]), and music came to be seen in terms of a melody supported by [[chord progression]]s ([[homophony]]), rather than interlocking, equally important lines that are used in [[polyphony]].  The figured bass, therefore, was integral to the development of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], by extension the [[Classical music era|\u201dclassical\u201d]] style, which built on the innovations of the Baroque era, and by further extension most subsequent musical styles.\n\nAs part of the new [[Classical period (music)#The Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730\u20131760|galant]] style in the mid-18th century, with its emphasis on lighter and more varied textures, and singable melodies, orchestral music gradually phased out the basso continuo, and solo-with-accompaniment textures increasingly featured fully written-out accompaniments. By the second half of the 18th century, figured bass was almost entirely eliminated, except in sacred choral music, where it lingered until well after 1800: Beethoven's [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] (1807), for example, has a figured bass part.\n\nMany composers and theorists of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries wrote \"how-to guides\" for chord-playing musicians, to aid them in realizing figured bass notation, including [[Gregor Aichinger]], [[Filippo Bonaffino]], [[Friedrich Erhard Niedt]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]], and [[Michael Praetorius]].\n\n==Contemporary uses==\nIn the 20th and 21st century, figured bass is also sometimes used by [[classical music]]ians as a shorthand way of indicating chords when a [[composer]] is sketching out ideas for a new piece or when a music student is [[Harmonic analysis|analyzing the harmony]] of a notated piece of music (e.g., a Bach chorale or a Chopin piano prelude). Figured bass is not generally used in modern musical compositions, except for neo-Baroque pieces.  A form of figured bass is used in notation of [[accordion]] music; another simplified form is used to notate [[guitar chord]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the 2000s, outside of professional [[Baroque ensemble]]s that specialize in the [[performance practice]] of the Baroque era, the most common use of figured bass notation is to indicate the [[inversion (music)|inversion]] in a harmonic analysis or composer's sketch context, however, often without the staff notation, using letter note names followed with the figure. For instance, if a piano piece had a C major triad in the right hand (C\u2013E\u2013G), with the bass note a G with the left hand, this would be a [[second inversion]] C major chord, which would be written C{{su|b=4|p=6}}. If this same C major triad had an E in the bass, it would be a [[first inversion]] chord, which would be written C{{su|b=3|p=6}} or C<sup>6</sup> (this is different from the [[jazz]] notation, where a C<sup>6</sup> means the [[major sixth]] chord C\u2013E\u2013G\u2013A, i.e., a C major with an added 6th degree). The symbols can also be used with Roman numerals in analyzing [[diatonic functionality|functional harmony]], a usage called ''figured Roman''; see [[chord symbol]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unfigured bass]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*Schick, Kyle (2012) \"Improvisation: Performer as Co-composer,\" Musical Offerings: Vol. 3: No. 1, Article 3.

This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.\n\nThe pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] [[France]].<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013324</ref> Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.<ref>Braudel, 313\u2013315</ref>\n\n[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice.

The \"Spanish style\" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013321</ref>\n\nThough different  textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,<ref>Thornton, Peter.

The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry.

A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.\n\nModern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a wide number of choices available in the selection of their clothes.

The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474</ref> and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\nThe fashion industry consists of four levels:\n\n# the production of raw materials, principally fibers and textiles but also leather and fur.\n# the production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.\n# [[retail sale]]s\n# various forms of advertising and promotion\n\nThese levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors are Textile Design and Production, [[Fashion Design]] and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising, [[Fashion Show]]s, and Media and Marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296476/Fashion-design-and-manufacturing, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296477/Fashion-retailing-marketing-and-merchandising, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296479/Media-and-marketing</ref>\n\n== Fashion trend ==\n{{main|Fashion trend|2010s in fashion}}\nFashion trends are influenced by several factors including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, political, economical, social and technological. Examining these factors is called a [[PEST analysis]]. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine growth or decline of a particular trend. Fashion trends change daily, it can not stay unchanged\n\n=== Political influences ===\n[[File:Shinz\u014d Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to US President and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzo Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]\n\nNot only did political events make a huge impact on fashion trends but also the political figure played a critical role in forecasting the fashion trend. For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress or a soft color Cassini coat with huge buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s the economy had become wealthier, divorce rate was increasing and government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring miniskirt has become a major fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.\n\nMoreover, political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trend. For instance, during Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie and it is still affecting current fashion trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political & Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Technology influences ===\n\nTechnology plays a large role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.\n\nDevelopments such as wearable technology have become an important trend in fashion and will continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and [[E-textiles|smart fabrics]] that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apparel.edgl.com/news/Top-6-Tech-Trends-in-the-Fashion-Industry94135|title=Top 6 Tech Trends in the Fashion Industry|last=Communications|first=Edgell|website=apparel.edgl.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nThe fashion industry is seeing how [[3D printing]] technology has influenced designers such as [[Iris van Herpen|Iris Van Herpen]] and [[Kimberly Ovitz]]. These designers have been heavily experimenting and developing 3D printed couture pieces. As the technology grows, the 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually consumers, which could potentially shape the fashion industry entirely.\n\nInternet technology such as online retailers and social media platforms have given way for trends to be identified, marketed and sold immediately.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487\u2013506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015}}</ref> Styles and trends are easily conveyed online to attract the trendsetters.

The industry can now see the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence street-chic outfits. The effects can now be quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, designers and consumers regarding trends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/541091/how-machine-vision-is-about-to-change-the-fashion-world/|title=How Machine Vision Is About to Change the Fashion World|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nMilitary technology has played an important role in the fashion industry. The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personal be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s and camouflage fabric was introduced to street wear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then. Camouflage started to appear in high fashion by the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com|title=Home : Berg Fashion Library|website=www.bergfashionlibrary.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> Designers such as Valentino, Dior and Dolce & Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections.\n\n=== Social influences ===\n[[File:Britney Europe.jpg|thumb|upright|Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have popularised the concept of wearing [[underwear as outerwear]].]]\n[[File:Gabriel Garko and Laura Torrisi - nicogenin - 66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) - The Road (3).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Red carpet fashion]]: Italian actors [[Gabriel Garko]] and [[Laura Torrisi]] wearing designer [[formal wear]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], 2009]]\n\nClothing is much more than fashion, it is a style of life an expression of ones self. Social media is one of the biggest platforms to exhibit and connect fashion trends with millions of people all at once worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/social-media-influences-fashion|title=Social Media Influences on Fashion|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Fashion trend goes beyond the aesthetic values, it emerges as an expressive tool for designers to deliver their message about the society. With the influence of social media, celebrities and bloggers, their voice are easily being heard and have impact on fashion and trend at any time.\nFashion and music are inseparable. [[Prabal Gurung]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/editorial/music-and-fashion|title=Music and Fashion|website=www.notjustalabel.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> highlighted the importance of music to his shows, saying \"each season we want to tell a story for 10 minutes\u2026. the perfect harmony between cloths and music allows this\". Music is a representation of fashion that expresses the abstract design concept into relatable harmony for viewers.\n\nFashion relates to social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music\u2026like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives.\" Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video \u2018Formation\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9, according to Carlos,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyonc\u00e9's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyonc\u00e9 catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once. Atop a New Orleans police car in a red-and-white Gucci high-collar dress and combat boots, she sits among the ruins of Hurricane Katrina, immediately implanting herself in the biggest national debate on police brutality and race relations in modern day.\"\n\nRunway show is a reflection of fashion trend and a designer's thought. For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway show is a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet.\" Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like \"Feminist but feminine\" and \"Ladies first.\" According to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\" /> \"The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour.\"\n\n=== Economic influences ===\n\n==== Circular economy ====\nAs we undergo a global economic downturn{{when|date=May 2018}}, the \"Spend now, think later\" belief is getting less relevant in our society.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&q=economy+trend+fashion&CID=A105052&PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society. They're looking for ways to mediate their material desires with an aim to do more good in the world. A linear economy is slowly shifting to a circular one.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company \"represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,\" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay \u20ac7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's \"Used Gear\" section.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== China's domestic spending ====\nConsumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes \u2014 easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.\n\n=== Consumers' needs ===\n[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A tourist couple wearing [[casual attire|casual]] clothes at [[Cumberland Island]], 2015]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Chinese model posing as CEO (6759428801).jpg  \n| image2 = LG\uc5d1\uc2a4\ub178\ud2b8 X300\u2019\uc758 CF \ub9e4\uc9c1(Magic)\ud3b8 (cropped).jpg  \n| footer = Models posing in [[Informal attire|corporate office wear]].\n}}\nConsumers all have different needs and demands that have to be suited. A person's needs change frequently.  An important factor to take into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs is the key demographics of the customer. Gender, age, income, and even profession can help a company better understand the needs of their customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs & Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a woman who is pregnant could be looking for diapers, baby strollers, and maternity clothes. Her needs would differ greatly from a woman with children that just went off to college or a teen entering high school.\n\nOften consumers need to be told what they want. Fashion companies have to do their research to ensure they know their customers' needs before developing solutions. Steve Jobs said, \"You\u2019ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You cannot start with the technology and try to figure out where you are going to sell it\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\nThe best way to understand the consumers' needs and therefore predict fashion trends is through [[market research]]. There are two research methods: primary and secondary.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups.\n\nBenefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\"/> Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.\n\nKnowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tanzturnier 28.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latin dance]]rs in their [[costume]]s.

For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.).

Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by [[Lucien Vogel]] and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show & Sale (32801142162).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[See-through clothing|see-through]] top worn along with [[pasties]] by a model at a [[fashion show]] in USA, 2017. Such [[fashion trend]]s get popularised through media.]]\n''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the \"fashionista on a budget\". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as \"blogger of the moment\" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.<ref>Fateh, Azhar. \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Fashion?\u201d The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.</ref>\n\nA few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. \"Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January\", she writes. \"Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.\"<ref>Tax, Genevieve.

A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201355 [42]}}</ref> According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nToday, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property==\nIn the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that \"Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.\n\nSince fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.<ref>[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]

Fourier analysis reveals the oscillatory components of signals and functions.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Fourier analysis''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u028ar|i|e\u026a|,_|-|i|\u0259r}})<ref>{{Dictionary.com|Fourier}}</ref> is the study of the way general [[function (mathematics)|functions]] may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler [[trigonometric functions]]. Fourier analysis grew from the study of [[Fourier series]], and is named after [[Joseph Fourier]], who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of [[heat transfer]].\n\nToday, the subject of Fourier analysis encompasses a vast spectrum of mathematics. In the sciences and engineering, the process of decomposing a function into oscillatory components is often called Fourier analysis, while the operation of rebuilding the function from these pieces is known as '''Fourier synthesis'''. For example, determining what component frequencies are present in a musical note would involve computing the Fourier transform of a sampled musical note. One could then re-synthesize the same sound by including the frequency components as revealed in the Fourier analysis. In mathematics, the term ''Fourier analysis'' often refers to the study of both operations.\n\nThe decomposition process itself is called a [[Fourier transformation]]. Its output, the Fourier transform, is often given a more specific name, which depends on the domain and other properties of the function being transformed. Moreover, the original concept of Fourier analysis has been extended over time to apply to more and more abstract and general situations, and the general field is often known as [[harmonic analysis]]. Each [[Transform (mathematics)|transform]] used for analysis (see [[list of Fourier-related transforms]]) has a corresponding [[inverse function|inverse]] transform that can be used for synthesis.\n\n==Applications==\nFourier analysis has many scientific applications \u2013 in [[physics]], [[partial differential equation]]s, [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[signal processing]], [[digital image processing]], [[probability theory]], [[statistics]], [[forensics]], [[option pricing]], [[cryptography]], [[numerical analysis]], [[acoustics]], [[oceanography]], [[sonar]], [[optics]], [[diffraction]], [[geometry]], [[protein]] structure analysis, and other areas.\n\nThis wide applicability stems from many useful properties of the transforms:\n* The transforms are [[linear operator]]s and, with proper normalization, are [[unitary operator|unitary]] as well (a property known as [[Parseval's theorem]] or, more generally, as the [[Plancherel theorem]], and most generally via [[Pontryagin duality]]) {{harv|Rudin|1990}}.\n* The transforms are usually invertible.\n* The [[exponential function]]s are [[eigenfunction]]s of [[derivative|differentiation]], which means that this representation transforms linear [[differential equation]]s with [[constant coefficients]] into ordinary algebraic ones {{harv|Evans|1998}}. Therefore, the behavior of a [[LTI system|linear time-invariant system]] can be analyzed at each frequency independently.\n* By the [[convolution theorem]], Fourier transforms turn the complicated [[convolution]] operation into simple multiplication, which means that they provide an efficient way to compute convolution-based operations such as [[polynomial]] multiplication and [[Multiplication algorithm#Fourier transform methods|multiplying large numbers]] {{harv|Knuth|1997}}.\n* The [[Discrete Fourier transform|discrete]] version of the Fourier transform (see below) can be evaluated quickly on computers using [[Fast Fourier Transform]] (FFT) algorithms. {{harv|Conte|de Boor|1980}}\n\nIn forensics, laboratory infrared spectrophotometers use Fourier transform analysis for measuring the wavelengths of light at which a material will absorb in the infrared spectrum. The FT method is used to decode the measured signals and record the wavelength data. And by using a computer, these Fourier calculations are rapidly carried out, so that in a matter of seconds, a computer-operated FT-IR instrument can produce an infrared absorption pattern comparable to that of a prism instrument.<ref>{{cite book | last =Saferstein | first =Richard | title =Criminalistics: An Introduction to Forensic Science | date =2013}}</ref>\n\nFourier transformation is also useful as a compact representation of a signal. For example, [[JPEG]] compression uses a variant of the Fourier transformation ([[discrete cosine transform]]) of small square pieces of a digital image. The Fourier components of each square are rounded to lower [[precision (arithmetic)|arithmetic precision]], and weak components are eliminated entirely, so that the remaining components can be stored very compactly. In image reconstruction, each image square is reassembled from the preserved approximate Fourier-transformed components, which are then inverse-transformed to produce an approximation of the original image.\n\n===Applications in signal processing===\n\nWhen processing signals, such as [[Sound|audio]], [[radio wave]]s, light waves, [[seismic wave]]s, and even images, Fourier analysis can isolate narrowband components of a compound waveform, concentrating them for easier detection or removal. A large family of signal processing techniques consist of Fourier-transforming a signal, manipulating the Fourier-transformed data in a simple way, and reversing the transformation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rabiner |first=Lawrence R. |last2=Gold |first2=Bernard |title=Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |date=1975}}</ref>\n\nSome examples include:\n* [[Equalization (audio)|Equalization]] of audio recordings with a series of [[bandpass filter]]s;\n* Digital radio reception without a [[superheterodyne]] circuit, as in a modern cell phone or [[radio scanner]];\n* [[Image processing]] to remove periodic or [[anisotropic]] artifacts such as [[jaggies]] from interlaced video, strip artifacts from [[strip aerial photography]], or wave patterns from [[radio frequency interference]] in a digital camera;\n* [[Cross correlation]] of similar images for co-alignment;\n* [[X-ray crystallography]] to reconstruct a crystal structure from its diffraction pattern;\n* [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometry to determine the mass of ions from the frequency of cyclotron motion in a magnetic field;\n* Many other forms of spectroscopy, including [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopies;\n* Generation of sound [[spectrogram]]s used to analyze sounds;\n* Passive [[sonar]] used to classify targets based on machinery noise.\n\n==Variants of Fourier analysis==\n[[File:Fourier transform, Fourier series, DTFT, DFT.gif|thumb|400px|A Fourier transform and 3 variations caused by periodic sampling (at interval T) and/or periodic summation (at interval P) of the underlying time-domain function. The relative computational ease of the DFT sequence and the insight it gives into {{math|''S''(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} make it a popular analysis tool.]]\n\n===(Continuous) Fourier transform===\n{{main|Fourier transform}}\n\nMost often, the unqualified term '''Fourier transform''' refers to the transform of functions of a continuous [[real number|real]] argument, and it produces a continuous function of frequency, known as a ''frequency distribution''. One function is transformed into another, and the operation is reversible. When the domain of the input (initial) function is time ({{mvar|t}}), and the domain of the output (final) function is [[frequency|ordinary frequency]], the transform of function {{math|''s''(''t'')}} at frequency {{mvar|f}} is given by the complex number:\n\n:<math>S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} s(t) \\cdot e^{- 2 i\\pi f t} \\, dt.</math>\n\nEvaluating this quantity for all values of {{mvar|f}} produces the ''frequency-domain'' function. Then {{math|''s''(''t'')}} can be represented as a recombination of [[complex exponentials]] of all possible frequencies:\n\n:<math>s(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} S(f) \\cdot e^{2 i\\pi f t} \\, df,</math>\n\nwhich is the inverse transform formula.

Thus, a convergent [[periodic summation]] in the frequency domain can be represented by a Fourier series, whose coefficients are samples of a related continuous time function:\n\n:<math>S_\\frac{1}{T}(f)\\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} S\\left(f - \\frac{k}{T}\\right) \\equiv \\overbrace{\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} s[n] \\cdot e^{-2 i\\pi f n T}}^{\\text{Fourier series (DTFT)}}}_{\\text{Poisson summation formula}} = \\mathcal{F} \\left \\{ \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} s[n]\\ \\delta(t-nT)\\right \\},\\,</math>\n\nwhich is known as the DTFT. Thus the '''DTFT''' of the {{math|''s''[''n'']}} sequence is also the '''Fourier transform''' of the modulated [[Dirac comb]] function.<ref group=\"note\">We may also note that:\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} T\\cdot s(nT) \\delta(t-nT) &= \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} T\\cdot s(t) \\delta(t-nT) \\\\ &= s(t)\\cdot T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\delta(t-nT). \\end{align}</math>\nConsequently, a common practice is to model \"sampling\" as a multiplication by the [[Dirac comb]] function, which of course is only \"possible\" in a purely mathematical sense.</ref>\n\nThe Fourier series coefficients (and inverse transform), are defined by:\n\n:<math>s[n]\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ T \\int_\\frac{1}{T} S_\\frac{1}{T}(f)\\cdot e^{2 i\\pi f nT} \\,df = T \\underbrace{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} S(f)\\cdot e^{2 i\\pi f nT} \\,df}_{\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\, s(nT)}.</math>\n\nParameter {{mvar|T}} corresponds to the sampling interval, and this Fourier series can now be recognized as a form of the [[Poisson summation formula]]. Thus we have the important result that when a discrete data sequence, {{math|''s''[''n'']}}, is proportional to samples of an underlying continuous function, {{math|''s''(''t'')}}, one can observe a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform, {{math|''S''(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}}. That is a cornerstone in the foundation of [[digital signal processing]]. Furthermore, under certain idealized conditions one can theoretically recover {{math|''S''(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} and {{math|''s''(''t'')}} exactly. A sufficient condition for perfect recovery is that the non-zero portion of {{math|''S''(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} be confined to a known frequency interval of width {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}}}}. When that interval is {{math|[\u2212{{sfrac|1|2''T''}}, {{sfrac|1|2''T''}}]}}, the applicable reconstruction formula is the [[Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula]].\n\nAnother reason to be interested in {{math|''S''<sub>{{sfrac|1|''T''}}</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} is that it often provides insight into the amount of [[aliasing]] caused by the sampling process.\n\nApplications of the DTFT are not limited to sampled functions. See [[Discrete-time Fourier transform]] for more information on this and other topics, including:\n* normalized frequency units\n* windowing (finite-length sequences)\n* transform properties\n* tabulated transforms of specific functions\n\n===Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)===\n{{main|Discrete Fourier transform}}\n\nSimilar to a Fourier series, the DTFT of a periodic sequence, {{math|''s''<sub>''N''</sub>[''n'']}}, with period {{mvar|N}}, becomes a Dirac comb function, modulated by a sequence of complex coefficients (see [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Periodic data|DTFT/Periodic data]]):\n\n:<math>S[k] = \\sum_n s_N[n]\\cdot e^{-2 i\\pi \\frac{k}{N} n},</math> &nbsp; where {{math|\u2211<sub>''n''</sub>}} is the sum over any sequence of length {{mvar|N}}.\n\nThe {{math|''S''[''k'']}} sequence is what is customarily known as the '''DFT''' of {{math|''s''<sub>''N''</sub>}}.&nbsp; It is also {{mvar|N}}-periodic, so it is never necessary to compute more than {{mvar|N}} coefficients. The inverse transform is given by:\n\n:<math>s_N[n] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k} S[k]\\cdot e^{2 i\\pi \\frac{n}{N}k},</math> &nbsp; where {{math|\u2211<sub>''k''</sub>}} is the sum over any sequence of length {{mvar|N}}.\n\nWhen {{math|''s''<sub>''N''</sub>[''n'']}} is expressed as a [[periodic summation]] of another function:\n\n:<math>s_N[n]\\, \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\, \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} s[n-mN],</math> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <math>s[n]\\, \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\, s(nT),</math><ref group=\"note\">Note that this definition differs from the DTFT section by a factor of {{mvar|T}}.</ref>\n\nthe coefficients are proportional to samples of {{math|''S''<sub>{{sfrac|1|''T''}}</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}} at discrete intervals of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''P''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''NT''}}}}:\n\n:<math>S[k] = \\frac{1}{T}\\cdot S_\\frac{1}{T}\\left(\\frac{k}{P}\\right).</math><ref group=\"note\">\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\left(\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} s([n-mN]T)\\right) \\cdot e^{-2 i\\pi \\frac{k}{N} n} = \\underbrace{\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} s(nT) \\cdot e^{-2 i\\pi \\frac{k}{N} n}}_{\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\, \\frac{1}{T} S_\\frac{1}{T}\\left(\\frac{k}{NT}\\right)}</math>\n</ref>\n\nConversely, when one wants to compute an arbitrary number ({{mvar|N}}) of discrete samples of one cycle of a continuous DTFT, {{math|''S''<sub>{{sfrac|1|''T''}}</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}}, it can be done by computing the relatively simple DFT of {{math|''s''<sub>''N''</sub>[''n'']}}, as defined above. In most cases, {{mvar|N}} is chosen equal to the length of non-zero portion of {{math|''s''[''n'']}}. Increasing {{mvar|N}}, known as ''zero-padding'' or ''interpolation'', results in more closely spaced samples of one cycle of {{math|''S''<sub>{{sfrac|1|''T''}}</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;)}}. Decreasing {{mvar|N}}, causes overlap (adding) in the time-domain (analogous to [[aliasing]]), which corresponds to decimation in the frequency domain. (see [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]]) In most cases of practical interest, the {{math|''s''[''n'']}} sequence represents a longer sequence that was truncated by the application of a finite-length [[window function]] or [[FIR filter]] array.\n\nThe DFT can be computed using a [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm, which makes it a practical and important transformation on computers.\n\nSee [[Discrete Fourier transform]] for much more information, including:\n* transform properties\n* applications\n* tabulated transforms of specific functions\n\n===Summary===\nFor periodic functions, both the Fourier transform and the DTFT comprise only a discrete set of frequency components (Fourier series), and the transforms diverge at those frequencies. One common practice (not discussed above) is to handle that divergence via [[Dirac delta]] and [[Dirac comb]] functions. But the same spectral information can be discerned from just one cycle of the periodic function, since all the other cycles are identical. Similarly, finite-duration functions can be represented as a Fourier series, with no actual loss of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform is a mere artifact.\n\nWe also note that it is common in practice for the duration of ''s''(\u2022) to be limited to the period, {{mvar|P}} or {{mvar|N}}.&nbsp; But these formulas do not require that condition.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+ {{math|''s''(''t'')}} transforms (continuous-time)\n|-\n! !!

This treatment also allows a general formulation of the [[convolution theorem]], which relates Fourier transforms and [[convolution]]s.

These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the [[short-time Fourier transform]], the [[Gabor transform]] or [[fractional Fourier transform]] (FRFT), or can use different functions to represent signals, as in [[wavelet transforms]] and [[chirplet transform]]s, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the [[continuous wavelet transform]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Fourier series#Historical development}}\n\nA primitive form of harmonic series dates back to ancient [[Babylonian mathematics]], where they were used to compute [[ephemerides]] (tables of astronomical positions).<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Evolution of Applied Harmonic Analysis: Models of the Real World\n|first=Elena\n|last=Prestini\n|date=2004\n|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user\n|isbn=978-0-8176-4125-2\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fye--TBu4T0C&pg=PA62\n|page=62}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Indiscrete Thoughts\n|first1=Gian-Carlo\n|last1=Rota\n|first2=Fabrizio\n|last2=Palombi\n|authorlink=Gian-Carlo Rota\n|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user\n|year=1997\n|isbn=978-0-8176-3866-5\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5smrEExNFUC&pg=PA11\n|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| edition = 2nd | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E.

That is, it takes a function from the time domain into the [[frequency]] domain; it is a [[orthogonal system|decomposition]] of a function into [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] of different frequencies; in the case of a [[Fourier series]] or [[discrete Fourier transform]], the sinusoids are [[harmonic]]s of the fundamental frequency of the function being analyzed.\n\nWhen the function {{mvar|f}} is a function of time and represents a physical [[Signal (information theory)|signal]], the transform has a standard interpretation as the frequency spectrum of the signal. The [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the resulting complex-valued function {{mvar|F}} at frequency {{mvar|\u03c9}} represents the [[amplitude]] of a frequency component whose [[phase (waves)|initial phase]] is given by the phase of&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}.\n\nFourier transforms are not limited to functions of time, and temporal frequencies. They can equally be applied to analyze ''spatial'' frequencies, and indeed for nearly any function domain.

It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being [[Little Boy]], and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] using [[plutonium]] from the [[Hanford Site]], and it was dropped from the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' piloted by Major [[Charles Sweeney]].\n \nThe name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape; it was also known as the Mark III. Fat Man was an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] less than a month earlier on 16 July at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] in New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946, and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.\n\n==Early decisions==\n\n[[Robert Oppenheimer]] held conferences in Chicago in June 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research, and in Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. They chose a gun-type design in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by firing a \"bullet\" into a \"target\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201344}} [[Richard C. Tolman]] suggested an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]], but the idea attracted scant consideration.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}}\n\nThe feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. [[Wallace Akers]], the director of the British \"[[Tube Alloys]]\" project, told [[James Bryant Conant]] on 14 November that [[James Chadwick]] had \"concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities.\"{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=64}} Conant consulted [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Arthur Compton]], who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem, but they could offer no ready solution. Conant informed Manhattan Project director Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer, and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nOppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to the gun-type weapon,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}} but he created the E-5 Group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] under [[Seth Neddermeyer]] to investigate implosion as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=87}}\n\n==Naming==\nThe gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed \"[[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]\" and \"Fat Man\" respectively. These code names were created by [[Robert Serber]], a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man was a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] detective novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'' and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]]. The Fat Man was round and fat and was named after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. [[Little Boy]] came last as a variation of Thin Man.{{sfn|Serber|Crease|1998|p=104}}\n\n==Development==\n \nNeddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman's initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by [[Hugh Bradner]], [[Charles Critchfield]], and John Streib. [[L.T.E. Thompson|L. T. E. Thompson]] was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and [[Edwin McMillan]] to visit the [[National Defense Research Committee]]'s Explosives Research Laboratory near the [[Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines|laboratories]] of the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]] in [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb), where they spoke to [[George Kistiakowsky]] and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was the only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=86\u201390}}\n[[File:AirForceMuseum FatManReplica.jpg|300px|thumb|left|alt=Fat Man Replica|Replica mockup displayed in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|Wright-Patterson Air Force Museum]], beside the ''[[Bockscar]]'' B-29 that dropped the original device \u2013 black liquid asphalt sealant was sprayed over the original bomb casing's seams, simulated on the mockup.]]\n\nOppenheimer brought [[John von Neumann]] to Los Alamos in September 1943 to take a fresh look at implosion. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with [[Edward Teller]], von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in [[shaped charge]]s to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of [[fissile]] material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}} The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the [[Earth's core]] with [[George Gamow]].{{sfn|Teller|2001|pp=174\u2013176}} The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and [[Hans Bethe]], but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}}\n \nThe implosion project remained a backup until April 1944, when experiments by [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced [[plutonium]] from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Clinton Engineer Works|Oak Ridge]] and the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford site]] showed that it contained impurities in the form of the [[isotope]] [[plutonium-240]]. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than [[plutonium-239]]. The [[cyclotron]]-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would [[predetonation|predetonate]] and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}} The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}}\n[[File:X-Ray-Image-HE-Lens-Test-Shot.gif|thumb|right|Flash X-Ray images of the converging shock waves formed during a test of the high-explosive lens system.]]\n\nThe impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the [[Manhattan Project]] was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research focused on the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}} The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional [[explosive lens]]es came from [[James L. Tuck]], and was developed by von Neumann.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=163}} To overcome the difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Lawrence H. Johnston|Lawrence Johnston]] invented [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s to replace the less precise [[primacord]] detonation system.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=163}} [[Robert Christy]] is credited with doing the calculations that showed how a solid subcritical sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state, greatly simplifying the task, since earlier efforts had attempted the more-difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=270\u2013271}} After Christy's report, the solid-plutonium core weapon was referred to as the \"[[pit (nuclear weapon)#Christy pits|Christy Gadget]]\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=293, 307\u2013308}}\n \nThe task of the [[metallurgist]]s was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple [[allotropes of plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=244\u2013245}} The brittle \u03b1 phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic \u03b2 phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable \u03b4 phase that normally exists in the {{convert|300|-|450|\u00b0C|F|round=5}} range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium\u2013gallium alloy]], which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.{{sfn|Baker|Hecker|Harbur|1983|pp=144\u2013145}}\n[[File:Fat Man test unit being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A [[pumpkin bomb]] (Fat Man test unit) being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29 for bombing practice during the weeks before the attack on Nagasaki.]]\n\nThe size of the bomb was constrained by the available aircraft. The only Allied aircraft capable of carrying the Fat Man were the British [[Avro Lancaster]] and the American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. For logistic and nationalistic reasons, the B-29 was preferred, but this constrained the bomb to a maximum length of {{convert|11|ft}}, width of {{convert|5|ft}} and weight of {{convert|20000|lb}}. Removing the bomb rails allowed a maximum width of {{convert|5.5|ft}}.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=119\u2013120}} Drop tests began in March 1944, and resulted in modifications to the [[Silverplate]] aircraft due to the weight of the bomb.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=8\u201310}} High-speed photographs revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a \"California Parachute\", a cubical open-rear tail box outer surface with eight radial fins inside of it, four angled at 45\u00b0 and four perpendicular to the line of fall holding the outer square-fin box to the bomb's rear end, was approved.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380\u2013383}} In drop tests in early weeks, the Fat Man missed its target by an average of {{convert|1,857|ft|m|0}}, but this was halved by June as the bombardiers became more proficient with it.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=131}}\n\nThe early Y-1222 model Fat Man was assembled with some 1,500 bolts.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=52}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=121}} This was superseded by the Y-1291 design in December 1944. This redesign work was substantial, and only the Y-1222 tail design was retained.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=121}} Later versions included the Y-1560, which had 72 detonators; the Y-1561, which had 32; and the Y-1562, which had 132. There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no detonators at all.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=127}} The final wartime Y-1561 design was assembled with just 90 bolts.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=52}}\n\nOn 16 July 1945, a Y-1561 model Fat Man, known as the Gadget, was detonated in a [[nuclear weapons testing|test explosion]] at a remote site in [[New Mexico]], known as the \"[[Trinity test|Trinity]]\" test. It gave a yield of about {{convert|20|kt(TNT)}}.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=465,514\u2013517}} Some minor changes were made to the design as a result of the Trinity test.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=377}} [[Philip Morrison]] recalled that \"There were some changes of importance...

''Bockscar'' was flown by Major [[Charles W. Sweeney]] and his crew, with Commander [[Frederick L. Ashworth]] from Project Alberta as the weaponeer in charge of the bomb.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=32}}\n\n''Bockscar'' lifted off at 03:47 on the morning of 9 August 1945, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The weapon was already armed, but with the green electrical safety plugs still engaged. Ashworth changed them to red after ten minutes so that Sweeney could climb to {{convert|17000|ft}} in order to get above storm clouds.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=740}} During pre-flight inspection of ''Bockscar'', the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use {{convert|640|USgal|l}} of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Colonel [[Paul Tibbets]] and Sweeney therefore elected to have ''Bockscar'' continue the mission.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=204\u2013205}}\n[[File:Nagasaki 1945 - Before and after (adjusted).jpg|thumb|right|Effects of the Fat Man's detonation on Nagasaki]]\n\nThe original target for the bomb was the city of [[Kokura]], but it was found to be obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby [[Yahata, Fukuoka|Yahata]] the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yahata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close; Second Lieutenant [[Jacob Beser]] was monitoring Japanese communications, and he reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=179, 213\u2013215}} \n\nSweeney then proceeded to the alternative target of Nagasaki. It was obscured by cloud, as well, and Ashworth ordered Sweeney to make a radar approach. At the last minute, however, bombardier{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=740}} Captain [[Kermit K. Beahan]]{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=32}} found a hole in the clouds. The Fat Man was dropped and exploded at 11:02 local time, following a 43-second free-fall at an altitude of about {{convert|1,650|ft}}.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=740}} There was poor visibility due to cloud cover and the bomb missed its intended detonation point by almost two miles, so damage was somewhat less extensive than that in [[Hiroshima]].\n\nAn estimated 35,000\u201340,000 people were killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000\u201380,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims.<ref>[http://k1project.org/explore-health/hiroshima-and-nagasaki-the-long-term-health-effects Columbia universcity center for nuclear studies: Hiroshima and Nagasaki: The Long Term Health Effects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723042220/http://k1project.org/explore-health/hiroshima-and-nagasaki-the-long-term-health-effects |date=23 July 2015 }}, updated 7/3/2014</ref> Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=723\u2013725}} Most of the direct deaths and injuries were among munitions or industrial workers.<ref name=\"HOG\">{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers & Artists Against Nuclear Energy & Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22\u201329 |date=1 May 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}</ref> Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city was also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would have required a year to get back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the arms plant would have required 15 months to return to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity.

The first was known as ''Gilda'' after [[Rita Hayworth]]'s character in the 1946 movie [[Gilda]], and it was dropped by the B-29 ''[[Big Stink (B-29)|Dave's Dream]]''; it missed its aim point by {{convert|710|yd}}. The second bomb was nicknamed ''Helen of Bikini'' and was placed without its tail fin assembly in a steel caisson made from a submarine's conning tower; it was detonated {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} beneath the landing craft ''[[USS LSM-60]]''. The two weapons yielded about {{convert|23|kt(TNT)}} each.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nThe Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces had already commenced work on improving the design. The [[North American B-45 Tornado]], [[Convair XB-46]], [[Martin XB-48]], and [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] bombers had bomb bays sized to carry the [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]], which was much longer but not as wide as the Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the [[Convair B-36]]. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs, but there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies at the time. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design to make it easier to manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime [[Project W-47]] was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=137\u2013142}}\n\nThe Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man was ordered into production in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of [[Project Camel]], and a new plant was established at the [[Iowa Army Ammunition Plant]]. Mechanical components were made or procured by the [[Rock Island Arsenal]]; electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions known as Mods 1 and 2 which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=142\u2013145}} Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}} when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=143}} The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=150}}\n\nA nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s due to the limitations of the Mark III Fat Man. The lead-acid batteries which powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] had only three teams in June 1948. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at [[Walker Air Force Base]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. They would first have to fly to [[Sandia Base]] to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=147\u2013149}}\n\nThe Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon was based closely on Fat Man's design thanks to spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]], who provided them with secret information concerning the Manhattan Project and Fat Man. It was detonated on 29 August 1949 as part of [[RDS-1|Operation \"First Lightning\"]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holloway |first1=David |year=1993 |title=Soviet Scientists Speak Out |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=18\u201319 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQwAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html#nfaq8.1.1 |title=Section 8.1.1 The Design of Gadget, Fat Man, and \"Joe 1\" (RDS-1)|first=Carey|last=Sublette |date=3 July 2007 |work=Nuclear Weapons FAQ |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Richard D. |last2=Hecker |first2=Siegfried S. |last3=Harbur |first3=Delbert R.|title=Plutonium: A Wartime Nightmare but a Metallurgist's Dream |url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?07-16.pdf |journal=[[Los Alamos Science]] |issue=Winter/Spring |year=1983 |pages=142\u2013151 |accessdate=22 November 2010|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Richard H. |year=2005 |title=The Silverplate Bombers: A History and Registry of the Enola Gay and Other B-29s Configured to Carry Atomic Bombs |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn= 978-0-7864-2139-8 |oclc=58554961 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Coster-Mullen |first=John |title=Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |publisher=J.

It includes the most significant amendments to the FCA since the 1986 amendments.  FERA enacted the following changes:\n\n# Expanded the scope of potential FCA liability by eliminating the \"presentment\" requirement (effectively overruling the Supreme Court's opinion in ''[[Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders]]'', 128 S. Ct. 2123 (2008));\n# Redefined \"claim\" under the FCA to mean \"any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise for money or property and whether or not the United States has title to the money or property\" that is (1) presented directly to the United States, or (2) \"to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient, if the money or property is to be spent or used on the Government's behalf or to advance a Government program or interest\" and the government provides or reimburses any portion of the requested funds;\n# Amended the FCA's intent requirement, and now requiring only that a false statement be \"material to\" a false claim;\n# Expanded conspiracy liability for any violation of the provisions of the FCA;\n# Amended the \"reverse false claims\" provisions to expand liability to \"knowingly and improperly avoid[ing] or decreas[ing] an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government;\"\n# Increased protection for qui tam plaintiffs/relators beyond employees, to include contractors and agents;\n# Procedurally, the government's complaint will now relate back to the qui tam plaintiff/relator's filing;\n# Provided that whenever a state or local government is named as a co-plaintiff in an action, the government or the relator \"shall not [be] preclude[d]... from serving the complaint, any other pleadings, or the written disclosure of substantially all material evidence;\"\n# Increased the [[Attorney General]]'s power to delegate authority to conduct Civil Investigative Demands prior to intervening in an FCA action.\n\nWith this revision, the FCA now prohibits knowingly (changes are in bold):\n\n# Submitting for payment or reimbursement a claim known to be false or fraudulent.\n# Making or using a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to an \u2018obligation\u2019 to pay money to the government.\n# Engaging in a conspiracy to defraud by the improper submission of a false claim.\n# Concealing, improperly avoiding or decreasing an \u2018obligation\u2019 to pay money to the government.\n\n== 2010 changes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ==\n\nOn March 23, 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also referred to as the health reform bill or PPACA) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]].  The Affordable Care Act made further amendments to the False Claims Act, including:\n\n# '''Changes to the Public Disclosure Bar.''' Under the previous version of the FCA, cases filed by private individuals or \"relators\" could be barred if it was determined that such cases were based on a public disclosure of information arising from certain proceedings, such as civil, criminal or administrative hearings, or news media reports.  As a result, defendants frequently used the public disclosure bar as a defense to a plaintiff's claims and grounds for dismissal of the same. PPACA amended the language of the FCA to allow the federal government to have the final word on whether a court may dismiss a case based on a public disclosure.  The language now provides that \"the court shall dismiss an action unless opposed by the Government, if substantially the same allegations or transaction alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed.\"  ''See'' 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A).\n# '''Original Source Requirement'''. A plaintiff may overcome the public disclosure bar outlined above if they qualify as an \"original source,\" the definition of which has also been revised by PPACA.  Previously, an original source must have had \"direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.\"  Under PPACA, an original source is now someone who has \"knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.\" See 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(B).\n# '''Overpayments'''. FERA redefined \"obligation\" under the FCA to include \"retention of any overpayments.\"  Accordingly, such language imposed FCA liability on any provider who received Medicare/Medicaid overpayments (accidentally or otherwise) and fails to return the money to the government.  However, FERA also raised questions as to what exactly is involved in the \"retention of overpayments\" \u2013 for example, how long a provider had to return monies after discovering an overpayment.  PPACA clarified the changes to the FCA made by FERA.  Under PPACA, overpayments under Medicare and Medicaid must be reported and returned within 60 days of discovery, or the date a corresponding hospital report is due.  Failure to timely report and return an overpayment exposes a provider to liability under the FCA.\n# '''Statutory Anti-Kickback Liability'''. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b) (AKS) is a criminal statute which makes it improper for anyone to solicit, receive, offer or pay remuneration (monetary or otherwise) in exchange for referring patients to receive certain services that are paid for by the government.  Previously, many courts had interpreted the FCA to mean that claims submitted as a result of AKS violations were false claims and therefore gave rise to FCA liability (in addition to AKS penalties).  However, although this was the \"majority rule\" among courts, there were always opportunities for courts to hold otherwise. Importantly, PPACA changed the language of the AKS to provide that claims submitted in violation of the AKS automatically constitute false claims for purposes of the FCA.  Further, the new language of the AKS provides that \"a person need not have actual knowledge \u2026 or specific intent to commit a violation\" of the AKS.  Accordingly, providers will not be able to successfully argue that they did not know they were violating the FCA because they were not aware the AKS existed.\n\n==Practical application of the law==\nThe False Claims Act has a detailed process for making a claim under the Act. Mere complaints to the government agency are insufficient to bring claims under the Act.  A complaint (lawsuit)\nmust be filed in [[U.S. District Court]] (federal court) in camera (under seal). After an investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] within 60 days, or frequently several months after an extension is granted, the Department of Justice decides whether it will pursue the case.\n\nIf the case is pursued, the amount of the reward is less than if the Department of Justice decides not to pursue the case and the plaintiff/relator continues the lawsuit himself.  However, the success rate is higher in cases that the Department of Justice decides to pursue.\n\nTechnically, the government has several options in handing cases.  These include: \n# intervene in one or more counts of the pending qui tam action. This intervention expresses the Government's intention to participate as a plaintiff in prosecuting that count of the complaint. Fewer than 25% of filed qui tam actions result in an intervention on any count by the Department of Justice.\n# decline to intervene in one or all counts of the pending qui tam action. If the United States declines to intervene, the relator may prosecute the action on behalf of the United States, but the United States is not a party to the proceedings apart from its right to any recovery. This option is frequently used by relators and their attorneys.\n# move to dismiss the relator's complaint, either because there is no case, or the case conflicts with significant statutory or policy interests of the United States.\n\nIn practice, there are two other options for the Department of Justice:\n# settle the pending qui tam action with the defendant prior to the intervention decision. This usually, but not always, results in a simultaneous intervention and settlement with the Department of Justice (and is included in the 25% intervention rate).\n# advise the relator that the Department of Justice intends to decline intervention.  <!-- Comment out newline to have article match the citation). -->This usually, but not always, results in dismissal of the qui tam action, according to the U.S. Attorneys' Office of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pae/Documents/fcaprocess2.pdf False Claims Act Cases: Government intervention in Qui Tam (whistleblower) suits \u2013 Memo of the U.S. Attorneys' Office of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania <!-- Note: much of the above is copied verbatim from the (PD-USGov) source. -->]</ref>\nThere is case law where claims may be prejudiced if disclosure of the alleged unlawful act has been reported in the press, if complaints were filed to an agency instead of filing a lawsuit, or if the person filing a claim under the act is not the first person to do so.  Individual states in the U.S. have different laws regarding whistleblowing involving state governments.\n\n===Federal income taxation of awards under FCA in the United States===\nThe U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) takes the position that, for Federal income tax purposes, ''qui tam'' payments to a relator under FCA are [[ordinary income]] and not [[capital gain]]s. The IRS position was challenged by a relator in the case of ''Alderson v. United States''<ref>686 F.3d 791 (9th Cir. 2012).,</ref> and, in 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the IRS' stance. As of 2013, this remained the only circuit court decision on tax treatment of these payments.<ref>Robert W. Wood and Dashiell C.

United States ex rel.

In ''Stevens'', the Supreme Court also endorsed the \"partial assignment\" approach to ''qui tam'' relator [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue, which had previously been articulated by the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals and is an exception to the general legal rule for standing.<ref name=Vermont/><ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1537749 Nathan D.

United States]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] considered several issues relating to the \"original source\" exception to the FCA's public-disclosure bar.  The Court held that (1) the original source requirement of the FCA provision setting for the original-source exception to the public-disclosure bar on federal-court jurisdiction is jurisdictional; (2) the statutory phrase \"information on which the allegations are based\" refers to the relator's allegations and not the publicly disclosed allegations; the terms \"allegations\" is not limited to the allegations in the original complaint, but includes, at a minimum, the allegations in the original complaint as amended; (3) relator's knowledge with respect to the pondcrete fell short of the direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based required for him to qualify as an original source; and (4) the government's intervention did not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction with respect to the relator.\n\nIn a 2008 case, ''[[Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] considered whether a false claim had to be presented directly to the Federal government, or if it merely needed to be paid with government money, such as a false claim by a [[subcontractor]] to a prime contractor.  The Court found that the claim need not be presented directly to the government, but that the false statement must be made with the intention that it will be relied upon by the government in paying, or approving payment of, a claim.<ref>Opinion of the Court, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-214.pdf Allison Engine Co. v.

[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-660.pdf]</ref> the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] considered whether, when the government declines to intervene or otherwise actively participate in a ''qui tam'' action under the False Claims Act, the United States is a \"party\" to the suit for purposes of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) (which requires that a notice of appeal in a federal civil action generally be filed within 30 days after entry of a judgment or order from which the appeal is taken).  The Court held that when the United States has declined to intervene in a privately initiated FCA action, it is not a \"party\" for FRAP 4 purposes, and therefore, petitioner's appeal filed after 30 days was untimely.\n\nIn a 2016 case, ''[[Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar]]'',<ref>Supreme Court Of The United States.  Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar.  Certiorari To The United States Court Of Appeals for the First Circuit No. 15\u20137. Argued April 19, 2016.

The group debuted in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d Nov. 1961), which helped to usher in a new level of realism in the [[mass media|medium]]. The Fantastic Four was the first superhero team created by editor/co-plotter [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.\n\nThe four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained [[superpower (ability)|superpowers]] after exposure to [[cosmic ray]]s during a scientific mission to outer space, are [[Mister Fantastic]] (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] (Susan \"Sue\" Storm; later \"Invisible Woman\"), who eventually married Reed, who can render herself invisible and later project powerful invisible force fields; the [[Human Torch]] (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; and the monstrous [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star and Reed's college roommate as well as a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability, and endurance due to the nature of his stone-like flesh.\n\nSince their original 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic book archetypes of the time, they would squabble and hold grudges both deep and petty and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. The team is also well known for its recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch [[Doctor Doom]], the planet-devouring [[Galactus]], the sea-dwelling prince [[Namor]], the spacefaring [[Silver Surfer]] and the shape-changing alien [[Skrull]]s.\n\nThe Fantastic Four have been adapted into [[mass media|other media]], including four [[animated series]] and four [[Fantastic Four in film|live-action films]].\n\n==Publication history==\n===Origins===\nApocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime [[magazine]] and [[comic book]] [[publishing|publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] was playing golf with either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of rival company [[DC Comics]], then known as National Periodical Publications, <!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says \"National Comics\" in quote directly below this paragraph--> and that the top executive bragged about DC's success with the new superhero team the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].<ref group=note>That DC all-star superhero team had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1960) before going on to its own hit title (issue #1 cover-dated Nov. 1960).</ref> While film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] has debunked the particulars of that story,<ref group=note>Uslan, in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43\u201344, writes: \"Irwin Donenfeld said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC's 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC ''owned'' Independent News). ... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. ... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth.\"</ref> Goodman, a publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, \"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called ''The'' {{sic}} ''Justice League of America'' and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... 'If the Justice League is selling', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'\"<ref name=\"Origins\">{{Cite book | last=Lee | first=Stan | authorlink=Stan Lee | title=Origins of Marvel Comics | publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books|Fireside Books]]<!--Book predates publisher's change to ampersand in corporate name--> | date=September 1974|location= New York, New York| isbn=978-0-671-21863-8}}</ref>{{Rp|16}}\n\nLee, who had served as editor-in-chief and art director of Marvel Comics and its predecessor companies, [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], for two decades, found that the medium had become creatively restrictive.

Kirby was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Marvel Comics regarding the return of his artwork, and his relationship with Lee had deteriorated, in part due to this dispute but also due to Lee's public statements through the years, which Kirby saw as diminishing his role. Groth states: \"Lee's contribution is a matter for endless speculation, but most observers and historians consider Kirby's claims here to be excessive.\"</ref> Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel's offices, and that Lee had merely added the dialogue after the story had been pencilled.<ref name=\"GG\"/>{{Rp|38}} Kirby also sought to establish, more credibly and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions.

He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny, so in issue #308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing's new girlfriend, [[Sharon Ventura]], and Johnny Storm's former love, Crystal. The changes increased readership through issue #321. At this point, Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic, ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'', that he disagreed with, and in protest he changed his byline to S.F.X. Englehart (S.F.X. is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects). In issue #326, Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made. This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book. He used the pseudonym John Harkness, which he had created years before for work he didn't want to be associated with.

The Silver Age stories were republished in 1974, along with some Golden Age Human Torch stories, in a short-lived ongoing ''Human Torch'' series.\n\nA later ongoing solo series in Marvel's [[manga]]-influenced Tsunami [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]], ''Human Torch'', ran 12 issues (June 2003 \u2013 June 2004), followed by the five-issue limited series ''Spider-Man/Human Torch'' (March\u2013July 2005), an untold tales [[team-up]] arc spanning the course of their friendship.\n\n===The Thing solo===\nThe Thing appeared in two team-up issues of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (#11\u201312, September\u2013November 1973).

Stan Lee's original synopsis described the crew's plan to fly to Mars, but Lee later shortly afterward wrote that due to \"the rate the Communists are progressing in space, maybe we better make this a flight to the STARS, instead of just to Mars, because by the time this mag goes on sale, the Russians may have already MADE a flight to Mars!\"<ref>Note reprinted in {{cite book|last = Lee|first = Stan|title = Marvel Firsts: The 1960s|chapter= Snopses\" [sic] The Fantsiuc [sic] Four July '61 Schedule (#)|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|pages = 484\u2013485 |isbn = 978-0785158646}}</ref>\n\nIn a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions, the Fantastic Four make no effort to maintain secret identities or, until issue #3, to wear superhero costumes, instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society.

The Fantastic Four are also playable characters in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'' and ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n\nThe Fantastic Four starred in their own virtual pinball game [[Pinball FX 2#Tables|Fantastic Four]] for [[Pinball FX 2]] released by [[Zen Studios]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/video_games/15748/download_the_marvel_pinball_fantastic_four_table |title=Download the Marvel Pinball Fantastic Four Table |date=April 27, 2011 |publisher=Marvel Comics |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6loBwfJba?url=http://marvel.com/news/video_games/15748/download_the_marvel_pinball_fantastic_four_table |archivedate=November 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |quote=Marvel Pinball is celebrating 50 years of the Fantastic Four with the addition of its newest table, which highlights the teamwork of Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Thing and the Human Torch! |accessdate=February 18, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Maximum Fantastic Four]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | title=The Science of Superheroes | last=Gresh | first=Lois H. | authorlink= |author2=Robert Weinberg |authorlink2=Robert Weinberg (author)  | year=2002 | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | isbn=0-471-02460-0 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TCv0LyEnzsUC&pg=PA21 21]\u201329 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCv0LyEnzsUC}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Comicbookdb|type=team|id=4|title=Fantastic Four}}\n* {{dmoz|Arts/Comics/Titles/F/Fantastic_Four|''Fantastic Four''}}\n* Archive of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071224050113/http://www.ffplaza.com/database/ FFPlaza.com Database] from the [http://www.ffplaza.com/database/ original page]\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{Fantastic Four in popular media}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{Inhumans}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n{{Doctor Doom}}\n{{Namor}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n{{Silver Surfer}}\n{{Skrull}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Thanos}}\n{{Galactus}}\n{{Avengers}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:American comics characters]]\n[[Category:American superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics adapted into television series]]\n[[Category:Comics adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Fantastic Four]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional explorers]]\n[[Category:Fictional families]]\n[[Category:Fictional quartets]]\n[[Category:Fiction about invisibility]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superhero teams]]", "sha1": "7dfcpuhr1qo8xirwpsj8g1wbn4sb6b7"}}, {"title": "Filtration", "ns": "0", "id": "11665", "revision": {"id": "861049191", "parentid": "861049152", "timestamp": "2018-09-24T19:46:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mythdon", "id": "6034478"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/82.14.213.43|82.14.213.43]] ([[User talk:82.14.213.43|talk]]) to last version by Samf4u", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|operation of solid-fluid separation|the mathematical concept|Filtration (mathematics)|the stochastic concept|Filtration (probability theory)|the equipment used|Filter (disambiguation)|filtration used in winemaking|Filtration (wine)}}\n{{refimprove|date=August 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:FilterDiagram.svg|right|thumb|300px|Diagram of simple filtration: oversize particles in the '''feed''' cannot pass through the lattice structure of the filter, while fluid and small particles pass through, becoming '''filtrate'''.]]\n'''Filtration''' is any of various mechanical, physical or biological operations that separate solids from fluids ([[liquid]]s or [[gas]]es) by adding a medium through which only the fluid can pass. The fluid that passes through is called the '''filtrate'''.<ref>Article on \"Water treatment solution: Filtration\", retrieved on 15 October 2013 from http://www.lenntech.com/chemistry/filtration.htm</ref> In physical '''filters''' oversize solids in the fluid are retained and in biological filters particulates are trapped and ingested and metabolites are retained and removed.  However, the separation is not complete; solids will be contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size, filter thickness and biological activity). Filtration occurs both in [[nature]] and in [[engineering|engineered]] systems; there are [[biology|biological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[industry|industrial]] forms. For example, in [[animal]]s (including [[human]]s), [[renal physiology#Filtration|renal filtration]] removes [[metabolic waste|wastes]] from the [[blood]], and in [[water treatment]] and [[sewage treatment]], undesirable constituents are removed by absorption into a biological film grown on or in the filter medium, as in [[slow sand filter|slow sand filtration]].\n\n==Applications==\n* Filtration is used to separate particles and fluid in a suspension, where the fluid can be a [[liquid]], a [[gas]] or a [[supercritical fluid]]. Depending on the application, either one or both of the components may be isolated.\n\n* Filtration, as a physical operation is very important in chemistry for the separation of materials of different chemical composition. A [[solvent]] is chosen which dissolves one component, while not dissolving the other. By dissolving the mixture in the chosen solvent, one component will go into the solution and pass through the filter, while the other will be retained. This is one of the most important techniques used by chemists to purify compounds.\n* Filtration is also important and widely used as one of the unit operations of [[chemical engineering]]. It may be simultaneously combined with other unit operations to process the feed stream, as in the [[biofilter]], which is a combined filter and biological digestion device.\n* Filtration differs from sieving, where separation occurs at a single perforated layer (a [[sieve]]). In sieving, particles that are too big to pass through the holes of the sieve are retained (see [[particle size distribution]]). In filtration, a multilayer lattice retains those particles that are unable to follow the tortuous channels of the filter.<ref>Lecture notes, Postgraduate course on Filtration and Size separation at the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Lougborough, England</ref> Oversize particles may form a [[Filter cake|cake]] layer on top of the filter and may also block the filter lattice, preventing the fluid phase from crossing the filter (blinding). Commercially, the term filter is applied to [[membrane]]s where the separation lattice is so thin that the surface becomes the main zone of particle separation, even though these products might be described as sieves.\n* Filtration differs from [[adsorption]], where it is not the physical size of particles that causes separation but the effects of [[surface charge]]. Some adsorption devices containing [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]] and [[ion exchange resin]] are commercially called filters, although filtration is not their principal function.\n* Filtration differs from removal of [[magnetic]] contaminants from fluids with [[Magnet#Common uses of magnets|magnets]] (typically [[lubrication]] oil, coolants and [[fuel oils]]), because there is no filter medium. Commercial devices called \u2018magnetic filters\u2019 are sold, but the name reflects their use, not their mode of operation.\n\n==Methods==\nThere are many different methods of filtration; all aim to attain the [[separation of mixtures|separation]] of substances. Separation is achieved by some form of interaction between the substance or objects to be removed and the filter. The substance that is to pass through the filter must be a [[fluid]], i.e. a [[liquid]] or [[gas]]. Methods of filtration vary depending on the location of the targeted material, i.e. whether it is dissolved in the fluid phase or suspended as a solid.\n\n[[File: Hot Filtration set up.jpg|thumb|Hot Filtration, solution contained in the Erlenmeyer flask is heated on a hot plate in order to prevent re-crystallization of solids in the flask itself]]\nThere are several filtration techniques depending on the desired outcome namely, hot, cold and [[Suction filtration|vacuum filtration]]. Some of the major purposes of getting the desired outcome are, for the removal of impurities from a mixture or, for the isolation of solids from a mixture.\n[[File: Hot FIltration.jpg|thumb|left|Hot Filtration for the separation of solids from a hot solution]]\n'''Hot filtration''' method is mainly used to separate solids from a hot solution. This is done in order to prevent crystal formation in the filter funnel and other apparatuses that comes in contact with the solution. As a result, the apparatus and the solution used are heated in order to prevent the rapid decrease in temperature which in turn, would lead to the crystallization of the solids in the funnel and hinder the filtration process.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Filtration Methods|url=http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/laboratory/filtration.pdf|publisher=University of Calgary |format=PDF |access-date= 4 June 2015|website = [[University of Calgary]]}}</ref>\nOne of the most important measures to prevent the formation of crystals in the funnel and to undergo effective hot filtration is the use stemless filter funnel. Due to the absence of stem in the filter funnel, there is a decrease in the surface area of contact between the solution and the stem of the filter funnel, hence preventing re-crystallization of solid in the funnel, adversely affecting filtration process.\n\n[[File: Cold Filtration.jpg|thumb|Cold Filtration, the ice bath is used to cool down the temperature of the solution before undergoing the filtration process]]\n'''Cold Filtration''' method is the use of ice bath in order to rapidly cool down the solution to be crystallized rather than leaving it out to cool it down slowly in the room temperature. This technique results to the formation of very small crystals as opposed to getting large crystals by cooling the solution down at room temperature.\n\n'''[[Suction filtration|Vacuum Filtration]]''' technique is most preferred for small batch of solution in order to quickly dry out small crystals. This method requires a [[B\u00fcchner funnel]], filter paper of smaller diameter than the funnel, [[B\u00fcchner flask]], and rubber tubing to connect to vacuum source.\n\n== Filter media ==\nTwo main types of filter media are employed in laboratories: a '''surface filter''', a solid sieve which traps the solid particles, with or without the aid of [[filter paper]] (e.g. [[B\u00fcchner funnel]], [[Belt filter]], [[Rotary vacuum-drum filter]], [[cross-flow filtration|Cross-flow filters]], [[Screen filter]]); and a '''[[depth filter]]''', a bed of granular material which retains the solid particles as it passes (e.g. [[sand filter]]). The first type allows the solid particles, i.e. the residue, to be collected intact; the second type does not permit this. However, the second type is less prone to clogging due to the greater surface area where the particles can be trapped. Also, when the solid particles are very fine, it is often cheaper and easier to discard the contaminated granules than to clean the solid sieve.\n\nFilter media can be cleaned by rinsing with solvents or detergents. Alternatively, in engineering applications, such as [[swimming pool]] water treatment plants, they may be cleaned by [[Backwashing (water treatment)|backwashing]]. Self-cleaning [[screen filter]]s utilize point-of-suction backwashing to clean the screen without interrupting system flow.\n\n===Achieving flow through the filter===\n\nFluids flow through a filter due to a difference in pressure\u2014fluid flows from the high-pressure side to the low-pressure side of the filter, leaving some material behind. The simplest method to achieve this is by gravity and can be seen in the [[coffee filter|coffeemaker]] example. In the laboratory, pressure in the form of compressed air on the feed side (or vacuum on the filtrate side) may be applied to make the filtration process faster, though this may lead to clogging or the passage of fine particles. Alternatively, the liquid may flow through the filter by the force exerted by a [[pump]], a method commonly used in industry when a reduced filtration time is important. In this case, the filter need not be mounted vertically.\n\n===Filter aid===\nCertain filter aids may be used to aid filtration. These are often incompressible [[diatomaceous earth]], or kieselguhr, which is composed primarily of [[silica]]. Also used are wood [[cellulose]] and other inert porous solids such as the cheaper and safer [[perlite]].\n\nThese filter aids can be used in two different ways. They can be used as a precoat before the [[slurry]] is filtered. This will prevent gelatinous-type solids from plugging the filter medium and also give a clearer filtrate. They can also be added to the slurry before filtration. This increases the [[porosity]] of the [[Filter cake|cake]] and reduces resistance of the cake during filtration. In a rotary filter, the filter aid may be applied as a precoat; subsequently, thin slices of this layer are sliced off with the cake.\n\nThe use of filter aids is usually limited to cases where the cake is discarded or where the [[precipitate]] can be chemically separated from the filter.\n\n==Alternatives==\nFiltration is a more efficient method for the [[separation of mixtures]] than [[decantation]], but is much more time consuming. If very small amounts of [[solution]] are involved, most of the solution may be soaked up by the filter medium.\n\nAn alternative to filtration is [[centrifugation]]\u2014instead of filtering the mixture of solid and liquid particles, the mixture is centrifuged to force the (usually) denser solid to the bottom, where it often forms a firm [[Filter cake|cake]]. The liquid above can then be decanted. This method is especially useful for separating solids which do not filter well, such as gelatinous or fine particles. These solids can clog or pass through the filter, respectively.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:FilterFunnelApparatus.png|right|thumb|240px|Filter flask (suction flask, with sintered glass filter containing sample). Note the almost colourless filtrate in the receiver flask.]]\nExamples of filtration include\n* The [[coffee filter]] to keep the coffee separate from the grounds.\n* [[HEPA]] filters in [[air conditioning]] to remove particles from air.\n* [[Belt filter]]s to extract [[precious metal]]s in [[mining]].\n* Horizontal plate filter, also known as [[Sparkler Filters|Sparkler]] filter.\n* Furnaces use filtration to prevent the furnace elements from fouling with particulates.\n* Pneumatic conveying systems often employ filtration to stop or slow the flow of material that is transported, through the use of a [[dust collector|baghouse]].\n* In the laboratory, a [[B\u00fcchner funnel]] is often used, with a [[filter paper]] serving as the porous barrier.\n* Air filters are commonly used to remove airborne particulate matter in building ventilation systems, combustion engines, and industrial processes.\n* [[Oil filter]] in automobiles, often as a canister or cartridge.\n* [[Filter (aquarium)|Aquarium filter]]\n\nAn experiment to prove the existence of [[Microorganism|microscopic organisms]] involves the comparison of water passed through unglazed [[porcelain]] and unfiltered water. When left in sealed containers the filtered water takes longer to go foul, demonstrating that very small items (such as [[bacterium|bacteria]]) can be removed from fluids by filtration.\n\nIn the [[kidney]], [[renal filtration]] is the filtration of [[blood]] in the [[glomerulus]], followed by selective reabsorption of many substances essential for the body to maintain homeostasis.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n* [[Separation process]]\n* [[:Category:Filters]]\n* [[Separation of mixtures]]\n* [[Microfiltration]]\n* [[Ultrafiltration]]\n* [[Nanofiltration]]\n* [[Reverse osmosis]]\n* [[Crossflow filtration]]\n* [[Sieve]]\n* [[Sieve analysis]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wiktionary|filtration}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Separation processes}}\n{{Wastewater}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Analytical chemistry]]\n[[Category:Laboratory techniques]]\n[[Category:Alchemical processes]]\n[[Category:filtration]]", "sha1": "15ay6419lxr0jytlna950fb8b0byssy"}}, {"title": "Follies", "ns": "0", "id": "11668", "revision": {"id": "866353581", "parentid": "864999610", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T20:51:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ewanchung", "id": "5386750"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Plot */ grammar", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses|Follies (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox Musical\n|image=Pfollies.jpeg\n|name=Follies\n|caption=Original Broadway poster\n|music=[[Stephen Sondheim]]\n|lyrics=[[Stephen Sondheim]]\n|book=[[James Goldman]]\n|basis=\n|productions= {{Plain list|\n* 1971 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]\n* 1972 [[Los Angeles]]\n* 1985 [[Lincoln Center]] concert\n* 1987 [[West End theatre|West End]]\n* 2001 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[revival (theatre)|revival]]\n* 2002 Los Angeles\n* 2002 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival\n* 2007 [[New York City Center]] concert\n* 2011 [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* 2011 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival\n* 2012 Los Angeles\n* 2012 [[Madrid]]\n* 2017 London revival\n}}\n|awards= {{Plain list|\n* 1971 - New York Drama Critics' Award for Best Musical\n* 1972 - [[Tony Award for Best Score]]\n* 1971 - [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Music\n* 1971 - [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Lyrics\n* 1987 - [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical|Laurence Olivier Award for Musical of the Year]]\n* 2012 - [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical]]\n* 2018 - [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival]]\n}}\n}}\n\n'''''Follies''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and a book by [[James Goldman]].  The story concerns a reunion in a crumbling [[Broadway theatre]], scheduled for demolition, of the past performers of the \"Weismann's Follies\", a musical [[revue]] (based on the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]''), that played in that theatre between the World Wars.  It focuses on two couples, Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone, who are attending the reunion. Sally and Phyllis were showgirls in the Follies. Both couples are deeply unhappy with their marriages.  Buddy, a traveling salesman, is having an affair with a girl on the road; Sally is still as much in love with Ben as she was years ago; and Ben is so self-absorbed that Phyllis feels emotionally abandoned.  Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, sometimes accompanied by the ghosts of their former selves. The musical numbers in the show have been interpreted as pastiches of the styles of the leading Broadway composers of the 1920s ands '30s, and sometimes as parodies of specific songs.\n\nThe [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on April 4, 1971, directed by [[Harold Prince]] and [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]], and with choreography by Bennett.  The musical was nominated for eleven [[Tony Award]]s and won seven.  The original production, the most costly performed on Broadway to that date,<ref>Hetrick,Adam.

The musical has had a number of major revivals, and several of its songs have become standards, including \"Broadway Baby\", \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\", \"Too Many Mornings\", \"[[Could I Leave You? (song)|Could I Leave You?]]\", and \"[[Losing My Mind]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter the failure of ''[[Do I Hear A Waltz?]]'' (1965), for which he had written the lyrics to [[Richard Rodgers]]'s music, Sondheim decided that he would henceforth work only on projects where he could write both the music and lyrics himself.  He asked author and playwright James Goldman to join him as [[bookwriter]] for a new musical.  Inspired by a ''New York Times'' article about a gathering of former showgirls from the [[Ziegfeld Follies]], they decided upon a story about ex-showgirls.<ref name=chapin>Chapin, pp. xxii\u2013xxvi, 7</ref>\n\nOriginally titled ''The Girls Upstairs'', the musical was originally to be produced by [[David Merrick]] and Leland Hayward in late 1967, but the plans ultimately fell through, and Stuart Ostrow became the producer, with Joseph Hardy to direct. These plans also did not work out,<ref>Citron, Stephen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AWaZ1LAFAZEC&pg=PA160 ''Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical'', \"Chapter:Prince and Company\"]. ''Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical'',  Oxford University Press US, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-509601-0}}, pp.159-160</ref> and finally Harold Prince, who had worked previously with Sondheim, became the producer and director. He had agreed to work on ''The Girls Upstairs'' if Sondheim would agree to work on ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]''; Michael Bennett, the young choreographer of ''Company'', was also brought onto the project. It was Prince who changed the title to ''Follies''; he was \"intrigued by the psychology of a reunion of old chorus dancers and loved the play on the word 'follies'\".<ref name=chapin/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1971, on the soon-to-be demolished stage of the Weismann Theatre, a reunion is being held to honor the Weismann's \"Follies\" shows past, and the beautiful chorus girls who performed there every year between the two World Wars. The once resplendent theatre is now little but planks and scaffolding (\"Prologue\"/\"Overture\"). As the ghosts of the young showgirls slowly drift through the theatre, a [[majordomo]] enters with his entourage of waiters and waitresses. They pass through the spectral showgirls without seeing them.\n\nSally Durant Plummer, \"blond, petite, sweet-faced\" and at 49 \"still remarkably like the girl she was thirty years ago\",<ref name=\"script\">Sondheim, Stephen, and Goldman, James.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ANllScAXhgoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sondheim+Follies&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Act 1\"] ''Follies''.

Phyllis Rogers Stone, a stylish and elegant woman,<ref name=script/> also arrives with her husband Ben, a renowned philanthropist and politician. As their younger counterparts approach them, Phyllis comments to Ben about their past. He feigns a lack of interest; there is an underlying tension in their relationship.  As more guests arrive, Sally\u2019s husband, Buddy, enters. He is a salesman, in his early 50s, appealing and lively,<ref name=script/> whose smiles cover inner disappointment.\n\nFinally, Weismann enters to greet his guests. Roscoe, the old master of ceremonies, introduces the former showgirls (\"Beautiful Girls\"). Former Weismann performers at the reunion include Max and Stella Deems, who lost their radio jobs and became store owners in Miami; Solange La Fitte, a coquette, who is vibrant and flirtatious even at 66; Hattie Walker, who has outlived five younger husbands; Vincent and Vanessa, former dancers who now own an [[Arthur Murray]] franchise; Heidi Schiller, for whom [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]] once wrote a waltz (or was it [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]]? Facts never interest her; what matters is the song!); and Carlotta Campion, a film star who has embraced life and benefited from every experience.\n\nAs the guests reminisce, the stories of Ben, Phyllis, Buddy and Sally unfold. Phyllis and Sally were roommates while in the Follies, and Ben and Buddy were best friends at school in New York. When Sally sees Ben, her former lover, she greets him self-consciously (\"Don't Look at Me\"). Buddy and Phyllis join their spouses and the foursome reminisce about the old days of their courtship and the theatre, their memories vividly coming to life in the apparitions of their young counterparts (\"Waiting For The Girls Upstairs\"). Each of the four is shaken at the realization of how life has changed them. Elsewhere, Willy Wheeler (portly, in his sixties) cartwheels for a photographer. Emily and Theodore Whitman, ex-vaudevillians in their seventies, perform an old routine (\"The Rain on the Roof\"). Solange proves she is still fashionable at what she claims is 66 (\"Ah, Paris!\"), and Hattie Walker performs her old showstopping number (\"Broadway Baby\").\n\nBuddy warns Phyllis that Sally is still in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben\u2019s apparently glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been (\"The Road You Didn't Take\"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) (\"In Buddy\u2019s Eyes\"). But it is clear that Sally is still in love with Ben \u2013 even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.\n\nPhyllis interrupts this tender moment and has a biting encounter with Sally. Before she has a chance to really let loose, they are both called on to participate in another performance \u2013 Stella Deems and the ex-chorines line up to perform an old number (\"Who's That Woman?\"), as they are mirrored by their younger selves. Afterward, Phyllis and Ben angrily discuss their lives and relationship, which has become numb and emotionless. Sally is bitter and has never been happy with Buddy, although he has always adored her. She accuses him of having affairs while he is on the road, and he admits he has a steady girlfriend, Margie, in another town, but always returns home. Carlotta amuses a throng of admirers with a tale of how her dramatic solo was cut from the Follies because the audience found it humorous, transforming it as she sings it into a toast to her own hard-won survival (\"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\").\n\nBen confides to Sally that his life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips between them and the three move together (\"Too Many Mornings\"). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes him feel like \"a somebody\", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back (\"The Right Girl\"). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he's already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs \"One More Kiss\", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can't continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this but still wants Phyllis out. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request (\"[[Could I Leave You? (song)|Could I Leave You?]]\").\n\nPhyllis begins wondering at her younger self, who worked so hard to become the socialite that Ben needed. Ben yells at his younger self for not appreciating all the work that Phyllis did. Both Buddys enter to confront the Bens about how they stole Sally. Sally and her younger self enter, and Ben firmly tells Sally that he never loved her. All the voices begin speaking and yelling at each other. Suddenly, at the peak of madness and confusion, the couples are engulfed by their follies, which transform the rundown theatre into a fantastical \"Loveland\", an extravaganza even more grand and opulent than the gaudiest Weismann confection: \"the place where lovers are always young and beautiful, and everyone lives only for love\".<ref name=mtiplot>[http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000037 \"Synopsis\"] mtishows.com. Retrieved August 30, 2010.</ref> Sally, Phyllis, Ben, and Buddy show their \"real and emotional lives\" in \"a sort of group nervous breakdown.\"<ref>Sondheim, p. 231</ref>\n\nWhat follows is a series of musical numbers performed by the principal characters, each exploring his or her biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in counterpoint of their hopes for the future (\"You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through\"). Buddy then appears, dressed in \"plaid baggy pants, garish jacket and a shiny derby hat\", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him<ref name=script/> (\"The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues\"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past - and her obsession with him now (\"[[Losing My Mind]]\"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated, and her desire to combine them (\"The Story of Lucy and Jessie\"). Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy (\"Live, Laugh, Love\") but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing were wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.\n\n\"Loveland\" has dissolved back into the reality of the crumbling and half-demolished theatre; dawn is approaching.

The show and the score have a double vision: simultaneously squinting at the messes people make of their lives and wide-eyed at the lingering grace and lift of the music they want to hear.

Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analyzed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from [[structural linguistics]] or formalist language theories, in that the latter approaches seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other only as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former additionally takes into account the context where linguistic elements are used and studies the way they are instrumentally useful or functional in the given environment. This  means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used in communicative context. The formal relations between linguistic elements are assumed to be functionally-motivated.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Functional Theories of Grammar|author=Nichols, Johanna|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=13|year=1984|pages= 97\u2013117|quote=[Functional grammar] ''analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that structural or formal approaches are not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but are inadequate even as structural accounts. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation.''|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.13.1.97}}</ref>\n\n==Frameworks==\nThere are several distinct grammatical frameworks that employ a functional approach.\n\n*The structuralist functionalism of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague school]] was the earliest functionalist framework developed in the 1920s.<ref>Newmeyer, Frederick.

Within this paradigm one attempts to reveal the instrumentality of language with respect to what people do and achieve with it in social interaction. A [[natural language]], in other words, is seen as an integrated part of the [[communicative competence]] of the natural language user. (2, p.&nbsp;3)}}\n\nBecause of its emphasis on usage, communicative function, and the social context of language, functional grammar differs significantly from other linguistic theories which stress purely [[formal grammar|formal approaches to grammar]], notably Chomskyan [[generative grammar]]. Functional grammar makes much use of [[corpus linguistics]] and [[linguistic typology]] to provide material.\n\n==Grammatical functions==\nFunctions exist on all levels of grammar, and even in phonology, where the function of the [[phoneme]] is to distinguish between lexical material.\n#Semantic function: ([[Agent (linguistics)|Agent]], [[Patient (linguistics)|Patient]], [[Recipient (linguistics)|Recipient]], etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.\n#Syntactic functions: (e.g. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]]  and [[Object (grammar)|Object]]), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression.\n#Pragmatic functions: ([[Topic\u2013comment|Theme and Rheme]], [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], [[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Functional grammar (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Functional Theories Of Grammar}}\n[[Category:Grammar frameworks]]\n[[Category:Theories of language]]\n\n[[it:Grammatica funzionale]]", "sha1": "ttgtym6rbg28926l2mu24m9yv87m41h"}}, {"title": "Fick's laws of diffusion", "ns": "0", "id": "11671", "revision": {"id": "865276889", "parentid": "865276538", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T21:55:10Z", "contributor": {"ip": "86.171.65.184"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the technique of measuring [[cardiac output]]|Fick principle}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:DiffusionMicroMacro.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Molecular diffusion]] from a microscopic and macroscopic point of view. Initially, there are [[Solution|solute]] molecules on the left side of a barrier (purple line) and none on the right. The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole container. '''Top''': A single molecule moves around randomly. '''Middle''': With more molecules, there is a clear trend where the solute fills the container more and more uniformly. '''Bottom''': With an enormous number of solute molecules, randomness becomes undetectable: The solute appears to move smoothly and systematically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas. This smooth flow is described by Fick's laws.]]\n'''Fick's laws of diffusion''' describe [[diffusion]] and were derived by [[Adolf Fick]] in 1855. They can be used to solve for the [[Mass diffusivity|diffusion coefficient]], {{mvar|D}}. Fick's first law can be used to derive his second law which in turn is identical to the [[diffusion equation]].\n\n== Fick's first law ==\n'''Fick's first law''' relates the diffusive [[flux]] to the concentration under the assumption of [[steady state]]. It postulates that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient (spatial derivative), or in simplistic terms the concept that a solute will move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across a concentration gradient. In one (spatial) dimension, the law is:\n\n:<math>J = -D \\frac{d \\varphi}{d x} </math>\nwhere\n* {{mvar|J}} is the '''diffusion flux''', of which the [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] is [[amount of substance]] per unit area per unit time, so it is expressed in such units as mol&nbsp;m<sup>\u22122</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup>. {{mvar|J}} measures the amount of substance that will flow through a unit area during a unit time interval.\n* {{mvar|D}} is the '''diffusion coefficient''' or '''[[mass diffusivity|diffusivity]]'''. Its dimension is area per unit time, so typical units for expressing it would be m<sup>2</sup>/s.\n* {{mvar|\u03c6}} (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration, of which the dimension is amount of substance per unit volume. It might be expressed in units of mol/m<sup>3</sup>.\n* {{mvar|x}} is position, the dimension of which is length. It might thus be expressed in the unit m.\n\n{{mvar|D}} is proportional to the squared velocity of the diffusing particles, which depends on the temperature, [[viscosity]] of the fluid and the size of the particles according to the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)#Stokes-Einstein equation|Stokes\u2013Einstein relation]]. In dilute aqueous solutions the diffusion coefficients of most ions are similar and have values that at room temperature are in the range of {{val|0.6|-|2|e=-9|u=m<sup>2</sup>/s}}. For biological molecules the diffusion coefficients normally range from 10<sup>\u221211</sup> to 10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s.\n\nIn two or more dimensions we must use {{math|\u2207}}, the [[del]] or [[gradient]] operator, which generalises the first derivative, obtaining\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{J}=- D\\nabla \\varphi</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''J'''}} denotes the diffusion flux vector.\n\nThe driving force for the one-dimensional diffusion is the quantity {{math|\u2212{{sfrac|\u2202''\u03c6''|\u2202''x''}}}}, which for ideal mixtures is the concentration gradient. In chemical systems other than ideal solutions or mixtures, the driving force for diffusion of each species is the gradient of [[chemical potential]] of this species. Then Fick's first law (one-dimensional case) can be written as:\n\n:<math>J_i = - \\frac{D c_i}{RT} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial x}</math>\n\nwhere the index {{mvar|i}} denotes the {{mvar|i}}th species, {{mvar|c}} is the concentration (mol/m<sup>3</sup>), {{mvar|R}} is the [[universal gas constant]] (J/K/mol), {{mvar|T}} is the absolute temperature (K), and {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the chemical potential (J/mol).\n\nIf the primary variable is mass fraction ({{mvar|y<sub>i</sub>}}, given, for example, in kg/kg), then the equation changes to:\n\n:<math>J_i=- \\rho D\\nabla y_i </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the fluid [[density]] (for example, in kg/m<sup>3</sup>). Note that the density is outside the [[gradient]] operator.\n\n== Fick's second law ==\n'''Fick's second law''' predicts how diffusion causes the concentration to change with time. It is a [[partial differential equation]] which in one dimension reads:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi}{\\partial x^2}</math>\n\nwhere\n* {{mvar|\u03c6}} is the concentration in dimensions of [(amount of substance) length<sup>\u22123</sup>], example mol/m<sup>3</sup>; {{math|''\u03c6'' {{=}} ''\u03c6''(''x'',''t'')}} is a function that depends on location {{mvar|x}} and time {{mvar|t}}\n* {{mvar|t}} is time, example s\n* {{mvar|D}} is the diffusion coefficient in dimensions of [length<sup>2</sup> time<sup>\u22121</sup>], example m<sup>2</sup>/s\n* {{mvar|x}} is the position [length], example m\n\nIn two or more dimensions we must use the [[Laplacian]] {{math|\u0394 {{=}} \u2207<sup>2</sup>}}, which generalises the second derivative, obtaining the equation\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = D\\Delta \\varphi</math>\n\n==Derivation of Fick's laws==\n\n===Fick's first law===\nIn one dimension, the following derivation is based on a similar argument made in Berg 1977 (see [[#References|references]]).\n\nConsider a collection of particles performing a random walk in one dimension with length scale {{math|\u0394''x''}} and time scale {{math|\u0394''t''}}. Let {{math|''N''(''x'',''t'')}} be the number of particles at position {{mvar|x}} at time {{mvar|t}}.\n\nAt a given time step, half of the particles would move left and half would move right. Since half of the particles at point {{mvar|x}} move right and half of the particles at point {{math|''x'' + \u0394''x''}} move left, the net movement to the right is:\n\n:<math>-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\bigl[N(x + \\Delta x, t) - N(x, t)\\bigr]</math>\n\nThe flux, {{mvar|J}}, is this net movement of particles across some area element of area {{mvar|a}}, normal to the random walk during a time interval {{math|\u0394''t''}}. Hence we may write:\n\n:<math>J = - \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\frac{ N(x + \\Delta x, t)}{a \\Delta t} - \\frac{ N(x, t)}{a \\Delta t}\\right]</math>\n\nMultiplying the top and bottom of the right hand side by {{math|(\u0394''x'')<sup>2</sup>}} and rewriting, one obtains:\n\n:<math> J = -\\frac{\\left(\\Delta x\\right)^2}{2 \\Delta t}\\left[\\frac{N(x + \\Delta x, t)}{a \\left(\\Delta x\\right)^2} - \\frac{N(x, t)}{a \\left(\\Delta x\\right)^2}\\right]</math>\n\nConcentration is defined as particles per unit volume, and hence\n:<math>\\varphi (x, t) = \\frac{N(x, t)}{a \\Delta x}.</math>\n\nIn addition, {{math|{{sfrac|(\u0394''x'')<sup>2</sup>|2\u0394''t''}}}} is the definition of the one-dimensional diffusion constant, {{mvar|D}}. Thus our expression simplifies to:\n\n:<math> J = -D \\left[\\frac{\\varphi (x + \\Delta x, t)}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{\\varphi (x , t)}{\\Delta x}\\right]</math>\n\nIn the limit where {{math|\u0394''x''}} is infinitesimal, the right-hand side becomes a space derivative:\n\n:<math> J = - D \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x}  </math>\n\n===Fick's second law===\nFick's second law can be derived from Fick's first law and the [[mass conservation]] in absence of any chemical reactions:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}J = 0\\Rightarrow\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(D\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\varphi\\right)\\,=0</math>\n\nAssuming the diffusion coefficient {{mvar|D}} to be a constant, one can exchange the orders of the differentiation and multiply by the constant:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(D\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\varphi\\right) = D\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\varphi = D\\frac{\\partial^2\\varphi}{\\partial x^2}</math>\n\nand, thus, receive the form of the Fick's equations as was stated above.\n\nFor the case of diffusion in two or more dimensions Fick's second law becomes\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = D\\nabla^2\\varphi,</math>\n\nwhich is analogous to the [[heat equation]].\n\nIf the diffusion coefficient is not a constant, but depends upon the coordinate or concentration, Fick's second law yields\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} =  \\nabla \\cdot (D\\nabla\\varphi).</math>\n\nAn important example is the case where {{math|'''\u03c6'''}} is at a steady state, i.e. the concentration does not change by time, so that the left part of the above equation is identically zero. In one dimension with constant {{mvar|D}}, the solution for the concentration will be a linear change of concentrations along {{mvar|x}}. In two or more dimensions we obtain\n\n:<math> \\nabla^2\\varphi =0</math>\n\nwhich is [[Laplace's equation]], the solutions to which are referred to by mathematicians as [[harmonic functions]].\n\n==Derivation==\nFick's second law is a special case of the [[convection\u2013diffusion equation]] in which there is no [[advection|advective flux]] and no net volumetric source. It can be derived from the [[Continuity equation#Differential form|continuity equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{j} = R, </math>\nwhere {{math|'''j'''}} is the total [[flux]] and {{mvar|R}} is a net volumetric source for {{math|'''\u03c6'''}}. The only source of flux in this situation is assumed to be '''diffusive flux''':\n:<math>\\mathbf{j}_{\\text{diffusion}} = -D \\nabla \\varphi</math>\n\nPlugging the definition of diffusive flux to the continuity equation and assuming there is no source ({{math|''R'' {{=}} 0}}), we arrive at Fick's second law:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = D\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi}{\\partial x^2}</math>\n\nIf flux were the result of both '''diffusive flux''' and [[advection|advective flux]], the [[convection\u2013diffusion equation]] is the result.\n\n===Example solution in one dimension: diffusion length===\n\nA simple case of diffusion with time {{mvar|t}} in one dimension (taken as the {{mvar|x}}-axis) from a boundary located at position {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, where the concentration is maintained at a value {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}} is\n\n:<math>n \\left(x,t \\right)=n_0 \\mathrm{erfc} \\left( \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)</math>.\n\nwhere {{math|erfc}} is the complementary [[error function]]. This is the case when corrosive gases diffuse through the oxidative layer towards the metal surface (if we assume that concentration of gases in the environment is constant and the diffusion space \u2013 that is, the corrosion product layer \u2013 is ''semi-infinite'', starting at 0 at the surface and spreading infinitely deep in the material). If, in its turn, the diffusion space is ''infinite'' (lasting both through the layer with {{math|''n''(''x'',0) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''x'' > 0}} and that with {{math|''n''(''x'',0) {{=}} ''n''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''x'' \u2264 0}}), then the solution is amended only with coefficient {{sfrac|2}} in front of {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}} (as the diffusion now occurs in both directions). This case is valid when some solution with concentration {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}} is put in contact with a layer of pure solvent. (Bokstein, 2005) The length {{math|2{{sqrt|''Dt''}}}} is called the ''diffusion length'' and provides a measure of how far the concentration has propagated in the {{mvar|x}}-direction by diffusion in time {{mvar|t}} (Bird, 1976).\n\nAs a quick approximation of the error function, the first 2 terms of the Taylor series can be used:\n:<math>n \\left(x,t \\right)=n_0 \\left[ 1 - 2 \\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt\\pi}}\\right) \\right] </math>\n\nIf {{mvar|D}} is time-dependent, the diffusion length becomes\n:<math> 2\\sqrt{\\int_0^{t}D\\tau \\,d\\tau}. </math>.\nThis idea is useful for estimating a diffusion length over a heating and cooling cycle, where {{mvar|D}} varies with temperature.\n\n===Generalizations===\n\n* In ''non-homogeneous media'', the diffusion coefficient varies in space, {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''D''(''x'')}}. This dependence does not affect Fick's first law but the second law changes:\n::<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi(x,t)}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\cdot \\bigl(D(x) \\nabla \\varphi(x,t)\\bigr)=D(x) \\Delta \\varphi(x,t)+\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial D(x)}{\\partial x_i} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(x,t)}{\\partial x_i}</math>\n\n* In ''[[anisotropic]] media'', the diffusion coefficient depends on the direction. It is a symmetric [[tensor]] {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''D<sub>ij</sub>''}}. Fick's first law changes to\n::<math>J=-D \\nabla \\varphi </math>,\n:it is the product of a tensor and a vector:\n::<math> J_i=-\\sum_{j=1}^3 D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\n:For the diffusion equation this formula gives\n::<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi(x,t)}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\cdot \\bigl(D \\nabla \\varphi(x,t)\\bigr)=\\sum_{i=1}^3\\sum_{j=1}^3D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi(x,t)}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}. </math>\n:The symmetric matrix of diffusion coefficients {{math|''D<sub>ij</sub>''}} should be [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]. It is needed to make the right hand side operator [[Elliptic operator|elliptic]].\n\n* For ''inhomogeneous anisotropic media'' these two forms of the diffusion equation should be combined in\n::<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi(x,t)}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\cdot \\bigl(D(x) \\nabla \\varphi(x,t)\\bigr)=\\sum_{i,j=1}^3\\left(D_{ij}(x) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi(x,t)}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}+ \\frac{\\partial D_{ij}(x)}{\\partial x_i }  \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(x,t)}{\\partial x_j}\\right). </math>\n\n* The approach based on [[Diffusion#Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula|Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula]] gives the following generalization of Fick's equation for the ''multicomponent diffusion'' of the perfect components:\n::<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i}{\\partial t}  =\\sum_j \\nabla\\cdot\\left(D_{ij} \\frac{\\varphi_i}{\\varphi_j} \\nabla \\, \\varphi_j\\right) .</math>\n:where {{mvar|\u03c6<sub>i</sub>}} are concentrations of the components and {{mvar|D<sub>ij</sub>}} is the matrix of coefficients. Here, indices {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} are related to the various components and not to the space coordinates.\n\nThe [[Diffusion#The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation|Chapman\u2013Enskog formulae for diffusion in gases]] include exactly the same terms. These physical models of diffusion are different from the test models {{math|\u2202<sub>''t''</sub>''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} \u2211<sub>''j''</sub> ''D<sub>ij</sub>'' \u0394''\u03c6<sub>j</sub>''}} which are valid for very small deviations from the uniform equilibrium. Earlier, such terms were introduced in the [[Maxwell\u2013Stefan diffusion]] equation.\n\nFor anisotropic multicomponent diffusion coefficients one needs a rank-four tensor, for example {{math|''D''<sub>''ij'',''\u03b1\u03b2''</sub>}}, where {{math|''i'', ''j''}} refer to the components and {{math|''\u03b1'', ''\u03b2'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}} correspond to the space coordinates.\n\n== Applications ==\nEquations based on Fick's law have been commonly used to model [[Passive transport|transport processes]] in foods, [[neuron]]s, [[biopolymer]]s, [[Pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]], [[porous]] [[soil]]s, [[population dynamics]], nuclear materials, [[plasma physics]], and [[Doping (semiconductor)|semiconductor doping]] processes. Theory of all [[Voltammetry|voltammetric]] methods is based on solutions of Fick's equation. Much experimental research in [[polymer]] science and food science has shown that a more general approach is required to describe transport of components in materials undergoing [[glass transition]].  In the vicinity of glass transition the flow behavior becomes \"non-Fickian\". It can be shown that the Fick's law can be obtained from the [[Maxwell\u2013Stefan]] equations<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Taylor\n|first=Ross\n|first2=R. |last2=Krishna\n|title = Multicomponent mass transfer\n|publisher = Wiley\n|year=1993\n}}</ref>\nof [[multi-component]] [[mass transfer]]. The Fick's law is limiting case of the Maxwell\u2013Stefan equations, when the mixture is extremely dilute and every chemical species is interacting only with the bulk mixture and not with other species. To account for the presence of multiple species in a non-dilute mixture, several variations of the Maxwell\u2013Stefan equations are used. See also non-diagonal coupled transport processes ([[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager]] relationship). <!-- Onsager = important point to be still developed -->\n\n=== Biological perspective ===\nThe first law gives rise to the following formula:<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|3/3ch9/s3ch9_2}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\text{flux} = {-P \\left(c_2 - c_1\\right)}</math>\n\nin which,\n* {{mvar|P}} is the permeability, an experimentally determined membrane \"[[Electrical conductance|conductance]]\" for a given gas at a given temperature.\n* {{math|''c''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''c''<sub>1</sub>}} is the difference in [[concentration]] of the gas across the [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] for the direction of flow (from {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''c''<sub>2</sub>}}).\n\nFick's first law is also important in radiation transfer equations.  However, in this context it becomes inaccurate when the diffusion constant is low and the radiation becomes limited by the speed of light rather than by the resistance of the material the radiation is flowing through.  In this situation, one can use a [[flux limiter]].\n\nThe exchange rate of a gas across a fluid membrane can be determined by using this law together with [[Graham's law]].\n\n=== Fick's flow in liquids ===\nWhen two [[miscibility|miscible]] liquids are brought into contact, and diffusion takes place, the macroscopic (or average) concentration evolves following Fick's law. On a mesoscopic scale, that is, between the macroscopic scale described by Fick's law and molecular scale, where molecular [[random walk]]s take place, fluctuations cannot be neglected. Such situations can be successfully modeled with Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics. In this theoretical framework, diffusion is due to fluctuations whose dimensions range from the molecular scale to the macroscopic scale.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=D. |last1=Brogioli |first2=A. |last2=Vailati |title=Diffusive mass transfer by nonequilibrium fluctuations: Fick's law revisited |journal=Phys.

When calculating the fluctuations with a perturbative approach, the zero order approximation is Fick's law. The first order gives the fluctuations, and it comes out that fluctuations contribute to diffusion. This represents somehow a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], since the phenomena described by a lower order approximation is the result of a higher approximation: this problem is solved only by [[renormalization|renormalizing]] the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations.\n\n=== Semiconductor fabrication applications ===\n[[Integrated circuit]] fabrication technologies, model processes like CVD, thermal oxidation, wet oxidation, doping, etc. use diffusion equations obtained from Fick's law.\n\nIn certain cases, the solutions are obtained for boundary conditions such as constant source concentration diffusion, limited source concentration, or moving boundary diffusion (where junction depth keeps moving into the substrate).\n\n== History ==\nIn 1855, physiologist Adolf Fick first reported<ref>\n*{{cite journal|first=A. |last=Fick |journal=Annalen der Physik |date=1855 |volume=94 |pages=59\u201386 |DOI=10.1002/andp.18551700105|language=German |title=Ueber Diffusion}}\n*{{cite journal|first=A. |last=Fick |journal=Phil.

Fick's work was inspired by the earlier experiments of [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]], which fell short of proposing the fundamental laws for which Fick would become famous.  The Fick's law is analogous to the  relationships discovered at the same epoch by other eminent scientists: [[Darcy's law]] (hydraulic flow), [[Ohm's law]] (charge transport), and [[Fourier's Law]] (heat transport).\n\nFick's experiments (modeled on Graham's) dealt with measuring the concentrations and fluxes of salt, diffusing between two reservoirs through tubes of water. It is notable that Fick's work primarily concerned diffusion in fluids, because at the time, diffusion in solids was not considered generally possible.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/journal/pdf/volume2/diff_fund_2(2005)1.pdf |first=Jean |last=Philibert |title=One and a Half Centuries of Diffusion: Fick, Einstein, before and beyond |journal=Diffusion Fundamentals |volume=2 |date=2005 |page=1.1\u20131.10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205030323/http://www.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/journal/pdf/volume2/diff_fund_2(2005)1.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>  Today, Fick's Laws form the core of our understanding of diffusion in solids, liquids, and gases (in the absence of bulk fluid motion in the latter two cases).

Likewise, in [[Qing Dynasty]] of the 19th and early 20th centuries the term \"[[Far West (Taixi)|T\u00e0ix\u012b]] ({{lang|zh|\u6cf0\u897f}})\" \u2013 i.e. anything further west than the [[Arab world]] \u2013 was used to refer to the [[Western world|Western]] countries.\n\nSince the 1960s, East Asia has become the most common term for the region in international [[mass media]] outlets.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15213613|title=A menagerie of monikers|date=7 January 2010|accessdate=9 July 2011|publisher=[[The Economist]]|quote=}}</ref><ref name=\"Reischauer 1960\">Reischauer, Edwin and John K Fairbank, ''East Asia: The Great Tradition,'' 1960.</ref>\n\n== Popularization ==\nPrior to the colonial era, \"Far East\" referred to anything further east than the Middle East. In the 16th century, [[King John III of Portugal]] called [[India]] a \"rich and interesting country in the Far East<ref>{{cite book|title=A Forgotten Empire: Vijayanagar; A Contribution to the History of India|author=Robert Sewell|year=1901}}</ref> (''Extremo Oriente'').\" The term was popularized during the period of the [[British Empire]] as a blanket term for lands to the east of [[British Raj|British India]].\n\nIn pre-[[World War I]] European geopolitics, the ''[[Near East]]'' referred to the relatively nearby lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the ''[[Middle East]]'' denoted northwestern [[South Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], and the ''Far East'' meant countries along the western [[Pacific Ocean]] and eastern [[Indian Ocean]]. Many European languages have analogous terms, such as the [[French language|French]] (''{{lang|fr|[[:fr:Extr\u00eame-Orient|Extr\u00eame-Orient]]}}''), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''{{lang|es|[[:es:Extremo Oriente|Extremo Oriente]]}}''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''{{lang|pt|[[:pt:Extremo Oriente|Extremo Oriente]]}}''), [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|[[:de:Ferner Osten|Ferner Osten]]}}''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''{{lang|it|[[:it:Estremo Oriente|Estremo Oriente]]}}''), [[Polish language|Polish]] (''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:Daleki Wsch\u00f3d|Daleki Wsch\u00f3d]]}}''), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''{{lang|no|[[:no:Det fjerne \u00d8sten|Det fjerne \u00d8sten]]}}'') and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''{{lang|nl|[[:nl:Verre Oosten|Verre Oosten]]}}'').\n\n== Cultural as well as geographic meaning ==\n{{main|East Asian cultural sphere}}\n\nSignificantly, the term evokes cultural as well as geographic separation; the ''Far East'' is not just geographically distant, but also culturally exotic. It never refers, for instance, to the culturally Western nations of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], which lie even farther to the east of Europe than East Asia itself. This combination of cultural and geographic subjectivity was well illustrated in 1939 by [[Robert Menzies]], a [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Reflecting on his country's geopolitical concerns with the onset of [[World War II|war]], Menzies commented that: \n<blockquote> The problems of the Pacific are different. What Great Britain calls the Far East is to us the Near North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/(LookupVolNoNumber)/2~73|title=Historical documents|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n''Far East'' in its usual sense is comparable to terms such as ''the [[Orient]]'', which means [[East]]; the ''[[Eastern world]]''; or simply the ''East''. [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Russian Far East]], and occasionally the [[Indian Subcontinent]] might be included in the Far East to some extent.\n\nConcerning the term, John K. Fairbank and Edwin O. Reischauer, professors of East Asian Studies at [[Harvard University]], wrote (in ''East Asia: The Great Tradition''): \"When Europeans traveled far to the east to reach [[Cathay]], Japan and the Indies, they naturally gave those distant regions the general name 'Far East.' Americans who reached China, Japan and Southeast Asia by sail and steam across the Pacific could, with equal logic, have called that area the 'Far West.' For the people who live in that part of the world, however, it is neither 'East' nor 'West' and certainly not 'Far.' A more generally acceptable term for the area is 'East Asia,' which is geographically more precise and does not imply the outdated notion that Europe is the center of the civilized world.\"<ref name=\"Reischauer 1960\"/>\n\nToday, the term remains in the names of some longstanding institutions, including the [[Far Eastern Federal University]] in [[Vladivostok]], [[Far Eastern University]] in [[Manila]], and the [[Far East University (Korea)|Far East University]] in [[South Korea]]. Furthermore, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] have historically used ''Far East'' for several military units and commands in the region:\n\n== Territories and regions conventionally included under the term ''Far East'' ==\n<!--{{editnote | NOTE: The countries in this table are categorized according to region than alphabetical order used by the United Nations etc., and data included are per sources in cross-referenced articles.

Only 12 episodes were made (two series of six episodes each). The show was created and written by [[John Cleese]] and [[Connie Booth]], who also starred in the show. They were married at the time of series 1, but divorced before recording series 2. The show was ranked first on a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000.\n\nThe series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional [[hotel]] in the seaside town of [[Torquay]] on the \"[[Torbay|English Riviera]]\". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner [[Basil Fawlty]] (Cleese), his bossy wife [[Sybil Fawlty|Sybil]] ([[Prunella Scales]]), comparatively normal chambermaid [[Polly Sherman (Fawlty Towers)|Polly]] (Booth) who often is the peacemaker and voice of reason, and hapless and English-challenged Spanish waiter [[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|Manuel]] ([[Andrew Sachs]]), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests and tradespeople.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Gleneagles Hotel, Torquay - geograph.org.uk - 1444339.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gleneagles Hotel, Torquay|Gleneagles Hotel]], Torquay, in mid-August 2009]]\nIn May 1970, the [[Monty Python]] comedy group stayed at the [[Gleneagles Hotel, Torquay|Gleneagles Hotel]] in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]] while filming on location in [[Paignton]].<ref>Palin, Michael; ''Diaries 1969\u20131979: The Python Years''; p24; 2007, Weidenfeld & Nicolson</ref> [[John Cleese]] was fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, [[Donald Sinclair (hotel owner)|Donald Sinclair]], later describing him as \"the rudest man I've ever come across in my life.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1yKb_77Sf0 |title=John Cleese interview \u2013 part one \u2013 Parkinson \u2013 BBC |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}</ref> Among such behaviour by Sinclair was his criticism of [[Terry Gilliam]]'s \"too American\" table [[etiquette]] and tossing [[Eric Idle]]'s briefcase out of a window \"in case it contained a bomb.\"<ref name=devon>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2006/08/10/fawlty_towers_relaunch_feature.shtml |title=Sybil back at Fawlty Towers |publisher=BBC |date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref> Sinclair justified his actions by claiming the hotel had \"staff problems\".<ref>Cleese Interview; 'Fawlty Towers: Reopened'; 2009</ref> Cleese and [[Connie Booth]] stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of its owner.\n\nAt the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' for [[London Weekend Television]]. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode (\"No Ill Feeling\") of the third ''Doctor'' series (titled ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]''). In this edition, the main character checks into a small-town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by [[Timothy Bateson]]) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/d/doctoratlarge_7772270.shtml ''BBC Comedy Guide Doctor At Large''].

At a 30th anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,\n{{blockquote|\"Connie and I wrote that first episode and we sent it in to [[James Gilbert (producer)|Jimmy Gilbert]],\" the executive \"whose job it was to assess the quality of the writing said, and I can quote [his note to me] fairly accurately, 'This is full of clich\u00e9d situations and stereotypical characters and I cannot see it as being anything other than a disaster.'

It was filmed at the T-junction of Lapstone Gardens and Mentmore Close ({{Coord|51.581103|N|0.309072|W|display=inline}}). In the episode \"[[The Germans]]\", the opening shot is of [[Northwick Park Hospital]]. In \"Gourmet Night,\" the exterior of Andr\u00e9's restaurant was filmed on Preston Road in the Harrow area ({{Coord|51.573393|N|0.294411|W|display=inline}}). The [[launderette]] next door to the restaurant still exists, but Andr\u00e9's now is a Chinese and Indian restaurant called Wings.<ref>[https://www.google.ca/maps/@51.5734065,-0.2944301,3a,75y,78.71h,89.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1svamY7kTfSM_L3YnsakJwyQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en View of scene on Google StreetView]</ref>\n\nBoth Cleese and Booth were keen on [[perfectionism (psychology)|every script being perfect]], and some episodes took four months and required as many as ten drafts until they were satisfied.<ref name=museumTV>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Goddard |title=FAWLTY TOWERS: British Situation Comedy |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/fawltytowers/fawltytowers.htm |publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot directions and examples==\nThe series focuses on the exploits and misadventures of short-fused hotelier [[#Basil Fawlty|Basil Fawlty]] and his acerbic wife [[#Sybil Fawlty|Sybil]], as well as their employees: [[porter (carrier)|porter]] and waiter [[#Manuel|Manuel]], maid [[#Polly Sherman|Polly Sherman]], and, in the second series, chef Terry. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in \"raising the tone\" of his hotel and his increasing frustration at numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. \n\nMuch of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as \"that golfing [[Bitis|puff adder]]\", \"my little [[piranha]] fish\" and \"my little nest of [[Viperidae|vipers]]\". Despite this, Basil frequently feels intimidated, Sybil being able to cow him at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of \"Basil!\" At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance.\n\nThe plots occasionally are intricate and always [[farce|farcical]], involving [[coincidence]]s, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The [[innuendo]] of the [[bedroom farce]] is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] Basil) but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events test to the breaking point what little patience Basil has, sometimes causing him to have a near breakdown by the end of the episode.\n\nThe guests at the hotel typically are [[double act|comic foils]] to Basil's anger and outbursts. Guest characters in each episode provide different characteristics (working class, promiscuous, foreign) that he cannot stand. Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted annoy him, as for example in the episode \"Communication Problems\", revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards. By the end, Basil faints just at the mention of her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild [[Black comedy|black humour]] at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in his comments about Sybil (\"Did you ever see that film, ''[[How to Murder Your Wife]]''? ... Awfully good. I saw it six times.\") and to the guests (\"May I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.\").\n\nBasil's physical outbursts are primarily directed at Manuel, an emotional but largely innocent [[Spain|Spaniard]] whose confused English vocabulary causes him to make elementary mistakes. At times, Basil beats Manuel with a frying pan and smacks his forehead with a spoon. The violence towards Manuel caused rare negative criticism of the show. Sybil and Polly, on the other hand, are more patient and understanding toward Manuel; everyone's usual excuse for his behaviour to guests is, \"He's from [[Barcelona]],\" Manuel even having once used the excuse for himself.\n\nBasil longs for a touch of [[Social class|class]], sometimes by playing recordings of classical music. In one episode he is playing music by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] when Sybil remarks, after pestering him asking to do different tasks: \"You could have them both done by now if you hadn't spent the whole morning skulking in there listening to that racket.\" Basil replies, with exasperation, \"Racket?? That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!\" Basil often displays blatant [[snob]]bishness as he attempts to climb the social ladder, frequently expressing disdain for the \"[[hoi polloi|riff-raff]]\", \"[[wikt:cretin|cretins]]\" and \"[[yobbo]]s\" that he believes regularly populate his hotel. His desperation is readily apparent as he makes increasingly hopeless manoeuvres and painful faux pas in trying to carry favour with those he perceives as having superior social status. Yet he finds himself forced to serve those individuals that are \"beneath\" him. As such, Basil's efforts tend to be counter-productive, with guests leaving the hotel in disgust and his marriage (and sanity) stretching to breaking point.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Fawlty Towers cast.jpg|thumb|250px|Cast of ''Fawlty Towers'', ''left to right'': ''(front)'' [[Prunella Scales]], [[Connie Booth]], and [[Andrew Sachs]]; ''(back)'' [[John Cleese]]]]\n\n===Basil Fawlty===\n{{main|Basil Fawlty}}\n[[Basil Fawlty]], played by [[John Cleese]], is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] and snobbish [[Misanthropy|misanthrope]] who is desperate to belong to a [[Upper class|higher social class]]. He sees a successful hotel as a means of achieving this, yet his job forces him to be polite to people he despises.\n\nHe is intimidated by his wife [[Sybil Fawlty]]. He yearns to stand up to her, but his plans frequently conflict with her demands. She is often [[Verbal abuse|verbally abusive]] (describing him as \"an ageing, [[brilliantine]]d stick insect\") but although he towers over her, he often finds himself on the receiving end of her temper, verbally and physically (as in \"[[The Builders]]\").\n\nBasil usually turns to Manuel or Polly to help him with his schemes, while trying his best to keep Sybil from discovering them. However, Basil occasionally laments for the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost. Also, it appears he still does care for her, and actively resists the flirtations of a French guest in one episode. The penultimate episode, \"[[The Anniversary (Fawlty Towers)|The Anniversary]]\", is about his efforts to put together a surprise anniversary party  involving their closest friends. Things go wrong as Basil pretends the anniversary date doesn't remind him of anything though he pretends to have a stab at it by reeling off a list of random anniversaries, starting with the [[Battle of Agincourt]], for which he receives a slap from Sybil, who becomes increasingly frustrated and angry. He continues guessing even after Sybil is out of earshot, and mentions other anniversaries (none of which happened on 17 April), including the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and [[Yom Kippur]], just to enhance the surprise. Sybil believes he really has forgotten, and leaves in a huff. In an interview in the DVD box set, Cleese claims this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been similar episodes).\n\nIn keeping with the lack of explanation about the marriage, not much is revealed of the characters' back-stories. It is known that Basil served in the [[British Army]] and saw action in the [[Korean War]], possibly as part of his [[conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]]. ([[John Cleese]] himself was only 13 when the Korean War ended, making the character of Basil at least five or six years older than he.) Basil exaggerates this period of his life, proclaiming to strangers, \"I killed four men.\" To this Sybil jokes that \"He was in the [[Army Catering Corps|Catering Corps]]. He used to poison them.\" Basil often is seen wearing regimental and old boy-style ties, perhaps spuriously, one of which in the colours of the [[Army Catering Corps]]. He also claims to have sustained a [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] injury to his leg; it tends to flare up at suspiciously convenient times. The only person Basil consistently exhibits tolerance and good manners towards is the old and senile [[Major Gowen]], a veteran of one of the [[world war]]s (which one never is specified, though he once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir that he was in France in 1918) who permanently resides at the hotel. When interacting with Manuel, Basil displays a rudimentary ability with Spanish (Basil states that he \"learned classical Spanish, not the strange dialect he [Manuel] seems to have picked up\"); this ability also is ridiculed, as in the first episode in which a guest, whom Basil has immediately dismissed as working-class, communicates fluently with Manuel in Spanish after Basil is unable to do so.\n\nCleese described Basil as thinking that \"he could run a first-rate hotel if he didn't have all the guests getting in the way\" and as being \"an absolutely awful human being\" but says that in comedy if an awful person makes people laugh they unaccountably feel affectionate towards him.<ref>An Interview with John Cleese, DVD Special Programs, 2001</ref> Indeed, he is not entirely unsympathetic. The \"[[The Hotel Inspectors|Hotel Inspectors]]\" and \"[[Gourmet Night]]\" episodes feature guests who are shown to be deeply annoying, with constant and unreasonable demands. In \"Gourmet Night\" the chef gets drunk and is unable to cook dinner, leaving Basil to scramble in an attempt to salvage the evening.  Much of the time, Basil is an unfortunate victim of circumstance.\n\n===Sybil Fawlty===\n{{main|Sybil Fawlty}}\n[[Sybil Fawlty]], played by [[Prunella Scales]], is Basil's wife. Energetic and petite, she prefers a working wardrobe of tight skirt-suits in shiny fabrics and sports a tower of permed hair augmented with hairpieces and wigs and necessitating the use of overnight [[curlers]]. She often is a more effective manager of the hotel, making sure Basil gets certain jobs done or stays out of the way when she is handling difficult guests. Typically when Basil is on the verge of meltdown due to a crisis (usually of his own making), it is Sybil who steps in to clear up the mess and bring some sense to the situation.  Despite this, she rarely participates directly in the running of the hotel. During busy check-in sessions or meal times, while everyone else is busy working, Sybil is frequently talking on the phone to one of her friends with her phrase \"Oohhh, I knoooooooow\" or chatting to customers. She has a distinctive conversational tone and braying laugh, which Basil compares to \"someone machine-gunning a seal.\" Being his wife, she is the only regular character who refers to Basil by his first name. When she barks his name at him, he flinchingly freezes in his tracks.\n\nBasil refers to her by a number of epithets, occasionally to her face, including \"that golfing puff-adder\", \"the dragon\", \"toxic midget\", \"the sabre-toothed tart\", \"my little kommandant\", \"my little piranha fish\", \"my little nest of vipers\" and \"you rancorous, coiffured old sow\". Despite these nasty nicknames, Basil is terrified of her. There is only one time he loses patience and snaps at her (Basil: \"Shut up, I'm fed up.\" Sybil: \"Oh, you've done it now.\").\n\nPrunella Scales speculated in an interview for ''The Complete Fawlty Towers'' DVD box set that Sybil married Basil because his origins were of a higher social class than hers.\n\n===Polly Sherman===\n{{main|Polly Sherman}}\n[[Polly Sherman]], played by [[Connie Booth]], is a [[waitress]] and general helper at the hotel with aspirations of being an artist. She is the most competent of the staff and the voice of sanity during chaotic moments, but frequently is embroiled in ridiculous masquerades as she loyally attempts to aid Basil in trying to cover a mistake or keep something from Sybil.\n\nIn \"[[The Anniversary (Fawlty Towers)|The Anniversary]]\" she snaps and refuses to help Basil out when he wants her to impersonate Sybil in the semi-darkness of her bedroom in front of the Fawltys' friends, Basil having dug himself into a hole by claiming Sybil was ill instead of admitting she had stormed out earlier in annoyance with him. Polly finally agrees, but only on condition that Basil lends her money to purchase a car, which he has previously refused to do.\n\nPolly generally is good-natured but sometimes shows her frustration, and has odd moments of malice. In \"[[The Kipper and the Corpse]]\", the pampered [[shih-tzu]] dog of an elderly guest bites Polly and Manuel. As revenge, Polly laces the dog's sausages with black pepper and [[Tabasco sauce]] (\"bangers a la bang\"), making it ill.\n\nDespite her part-time employment (during meal times), Polly frequently is saddled with many other duties, including manager in \"[[The Germans]]\" when Sybil and Basil are incapacitated. In the first series, Polly is said to be an art student who, according to Basil, has spent three years at college. In \"[[Gourmet Night]]\", she is seen to draw a sketch (presumably an [[impressionist]]ic [[caricature]]) of Basil, which everyone but Basil immediately recognises. Polly is not referred to as a student in the second series, although in both series she is shown to have a flair for languages, displaying ability in both Spanish and German. In \"The Germans\", Basil alludes to Polly's polyglot inclination by saying that she does her work \"while learning two Oriental languages.\" Like Manuel, she has a room of her own at the hotel.\n\n===Manuel===\n{{main|Manuel (Fawlty Towers)}}\n[[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|Manuel]], a waiter played by [[Andrew Sachs]], is a well-meaning but disorganised and confused [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] from [[Barcelona]] with a poor grasp of the English language and customs.  He is verbally and physically abused by his boss. When told what to do, he often responds, \"\u00bfQu\u00e9?\" (\"What?\"). Manuel's character is used to demonstrate Basil's instinctive lack of sensitivity and tolerance. Every episode involves Basil becoming enraged at Manuel's confusion at his boss's bizarre demands and even basic requests. Manuel is afraid of Fawlty's quick temper and violent assaults, yet often expresses his appreciation for being given employment. He is relentlessly enthusiastic and is proud of what little English he knows.\n\nDuring the series, Sachs was seriously injured twice. Cleese describes using a real metal pan to knock Manuel unconscious in \"[[The Wedding Party (Fawlty Towers)|The Wedding Party]]\", although he would have preferred to use a rubber one. The original producer and director, John Howard Davies, said that he made Basil use a metal one and that he was responsible for most of the violence on the show, which he felt was essential to the type of comical farce they were creating. Later, when Sachs's clothes were treated to give off smoke after he escapes the burning kitchen in \"[[The Germans]]\", the corrosive chemicals ate through them and gave Sachs severe burns.<ref>John Cleese, VHS or DVD cast interview, 1998</ref>\n\nManuel's exaggerated Spanish accent is part of the humour of the show. In fact, Sachs's original language was German; he emigrated to Britain as a child.<ref>{{cite news | title =Variety Club \u2013 Jewish Chronicle colour supplement \"350 years\"| pages=28\u201329| publisher =The Jewish Chronicle| date =15 December 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe character's nationality was switched to Italian (and the name to Paolo) for the Spanish dub of the show, while in [[Catalonia]] and [[France]], Manuel is a Mexican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvdenlared.com/dvd/Fawlty%20Towers:%20Volumen%201/Analisis/20050109015234.html|title=Fawlty Towers: Volumen 1|last=G\u00f3mez Tato|first=David|date=2005-01-09|website=DVDenlared|publisher=Sync Intertainment S.L.|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603104423/http://dvdenlared.com/dvd/Fawlty%20Towers:%20Volumen%201/Analisis/20050109015234.html|archive-date=2009-06-03|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Other regular characters and themes===\n* Terry Hughes, played by [[Brian Hall (actor)|Brian Hall]], appears in only the second series of episodes. He is the sly, somewhat shifty [[Cockney]] chef at Fawlty Towers.<ref>McCann (2007) p.204</ref>  Though apparently a competent chef (\"I 'ave been to catering school!\"), Terry's cooking methods are somewhat casual, which frustrates and worries the neurotic Basil. He used to work in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] (not at the [[Dorchester Hotel|Dorchester]], as believed by a guest). In \"[[The Anniversary (Fawlty Towers)|The Anniversary]]\" Terry and Manuel come to blows since Terry doesn't like anyone else cooking in his kitchen, so he proceeds to sabotage the [[paella]] Manuel is making for Sybil, leading to fisticuffs at the end of the episode. Cleese himself told Hall to portray Terry as if he were on the run from the police.\n* [[Major Gowen]], played by [[Ballard Berkeley]], is a slightly senile, amiable old soldier who is a permanent resident of the hotel.<ref name=\"Slide1996\">{{cite book | page=21 | title=Some Joe you don't know: an American biographical guide to 100 British television personalities | first=Anthony | last=Slide | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=1996 | isbn=0-313-29550-6 }}</ref><ref name=\"Terrace1985\">{{cite  book | page=141 | title=Encyclopedia of Television Series, Pilots and Specials: 1974\u20131984 | first=Vincent | last=Terrace | publisher=VNR AG | year=1985 | isbn=0-918432-61-8 }}</ref>  He is one of the few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is because he has the [[The Establishment|establishment]] status that Basil craves. He usually wears the [[Royal Artillery]] jagged-striped tie, and once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir being in France in 1918. He often is introduced as their \"oldest resident\" and in the episode \"Waldorf Salad\" Basil reveals that the Major has lived there for seven years. He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers' strikes (the frequent strikes at [[British Leyland]] during the time of the series' original transmission were often mentioned), and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode \"[[List of Fawlty Towers episodes|The Germans]]\" he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. The best he can say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between \"[[Wog#British English|wogs]]\" and \"[[Nigger#British|niggers]]\"\u2014but in a manner innocent of malice or bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode \"[[Communication Problems]]\" in which Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil.\n* [[Miss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby]], played by [[Gilly Flower]] and [[Renee Roberts]], are the other two permanent residents. Seemingly inseparable, these sweet-natured, dotty spinsters appear to have taken a fancy to Basil, feeling that they need to take care of him. In response, Basil vacillates between [[superficial charm]] and blunt rudeness during his conversations with them.<ref name=\"Slide1996\" /><ref name=\"Terrace1985\" /><ref>{{cite book | page=20 | title=Extras und Co- Die Faszination der Groteske: Eine Untersuchung der kom\u00f6diantischen Sch(m)erzgrenze in der britischen Fernsehserie | first=Marlies | last=Bayha | publisher=GRIN Verlag | year=2009 | isbn=3-640-43074-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o21AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wacMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4600,3809655&dq=miss-tibbs+miss-gatsby&hl=en | title=The war of the channel chuckles | first=Paul | last=Foster | journal=Evening Times | page=8 | date=19 September 1975 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Monty Python encyclopedia | first=Robert | last=Ross | publisher=TV Books | year=1999 | isbn=1-57500-036-9 |pages=63, 70 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=\"I'm sick to death with you...\" or External Character Conflicts in Fawlty Towers | first=Alexander | last=Grewe | isbn=978-3-638-42885-9 | doi=10.3239/9783638428859 | publisher=grin.com }}</ref>\n* Audrey is Sybil's lifelong best friend, and is mostly acknowledged during gossipy telephone calls. Talking with her is a refuge for Sybil. When times get tough for Audrey, who has a dysfunctional relationship with her husband George, Sybil will offer solutions and guidance, often resulting in the catchphrase \"Ohhh, I knowwww...\" when she tries to commiserate with Audrey's problems. In Audrey's one on-screen appearance,  in \"The Anniversary\", she is played by actress Christine Shaw. Basil tells Major Gowan that he thinks she is a \"dreadful woman.\"\n* The paperboy, though rarely seen, is revealed at the beginning of ''The Psychiatrist'' in the second series to be the prankster who rearranges the letters on the \"Fawlty Towers\" sign to sometimes crude phrases. The shot of the hotel's sign appears at the beginning of every episode except \"The Germans\", when a hospital exterior is used as an [[establishing shot]].\n\n===Guest characters===\n\n{{details|topic=guest characters|List of guest characters in Fawlty Towers}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Series\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! colspan=\"2\"| Originally aired\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\"| DVD release date\n|-\n!

The 12th and final episode was first shown on 25 October 1979. The first series was directed by John Howard Davies, the second by Bob Spiers. Both had their premieres on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].\n\nWhen originally transmitted, the individual episodes had no on-screen titles. The ones in common currency were first used for the VHS release of the series in the 1980s. There were working titles, such as \"USA\" for \"Waldorf Salad\", \"Death\" for \"The Kipper and the Corpse\" and \"Rat\" for \"Basil the Rat\", which have been printed in some programme guides. In addition, some of the early BBC audio releases of episodes on vinyl and cassette included other variations, such as \"Mrs. Richards\" and \"The Rat\" for \"Communication Problems\" and \"Basil the Rat\" respectively.\n\nIt has long been rumoured that a 13th episode of the series was written and filmed, but never progressed further than a rough cut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fawltysite.net/thirteenth-episode.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403090421/http://www.fawltysite.net/thirteenth-episode.htm |archivedate=3 April 2007 |title=fawltysite.net \u2013 Thirteenth Episode|year=2004}}</ref>  Lars Holger Holm, author of the book ''Fawlty Towers: A Worshipper's Companion,'' has made detailed claims about the episode's content, but he provides no concrete evidence of its existence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tellyspotting.kera.org/2005/12/04/13th-episode-of-fawlty-towers-basil-and-numerology-interview-with-lars-holger-holm-author-of-fawlty-towers-a-worshippers-companion/|title=13th Episode Of Fawlty Towers?

The plot, never fleshed out beyond his initial idea, would have revolved around the chaos that a now-retired Basil typically caused as he and Sybil flew to [[Barcelona]] to visit their former employee Manuel and his family. Of the idea, Cleese said:\n\n<blockquote>We had an idea for a plot which I loved. Basil was finally invited to Spain to meet Manuel's family. He gets to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and then spends about 14 frustrating hours waiting for the flight. Finally, on the plane, a terrorist pulls a gun and tries to hijack the thing. Basil is so angry he overcomes the terrorist, and when the pilot says, 'We have to fly back to Heathrow' Basil says, 'No, fly us to Spain or I'll shoot you.' He arrives in Spain, is immediately arrested,  and spends the entire holiday in a Spanish jail. He is released just in time to go back on the plane with Sybil.\n\nIt was very funny, but I couldn't do it at the time. Making 'Fawlty Towers' work at 90 minutes was a very difficult proposition. You can build up the comedy for 30 minutes, but at that length there has to be a trough and another peak. It doesn't interest me. I don't want to do it.</blockquote>\n\nCleese also may have relented because of the lack of [[Connie Booth]]'s involvement. She had practically retreated from public life after the show finished (and had been initially unwilling to collaborate on a second series, which explains the four-year gap between productions).\n\nThe decision by Cleese and Booth to quit before a third series often has been lauded as it ensured the show's successful status would not be weakened with later, lower-quality work. Subsequently, it has inspired the makers of other shows to do likewise. Most notably, [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]] refused to make a third series of either ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' or ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', citing ''Fawlty Towers' '' short lifespan. [[Rik Mayall]], [[Ben Elton]] and [[Lise Mayer]], the writers behind ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', which also ran for only two series (each with six episodes), used this explanation as well. [[Victoria Wood]] also indicated this influenced her decision to limit ''[[Dinnerladies]]'' to 16 episodes over two series.\n\nThe origins, background and eventual cancellation of the series would later be humorously referenced in 1987's \"[[The Secret Policeman's Third Ball]]\" in a sketch in which [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Stephen Fry]] present Cleese \u2014 who they comically misname \"Jim Cleese\" \u2014 with a [[Dick Emery]] Lifetime Achievement Award (\"Silver Dick\") for his contributions to comedy, then launch into a comical series of questions regarding the show, including Cleese's marriage and divorce from Booth, innocently ridiculing Cleese and reducing him to tears, to a point at which he gets on his knees and crawls off the stage while crying.\n\n===Series 1 (1975)===\n*\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"width:100%; margin-right:0;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#deaf77; color:#fff;\"| Series No.\n! style=\"background:#deaf77; color:#fff;\"| Episode No.\n! style=\"background:#deaf77; color:#fff;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#deaf77; color:#fff;\"| Sign reads\n! style=\"background:#deaf77; color:#fff;\"| Original air date\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = [[A Touch of Class (Fawlty Towers)|A Touch of Class]]\n |Aux1 = FAWLTY TOWER'''''S''''' <small>(Crooked S)</small>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1975|9|19|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary = As Basil tries to raise the tone of the hotel, the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.

''Fawlty Towers'' became a huge success in almost all countries in which it aired. Although it initially was a flop in Spain, largely because of the portrayal of the Spanish waiter Manuel, it was successfully resold with the Manuel character's nationality changed to Italian<ref name=museumTV/> except in Spain's Catalan region where Manuel was Mexican.<ref name=\"manuel\"/> To show how badly it translated, Clive James picked up a clip containing Manuel's \"\u00bfQu\u00e9?\" phrase to show on ''[[Clive James on Television]]'' in 1982. The series also briefly was broadcast in Italy in the 1990s on the satellite channel Canal Jimmy, in the original English with Italian subtitles.\n\nIn Australia, the show originally was broadcast on [[ABC Television]], the first series in 1976 and the second series in 1980. The show then was sold to the [[Seven Network]] where it has been repeated numerous times.\n\n==Home video releases and merchandise==\nTwo record albums were released by [[BBC Records]]. The first album, simply titled ''Fawlty Towers'', was released in 1979 and contained the audio from \"Communication Problems\" (as \"Mrs Richards\") and \"Hotel Inspectors\". The second album, titled ''Second Sitting'', was released in 1981 and contained audio from \"Basil the Rat\" (as \"The Rat\") and \"The Builders\".\n\n''Fawlty Towers'' originally was released by BBC Video in 1984, with three episodes on each of four tapes. Each tape was edited with the credits from all three episodes put at the end of the tape. A Laserdisc containing all episodes spliced together as a continuous episode was released in the U.S. on 23 June 1993. It was re-released in 1994, unedited but digitally remastered. It also was re-released in 1998 with a special interview with John Cleese. ''Fawlty Towers \u2013 The Complete Series'' was released on DVD on 16 October 2001, available in [[DVD region code|regions]] 1, 2 and 4. A \"Collector's Edition\" is available in region 2.\n\nSeries one of the show was released on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] Video for [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]. In July 2009, BBC America announced a DVD re-release of the ''Fawlty Towers'' series. The DVD set was released on 20 October 2009. The reissue, titled ''Fawlty Towers Remastered: Special Edition,'' contains commentary by John Cleese on every episode as well as remastered video and audio.

An example is the English ''embarrassed'' and the Spanish ''[[embarazada]]'' (which means ''pregnant''), or the word ''sensible'', which means ''reasonable'' in English, but ''sensitive'' in [[:wikt:sensible#French|French]] and [[:wikt:sensible#Spanish|Spanish]]. \n\nThe term originates from a book by French linguists describing the phenomenon, which was translated in 1928 and entitled, \"false friend of a translator\".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThere is often a partial overlap in meanings, which creates additional complications.\n\nAs well as producing completely false friends, the use of [[loanword]]s often results in the use of a word in a restricted [[Context (language use)|context]], which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language. For example, ''angst'' means \"fear\" in a general sense (as well as \"anxiety\") in German, but when it was borrowed into English in the context of psychology, its meaning was restricted to a particular type of fear described as \"a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blvoc_gerloan.htm|title=German Loan Words in English|publisher=About.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> Also, ''gymnasium'' meant both 'a place of education' and 'a place for exercise' in Latin, but its meaning was restricted to the former in German and to the latter in English, making the expressions into false friends in those languages as well as in Greek, where it started out as 'a place for naked exercise'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=gymnasium|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=etymolyonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>\n\n== Definition and origin ==\n\nFalse friends, or bilingual homophones<ref name=\"Korpela-2014\">{{cite book |last=Korpela |first=Jukka K. |title=Introduction to Finnish |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ld9BBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT35 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |date=12 August 2014 |publisher=Suomen E-painos Oy |location=Helsinki |isbn=978-952-6613-26-0 |page=35}}</ref> are words in two or more languages that [[homonym|look]] or [[homophone|sound]] similar, but differ significantly in meaning.<ref name=\"Knospe-2016\">{{cite book |last1=Knospe |first1=Sebastian  |last2=Onysko |first2=Alexander  |last3=Goth |first3=Maik |title=Crossing Languages to Play with Words: Multidisciplinary Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuUsDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA116 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |date=26 September 2016 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-046560-0 |page=116 |oclc=954201320}}</ref><ref name=\"Korpela-2014\"/>\n\nThe origin of the term is as a shortened version of the expression \"false friend of a translator\", the English translation of a French expression ({{lang-fr|faux amis du traducteur}}) introduced by linguists Maxime K\u0153ssler and Jules Derocquigny in their 1928 book,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0aFqB-R0MrgC&pg=PA698 books.google.com]</ref> ''False Friends, or the Pitfalls of the English Vocabulary'' (''Les Faux Amis ou les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais'')<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lesfauxamisoules00kssl archive.org]</ref> with a sequel, ''Autres Mots anglais perfides''.\n\n== Implications ==\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=May 2018}}\nFalse friends can cause difficulty for people who might interpret a foreign text incorrectly.  Students learning a foreign language, particularly one that is related to their [[First language|native language]], also have difficulty with false friends because students are likely to identify the words wrongly due to [[language transfer|linguistic interference]]. For this reason, teachers sometimes compile lists of false friends as an aid for their students.\n\n== Causes ==\nFrom the [[etymology|etymological]] point of view, false friends can be created in several ways.\n\n=== Shared etymology ===\nIf language A borrowed a word from language B, or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor, and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages, a [[First language|native speaker]] of one language will face a false friend when learning the other. Sometimes, presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language, but the cognate words got different restricted senses in Language A and Language B.{{citation needed |date=March 2013}}\n\n''Actual'', which in English is usually a synonym of ''real'', has a different meaning in other European languages, in which it means 'current' or 'up-to-date', and has the logical derivative as a [[verb]], meaning 'to make current' or 'to update'. ''Actualise'' (or 'actualize') in English means 'to make a reality of'.<ref>{{citation |title=Euro-English: assessing variety status\n|last=Mollin |first=Sandra |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPhULmMmqJMC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=using+actual+to+mean+current#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe word ''friend'' itself has cognates in the other Germanic languages; but the Scandinavian ones (like Swedish ''fr\u00e4nde'', Danish ''fr\u00e6nde'') predominantly mean 'relative'. The original [[Proto-Germanic]] word meant simply 'someone whom one cares for' and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative, but lost various degrees of the 'friend' sense in Scandinavian languages, while it mostly lost the sense of 'relative' in English. (The plural ''friends'' is still rarely used for \"kinsfolk\", as in the Scottish proverb ''Friends agree best at a distance'', quoted in 1721.)\n\nThe [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Finnish language]]s are closely related, which gives rise to false friends:<ref name=\"Knospe-2016\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''humoroso'' ('capricious') changed its referent in American Portuguese to 'humorous', owing to the [[English language|English]] surface-cognate ''humorous.''{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n''[[Corn]]'' was originally the dominant type of grain in a region (indeed ''corn'' and ''grain'' are themselves [[cognate]]s from the same Indo-European root).

There are several possible objectives: \n* to conduct a company [[stock valuation]] and predict its probable price evolution;\n* to make a projection on its business performance;\n* to evaluate its management and make internal business decisions and/or to calculate its [[credit risk]].\n* to find out the intrinsic value of the share.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fundamentalsofaccounting.org/fundamental-technical-analysis/|title=Fundamental and Technical analysis {{!}} Fundamentals of Accounting|date=2016-07-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==The two analytical models==\nThere are two basic methodologies investors rely upon when the objective of the analysis is to determine what stock to buy and at what price, :\n#Fundamental analysis maintains that markets may  incorrectly price a security in the short run but that the \"correct\" price will eventually be reached. [[Profit (accounting)|Profits]] can be made by purchasing the  wrongly priced security and then waiting for the market to recognize its \"mistake\" and reprice the security.\n#[[Technical analysis]] maintains that all information is reflected already in the price of a [[Security (finance)|security]]. Technical analysts look at trends and believe that sentiment changes predate and predict trend changes. Investors' emotional responses to price movements lead to recognizable price chart patterns. Technical analysts also evaluate historical trends to predict future price movement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=John J.|title=Technical analysis of the financial markets : a comprehensive guide to trading methods and applications|date=1999|publisher=[[New York Institute of Finance]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0735200661|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nInvestors can use one or both of these complementary methods for stock picking. For example, many fundamental investors use technicals for deciding entry and exit points.  Similarly,  a large proportion of technical investors use fundamentals to limit their universe of possible stock to \"good\" companies.\n\nThe choice of stock analysis is determined by the investor's belief in the different paradigms for \"how the stock market works\".For explanations of these paradigms, see the discussions at [[efficient-market hypothesis]], [[random walk hypothesis]], [[capital asset pricing model]], [[Fed model]] Theory of Equity Valuation, [[market-based valuation]], and [[behavioral finance]].\n\nFundamental analysis includes:\n#Economic analysis\n#Industry analysis\n#Company analysis\n\nThe intrinsic value of the shares is determined based upon these three analyses. It is this value that is considered the true value of the share. If the intrinsic value is higher than the market price,  buying the share is recommended. If it is equal to market price, it is recommended to hold the share; and if it is less than the market price, then one should sell the shares.\n\n==Use by different portfolio styles==\nInvestors may also use fundamental analysis within different [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] [[Investment management|management]] [[investor profile|styles]].\n*[[Buy and hold]] investors believe that latching on to good businesses allows the investor's asset to grow with the business. Fundamental analysis lets them find \"good\" companies, so they lower their risk and the probability of wipe-out.\n*[[value investing|Value investors]] restrict their attention to under-valued companies, believing that \"it's hard to fall out of a ditch\".  The values they follow come from fundamental analysis.\n*Managers may use fundamental analysis to correctly value \"good\" and \"bad\" companies. \"Bad\" companies' stock prices will eventually fluctuate, which  can create opportunities for profit.\n*Managers may also consider the economic cycle in determining whether conditions are \"right\" to buy fundamentally suitable companies.\n*[[Contrarian investing|Contrarian investors]] hold that \"in the short run, the market is a voting machine, not a weighing machine\".<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Graham|first1 = Benjamin|last2 = Dodd|first2 = David|title = Security Analysis|publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]|date = December 10, 2004|isbn = 978-0-07-144820-8}}</ref> Fundamental analysis allows a broker to make his or her own decision on value, while ignoring the opinions of the market.\n*Managers may use fundamental analysis to determine future growth rates for buying high priced [[growth stock]]s.\n*Managers may include fundamental factors along with technical factors in computer models ([[quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]]).\n\n==Top-down and bottom-up approaches==\nInvestors using fundamental analysis can use either a top-down or bottom-up approach.\n*The top-down investor starts their analysis with global economics, including both international and national [[economic indicator]]s. These may include [[GDP]] growth rates, [[inflation]], [[interest rate]]s, [[exchange rate]]s, [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], and energy prices. They subsequently narrow their search to regional/ industry analysis of total sales, price levels, the effects of competing products, foreign competition, and entry or exit from the industry. Only then do they refine their search to the best business in the area being studied.\n*The bottom-up investor starts with specific businesses, regardless of their industry/region, and proceeds in reverse of the top-down approach.\n\n==Procedures==\nThe analysis of a business's health starts with a financial statement analysis that includes [[financial ratio]]s. It looks at dividends paid, [[operating cash flow]], new equity issues and capital financing. The earnings estimates and growth rate projections published widely by [[Thomson Reuters]] and others can be considered either \"fundamental\" (they are facts) or \"technical\" (they are investor sentiment) based on perception of their validity.\n\nDetermined growth rates (of income and cash) and risk levels (to determine the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]]) are used in various valuation models. The foremost is the [[discounted cash flow]] model, which calculates the present value of the future:\n*[[dividend]]s received by the investor, along with the eventual sale price; ([[Gordon model]])\n*earnings of the company;\n*or [[cash flow]]s of the company.\n\nThe amount of debt a company possesses is also a major consideration in determining its health. It can be quickly assessed using the [[debt-to-equity ratio]] and the ''current ratio'' (current assets/current liabilities).\n\nThe simple model commonly used is the [[P/E ratio]] (price-to-earnings ratio). Implicit in this model of a perpetual annuity ([[time value of money]]) is that the \"flip\" of the P/E is the discount rate appropriate to the risk of the business. The multiple accepted is adjusted for expected growth (which is not built into the model).\n\nGrowth estimates are incorporated into the [[PEG ratio]]. Its validity depends on the length of time analysts believe the growth will continue. IGAR models can be used to impute expected changes in growth from current P/E and historical growth rates for the stocks relative to a comparison index.\n\nComputer modelling of stock prices has now replaced much of the subjective interpretation of fundamental data (along with technical data) in the industry. Since about the year 2000, a new job role has been invented with computers now able to crunch vast amounts of data . At some funds  (Quant Funds) managers' decisions have been replaced by proprietary mathematical models.\n\n==Automation==\nThe process of fundamental analysis has significantly dropped in difficulty over the past 10 years. Ever since computers became a household product, people have built software designed to make the investor's life easier. Fundamental analysis is one of the most time consuming forms of analysis. Furthermore, with the fast paced trading style of the 21st century, where markets are dominated by HFT firms and day traders, it is difficult to keep up with the market in a timely fashion. One way to go about cutting down analysis time, is to subscribe to either free or paid screening services. Screening services will allow you to search the entire market for stocks that match the quantitative fields you are looking for. These types of software then automatically give you results, hence cutting down on time spent sifting through SEC filings.\n\nReference - [[Fundamental Analysis Software]] for more information on fundamental analysis software.\n\n==Criticisms==\n*Economists such as [[Burton Malkiel]] suggest that neither fundamental analysis nor [[technical analysis]] is useful in outperforming the markets<ref>{{cite web|title = Financial Concepts: Random Walk Theory|publisher = Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/university/concepts/concepts5.asp}}</ref>.

The program was created and produced by [[David Angell]], [[Peter Casey (screenwriter)|Peter Casey]], and [[David Lee (screenwriter)|David Lee]] (as [[Grub Street Productions]]) in association with [[Grammnet Productions|Grammnet]] (2004) and [[Paramount Television|Paramount Network Television]]. The series was created as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Cheers]]'',  continuing the story of psychiatrist [[Frasier Crane]] as he returned to his hometown of [[Seattle]] and started building a new life as a radio advice show host while reconnecting with his father and brother. ''Frasier'' stars [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Jane Leeves]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Peri Gilpin]], and [[John Mahoney]]. The show was critically acclaimed, with the show itself and the cast winning thirty-seven [[Emmy]] Awards, a record at the time for a scripted series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/game-of-thrones-emmys-record.html|title=Game of Thrones Breaks Frasier\u2019s Emmy Record for Most Wins Ever for a Scripted Series|publisher=}}</ref> It also won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series for five consecutive years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/14/news/mn-22669|title='Frasier' Wins Record Fifth Straight Emmy|first=BRIAN|last=LOWRY|date=September 14, 1998|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{See also|List of Frasier episodes}}\n\n[[Psychiatry|Psychiatrist]] [[Frasier Crane|Dr. Frasier Crane]] (Grammer) returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington, following the end of his [[marriage]] and his life in [[Boston]] (as seen in ''Cheers''). His plans for a new life as a [[bachelor]] are challenged when he is obliged to take in his father, [[Martin Crane|Martin]] (Mahoney), a retired [[Seattle Police Department]] detective, who has mobility problems after being shot in the line of duty during a robbery.\n\nFrasier hires [[Daphne Moon]] (Leeves) as Martin's live-in [[Physical therapy|physical therapist]] and [[caregiver]], and tolerates Martin's dog [[Minor characters on Frasier#Eddie|Eddie]]. Frasier frequently spends time with his younger brother [[Niles Crane|Niles]] (Pierce), a fellow psychiatrist. Niles becomes attracted to, and eventually falls in love with, Daphne (notwithstanding his own marriage), but does not confess his feelings to her until the [[Something Borrowed, Someone Blue|final episode of the seventh season]].\n\nFrasier hosts ''The Dr. Frasier Crane Show'', a call-in psychiatry show on talk radio station KACL. His producer [[Roz Doyle]] (Gilpin) is very different from Frasier in many ways. She is [[working class]], has cheap tastes and, at least early in the series, has superficial relationships with many men. However, Roz and Frasier share a professional respect, and over time, they become best friends. Frasier and the others often visit the local coffee shop, Caf\u00e9 Nervosa.\n\nThe Crane sons, who possess expensive tastes, intellectual interests, and high opinions of themselves, frequently clash with their [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[Average Joe]] father. The brothers' close relationship is often tense, and their sibling rivalry intermittently results in chaos. For a pair who make a living solving others' problems, they are often comically inept at dealing with each other's myriad hangups. Other recurring themes include Niles' relationship with his [[unseen character|never-seen]] wife (later ex-wife) [[Maris Crane|Maris]], Frasier's search for love, Martin's new life after [[retirement]], and the various attempts by the two brothers to gain acceptance into Seattle's [[High society (social class)|cultural elite]].\n\n{{:List of Frasier episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as '''[[Frasier Crane]]''' a radio psychiatrist.\n* [[Jane Leeves]] as '''[[Daphne Moon]]''' an English [[physiotherapist]] and live-in housekeeper, hired by Frasier to help take care of Martin, who lives with them in Frasier's apartment.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as '''[[Niles Crane]]''' Frasier's younger brother, also a psychiatrist, who works in private practice.\n* [[Peri Gilpin]] as '''[[Roz Doyle]]''' is the producer of Frasier's radio show, who becomes a close family friend.\n* [[John Mahoney]] as '''[[Martin Crane]]''' Frasier and Niles' father, a Seattle police detective who was forced to retire due to a gunshot wound to his hip that led to his living with Frasier.\n* [[Dan Butler]] as '''[[Minor characters on Frasier#Bob \"Bulldog\" Briscoe|Bob \"Bulldog\" Briscoe]]''' (seasons 4\u20136; recurring season 1; special appearance seasons 2\u20133; special guest seasons 7 & 9\u201311) is a male chauvinist, horny, boastful host of a sports radio talk show that followed Frasier's daily broadcast at KACL.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Edward Hibbert]] as '''Gil Chesterton''' (seasons 2\u20138 & 10\u201311; guest season 1), KACL's flamboyant, effeminate restaurant critic\n* [[Patrick Kerr]] as '''Noel Shempsky''' (seasons 6\u201311; guest seasons 1 & 3\u20135) KACL technical assistant and avid ''[[Star Trek]]'' aficionado who speaks [[Klingon (language)|Klingon]] and constantly hits on Roz\n* [[Tom McGowan]] as '''Kenny Daly''' (seasons 7\u201311; guest seasons 5\u20136), KACL's station manager\n* [[Millicent Martin]] as '''Gertrude Moon''' (season 9; guest season 7), Daphne's mother\n* [[Brian Klugman]] as '''Kirby''' (season 9; guest season 8), Bob and Lana's son, and part-timer at KACL\n* Ashley Thomas as '''Alice Doyle''' (seasons 10\u201311; co-star season 9), Roz's daughter\n\n{{See also|Minor characters on Frasier}}\n\n===Notes===\nThe main cast remained unchanged for all 11 years.{{r|mcfadden}} When the series ended in 2004, Grammer had portrayed the character of Frasier Crane for a total of 20 years, including his nine seasons on ''Cheers'' plus a one time performance as the character on the series ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'' which earned Grammer an Emmy nomination; at the time, he tied [[James Arness]]' portrayal of [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Matt Dillon]] on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' for the longest-running character on primetime television.<ref name=indyheart /> The record has since been surpassed in animation by the voice cast of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and in live action by [[Richard Belzer]]'s portrayal of [[John Munch]] on the series ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' and ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]''. Grammer was briefly the highest-paid television actor in the United States for his portrayal of Frasier, while Jane Leeves was the highest-paid British actress.<ref name=indyheart>{{cite news|last=Gorman |first=Steve |title=Kelsey Grammer has heart attack |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/kelsey-grammer--has-heart-attack-838970.html |date=June 3, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227095325/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/kelsey-grammer--has-heart-attack-838970.html |archivedate=February 27, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=bbcNewsmakers>{{cite news |last=Frost |first=Caroline |title=Frasier: Goodnight Seattle... |date=2003-01-24 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2691735.stm|accessdate=February 20, 2009 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FrazierCap.theora.ogv|left|thumb|The main characters in Frasier selling US Treasury Bonds]]\nIn addition to those of the ensemble, additional story lines included characters from Frasier's former incarnation on ''Cheers'', such as his ex-wife [[Lilith Sternin]], played by [[Bebe Neuwirth]], and their son Frederick, played by [[Trevor Einhorn]].\n\n=== Reunions ===\nGrammer had been the voice of [[Sideshow Bob]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' since 1990. In a 1997 episode (while ''Frasier'' was still in production), the character's brother, [[Cecil Terwilliger]], was introduced, played by Pierce, as referenced in the episode title, \"[[Brother from Another Series]]\". The episode contained numerous ''Frasier'' references, including a ''Frasier''-style version of ''The Simpsons'' theme for a transition and its iconic title card for the same thing. Pierce returned as Cecil for the second time (the first since ''Frasier'' had concluded) alongside Grammer in the 2007 episode \"[[Funeral for a Fiend]]\". The episode introduced the brothers' father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger,  who was portrayed by Mahoney.\n\nCast-member reunions also occurred on four episodes of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', which featured Leeves in the main cast along with [[Wendie Malick]] (who played Martin's girlfriend towards the end of ''Frasier''). In the season-two episode \"Unseparated at Birth\" and season-three episode \"Funeral Crashers\", Mahoney guest-stars as a waiter smitten with [[Betty White]]'s character. Gilpin appears in the episode \"I Love Lucci (Part 1)\", and [[Tom McGowan]] (who played Kenny Daly) appears in \"Love Thy Neighbor\" as a casting director. ''Hot in Cleveland'' was created and produced by [[Suzanne Martin]], who wrote multiple episodes of ''Frasier''.\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|List of Frasier writers}}\n\n=== Creation ===\nDuring the eighth season of ''Cheers'', Grammer made a deal with former ''Cheers'' producers David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee (who were moving on to produce ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'') that they would do a new series together once ''Cheers'' ended.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" /> Once it became clear during the 10th season that the 11th would be the last, the group began working on their next series together.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" />\n\nGrammer did not originally want to continue playing Frasier Crane, and Angell, Casey, and Lee did not want the new show to be compared to ''Cheers'', which they had worked on before ''Wings''. The three proposed that the actor play a wealthy, [[Malcolm Forbes]]-like [[paraplegic]] publisher who operated his business from his apartment. The main show featured a \"street-smart\" Hispanic [[live-in nurse]] who would clash with the main character.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" /> While Grammer liked the concept, [[Paramount Television]] disliked it, and suggested that the best route would be to spin off the Frasier Crane character.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" /> Grammer ultimately agreed to star in a ''Cheers'' spin-off, but the producers set the new show as far from Boston as possible to prevent NBC from demanding that other characters from the old show make [[fictional crossover#Television series|guest appearances on the new show]] during its first season. After first choosing [[Denver]], Angell, Casey, and Lee ultimately chose Seattle as the setting.<ref name=\"casey20061206\">{{cite web|last=Casey|first=Peter|title=How FRASIER came to be|url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2006/12/how-frasier-came-to-be.html|publisher=kenlevine.blogspot.com|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe creators did not want Frasier in private practice, which would make the show resemble ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. Taking from an unused idea they had for a ''Cheers'' episode, they conceived the idea of the psychiatrist working in a radio station surrounded by \"wacky, yet loveable\" characters.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" /> After realizing that such a setting resembled ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', the creators decided to emphasize Frasier's home life, which ''Cheers'' had rarely explored.{{r|casey20061206}} Lee thought of his own experiences with \"the relationship between an aging father and the grown-up son he never understood\"{{r|allinthefamily}} and thought it would be a good theme for ''Frasier''. Although Frasier had mentioned on ''Cheers'' that his father, a research scientist, had died,<ref name=\"ComedyFan2010\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539919/|title=\"Cheers\" Two Girls for Every Boyd (TV Episode 1989)|author=ComedyFan2010|date=June 9, 2014|work=IMDb|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> they decided to overlook the discrepancy (which they attempted to explain in a second-season episode). One element of the original concept that was carried over was the live-in health-care provider which would be for Frasier's father. Grammer points out that very little of the Frasier Crane of ''Cheers'' carried over to ''Frasier'', as his family history was changed, the setting, his job, and even the character himself changed from the ''Cheers'' predecessor, having to be more grounded as the central character of the show so the other supporting characters could be more eccentric.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nMartin Crane was based on creator Casey's father, who spent 34 years with the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. The creators suggested to NBC that they would like to cast someone like Mahoney, to which NBC told them if they could get Mahoney, they could hire him without auditions.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" /> Both Grammer and the producers contacted Mahoney, with the producers flying to Chicago to show Mahoney the pilot script over dinner. Upon reading the script, Mahoney accepted. Grammer, who lost his father as a child, and the childless Mahoney immediately built a close father-son relationship.<ref name=\"allinthefamily\" /> In discussing Martin's nurse, [[Warren Littlefield]] of NBC suggested she be English instead of Hispanic and suggested Leeves for the role.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" /> Grammer was initially reluctant, as he thought the casting made the show resemble ''[[Nanny and the Professor]]'', but approved Leeves after a meeting and [[read-through]] with her. Mahoney and Leeves quickly bonded over their shared English heritage; Mahoney was originally from Manchester where Leeves' character is from.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" />\n\nThe character of Niles was not part of the original concept for the show. Frasier had told his bar friends on ''Cheers'' that he was an only child.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\">\"Behind The Couch: The Making of Frasier\", DVD Extra, Season 1</ref><ref name=\"allinthefamily\">{{cite news| last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=All in Their Family|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1998/mar/01/entertainment/ca-24256|date=March 1, 1998|accessdate=February 20, 2009}}</ref> However, Sheila Guthrie, the assistant casting director on ''Wings'', brought the producers a photo of Pierce (whom she knew from his work on ''[[The Powers That Be (TV series)|The Powers That Be]]'') and noted his resemblance to Grammer when he first appeared on ''Cheers''. She recommended him should they ever want Frasier to have a brother. The creators were \"blown away\" both by his resemblance to Grammer and by his acting ability{{r|casey20061206}}.

Once he was given a script, he was initially concerned that his character was essentially a duplicate of Frasier, thinking that it would not work.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" />\nThe first table reading of the pilot script was notable because the producers had never heard either Pierce or Mahoney read lines because they were cast without auditions.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" />\n\nThe only main role that required an audition was Roz Doyle,{{r|casey20061206}} who was named in memory of a producer of ''Wings''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Joyce Saenz |title=Dallas actress finds second home on ''Frasier'' |work=The Dallas Morning News |date=May 5, 1996<!--|accessdate=February 20, 2009-->}}</ref> The producers auditioned around 300 actresses with no particular direction in mind. Women of all ethnicities were considered.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" /> [[Lisa Kudrow]] was originally cast in the role, but during rehearsals, the producers decided they needed someone who could appear more assertive in her job and take control over Frasier at KACL, and Kudrow did not fit that role. The creators quickly hired Gilpin, their second choice.<ref name=\"casey20061208\">{{cite web|last=Casey|first=Peter|title=FRASIER starring Lisa Kudrow?|url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2006/12/frasier-starring-lisa-kudrow.html|publisher=kenlevine.blogspot.com|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Zaslow | first = Jeffrey | title = Balancing friends and family | work = USA Weekend | date = October 8, 2000 | url = http://159.54.226.237/00_issues/001008/001008kudrow.html | accessdate =April 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe original focus of the series was intended to be the relationship between Frasier and Martin, and it was the focus of most of the first-season episodes. Once the show began airing, Niles became a [[breakout character]], and more focus was added to the brothers' relationship, and other plots centering on Niles, starting in the second season.<ref>\"Marching On to Season Two\", DVD Extra, Season 2</ref> The producers initially did not want to make Niles' wife Maris an [[unseen character]] because they did not want to draw parallels to Vera, [[Norm Peterson|Norm]]'s wife on ''Cheers''. They originally intended that she would appear after several episodes, but were so enjoying writing excuses for her absence that eventually they decided she would remain unseen, and after the increasingly eccentric characteristics ascribed to her, no real actress could portray her.<ref name=\"Behind The Couch\" />\n\n=== Sets and settings ===\nFrasier's apartment was designed to be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show's signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment's design which included elements such as a slightly split-level design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture (such as a replica of [[Coco Chanel]]'s sofa, and both [[Eames Lounge Chair|Eames]] and [[Wassily Chair]]s) and a notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept living area with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the rear upper level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and elevator doors was built, as was a powder room near the front entrance. Two corridors off the living area ostensibly led to the apartment's three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.<ref name=\"Conversation\">\"A Conversation with Art Director Roy Christopher\", DVD Extra, Season 3</ref>\n\nNo building or apartment in Seattle really has the view from Frasier's residence. It was created so the [[Space Needle]], the most iconic landmark of Seattle, would appear more prominently. According to the season-one DVD bonus features, the photograph used on the set was taken from atop a cliff, possibly the ledge at [[Kerry Park (Seattle)|Kerry Park]], a frequent photography location. Despite this, ''Frasier'' has been said to have contributed to the emergence of an upscale urban lifestyle in 1990s Seattle, with buyers seeking properties in locations resembling that depicted in the show, in search of \"that cosmopolitan feel of Frasier\".<ref name=\"mcfadden\">McFadden, Kay. \"[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040513&slug=frasier13 Condo by condo, Seattle has become a lot like 'Frasier']\". [[Seattle Times]], May 13, 2004.</ref>\n\nAnother of the primary sets was the radio studio at KACL from which Frasier broadcasts his show. The studio itself consists of two rooms: the broadcast booth and the control room. A section of the corridor outside of the booth was also built (visible through the windows at the back of the studio) and could be shot from the side to view the corridor itself. The set was designed based on ABC's then-brand-new radio studios in Los Angeles which the production designer visited. Technical elements such as the microphones were regularly updated to conform with the latest technology. Although the studio set lacked a \"front\" wall (the [[fourth wall]]), one was built for occasional use in  episodes with certain moments shot from behind the broadcast desk, rather than in front of it as usual.<ref name=\"Conversation\" />\n\nThe producers wanted to have a gathering place outside of home and work where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style which would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on ''Cheers''. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were used for reference. A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed their coffee. The show used three versions of the interior set depending on how much space other sets for each episode required. If space for the full set was not available, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used. If space for that set was lacking, a small back section of the back of the cafe at the top of the steps could be set up under the audience [[bleacher]]s. A set was also used on occasion for the exterior patio.<ref name=\"Conversation\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe cast had an unusual amount of freedom to suggest changes to the script. Grammer used an acting method he called \"requisite disrespect\" and did not rehearse with the others, instead learning and rehearsing his lines once just before filming each scene in front of a live [[studio audience]]. Although effective, the system often caused panic among guest stars. In 1996, Grammer's recurrent alcoholism led to a car accident; the cast and crew performed an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] that persuaded him to enter the [[Betty Ford Clinic]], delaying production for a month.<ref name=\"allinthefamily\" />\n\nOnly one episode, \"[[The 1000th Show]]\", was filmed in Seattle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/frasier/the-100th-show/episode/17052/summary.html|title=Frasier\u2013Season 5, Episode 5: The 1000th Show\u2013TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> As with ''Cheers'', most episodes were filmed on Stage 25, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]],<ref name=\"allinthefamily\" /> or at various locations in and around Los Angeles.\n\nThe KACL callers' lines were read by anonymous [[voice-over]] actors during filming in front of a live audience, and during [[postproduction]], the lines were replaced by celebrities, who actually phoned in their parts without having to come into the studio. The end credits of season finales show greyscale headshots of celebrities who had \"called in\" that season. Numerous celebrities called in, including [[David Duchovny]], [[Phil Donahue]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Linda Hamilton]], [[Olympia Dukakis]], [[Daryl Hannah]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]], [[Laura Linney]], [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Estelle Parsons]]. Some \"callers\" also guest-starred, such as Parsons and Linney, who played Frasier's final love interest in the last season.\n\n==== Credits ====\nThe show's theme song, \"Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs\", is sung by Grammer and is played over the closing credits of each episode.
