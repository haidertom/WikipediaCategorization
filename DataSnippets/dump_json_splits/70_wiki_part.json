The word ''fart'' is often considered unsuitable in formal situations as it may be considered vulgar or offensive. ''Fart'' can be used as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]].<ref name = \"vxstmm\">{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fart |title=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> The immediate roots are in the Middle English words ''ferten'', ''feortan'' and ''farten'', kin of the Old High German word ''ferzan''.  Cognates are found in [[Old Norse]], Slavic and also Greek and Sanskrit. The word ''fart'' has been incorporated into the [[colloquialism|colloquial]] and [[jargon|technical speech]] of a number of occupations, including computing.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''fart'' is one of the oldest words in the English lexicon.  Its [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origins are confirmed by the many [[cognate]] words in some other [[Indo-European languages]]:  It is cognate with [[Greek language|Greek]] verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (perdomai),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*p%3Aentry+group%3D93%3Aentry%3Dpe%2Frdomai H.G.Liddell, R.

Like most Indo-European roots in the [[Germanic languages]], it was altered under [[Grimm's law]], so that Indo-European ''/p/'' > ''/f/'', and ''/d/'' > ''/t/'', as the [[German language|German]] cognate ''furzen'' also manifests.<ref>[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] (4th edition, 2000)</ref><ref>''Dictionnaire Hachette de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise'', (Hachette, 1995) {{ISBN|0-317-45629-6}}</ref><ref>T.

For example, a person may be referred to as a 'fart', or an 'old fart', not necessarily depending on the person's age.  This may convey the sense that a person is boring or unduly fussy and be intended as an insult, mainly when used in the second or third person.  For example, '\"he's a boring old fart!\"  However the word may be used as a colloquial term of [[endearment]] or in an attempt at humorous self-deprecation (e.g., in such phrases as \"I know I'm just an old fart\" or \"you do like to fart about!\").  'Fart' is often only used as a term of endearment when the subject is personally well known to the user.\n\nIn both cases though, it tends to refer to personal habits or traits that the user considers to be a negative feature of the subject, even when it is a self-reference.  For example, when concerned that a person is being overly methodical they might say 'I know I'm being an old fart', potentially to forestall negative thoughts and opinions in others. When used in an attempt to be offensive, the word is still considered vulgar, but it remains a mild example of such an insult. This usage dates back to the Medieval period, where the phrase 'not worth a fart' would be applied to an item held to be worthless.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Geoffrey |title=A History of English Words |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-18855-X |page=130}}</ref> Whilst being accused of farting may be offensive, other phrasal descriptions of flatulent discharge, in phrases such as, \"Have you dropped your guts?\", \"Have you blown one off\" or \"Who shit?\" are certainly no less so.{{citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Certain derives from sources, not [[proof by blatant assertion]]}}\n\n===Historical examples===\n[[File:Newton Bull farts G3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Treason!!!

[[Richard Newton (caricaturist)|Newton]]'s etching was probably a comment on Pitt's threat (realized the following month) to suspend [[habeas corpus]].]]\nThe word ''fart'' in [[Middle English]] occurs in \"[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]\", where one sign of summer is \"bucke uerte\u00fe\" (the [[deer|buck]] farts). It appears in several of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. In \"[[The Miller's Tale]]\", Absolon has already been tricked into kissing Alison's buttocks when he is expecting to kiss her face. Her boyfriend Nicholas hangs his [[buttocks]] out of a window, hoping to trick Absolon into kissing his buttocks in turn and then farts in the face of his rival. In \"[[The Summoner's Tale]]\", the friars in the story are to receive the smell of a fart through a twelve-spoked wheel.\n\nIn the early modern period, the word ''fart'' was not considered especially vulgar; it even surfaced in literary works. For example, [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'', published in 1755, included the word.  Johnson defined it {{vague|date=August 2016}} with two poems, one by [[Jonathan Swift]], the other by [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Ron |title=Coming Home: Saskatchewan Remembered |year=2002 |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd |isbn=1-55002-379-9 |page=95}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davyking.com/fart.htm |title=An ill wind.

On 20 July 1871, in the offices of [[The Sportsman (1865 newspaper)|''The Sportsman'' newspaper]], the FA Secretary [[C. W. Alcock]] proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\". The [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|inaugural FA Cup tournament]] kicked off in November 1871. After thirteen games in all, [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] were crowned the winners in the final, on 16 March 1872. Wanderers retained the trophy the following year. The modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888\u201389 season, when qualifying rounds were introduced.<ref>{{cite book |last= Collett |first= Mike |title= The Complete Record of The FA Cup |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-899807-19-5 |page=878}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[1914\u201315 FA Cup|1914\u201315]] edition, the competition was suspended due to the [[World War I|First World War]], and did not resume until [[1919\u201320 FA Cup|1919\u201320]]. The [[1922\u201323 FA Cup|1922\u201323]] competition saw the first final to be played in the newly opened [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] (known at the time as the Empire Stadium). Due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], the competition was not played between the [[1938\u201339 FA Cup|1938\u201339]] and [[1945\u201346 FA Cup|1945\u201346]] editions. Due to the wartime breaks, the competition did not celebrate its centenary year until [[1980\u201381 FA Cup|1980\u201381]]; fittingly the final featured a goal by [[Ricky Villa]] which was later voted the greatest goal ever scored at Wembley Stadium, but has since been replaced by [[Steven Gerrard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32628391|title=FA Cup final: The greatest goal from the last 50 years voted by you|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nHaving previously featured replays, the modern day practice of ensuring the semi-final and final matches finish on the day, was introduced from 2000 onwards.

The final returned to Wembley in 2007, followed by the semi-finals from 2008.\n\n==Eligibility==\nThe competition is open to any club down to Level 10 of the [[English football league system]] which meets the eligibility criteria. All clubs in the top four levels (the [[Premier League]] and the three divisions of the [[The Football League|Football League]]) are automatically eligible. Clubs in the next six levels ([[non-league football]]) are also eligible provided they have played in either the FA Cup, [[FA Trophy]] or [[FA Vase]] competitions in the previous season. Newly formed clubs, such as [[F.C. United of Manchester]] in [[2005\u201306 FA Cup|2005\u201306]] and also [[2006\u201307 FA Cup|2006\u201307]], may not therefore play in the FA Cup in their first season. All clubs entering the competition must also have a suitable stadium.\n\nIt is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition, although it can happen in exceptional circumstances. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] did not defend their title in [[1999\u20132000 FA Cup|1999\u20132000]], as they were already in the [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship|inaugural]] [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Championship]]. The club stated that entering both tournaments would overload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their Champions League and Premier League titles. The club claimed that they did not want to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited United as they received a two-week break and won the 1999\u20132000 league title by an 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stage of the Club World Championship. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/853647.stm |title=Man Utd's FA Cup catastrophe |publisher=BBC News |date=27 July 2000 |accessdate=1 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premiership/i-regret-manchester-uniteds-fa-cup-pullout-fergie-14583761.html |title=I regret Manchester United's FA Cup pull-out: Fergie |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/united-underline-cup-withdrawal-742549.html |title=United underline Cup withdrawal |work=The Independent |last=Staniforth |first=Tommy |date=29 October 1999 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nWelsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible, although since the creation of the [[Welsh Premier League|League of Wales]] there are only six clubs remaining: [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (the only non-English team to win the tournament, in [[1927 FA Cup Final|1927]]), [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] and [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]].

The first and second proper rounds were also previously split into Northern and Southern sections, but this practice was ended after the 1997\u201398 competition.\n\nThe final is normally held the Saturday after the [[Premier League]] season finishes in May. The only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were [[1999\u20132000 in English football|1999\u20132000]], when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment, and [[2010\u201311 in English football|2010\u201311]] and [[2012\u201313 in English football|2012\u201313]] when the FA Cup Final was played before the Premier League season had finished, to allow [[Wembley Stadium]] to be ready for the [[UEFA Champions League]] final,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/mar/06/fa-cup-final-manchester-derby |title=Tarnished FA Cup needs a Manchester derby's drama |work=The Guardian |date=6 March 2011 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Wilson}}</ref> as well as in [[2011\u201312 in English football|2011\u201312]] to allow England time to prepare for that summer's [[UEFA Euro 2012|European Championships]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/12/2012-fa-cup-final-premier-league |title=No escape for 2012 FA Cup final from date clash with Premier League |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2011 |location=London |first=Owen |last=Gibson}}</ref>\n\n===The draw===\nThe draws for the Extra-Preliminary, Preliminary, and First Qualifying Rounds used to all occur at the same time. Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance. This season 2016/17 the draw for the 1st qualifying round was drawn at a later date as per previous season's later rounds.\n\nThe draw for each of the proper rounds is broadcast live on television, usually taking place at the conclusion of live coverage of one of the games of the previous round. Public interest is particularly high during the draw for the third round, which is where the top-ranked teams are added to the draw.\n\n===Tiebreaking===\nIn rounds up to and including the fifth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) go to a [[replay (sports)|replay]], played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]], and if still necessary, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Since [[2016\u201317 FA Cup|2016\u201317]], ties are settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties.\n\nUntil [[1990\u201391 FA Cup|1990\u201391]], further replays would be played until one team was victorious. Some ties took as many as six matches to settle; in their 1975 campaign, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] played a total of 12 games over six rounds, which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1975WestHamFulham.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105040811/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1975WestHamFulham.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 January 2013 |title=Hammers nail Fulham |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=5 March 2005}}</ref> Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game, but from [[1991\u201392 FA Cup|1991\u201392]] they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice for the rounds proper.

The first game had ended in a 0\u20130 draw.\n\nThe first [[FA Cup Final]] to go to extra time and a replay was the [[1875 FA Cup Final|1875 final]], between the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] and the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]]. The initial tie finished 1\u20131 but the Royal Engineers won the replay 2\u20130 in normal time. The last replayed final was the [[1993 FA Cup Final]], when Arsenal and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] fought a 1\u20131 draw.

The [[FA Cup semi-finals|semi-finals]] and [[FA Cup Final|final]] are played at a neutral venue \u2013 the rebuilt [[Wembley Stadium]] (since [[2007\u201308 FA Cup|2008]] and [[2006\u201307 FA Cup|2007]] respectively).\n\n=== Competition rounds ===\nIn the matches for the twelve competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn \u2013 simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. In the event of a [[draw (tie)|draw]], the [[replay (sports)|replay]] is played at the ground of the team who originally played [[home advantage|away from home]].\n\nIn the days when multiple replays were possible, the second replay (and any further replays) were played at neutral grounds. The clubs involved could alternatively agree to toss for home advantage in the second replay.\n\n=== Semi-finals ===\nThe semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt [[Wembley Stadium]] since [[2007\u201308 FA Cup|2008]], one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007). For the first decade of the competition, the [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] was used as the semi-final venue. In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel. The top three most used venues in this period were [[Villa Park]] in Birmingham (55 times), [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in Sheffield (34 times) and [[Old Trafford]] in Manchester (23 times). The [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]] was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nIn 2003 the FA took the decision to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.<ref>{{Cite web|title = FA Cup: Greg Dyke says semi-finals will stay at Wembley|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27008308|website = BBC Sport|accessdate = 12 February 2016}}</ref> This was controversial, with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London, as well as taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/news/news0002-facup.html |title=Football supporters hail FA Cup semi-final decision |publisher=Football Supporters' Federation |accessdate=8 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208165141/http://www.fsf.org.uk/news/news0002-facup.html |archivedate=8 February 2007 }}</ref> In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = FA Cup semi-finals: should they be played at Wembley? \u2013 poll|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/poll/2013/apr/11/fa-cup-semi-finals-wembley-poll|website = the Guardian|date = 11 April 2013|access-date = 12 February 2016|first = Paul|last = Campbell}}</ref> A fan poll by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 found 86% opposition to Wembley semi-finals.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Final ===\nThe final has been played at the rebuilt [[Wembley Stadium]] since it opened, in [[2006\u201307 FA Cup|2007.]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6039052.stm |title=Wembley Stadium to open next year |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 March 2007 |date=19 October 2006 |first=Howard |last=Nurse }}</ref> The rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]] in Wales. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]] since it opened in [[1922\u201323 FA Cup|1923]] (being originally named the Empire Stadium). One exception to this 78 year series of Empire Stadium finals (including five replays) was the [[1970 FA Cup Final|1970 replay]] between Leeds and Chelsea, held at [[Old Trafford]] in Manchester.\n\nIn the 51 years prior to the Empire Stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in London, and mainly at the [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] and then [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895\u20131914|Crystal Palace]]. It was played 22 times at The Oval (the inaugural competition in 1872, and then all but two times until 1892). After The Oval, Crystal Palace hosted 21 finals from 1895 to 1914, broken up by four replays elsewhere. The other London venues were [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] from 1920 to 1922 (the last three finals before the move to Empire Stadium); and the University of Oxford's [[Lillie Bridge Grounds|Lillie Bridge]] in [[Fulham]] for the second ever final, in 1873.

But with the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the regular Football League and FA Cup competitions for the 1939-40 season were cancelled for the duration of the war. Portsmouth's manager [[Jack Tinn]] was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' throughout the duration of the war, but this is an [[urban myth]]. Because the naval city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was actually taken ten miles to the north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of [[Lovedean]], and there it resided in a quaint thatched roof country pub called ''[http://www.lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk The Bird in Hand]'' for the seven years of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk/?BIHrequestID=4C55838218D9D39854D199BD64BA29|title=LoveDeanBirdInHand|website=www.lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk}}</ref>  After the conclusion of World War II, the FA Cup trophy was presented back to the Football Association by Portsmouth F.C. in time for the 1946 FA Cup Final.\n\n===Original design===\n\n====1871 original====\nThe first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of \u00a320<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/thetrophies|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140625213452/http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/thetrophies|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 June 2014|title=The Trophies|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> It was stolen from a [[Birmingham]] shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again. Despite a \u00a310 reward for information, the crime was never solved. As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa \u00a325 to pay for a replacement.\n\nJust over 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal Henry (Harry) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the story being published in the ''[[Sunday Pictorial]]'' newspaper on 23 February 1958. He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men, although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' newspaper (the crime pre-dated written police reports) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen, detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed.

Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The harder they fall|url = http://en.espn.co.uk/facupstories/sport/story/124299.html|website = ESPN.co.uk|accessdate = 10 February 2016}}</ref> Almost every club in the [[English football league system|League Pyramid]] has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history.<ref name=\"times analysis\" /> It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top [[Premier League]] team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e. from outside the professional levels of [[The Football League]].\n\nOne analysis of four years of FA Cup results showed that it was 99.85 per cent likely that at least one team would beat one from its next higher division in a given year.

Since the creation of The Football League, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] is the only non-league \"giant-killer\" to win the Cup, taking the [[1901 FA Cup Final|1901 FA Cup]] with a victory over [[1899\u20131900 Football League|reigning]] league runners-up [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]: although at that time, there were only two divisions and 36 clubs in the Football League, and Spurs were champions of the next strongest football league \u2013 the Southern League and probably already good enough for the First Division (as was shown when they joined the Second Division in 1908 and immediately won promotion to the First.) Only two other actual non-League clubs have even reached the final since the founding of the League: Sheffield Wednesday in 1890 (champions of the Football Alliance, a rival league which was already effectively the Second Division, which it formally became in 1892 \u2013 Wednesday being let straight into the First Division), and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 1900 and 1902 (in which years they were also Southern League champions, proving the strength of that league: again, they were probably of equivalent standard to a First Division club at the time, but Southampton's form subsequently faded and they did not join the League till 1920 and the formation of the Third Division.)\n\n===Non-league giant killings===\nThe most recent examples of a [[non-league]] team ([[English football league system#The System|Levels 5 to 10]]) beating a Level 1 opponent are [[National League (division)|National League]] side [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]'s [[Burnley 0\u20131 Lincoln City (2017)|away victory]] over Premier League side [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the [[2016\u201317 FA Cup]] and [[Conference Premier]] side [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]'s [[Norwich City 0\u20131 Luton Town (2013)|away victory]] over Level 1 [[English Premier League|Premier League]]'s [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the [[2012\u201313 FA Cup#Fourth Round Proper|2012\u201313 Fourth Round Proper]].

Cups on more than one occasion: [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] ([[2002 FA Cup Final|2002]], [[2003 FA Cup Final|2003]] and [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]], [[2015 FA Cup Final|2015]]).\n\n===Winning managers===\n{{See also|List of FA Cup winning managers}}\nThe record for most winner's medals for a manager is held by [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]], who has won seven titles with Arsenal ([[1998 FA Cup Final|1998]], [[2002 FA Cup Final|2002]], [[2003 FA Cup Final|2003]], [[2005 FA Cup Final|2005]], [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]], [[2015 FA Cup Final|2015]], [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]]).\n\n===Doubles/Trebles===\nSeven clubs have won the FA Cup as part of a [[Double (association football)|League and Cup double]], namely [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] (1889), [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (1897), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1961), [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (1971, 1998, 2002), [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (1986), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (1994, 1996, 1999) and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] (2010). In 1993, Arsenal became the first side to win both the FA Cup and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in the same season when they beat [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] 2\u20131 in both finals. Liverpool (in 2001) and Chelsea (in 2007) have since repeated this feat. In 2012, Chelsea accomplished a different cup double consisting of the FA Cup and the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|2012]] [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. In [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]], Manchester United added the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|1999]] [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] title to their league and cup double to complete a unique [[Treble (association football)|Treble]]. Two years later, in [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]], Liverpool won the FA Cup, [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] to complete a [[Treble (association football)#Other trebles|cup treble]].\n\n===Outside England===\nThe FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once. [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley. They had previously made it to the final only to lose to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1925 and lost another final to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in 2008. Cardiff City is also the only team to win the national cups of two different countries in the same season, having also won the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1927. The Scottish team [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885.\n\n===Outside the top division===\nSince the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] ([[1894 FA Cup Final|1894]]); [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] ([[1901 FA Cup Final|1901]]); [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] ([[1908 FA Cup Final|1908]]); [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] ([[1912 FA Cup Final|1912]]); [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] ([[1931 FA Cup Final|1931]]); [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] ([[1973 FA Cup Final|1973]]), [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] ([[1976 FA Cup Final|1976]]) and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] ([[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]]). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]) \u2013 Tottenham were playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation. Other than Tottenham's victory, only [[#FA Cup winners and finalists|24 finalists]] have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton ([[1902 FA Cup Final|1902]], then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers.\n\nSunderland's win in 1973 was considered a major upset, having beaten [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] who finished third in the top flight that season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/History/Postings/2003/11/46982.htm |title=TheFA.com \u2013 Shocks do happen |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=6 April 2005 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050305044037/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/History/Postings/2003/11/46982.htm |archivedate=5 March 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>, as was West Ham's victory over Arsenal in 1980 as the Gunners were in their third successive FA Cup Final and were also the cup holders from the previous year as well as just having finished 4th in the First Division, whereas West Ham had ended the season 7th in Division 2. This also marked the last time (as of 2017-18) a team from outside the top division won the FA cup. Uniquely, in [[2007\u201308 FA Cup|2008]] three of the four semi-finalists (Barnsley, [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and West Bromwich) were from outside the top division, although the eventual winner was the last remaining top-flight team, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7286364.stm |title=FA Cup semi-final draw 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 March 2012 |date=10 March 2008}}</ref> West Bromwich (1931) are the only team to have won the FA Cup and earned promotion to the top flight in the same season; whereas [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] ([[2013 FA Cup Final|2013]]) are the only team to have won the Cup and been relegated from the top flight in the same season.\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n===Domestic broadcasters===\n{{See also|English football on television}}\n\nThe FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the [[Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events]].\n\nIn the early years of coverage the BBC had exclusive radio coverage with a picture of the pitch marked in the [[Radio Times]] with numbered squares to help the listener follow the match on the radio. The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926 between Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester, the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff in 1927. The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full. The following season's final between Preston and Huddersfield was covered in full by the BBC. When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television, during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9&nbsp;a.m. which was six hours before kick off. Nowadays, this continues with Setanta and ESPN having all-day broadcasts from Wembley, but terrestrial TV coverage usually begins two hours before kick off. The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988, when ITV lost coverage to the new Sports Channel which later became [[Sky Sports]].\n\nFrom 1988 to 1997, the BBC and Sky Sports had coverage of the FA Cup, the BBC had highlights on Match of the Day and usually one match per round while Sky had the same deal. From 1997 to 2001, ITV and Sky shared live coverage with both having two matches per round and BBC continuing with highlights on Match of the Day. From 2002 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. From [[2008\u201309 FA Cup|2008\u201309]] to [[2013\u201314 FA Cup|2013\u201314]], FA Cup matches are shown live by [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] across England and [[Wales]], with [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] broadcasting to [[Northern Ireland]] but STV refusing to show them. ITV shows 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final is also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, [[Setanta Sports]] showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches exclusively to [[Scotland]], after the ITV franchise holder in Scotland, [[STV (TV network)|STV]], decided not to broadcast FA Cup games. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and [[England national football team|England internationals]].<ref>{{cite news |title=FA face Setanta shortfall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8115805.stm |website=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009 }}</ref> As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009\u201310 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. ESPN bought the competition for the 2010\u201311 to 2012\u201313 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.\n\nIn October 2009, The FA announced that ITV would show an additional match in the First and Second Rounds on ITV, with one replay match shown on [[ITV4]]. One match and one replay match from the first two rounds will broadcast on The FA website for free, in a similar situation to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup Qualifier]] between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2009/FACup_TVTies_1P.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20091027202428/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2009/FACup_TVTies_1P.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 October 2009 |title=FA Cup to be broadcast Free-to-Air |accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref> The 2009\u201310 First Round match between [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] was the first FA Cup match to be streamed online live.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/10/oldham-athletic-news/31689/latics-to-face-leeds-in-cup |title=Latics to face Leeds in Cup |accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nMany{{Who|date=June 2011}} expected [[BSkyB]] to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009\u201310 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final.

Some analysts argued the decision to move away from the Sky and, in particular, the BBC undermined the FA Cup in the eyes of the public.\n\nThe early rounds of the 2008\u201309 competition were covered for the first time by ITV's online service, [[ITV Local]]. The first match of the competition, between Wantage Town and Brading Town, was broadcast live online.

The pole was named after [[Johnny Pesky]], a light-hitting shortstop and long-time [[Coach (baseball)|coach]] for the Red Sox, who hit some of his six home runs at Fenway Park around the pole but never off the pole. Pesky (playing 1942 to 1952, except for 1943 to 1945); he was a [[contact hitter]] who hit just 17 home runs in his career (6 at Fenway Park).<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/p/peskyjo01.shtml Pesky at Baseball Reference]</ref> It's not known how many of these six actually landed near the pole. The Red Sox gives credit to pitcher and Sox broadcaster [[Mel Parnell]] for coining the name. The most notable for Pesky is a two-run homer in the eighth inning of the 1946 Opening Day game to win the game (in his career, Pesky hit 17 home runs). According to Pesky, Mel Parnell named the pole after Pesky won a game for Parnell in {{Baseball year|1948}} with a [[home run]] down the short right field line, just around the pole. However, Pesky hit just one home run in a game pitched by Parnell, a two-run shot in the first inning of a game against Detroit played on June 11, 1950. The game was eventually won by the visiting Tigers in the 14th inning on a three-run shot by Tigers right fielder Vic Wertz and Parnell earned a no-decision that day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redsoxconnection.com/peskypole.html |title=Pesky Pole at Fenway Park |publisher=redsoxconnection.com |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060228/http://www.redsoxconnection.com/peskypole.html |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe term, though it had been in use since the 1950s, became far more common when Parnell became a Red Sox broadcaster in 1965.

Facing Reds right-hander Pat Darcy in the 12th inning with the score tied at 6, Fisk hit a long fly ball down the left field line. It appeared to be heading foul, but Fisk, after initially appearing unsure of whether or not to continue running to first base, famously jumped and waved his arms to the right as if to somehow direct the ball fair. It ricocheted off the foul pole, winning the game for the Red Sox and sending the series to a seventh and deciding game the next night, which Cincinnati won.

The scientific study of this area of medicine is termed '''flatology'''.<ref name=\"Tangerman 2009\" />\n\nIt is normal for humans to pass flatus through the [[rectum]], although the volume and frequency may vary greatly between individuals. It is also normal for intestinal gas passed through the rectum to have a characteristic [[wiktionary:feculent|feculent]] smell, although this too may vary in concentration. Flatus is brought to the rectum by specialised contractions of the muscles in the intestines and colon. The noises commonly associated with flatulence (\"[[blowing a raspberry]]\") are caused by the vibration of [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|anal sphincters]], and occasionally by the closed [[buttocks]]. Both the noise and smell associated with flatus leaving the anus can be sources of embarrassment or comedy in many cultures.\n\nThere are five general symptoms related to intestinal gas: pain, bloating and abdominal distension, excessive flatus volume, excessive flatus smell and gas incontinence. Furthermore, [[burping|eructation]] (\"an act or instance of belching\", colloquially known as \"burping\") is sometimes included under the topic of flatulence.<ref name=\"K C clinical medicine\">{{cite book |editor=[[Parveen Kumar]] |editor2=Michael L.

Derived terms include [[vaginal flatulence]], otherwise known as a ''queef''.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n\nGenerally speaking, there are four different types of complaints that relate to intestinal gas, which may present individually or in combination.\n\n===Bloating and pain===\nPatients may complain of bloating as abdominal distension, discomfort and pain from \"trapped wind\". In the past, functional bowel disorders such as [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) that produced symptoms of bloating were attributed to increased production of intestinal gas. However, three significant pieces of evidence refute this theory. First, in normal subjects, even very high rates of gas infusion into the small intestine (30&nbsp;ml/min) are tolerated without complaints of pain or bloating and harmlessly passed as flatus per rectum.<ref name=\"Azpiroz 2005\" /> Secondly, studies aiming to quantify the total volume of gas produced by IBS patients (some including gas emitted from the mouth by eructation) have consistently failed to demonstrate increased volumes compared to healthy subjects. The proportion of hydrogen produced may be increased in a subset of IBS patients, but this does not affect the total volume.<ref name=\"King 1998\">{{cite journal |last=King |first=TS |author2=Elia, M |author3=Hunter, JO |title=Abnormal colonic fermentation in irritable bowel syndrome |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=October 10, 1998 |volume=352 |issue=9135 |pages=1187\u20139 |pmid=9777836 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)02146-1}}</ref> Thirdly, it is known that the total volume of flatus produced by IBS patients who complain of pain and abdominal distension would be tolerated in normal subjects without any complaints of pain.\n \nPatients who complain of bloating frequently can be shown to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined with the fact that the total volume of flatus is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension.<ref name=\"Azpiroz 2005\" /> In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased flatus production.\n\n===Excessive volume===\nAs mentioned above, the normal range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476\u20131,491&thinsp;ml/24&thinsp;h).<ref name=\"Tangerman 2009\" /> All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called [[aerophagia]], and has been shown in a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition.<ref name=\"Azpiroz 2005\" /> The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced.<ref name=\"Azpiroz 2005\" /> Diets that aim to reduce the amount of undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.\n\n===Smell===\nAlthough flatus possesses physiological smell, this may be abnormally increased in some patients and cause social distress to the patient. Increased smell of flatus presents a distinct clinical issue from other complaints related to intestinal gas.<ref name=\"Bailey 2009\">{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=J |author2=Carter, NJ |author3=Neher, JO |title=FPIN's Clinical Inquiries: Effective management of flatulence |journal=[[American Family Physician]] |date=June 15, 2009 |volume=79 |issue=12 |pages=1098\u2013100 |pmid=19530642}}</ref> Some patients may exhibit over-sensitivity to bad flatus smell, and in extreme forms, [[olfactory reference syndrome]] may be diagnosed.\n\n===Incontinence of flatus===\n\"Gas incontinence\" could be defined as loss of voluntary control over the passage of flatus. It is a recognised subtype of [[faecal incontinence]], and is usually related to minor disruptions of the continence mechanisms. Some consider gas incontinence to be the first, sometimes only, symptom of faecal incontinence.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\">{{citation |editor=Bruce G. Wolff |editor2=James W.

It took a staff of 200 about four years to complete ''The Spirits Within''. Square intended to make the character of Aki Ross into the world's first photorealistic computer-animated actress, with plans for appearances in multiple films in different roles. \n\n''The Spirits Within'' debuted to mixed critical reception, but was widely praised for the realism of the computer-animated characters. Due to rising costs, the film greatly exceeded its original budget towards the end of production, reaching a final cost of $137 million, of which it recovered only $85 million at the box office.<ref name=Boxofficemojo/> The film has been called a [[box office bomb]]<ref name=bomb>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/box_office_bombs?pg=8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025002802/http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/box_office_bombs?pg=8 |archivedate=25 October 2012 |title=Movies that were Box-office Bombs |last=Duffy |first=James |date=2 August 2006 |work=[[Boston.com]] |accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> and is blamed for the demise of Square Pictures.<ref name=briscoe>{{cite news|title='Final Fantasy' flop causes studio to fold|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=4 February 2002|last=Briscoe|first=David}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2065, Earth is infested by alien life forms known as Phantoms. By physical contact Phantoms consume the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia spirit]] of living beings, killing them instantly, though a minor contact may only result in an infection. The surviving humans live in \"barrier cities\", areas protected by an energy shield that prevents Phantoms from entering, and are engaged in an ongoing struggle to free the planet. After being infected by a Phantom during one of her experiments, Aki Ross ([[Ming-Na]]) and her mentor, Doctor Sid ([[Donald Sutherland]]), uncover a means of defeating the Phantoms by gathering eight spirit signatures that, when joined, can negate the Phantoms. Aki is searching for the sixth spirit in the ruins of New York City when she is cornered by Phantoms but is rescued by Gray Edwards ([[Alec Baldwin]]) and his squad \"Deep Eyes\", consisting of Ryan Whittaker ([[Ving Rhames]]), Neil Fleming ([[Steve Buscemi]]) and Jane Proudfoot ([[Peri Gilpin]]). It is revealed that Gray was once romantically involved with Aki.\n\nUpon returning to her barrier city, Aki joins Sid and appears before the leadership council along with General Hein ([[James Woods]]), who is determined to use the powerful Zeus space cannon to destroy the Phantoms. Aki is concerned the cannon will damage Earth's Gaia (a spirit representing its ecosystem) and delays the use of it by revealing that she has been infected and the collected spirit signatures are keeping her infection stable, convincing the council that there may be another way to defeat the Phantoms. However, this revelation leads Hein to incorrectly conclude that she is being controlled by the Phantoms. Aki and the Deep Eyes squad succeed in finding the seventh spirit as Aki's infection begins to worsen and she slips into unconsciousness. Her dream reveals to her that the Phantoms are the spirits of dead aliens brought to Earth on a fragment of their destroyed planet. Sid uses the seventh spirit to bring Aki's infection back under control, reviving her.\n\nTo scare the council into giving him clearance to fire the Zeus cannon, Hein lowers part of the barrier shield protecting the city. Though Hein intended that only a few Phantoms enter, his plan goes awry and legions of Phantoms invade the entire city. Aki, Sid and the Deep Eyes attempt to reach Aki's spaceship, their means of escape, but Ryan, Neil and Jane are killed by Phantoms. Hein escapes and boards the Zeus space-station where he finally receives authorisation to fire the cannon.\n\nSid finds the eighth spirit at the crater site of the alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a shielded vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of the Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box|width=20%|quote=At first it was very lonely sitting in that booth and eerie to see (Aki's) lips move and my words coming out, but slowly I began to enjoy my time with Aki, and I became attuned to her.|source=Ming-Na, voice actor<ref name=starbulletin/>}}\nAki Ross's voice actor, [[Ming-Na Wen]], was selected for a perceived fit between her personality and Aki's.<ref name=\"OPM\" /> Ming-Na, who found the role via her publicist,<ref>{{cite web| last=Hobson |first=Louis B. | title=Fantasy role for ER actress |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/E/ER/2001/07/19/pf-734449.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140226143418/http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/E/ER/2001/07/19/pf-734449.html |archivedate=26 February 2014 |work=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |date=1 June 2001 |accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> said she felt like she had given birth with her voice to the character.<ref name=\"bbc\" /> She gradually accustomed herself to the difficulty of working without the presence and spontaneity of real actors, and commented that the voice-acting work did not take much time, as she would just go into the studio \"once or twice a month for about four months\" with no need for make-up and costuming sessions.<ref name=starbulletin/> The workload was so light it did not interfere with her acting commitments in the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.<ref name=\"starbulletin\">{{cite web |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2001/07/10/features/story1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324052710/http://archives.starbulletin.com/2001/07/10/features/story1.html |archivedate=24 March 2012 |title='Fantasy' girl's a geek |last=Ryan |first=Tim |date=10 July 2001 |work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nSquare accumulated four [[SGI Origin 2000]] series servers, four [[SGI Onyx2|Onyx2]] systems, and 167 [[SGI Octane|Octane]] workstations for the film's production.<ref name=tech>{{cite web|last1=Stokes |first1=Jon |last2=Ragan-Kelley |first2=Jonathon |title=Final Fantasy: The Technology Within |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=30 July 2001 |url=http://archive.arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/01q3/ff-interview/ff-interview-1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111193848/http://archive.arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/01q3/ff-interview/ff-interview-1.html |archivedate=January 11, 2015 |accessdate=23 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The basic film was rendered at a custom [[render farm]] created by Square in Hawaii.

The founders had been members of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] but were excluded from its membership for too earnestly advocating what they saw as the doctrines and usages of authentic Wesleyan Methodism.  Under the leadership of the Rev. [[B. T. Roberts|Benjamin Titus (B. T.) Roberts]], a graduate of [[Wesleyan University]] and an able and eloquent preacher, the movement spread rapidly. Societies were organized, churches built and the work established.{{Citation needed |date=July 2018}}\n\nAt the 1910 session of the General Conference of the Methodist Church at Rochester, New York, a full acknowledgement was made of the wrong done to Roberts fifty years before, and the credentials unjustly taken from him were restored in a public meeting to his son, Rev. Benson Roberts.<ref>Editorial, ''Free Methodist'', May 1941.</ref>\n\nBefore the founding of the church, Roberts began publication of a monthly journal, ''The Earnest Christian''. In 1868, ''The Free Methodist'' (now ''Light & Life'') was begun. A publishing house was established in 1886 to produce books, periodicals and Sunday school curriculum and literature.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Light & Life'' Magazine, July 1995.</ref>\n\nThe name \"Methodist\" was retained for the newly organized church because the founders felt that their misfortunes (expulsion from the Methodist Episcopal Church) had come to them because of their adherence to doctrines and standards of Methodism. The word \"Free\" was suggested and adopted because the new church was anti-slavery.  Next, pews were to be free to all rather than sold or rented (as was common), so as to provide full access to the poor. The new church hoped for the freedom of worship in the Holy Spirit, as opposed to a stifling formality.<ref>''A Brief Story of Our Church'', C. L. Howland, Winona Lake, IN.</ref> A fourth principle was \"freedom\" from secret and oath-bound societies (in particular the Masonic Lodge), so has to have full loyalty to Christ. Fifth was \"freedom\" from the abuse of ecclesiastical authority (due to the bishop's action in allowing expulsion of 120 clergy and lay). Finally was \"freedom\" to experience transformation in sanctification via the Holy Spirit due to personal consecration and faith versus just 'sin-management' or gradual growth following justification.\n\n[[Conservative holiness movement|Holiness Conservatives]] within the Free Methodist Church left to form the [[United Holiness Church]] in 1955 (which itself joined the [[Bible Methodist Connection of Churches]] in 1994) and also the [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]] in 1963.<ref name=\"Melton2009\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/glenn-griffith-movement#E|title=Glenn Griffith Movement|year=2009|publisher=Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions|language=English|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Kostlevy2010\">{{cite book|last=Kostlevy|first=William|title=The A to Z of the Holiness Movement|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|language=English|isbn=9780810875913|page=19}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:Free Methodist World Ministries Center.JPG|thumb|Free Methodist World Ministries Center]]\nFree Methodist headquarters were located in [[Winona Lake, Indiana]], until 1990 when the denomination moved its headquarters to Indianapolis.<ref>[http://www.freemethodistchurch.org/users/marston/ Marston Historical Center]</ref> The church has about 77,000 members<ref>http://www.freemethodistchurch.org/sections/about_us/faqs.shtml</ref> in the United States and an average attendance of 107,000<ref>[http://www.freemethodistchurch.org/sections/about_us/stats/home.shtml Free Methodist Statistics]</ref> at its Sunday services.

The Free Methodist Church itself arose within the context of [[holiness movement]] within 19th century Methodism.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Free Methodist Church of North America</ref>\n\nWhile some clergy in the Free Methodist Church wear the [[pulpit robe]], others do not wear [[vestment]]s of any sort during worship.\n\nThe first general superintendent, B. T. Roberts, was in favor of ordaining women, but never saw it take place in his lifetime. Out of his own conviction he wrote ''Ordaining Women: Biblical and Historical Insights''. The impact of his writings eventually prevailed in the church. The Free Methodist Church affirmed the ordination of women in 1911.<ref>The Female Pastor: Is There Room for She in Shepherd</ref> As of June 2008, out of 2,011 ordained clergy, 216 were women (11 percent). Twenty-six percent of all ministerial candidates are women.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nFree Methodists recognize and license unordained persons for particular ministries. They mandate lay representation in numbers equal to clergy in the councils of the church.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''2007 Book of Discipline'', Free Methodist Church of North America</ref>\n\nAs a reaction to paid musicians in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], early Free Methodists enjoyed [[A cappella#Christian|a capella]] congregational hymns during worship. However, the General Conference of 1943 voted to allow each Conference to vote on whether or not their churches could have instrumental music.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1996&dat=19430619&id=baAiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bK8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2624,7104324|title = Free Methodists to Have Church Music.

Currently, many churches have worship teams composed of vocalists, drums, keyboards, guitars, and other instruments.\n\n==Organization==\nThe Free Methodist Church's highest governing body is the World Conference,<ref>[http://www.freemethodistworld.org World Conference]</ref> which is composed of representatives, both lay and clergy, from all countries with a Free Methodist General Conference. As the church in each country develops, its status progresses from Mission District to Annual Conference to General Conference.

Spring Arbor College followed in 1873, Seattle Pacific University in 1891 and Greenville College (renamed Greenville University in 2017) in 1892. Central College began in 1914, a continuation of Orleans Seminary begun in 1884. Azusa Pacific University was formed by a merger with [[Los Angeles Pacific College]] and other small denominational colleges.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe following educational institutions are a part of the Association of Free Methodist Educational Institutions.

T. Roberts recognized the Christian\u2019s responsibility for publishing.\n\nBefore the founding of the church in 1860, B. T. Roberts began publication of a monthly journal, ''The Earnest Christian''. In 1868 ''The Free Methodist'' (now ''Light & Life'' Magazine) began. A publishing house was established in 1886 to produce books, periodicals and Sunday school curriculum and literature.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Beginnings===\nEarly leaders, T. B. Arnold and B. T. Roberts privately financed and produced several publications.\n\nThe official publishing institution was established by the church at the 1886 General Conference. The church purchased the publishing business built by Rev. T. B. Arnold for $8,000. Arnold was named first publisher and B. T. Roberts was elected editor of ''The Free Methodist''. The Free Methodist Publishing House is recognized under its trade name Light and Life Press.\n\n===Growth and development===\nThe Free Methodist Publishing House operated at three locations in Chicago, Illinois. In February 1935, it moved along with Free Methodist Headquarters to Winona Lake, Indiana.\n\nDuring its history, the Free Methodist Publishing House built up a plant and accumulated property worth several hundred thousand dollars.

This was provided at vast cost and without the investment of any capital by the general church.\n\nIn 1960, the Free Methodist Publishing House board issued a deed in favor of the general church, whereby the church became the owner of the old property, plus nearly eight acres of land. For this the general church paid nothing, but agreed to make payments of $5,000 per year over a ten-year period to the Free Methodist Publishing House.\n\n===Ministry===\n''Arnold\u2019s Commentary'' was published from 1894\u20131980. In the late 1950s and early 60s the church pioneered fully graded church school materials.

His significance as a fully developed character in Shakespeare is primarily formed in the plays ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'', where he is a companion to [[Prince Hal]], the future King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. A notable eulogy for Falstaff is presented in Act II, Scene III of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', where Falstaff does not appear as a character on stage, as enacted by Mistress Quickly in terms that some scholars have ascribed to Plato's description of the death of Socrates after drinking hemlock. By comparison, in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', Falstaff is presented by Shakespeare as the buffoonish suitor of two married women.\n\nThough primarily a comic figure, Falstaff still embodies a kind of depth common to Shakespeare's major characters. A fat, vain, boastful, and cowardly knight, he spends most of his time drinking at the [[Boar's Head Inn]] with petty criminals, living on stolen or borrowed money. Falstaff leads the apparently wayward [[Prince Hal]] into trouble, and is ultimately repudiated after Hal becomes king. Falstaff has since appeared in other media, notably in operas by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Otto Nicolai]], and in [[Orson Welles]]' 1966 film ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]''. The operas focus on his role in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', while the film adapts from the [[Henriad]] and ''The Merry Wives''. Welles, who played Falstaff in his film, considered the character to be \"Shakespeare's greatest creation\".{{sfn|Lyons|1989|p=4}}\n\n==Role in the plays==\n[[File:MerryWives.jpg|thumb|right|Mistress Page and Falstaff in ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', staged by [[Pacific Repertory Theatre]] at the [[Golden Bough Playhouse]] in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, CA]], in 1999]]\n\nFalstaff appears in three of Shakespeare's plays, ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''. His death is mentioned in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' but he has no lines, nor is it directed that he appear on stage. However, many stage and film adaptations have seen it necessary to include Falstaff for the insight he provides into [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]'s character. The most notable examples in cinema are [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Henry V (1944 movie)|1944 version]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s [[Henry V (1989 movie)|1989 film]], both of which draw additional material from the ''Henry IV'' plays.\n\nThe character is known to have been very popular with audiences at the time, and for many years afterwards. According to [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]], writing shortly after Shakespeare's death, while many plays could not get good audiences, \"let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest, you scarce shall have a room\".{{sfn|Birch|2009|p=475}}\n\n===''Henry IV, Part 1''===\n{{further|Henry IV, Part 1}}\n[[File:Falstaff plays the king.jpg|thumb|right|An 1829 watercolor by [[Johann Heinrich Ramberg]] of Act II, Scene iv: Falstaff enacts the part of the king.]]\n\nKing Henry is troubled by the behaviour of his son and heir, the [[Prince of Wales]]. Hal (the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]) has forsaken the Royal Court to waste his time in taverns with low companions. This makes him an object of scorn to the nobles and calls into question his royal worthiness. Hal's chief friend and foil in living the low life is Sir John Falstaff. Fat, old, drunk, and corrupt as he is, he has a [[charisma]] and a zest for life that captivates the Prince.\n\nHal likes Falstaff but makes no pretense at being like him. He enjoys insulting his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins' plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely for the fun of watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court.\n\nOn the way to this climax, we are treated to Falstaff, who has \"misused the King's press damnably\",{{sfd|1H4|4|2|12\u201313}} not only by taking money from able-bodied men who wished to evade service but by keeping the wages of the poor souls he brought instead who were killed in battle (\"food for powder, food for powder\").{{sfd|1H4|4|2|66\u201367}} Left on his own during Hal's battle with [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Hotspur]], Falstaff dishonourably counterfeits death to avoid attack by Douglas. After Hal leaves Hotspur's body on the field, Falstaff revives in a mock miracle. Seeing he is alone, he stabs Hotspur's corpse in the thigh and claims credit for the kill. Though Hal knows better, he allows Falstaff his disreputable tricks. Soon after being given grace by Hal, Falstaff states that he wants to amend his life and begin \"to live cleanly as a nobleman should do\".{{sfd|1H4|5|4|76\u2013169}}\n\n===''Henry IV, Part 2''===\n{{further|Henry IV, Part 2}}\n[[File:Edward Grutzner Goupil Falstaff at the Boars Head Tavern.jpg|thumb|right|Falstaff with Doll Tearsheet in the Boar's Head tavern, illustration to Act 2, Scene 4 of the play by [[Eduard von Gr\u00fctzner]]]]\nThe play focuses on Prince Hal's journey toward kingship, and his ultimate rejection of Falstaff. However, unlike ''Part One'', Hal's and Falstaff's stories are almost entirely separate, as the two characters meet only twice and very briefly. The tone of much of the play is elegiac, focusing on Falstaff's age and his closeness to death, which parallels that of the increasingly sick king.\n\nFalstaff is still drinking and engaging in petty criminality in the London underworld. He first appears, followed by a new character, a young page whom Prince Hal has assigned him as a joke. Falstaff enquires what the doctor has said about the analysis of his [[urine]], and the page cryptically informs him that the urine is healthier than the patient. Falstaff delivers one of his most characteristic lines:  \"I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men.\" Falstaff promises to outfit the page in \"vile apparel\" (ragged clothing). He then complains of his insolvency, blaming it on \"consumption of the purse.\" They go off, Falstaff vowing to find a wife \"in the stews\" (i.e., the local brothels).\n\nThe Lord Chief Justice enters, looking for Falstaff.  Falstaff at first feigns deafness in order to avoid conversing with him, and when this tactic fails pretends to mistake him for someone else.  As the Chief Justice attempts to question Falstaff about a recent robbery, Falstaff insists on turning the subject of the conversation to the nature of the illness afflicting the King. He then adopts the pretense of being a much younger man than the Chief Justice:  \"You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young.\"  Finally, he asks the Chief Justice for one thousand pounds to help outfit a military expedition, but is denied.\n\n[[File:Falstaff rebuked (Smirke, c. 1795).jpg|thumb|right|''Falstaff rebuked'', [[Robert Smirke (painter)|Robert Smirke]], c. 1795]]\n\nHe has a relationship with [[Doll Tearsheet]], a prostitute, who gets into a fight with [[Ancient Pistol]], Falstaff's ensign. After Falstaff ejects Pistol, Doll asks him about the Prince. Falstaff is embarrassed when his derogatory remarks are overheard by Hal, who is present disguised as a musician. Falstaff tries to talk his way out of it, but Hal is unconvinced. When news of a second rebellion arrives, Falstaff joins the army again, and goes to the country to raise forces. There he encounters an old school friend, Justice Shallow, and they reminisce about their youthful follies. Shallow brings forward potential recruits for the loyalist army: Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, Shadow and Wart, a motley collection of rustic yokels. Falstaff and his cronies accept bribes from two of them, Mouldy and Bullcalf, not to be conscripted.\n\nIn the final scene, Falstaff, having learned from Pistol that Hal is now King, travels to London in expectation of great rewards. But Hal rejects him, saying that he has now changed, and can no longer associate with such people. The London lowlifes, expecting a paradise of thieves under Hal's governance, are instead purged and imprisoned by the authorities.\n\n===''Henry V''===\n{{further|Henry V (play)|l1=Henry V}}\nAlthough Falstaff does not appear on stage in ''Henry V'', his death is the main subject of Act 2, Scene 3, in which [[Mistress Quickly]] delivers a memorable eulogy:\n\n{{quote\n|character=[[Mistress Quickly]]\n|title=''Henry V''\n|author=[[William Shakespeare]]\n|source=Act 2, Scene 3.{{sfd|H5|2|3|9\u201326}}\n|text=<poem>\nNay, sure, he\u2019s not in hell!

To obtain financial advantage, he decides to court two wealthy married women, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page. Falstaff decides to send the women identical love letters and asks his servants \u2013 Pistol and Nym \u2013 to deliver them to the wives. When they refuse, Falstaff sacks them, and, in revenge, the men tell Ford and Page (the husbands) of Falstaff's intentions. Page is not concerned, but the jealous Ford persuades the Host of the Garter Inn to introduce him to Falstaff as a 'Master Brook' so that he can find out Falstaff's plans. \n\nWhen the women receive the letters, each goes to tell the other, and they quickly find that the letters are almost identical. The \"merry wives\" are not interested in the ageing, overweight Falstaff as a suitor; however, for the sake of their own amusement and to gain revenge for his indecent assumptions towards them both, they pretend to respond to his advances.\n\nThis all results in great embarrassment for Falstaff. Mr. Ford poses as 'Mr. Brook' and says he is in love with Mistress Ford but cannot woo her as she is too virtuous. He offers to pay Falstaff to court her, saying that once she has lost her honour he will be able to tempt her himself. Falstaff cannot believe his luck, and tells 'Brook' he has already arranged to meet Mistress Ford while her husband is out. Falstaff leaves to keep his appointment and Ford soliloquises that he is right to suspect his wife and that the trusting Page is a fool.\n\nWhen Falstaff arrives to meet Mistress Ford, the merry wives trick him into hiding in a laundry basket (\"buck basket\") full of filthy, smelly clothes awaiting laundering. When the jealous Ford returns to try and catch his wife with the knight, the wives have the basket taken away and the contents (including Falstaff) dumped into the river. Although this affects Falstaff's pride, his ego is surprisingly resilient. He is convinced that the wives are just \"playing hard to get\" with him, so he continues his pursuit of sexual advancement, with its attendant capital and opportunities for blackmail.\n\nAgain Falstaff goes to meet the women but Mistress Page comes back and warns Mistress Ford of her husband's approach again. They try to think of ways to hide him other than the laundry basket which he refuses to get into again. They trick him again, this time into disguising himself as Mistress Ford's maid's obese aunt, known as \"the fat woman of Brentford\". Ford tries once again to catch his wife with the knight but ends up beating the \"old woman\", whom he despises, and throwing her out of his house. Black and blue, Falstaff laments his bad luck.\n\nEventually the wives tell their husbands about the series of jokes they have played on Falstaff, and together they devise one last trick which ends up with the Knight being humiliated in front of the whole town. They tell Falstaff to dress as \"[[Herne the Hunter|Herne, the Hunter]]\" and meet them by an old oak tree in Windsor Forest (now part of [[Windsor Great Park]]). They then dress several of the local children as fairies and get them to pinch and burn Falstaff to punish him.\n\nThe wives meet Falstaff, and almost immediately the \"fairies\" attack. After the chaos, the characters reveal their true identities to Falstaff. Although he is embarrassed, Falstaff takes the joke surprisingly well, as he sees it was what he deserved. Ford says he must pay back the 20 pounds 'Brook' gave him and takes the Knight's horses as recompense. Eventually they all leave together and Mistress Page even invites Falstaff to come with them: \"let us every one go home, and laugh this sport o'er by a country fire; Sir John and all\".\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Gr\u00fctzner Falstaff mit Kanne.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eduard von Gr\u00fctzner]]: ''Falstaff mit gro\u00dfer Weinkanne und Becher'' (1896) (Falstaff with big wine jar and cup, 1896)]]\n\n===John Oldcastle===\nShakespeare originally named Falstaff \"[[John Oldcastle]]\". [[William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], a descendant of the historical John Oldcastle, complained, forcing Shakespeare to change the name. Shakespeare's ''Henry IV'' plays and ''Henry V'' adapted and developed the material in an earlier play called ''[[The Famous Victories of Henry V]]'', in which Sir John \"Jockey\" Oldcastle appears as a dissolute companion of the young Henry. In the published version of ''Henry IV, Part 1'', Falstaff's name is always [[metre (poetry)|unmetrical]], suggesting a name change after the original composition; Prince Hal refers to Falstaff as \"my old lad of the castle\" in the first act of the play; the epilogue to ''Henry IV, Part 2'', moreover, explicitly disavows any connection between Falstaff and Oldcastle: \"Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man.\"{{sfd|2H4|ftln=3431}}\n\nThe historical Oldcastle was a [[Lollardy|Lollard]] who was executed for heresy and rebellion, and he was respected by many Protestants as a [[martyr]]. In addition to the anonymous ''The Famous Victories of Henry V'', in which Oldcastle is Henry V's companion, Oldcastle's history is described in [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'', Shakespeare's usual source for his histories.\n\n===Cobhams===\nIt is not clear, however, if Shakespeare characterised Falstaff as he did for dramatic purposes, or because of a specific desire to satirise Oldcastle or the Cobhams. Cobham was a common butt of veiled satire in Elizabethan popular literature; he figures in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' and may have been part of the reason ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'' was suppressed. Shakespeare's desire to burlesque a hero of early English Protestantism could indicate [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] sympathies, but [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham]] was sufficiently sympathetic to Catholicism that in 1603, he was imprisoned as part of the [[Main Plot]] to place [[Arbella Stuart]] on the English throne, so if Shakespeare wished to use Oldcastle to embarrass the Cobhams, he seems unlikely to have done so on religious grounds.\n\nThe Cobhams appear to have intervened while Shakespeare was in the process of writing either ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' or the second part of ''Henry IV''. The first part of ''Henry IV'' was probably written and performed in 1596, and the name Oldcastle had almost certainly been allowed by [[Master of the Revels]] [[Edmund Tilney]]. [[William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham]] may have become aware of the offensive representation after a public performance; he may also have learned of it while it was being prepared for a court performance (Cobham was at that time [[Lord Chamberlain]]). As father-in-law to the newly widowed [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], Cobham certainly possessed the influence at court to get his complaint heard quickly. Shakespeare may have included a sly retaliation against the complaint in his play ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (published after the Henry IV series). In the play, the paranoid, jealous Master Ford uses the alias \"Brook\" to fool Falstaff, perhaps in reference to William Brooke. At any rate, the name is Falstaff in the ''Henry IV, Part 1'' [[quarto]], of 1598, and the epilogue to the second part, published in 1600, contains this clarification:\n\n{{quote\n|title=''Henry IV, Part 2''\n|author=[[William Shakespeare]]\n|source=Epilogue.{{sfd|1H4|ftln=3425\u20133431}}\n|text=<poem>\nOne word more, I beseech you: if you be not too\nmuch cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will\ncontinue the story, with Sir John in it, and make\nyou merry with fair Katherine of France, where, for\nanything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless\nalready he be killed with your hard opinions; for\nOldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man.\n</poem>\n}}\n\n===Sir John Fastolf===\nThe new name \"Falstaff\" probably derived from the medieval knight Sir [[John Fastolf]] (who may also have been a [[Lollard]]). The historical John Fastolf fought at the [[Battle of Patay]] against [[Joan of Arc]], which the English lost. Fastolf's previous actions as a soldier had earned him wide respect, but he seems to have become a scapegoat after the debacle. He was among the few English military leaders to avoid death or capture during the battle, and although there is no evidence that he acted with cowardice, he was temporarily stripped of his knighthood. Fastolf appears in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' in which he is portrayed as an abject coward. In the'' [[First Folio]] ''his name is spelled \"Falstaffe\", so Shakespeare may have directly appropriated the spelling of the name he used in the earlier play. In a further comic double meaning, the name implies impotence.\n\n===Robert Greene===\nIt has been suggested that the dissolute writer [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] may also have been an inspiration for the character of Falstaff. This theory was first proposed in 1930 and has recently been championed by [[Stephen Greenblatt]].{{sfn|Maxwell|1930}}{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004|pp=216\u2013225}} Notorious for a life of dissipation and debauchery somewhat similar to Falstaff, he was among the first to mention Shakespeare in his work (in ''[[Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit]]''), suggesting to Greenblatt that the older writer may have influenced Shakespeare's characterisation.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004|pp=216\u2013225}}\n\n[[File:Falstaff and Mistress Quickly Francis Philip Stephanoff.jpeg|thumb|''Falstaff and Mistress Quickly from The Merry Wives of Windsor'', [[Francis Philip Stephanoff]], circa 1840]]\n\n==Cultural adaptations and appropriations==\nThere are several works about Falstaff, inspired by Shakespeare's plays:\n\n===Drama===\n*''[[Falstaff's Wedding]]'' (1766), by [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]] was set after the events of ''Henry IV, Part 2''. To restore his financial position after his rejection by Hal, Falstaff is forced to marry Mistress Ursula (a character briefly mentioned by Shakespeare, whom Falstaff has \"weekly\" promised to marry). The play exists in two very different versions. In the first version Falstaff is drawn into [[Southampton Plot|Scroop's plot]] to murder the king, but wins back Henry's favour by exposing the plot. In the second this story is dropped for a purely farcical storyline.{{sfn|Sutherland|1933}}\n\n===Music===\n[[File:KembleFalstaff.jpg|thumb| [[Stephen Kemble]], \"the best Sir John Falstaff which the British stage ever saw.\"{{sfn|Edinburgh Literary Journal|1830}}]]\n*''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff]]'' (1799), [[Antonio Salieri]]'s [[opera buffa|opera]], with a libretto by [[Carlo Prospero Defranceschi]], which is based upon ''The Merry Wives of Windsor''.{{sfn|Rice|n.d.}}\n*''[[Falstaff (Balfe)|Falstaff]]'' (1838), an opera by [[Michael William Balfe]] to an Italian libretto by S.

Later, Americans claimed to have invented it, and held interstate tournaments in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://floorballcoach.org/development-of-floorball/ |title=DEVELOPMENT OF FLOORBALL : Floorball Coach \u2013 everything about floorball training |website=Floorballcoach.org |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> The game was formally organized as an international and more organised sport in the late 1970s in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"floorballnation1\">{{cite web|title=The History of Floorball|url=http://floorballnation.com.au/history-floorball.html|website=floorballnation.com.au|accessdate=7 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424172015/http://floorballnation.com.au/history-floorball.html|archivedate=24 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Malm|first1=William|last2=Olsson|first2=Rebecca|title=Floorball - The Future Sport|url=http://www.freeway.org/issue4/sports/floorball.htm|website=www.freeway.org|accessdate=7 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316062621/http://www.freeway.org/issue4/sports/floorball.htm|archivedate=16 March 2013|date=1998|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floorballcentral.org/2010/01/true-history-of-floorball.html |title=The True History of Floorball |website=www.floorballcentral.org |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate= 7 September 2016 }}</ref> The sport began as something that was played for fun as a pastime in schools.<ref name=\"floorballnation1\"/> After a decade or so, floorball began showing up in [[Nordic countries]] where the former schoolyard pastime was becoming a developed sport. Formal rules soon were developed, and clubs began to form. After some time, several countries developed national associations, and the IFF was founded in 1986.\n\nThe game of floorball is also known by many other names, such as '''salibandy''' (in Finland), '''innebandy''' (in Sweden and Norway), and '''unihockey''' (in Switzerland and Ireland). The names \"salibandy\" and \"innebandy\" are derived from [[bandy]]; they translate to \"hall bandy\" and \"indoor bandy\" respectively. Unihockey is derived from \"universal hockey\" since it is meant to be a special and simplified [[hockey]] form.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n{{Main|List of IFF member nations}}\n\nWhen the IFF was founded in 1986, the sport was played in mostly Nordic countries, [[Japan]], and several parts of [[Europe]]. By 1990, floorball was recognized in 7 countries, and by the time of the first European Floorball Championships in 1994, that number had risen to 14. That number included the [[United States Floorball Association|United States]], who was the first country outside of Europe and [[Asia]] to recognize floorball.<ref name=ifftoday>{{cite web |url=http://www.floorball.org/default.asp?sivu=171&alasivu=25&kieli=826 |title=IFF TODAY AND HISTORY IN SHORT |website=Floorball.org |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> By the time of the [[1996 Men's World Floorball Championships|first men's world championships]] in 1996, 20 nations played floorball, with 12 of them participating at the tournament.\n\nAs of 2009, the sport of floorball has been played in almost 80 countries. Of those, 58 have national floorball associations that are recognized by the IFF. With the addition of [[Sierra Leone]], [[Africa]]'s first floorball nation, the IFF has at least one national association on each [[continent]] of the [[world]], with the exception of [[Antarctica]].\n\n=== Development ===\n10 years after the IFF was founded, the first world championships were played, with a sold out final of 15,106 people at the [[Ericsson Globe|Globen]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. In addition to that, the world's two largest floorball leagues, Finland's Salibandyliiga and Sweden's Svenska Superligan were formed, in 1986 and 1995 respectively.\n\n==== Recognition ====\nIn December 2008, the IFF and the sport of floorball received recognition from the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). In July 2011, the IOC officially welcomed the IFF into its family of Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF). This will pave the way for floorball to enter the official sport programme.  The IFF hopes that this recognition will help allow floorball to become a part of the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floorball.org/news.asp?tyyppi=vanhat&offset=20&kieli=826&id_tiedote=832&alue=171&yhteinen= |title=Floorball moves towards becoming an Olympic Sport |website=Floorball.org |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, the IFF and the sport of floorball received recognition from the [[Special Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floorball.org/news.asp?kieli=826&id_tiedote=882&alue=171 |title=Floorball receives recognition by the Special Olympics |website=Floorball.org |date=23 Jan 2009 |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to recognition by the International Olympic Committee and Special Olympics, the IFF is also a member of the Sport Accord &ndash; formerly known as [[General Association of International Sports Federations]] (GAISF), and co-operates with the [[International University Sports Federation]] (FISU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floorball.org/default.asp?sivu=2&kieli=826 |title=IFF |website=Floorball.org |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> Floorball is now also member of IWGA which runs the [[World Games]] and floorball will be for the first time on programme in [[World Games 2017|Wroc\u0142aw 2017]].\n\n== World championships ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sweden2006.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Sweden men's national floorball team|Sweden]] celebrates their [[2006 Men's World Floorball Championships|2006 World Floorball Championship]] after defeating [[Finland men's national floorball team|Finland]] 7\u20136 in [[Overtime (sports)|Sudden Victory Overtime]].]] -->\n{{Main|Floorball World Championships|List of World Floorball Champions}}\nThe world floorball championships are an annual event where teams from across the world gather to play in a tournament in order to win the world championship. As of 2011, eight Men's, eight Women's, six Men's Under-19, and four Women's Under-19 World Floorball Championships have taken place. The Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland remain the only five countries to have ever captured a medal at a World Championship event.\n* The Men's World Floorball Championships take place every December (since 2008) in every even year.\n* The Women's World Floorball Championships take place every December (since 2009) in every odd year.\n* The Men's under-19 World Floorball Championships take place every May (since 2009) in every odd year.\n* The Women's under-19 World Floorball Championships take place every May (since 2008) in every even year.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2009, the IFF used a World Floorball Championship format where the last team in the A-Division was relegated to the B-Division, while the top team in the B-Division was promoted to the A-Division. This format caused much hardship for countries such as [[Men's national floorball team of Australia|Australia]], [[Men's national floorball team of Canada|Canada]], [[Men's national floorball team of Slovakia|Slovakia]], and [[Men's national floorball team of Spain|Spain]], who have all been trying to get to the B-Division from the C-Division since 2004. In 2010, the IFF adopted a [[FIFA]]-like continental qualification system, where teams must qualify to play at the world championships. Depending on the number of countries registered per [[continent]] or region, the IFF gives spots for the world championships. For example, [[Men's national floorball team of Argentina|Argentina]], [[Men's national floorball team of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Men's national floorball team of Canada|Canada]] and the [[Men's national floorball team of the United States|United States]] would need to play for one spot at the world championships in a continental qualification tournament for the Americas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://windows3.salibandy.net/Liitetiedostot/CB2007_3_Appex%2014a%20WFC%20new%20system.pdf |title=WFC new style system |website=Windows3.salibany.net |accessdate=7 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214164112/http://windows3.salibandy.net/Liitetiedostot/CB2007_3_Appex%2014a%20WFC%20new%20system.pdf |archivedate=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Floorball rink1.svg|thumb|230px|The dimensions of a floorball rink]]\n\n=== Measurements ===\nFloorball is played indoors on a rink whose size can officially vary from {{convert|18|\u2013|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide to {{convert|36|\u2013|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} long,<ref name=\"TIFF\">{{cite web|url=http://windows3.salibandy.net/Liitetiedostot/Rules%20of%20the%20Game%20Edition%202014.pdf |format=PDF |title=The International Floorball Federation : Rules of the Game |website=Windows3.salibandy.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811134133/http://windows3.salibandy.net/Liitetiedostot/Rules%20of%20the%20Game%20Edition%202014.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=7 September 2016 }}</ref> and which is surrounded by {{cvt|50|cm}} high enclosed boards with rounded corners.

Players may wear [[shin guard]]s, eye protectors and protective padding for vital areas although most do not. Protective eyewear is, in some countries, compulsory for junior players.\n\nA floorball stick is short compared with one for ice hockey; the maximum size for a stick is 114&nbsp;cm. As a stick cannot weigh any more than 350&nbsp;grams, floorball sticks are often made of carbon and composite materials. The blade of the stick can either be \"right\" or \"left\" which indicates which way stick is supposed to be held from the players point of view. A player who is right-handed will often use a \"left\" blade since this he/she will be holding the stick to left and the other way around for left-handed people.<ref>[https://www.myactivesg.com/sports/floorball/how-to-play/floorball-for-beginners/stick-holding-and-posture-in-floorball]</ref>\n\n=== Goalkeepers ===\nGoalkeepers wear limited protection provided by padded pants, a padded chest protector, knee pads, and a helmet. The goalkeeper may also wear other protective equipment such as elbow pads and jock straps but bulky padding is not permitted. Goalkeepers do not use sticks and may use their hands to play the ball when they are within the goalkeeper's box. There, they are allowed to throw the ball out to their teammates provided that the ball touches the ground before the half court mark. When they are completely outside the box, goalkeepers are considered field players and are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands.\n\n=== Ball ===\n[[File:Innebandy boll.jpg|right|thumb|A floorball ball. This is a plastic precision type ball, characterized by 1516 tiny dimples that reduce air resistance, as well as friction on the floor.]]\nA floor ball weighs {{cvt|23|g}} and its diameter is {{cvt|72|mm}}. It has 26 holes in it, each of which are {{cvt|10|mm}} in diameter. Many of these balls now are made with aerodynamic technology, where the ball has over a thousand small dimples in it that reduce air resistance. There have been several times where a ball has been recorded to have traveled at a speed of approximately {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floorballcentral.org/2010/11/new-world-record.html |title=New World Record |website=Floorballcentral.org |date=5 November 2010 |author= |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Rules ===\nEach team can field six players at a time on the court, one player being a [[goalkeeper]]. But the [[Coach (sport)|coach]] can take the goalkeeper off for a short amount of time, and switch him with a field player. This can make advantages for the attacking side of the team, and disadvantages when it comes to their own defence. The team is also allowed to change players any time in the game, usually they change the whole team. Individual substitution happens sometimes, but it usually happens when a player is exhausted or is hurt.\n\nA floorball game is officially played over three periods lasting 20 minutes each (15 minutes for juniors). The time is stopped in the case of penalties, goals, time-outs and any situation where the ball is not considered to be in play. The signal of a time out should be a triple sound.<ref name=\"IFF\" /> An intermission of 10 minutes (or maximum 15 minutes in some competitions)<ref name=\"TIFF\" /> takes place between each period, where teams change ends and substitution areas. Each team is allowed one timeout of 30 seconds (which is often used late in matches). There are two [[referee]]s to oversee the game, each with equal authority. If a game ends in a tie, teams play ten minutes extra, and the team that scores first wins.<ref name=\"IFF\" />\n\n[[Checking (ice hockey)|Checking]] is prohibited in floorball. Controlled shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed, but [[ice hockey]]-like checking is forbidden. Pushing players without the ball or competing for a loose ball is also disallowed, and many of these infractions lead to two-minute [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]]. The best comparison in terms of legal physical contact is [[Association football]], where checking is used to improve one's positioning in relation to the ball rather than to remove an opposing player from the play. In addition to checking, players cannot lift another opponents stick or perform any stick infractions in order to get to the ball. As well, players may not raise their stick or play the ball above their knee level, and a stick cannot be placed in between a player's legs.\n\nWhen a player commits a foul, or when the ball is deemed unplayable, play is resumed from a free-hit or a [[face-off]]. A free hit involves a player from one team to start play from the place where the ball was last deemed unplayable. A comparison of this is a free kick in soccer. For many fouls, such as stick infractions, a free hit is the only discipline provided. However, at the referee's discretion, a penalty may be worth either two or five minutes. At that point, the player who committed the foul sits in the penalty area, and his team is short handed for the time of the penalty. If an 'extreme' foul is committed, such as physical contact or unsportsmanlike behavior, a player may receive a 10-minute penalty or even a match misconduct.\n\n==== Penalties ====\nTwo-minute penalties can arise from a number of infractions and result in the offending player being sat on a penalty seat next to the scorers/timekeepers and away from the team benches. Each penalty has a specific code that is recorded on the [http://www.floorball.org/Liitetiedostot/IFF%20Match%20Record%202010.pdf official match record] along with the time of the foul. The team of the offending player will play short-handed for the full length of the penalty. The codes are as follows;\n\nTwo Minute Penalties\n* 201: Hit\n* 202: Blocking Stick\n* 203: Lifting Stick\n* 204: Incorrect Kick\n* 205: High Kick\n* 206: High Stick\n* 207: Incorrect Push\n* 208: Tackle/Trip\n* 209: Holding\n* 210: Obstruction\n* 211: Incorrect Distance\n* 212: Lying Play\n* 213: Hands\n* 214: Header\n* 215: Incorrect Substitution\n* 216: Too Many Players\n* 217: Repeated Offences\n* 218: Delaying\n* 219: Protest\n* 220: Incorrect Entering of the Rink\n* 221: Incorrect Equipment\n* 222: Measuring Stick\n* 223: Incorrect Numbering\n* 224: Play without Stick\n* 225: Non-removal of Broken Stick\n* 226: Penalty at Penalty Shot\n\n5 Minute Penalties\n* 501: Violent Hit\n* 502: Dangerous Play\n* 503: Hooking\n* 504: Roughing\n* 505: Repeated Offences\n\nPersonal Fouls/Penalties\n* 101: Unsportsperson-like Behaviour\n\n== Forms ==\n\n=== Freebandy ===\nFreebandy is a sport that developed in the 2000s from floorball fanatics who specialize in a technique called \"zorro\", which involves lifting the ball onto a stick and allowing air resistance and fast movements to keep the ball \"stuck\" to the stick. This technique is also referred to as \"airhooking\" or \"skyhooking\". In freebandy, the rules are very much the same of those of floorball, with the exception of high nets and no infractions for high sticking. As well, the sticks are slightly tweaked from those of a floorball variety to include a \"pocket\" where the ball can be placed.\n\n=== Special Olympics ===\nFloorball at the Special Olympics is slightly modified from the \"regular\" form of floorball. Matches are played 3-on-3 with a goaltender, on a smaller court that measures {{convert|20|m|ft}} long by {{convert|12|m|ft}} wide. This form of floorball was developed for the intellectually disabled, and has yet to be played at the Special Olympics. Floorball was played as a demonstration sport at the [[2013 Special Olympics World Winter Games]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/floorball.aspx |title=Special Olympics: Floorball |website=Specialolympics.org |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> and was played as an official sport at the [[2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games|games in 2017]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/General/Floorball_is_now_an_official_Special_Olympics_World_Games_Sport.aspx |title=Special Olympics: Floorball is now an official Special Olympics World Games Sport |website=Specialolympics.org |date=14 May 2014 |author=Mariusz Damentko |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Streetbandy ===\nA simplified less formal version of Floorball, played with smaller team numbers, shorter periods and can be played outdoors on various surfaces, including AstroTurf. In its most basic form, it is an informal pick up game amongst friends. However, a more formal version is played in Sweden, with the following structure:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://streetgames.se/om-street-games/streetbandy/ |title=Streetbandy |website=Streetgames.se |accessdate=7 September 2016}}{{sv icon}}</ref>\n* 3 field players on each team, with smaller overall team sizes (including subs.)\n* small goals, with no goalie\n* smaller playing area, usually closer to a half rink.\n* 10 minute length.\n* tendency towards \"first team to score 5 goals in the time limit\" rather than traditional scoring. Sudden death on a draw.\n* penalties are taken from the centre line.\n* most situations arising from the ball leaving play are resumed from a fixed point (e.g. corner, centre line)\n* no physical contact, high sticks or dangerous activity allowed.\n\n=== Swiss floorball ===\nSwiss floorball called unihockey is a revised version of a floorball match. The match is played on a slightly smaller court and often involves only three field players playing on each side, in 3-on-3 floorball. This form of floorball is also slightly shorter, with only two periods of 15 to 20 minutes each played. In Switzerland this form of playing is called \"smallcourt\" (Kleinfeld), opposed to the usual style of playing on a bigger court, which is called \"bigcourt\" (Grossfeld).\n\n=== Wheelchair floorball ===\nOriginally developed for players with disabilities, wheelchair floorball is played with exactly the same rules as \"regular\" floorball. Players use the same stick and ball, and goaltenders are also allowed to play.\n\nThe first ever IFF-sanctioned wheelchair floorball matches were played between the men's teams of the [[Men's national wheelchair floorball team of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] and [[Men's national wheelchair floorball team of Sweden|Sweden]], during the [[2008 Men's World Floorball Championships]] in [[Prague]], Czech Republic.\n\nIn addition to this, there is also an electric wheelchair variation. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n== Competitions ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Efc0708celebration.jpg|thumb|300px|[[AIK Innebandy]] celebrate their [[2007\u201308 Men's EuroFloorball Cup Finals|2007\u201308 EuroFloorball Cup]] after narrowly defeating [[Warberg IC]] 2\u20131 in [[Overtime (sports)|Overtime]] in the final match.]] -->\nIn addition to the [[Floorball World Championships]], there are other IFF Events for club teams such as the Champions Cup which is for the national competition winners from the Top-4 ranked nations, and the EuroFloorball Cup for the national competition winners from the 5th and lower ranked nations.

The event was created by the [[Singapore Floorball Association]] together with the cooperation of the [[Asia Oceania Floorball Confederation]] (AOFC). Members of the AOFC get together during this tournament to play for the Asia Pacific Floorball Championship every year. The most recent champions are [[Men's national floorball team of Australia]].\n\nAs of 2010, the Asia Pacific Floorball Championship is also the qualifying tournament for the [[World Floorball Championships]].\n\n=== Canada Cup ===\n{{Main|List of Canada Cup winners}}\nThe [[Canada Cup (floorball)|Canada Cup]] is an international club tournament that is held every year in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

It is famous not only for its on-court activities, but also for those off-court. The tournament attracts 200+ clubs every year from 20 different countries. The most recent champions of the prestigious Czech Open are Sweden's [[IBF Falun]].\n\n=== Champions Cup ===\nThe Champions Cup was played for the first time in 2011. It is now the premier IFF event for Men's and Women's Club teams. The national championship winners from the Top-4 ranked nations receive automatic qualification, while the remaining two spots are made up by a team nominated by the Local Event organiser and the winner of the previous year's EuroFloorball Cup.\n\nIn 2011, the winners were Men: SSV Helsinki (Finland) and Women: IF Djurg\u00e5rdens IBF (Sweden).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floorball.org/default.asp?sivu=5&alasivu=483&kieli=826 |title=Champions Cup 2011 |website=Floorball.org |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== EuroFloorball Cup ===\n{{Main|EuroFloorball Cup}}\nThe EuroFloorball Cup (formerly European Cup) is an IFF-organised club event for both men's and women's teams. It has taken place every single year since 1993, and in 2000 it changed its format to a 2-year event (i.e. 2000\u201301). In 2008, the tournament switched back to its one-year format. In 2011 it underwent another change when the Champions Cup was introduced for the first time.\n\nThe EuroFloorball Cup (EFC) is now for the national competition winners from the 5th and lower ranked nations.

The [[SIPTU]] trade union has stated its opposition to the Taoiseach Enda Kenny's assertion, in response to Ireland's economic crisis, that the national wage agreement should be suspended.

The party leadership has been eager to be seen to engage in an ongoing constitutional debate in Ireland on the topic of political reform. The debate which has been monitored by the ''[[Irish Times]]'' in its Renewing the Republic opinion pieces, has largely centred on the make up of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament. Fine Gael's [[Phil Hogan]] TD, now a European Commissioner, has published the party's proposals for political and constitutional reform. In a policy document entitled ''New Politics'', Hogan suggested creating a country with \"a smaller, more dynamic and more responsive political system,\" reducing the size of the D\u00e1il by 20, changing the way the D\u00e1il works, and in a controversial move, abolishing the Irish senate, [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0320/breaking39.html?via=rel |title=Irish Times on Kenny Conference Speech, 26 April 2010 |publisher=M.irishtimes.com |date=20 March 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAiming to carry out the parties proposals through a series of constitutional referendums, the proposals were echoed by then Labour leader Eamon Gilmore, when he proposed his own constitutional \"crusade\" at his 2010 party conference, shortly after.<ref>Commentary of Gilmore conference speech and Labour consistency with FG policy \u2013 {{cite web |url=http://www.thepost.ie/story/text/eyidqlsnql/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726213708/http://www.thepost.ie/story/text/eyidqlsnql/ |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}, 26 April 2010</ref>\n\n===Social policies===\nFine Gael was traditionally [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] for most of the twentieth century, due to the conservative Christian ethos of Irish society during this time. Its members are variously influenced by [[christian democracy]], [[social liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] on issues of social policy. Under Garret FitzGerald, the party's more social liberal or pluralist wing gained prominence. Proposals to allow [[divorce]] were put by referendum by two Fine Gael\u2013led governments, in 1986 under FitzGerald,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electionsireland.org/results/referendum/refdetail.cfm?ref=1986R |title=Referendum 26 June 1986 Dissolution of Marriage |work=ElectionsIreland.org |accessdate=25 February 2011}}</ref> and in 1995 under John Bruton, passing very narrowly on this second attempt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electionsireland.org/results/referendum/refresult.cfm?ref=1995R |title=Referendum 24 November 1995 Dissolution of Marriage |work=ElectionsIreland.org |date=24 November 1995 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n====LGBT rights====\nFine Gael supported [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Ireland|civil unions]] for same-sex couples from 2003, voting for the [[Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010|Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2010]], and the party approved a motion at its 2012 Ard Fheis to prioritise the consideration of [[same-sex marriage]] in the upcoming constitutional convention. In 2013 party leader and Taoiseach Enda Kenny announced his support for same-sex marriage. The Fine Gael led government held a referendum on the subject on 22 May 2015. The referendum passed. The electorate voted to extend full marriage rights to same sex couples, with 62.1% in favour and 37.9% opposed. The party has run advertisements in GCN (Gay Community News) advertising its commitments to same-sex couples.\n\n====Abortion rights====\nFine Gael was historically pro-life (supportive of the equal rights between fetus and the mother). It has however frequently disagreed with various pro-life organisations in Ireland, due to the fact that such organisations support a complete ban on abortion. In 1983, having initially supported the proposal, it came out in opposition to the [[Eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland|Eighth Amendment to the Irish Constitution]] that was being submitted in a referendum in 1983, which nearly banned most of the abortions. Under then leader and [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] it campaigned for a 'No' vote, arguing, on the advice of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]] [[Peter Sutherland]], that the wording, which had been drafted under the previous government, when analysed was ambiguous and open to many interpretations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = \"BREAKING THE SILENCE ON ABORTION: the 1983 referendum campaign\".|last = Muldowney|first = Mary|date = March\u2013April 2013|journal = History Ireland|doi = |pmid = }}</ref> This referendum resulted in the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution, giving the unborn child a qualified<ref>Through the words \"as far as practicable\".

The character was also featured extensively in cinema, television, radio, comic strips, and comic books for over 90 years, and has become an [[archetype]] of the [[Supervillain|evil criminal genius]] and [[mad scientist]], while lending the name to the [[Fu Manchu moustache]].\n\n== Background ==\nSax Rohmer, without any prior knowledge and understanding of Chinese culture, decided to start the Fu Manchu series after his [[ouija board]] spelled out C-H-I-N-A-M-A-N when he asked for a fortune. During the time period, the idea of the [[Yellow Peril]] was spreading in North American society. Western people had feared that Chinese people would elevate drug hysteria.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14bs955|title=Serial Fu Manchu: The Chinese Supervillain and the Spread of Yellow Peril Ideology|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2014|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781439910559}}</ref> The image of Orientals \u201cinvading\u201d Western nations became the foundation of Rohmer\u2019s commercial success, being able to sell 20 million copies in his lifetime.<ref name=\"Seshagiri 2006 162\u2013194\">{{Cite journal|last=Seshagiri|first=Urmila|date=2006|title=Modernity's (Yellow) Perils: Dr. Fu-Manchu and English Race Paranoia|jstor=4489239|journal=Cultural Critique|issue=62|pages=162\u2013194}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Dr. Fu Manchu===\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"Imagine a person, tall, lean and feline, high-shouldered, with a brow like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and a face like [[Satan]],&nbsp;... one giant intellect, with all the resources of science past and present&nbsp;...

[[fungus|fungi]] and my tiny allies, the [[bacillus|bacilli]]&nbsp;... my black spiders\" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons. He had a great respect for the truth (in fact, his word was his bond), and used torture and other gruesome tactics to dispose of enemies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1228548/racist-curse-fu-manchu-back-spotlight-after-chevrolet-ad|title=The racist curse of Fu Manchu back in spotlight after Chevrolet ad|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDr. Fu Manchu is described as a mysterious villain because he seldom appears on the stage. Dr. Fu Manchu always sends his assistants to commit the crimes for him. In the novel, ''The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu'', Dr. Fu Manchu sent a young beautiful girl for him to go to the crime scene to check whether the victim is dead. He also sent a dacoit to attack Sir Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie.\n\nIn the 1933 novel, ''The Bride of Fu Manchu'', Fu Manchu claims to hold doctorates from four Western universities. In the 1959 novel, ''Emperor Fu Manchu'', he reveals he attended [[Heidelberg University]], the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[University of Edinburgh]] (in the film ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'', on the other hand, he states proudly that \"I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ's College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me 'Doctor'\"). At the time of their first encounter (1911), Dr. Petrie believed that Fu Manchu was over 70 years old. This would have placed Fu Manchu in the West studying for his first doctorate in the 1860s or 1870s.\n\nAccording to [[Cay Van Ash]], Rohmer's biographer and former assistant who became the first author to continue the series after Rohmer's death, \"Fu Manchu\" was a title of honour, which meant \"the warlike [[Manchu people|Manchu]]\". Van Ash speculates that Fu Manchu had been a member of the [[Qing dynasty|imperial family of China]] who backed the losing side in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In the early books (1913-1917), Fu Manchu is an agent of the Chinese [[Tong (organization)|tong]] known as the Si-Fan and acts as the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations targeting Western imperialists. In the later books (1931-1959), he has gained control of the Si-Fan, which has been changed from a mere Chinese tong into an international organization under his leadership and, in addition to attempting to take over the world and restore China to its ancient glory (Fu Manchu's main goals right from the beginning), also tries to rout [[fascism|fascist]] dictators and halt the spread of [[communism]], Fu Manchu knowing them to be major rivals in his plans for world domination. The Si-Fan is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and [[human trafficking]] (\"white slavery\"). Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the [[elixir of life]], a formula he spent decades trying to perfect.\n\n'''<big>Dr. Fu Manchu's appearance/Fu Manchu mustache</big>'''\n\nDr. Fu Manchu\u2019s appearance has been portrayed in both novels and other types of media. The most representative part of Dr. Fu Manchu\u2019s appearance is his mustache. The mustache is also registered on dictionaries, and not only registered as Dr. Fu Manchu\u2019s mustache, but also just registered as a Fu Manchu which shows that the mustache of Dr. Fu Manchu has become an iconic characteristic of him. The Fu Manchu/Fu Manchu mustache is described as a long, narrow moustache whose ends taper and droop down to the chin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fu_manchu|title=Fu Manchu {{!}} Definition of Fu Manchu in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n===Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie ===\n\nOpposing Fu Manchu in the stories are Denis Nayland Smith and, in the first three books, Dr. Petrie. They are in the [[Sherlock Holmes|Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] tradition, with Dr. Petrie narrating the stories (after the third book, they would be narrated by various others up to the end of the series) while Nayland Smith carries the fight, combating Fu Manchu more by sheer luck and dogged determination than intellectual brilliance (except ''in extremis''). Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu share a grudging respect for one another, as each believes that a man must keep his word, even to an enemy.\n\nIn the first three books, Nayland Smith is a colonial police commissioner in Burma granted a [[roving commission]] which allows him to exercise authority over any group that can help him in his mission. He resembles [[Sherlock Holmes]] in physical description and acerbic manner, but not in deductive genius. He has been criticized as being a racist and [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] character, especially in the early books in the series, and gives voice to anti-[[Asian people|Asian]] sentiments. When Rohmer revived the series in 1931, Smith (who has been knighted by this time for his efforts to defeat Fu Manchu, although he would always admit that the honor was not earned by superior intellect) is Assistant Commissioner of [[Scotland Yard]]. He later resigns this post and accepts a position with the British Secret Service. Several books have him placed on special assignment with the [[FBI]].\n\nActors who played Nayland Smith:\n*[[O. P. Heggie]] in ''[[The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1930)\n*[[Lewis Stone]] in ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932)\n*[[Hanley Stafford]] in ''[[The Shadow of Fu Manchu]]'' (1939-1940)\n*[[William Royle]] in ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]'' (1940)\n*[[Lester Matthews]] in ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]''  (1956)\n*[[Nigel Green]] in ''[[The Face of Fu Manchu]]'' (1965)\n*[[Douglas Wilmer]] in ''[[The Brides of Fu Manchu]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]'' (1967)\n*[[Richard Greene]] in ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'' (1969)\n*[[Peter Sellers]] in ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1980)\n\nActors who played Dr. Petrie:\n*[[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]] in ''[[The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1930)\n*[[Gale Gordon]] in ''[[The Shadow of Fu Manchu]]'' (1939-1940)\n*[[Olaf Hytten]] in ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]'' (1940)\n*[[Clark Howat]] in ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1956)\n*[[Howard Marion Crawford]] in ''[[The Face of Fu Manchu]]'' (1965), ''[[The Brides of Fu Manchu]]'' (1966), ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]'' (1967), ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'' (1969)\n\n=== K\u00e2raman\u00e8h ===\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"Many there are, I doubt not, who will regard the Eastern girl with horror.

Her real name is unknown. She was sold to the Si-Fan by Egyptian slave traders while still a child. Kara falls in love with the narrator of the first three books in the series, Dr. Petrie. She rescues Petrie and Nayland Smith many times. Eventually the couple are united and she wins her freedom. They marry and have a daughter, Fleurette, who figures in later novels. Author [[Lin Carter]] later created a son for Dr. Petrie and Kara, but this is not considered canonical.\n\n=== Fah lo Suee ===\n\nFu Manchu's daughter, Fah lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, frequently plotting to usurp her father's position in the Si-Fan and aiding his enemies both within and outside of the organization. Her real name is unknown; Fah lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment. She was introduced anonymously while still a teenager in the third book in the series and plays a larger role in several of the titles of the 1930s and 1940s. She was known for a time as Koreani after being brainwashed by her father, but her memory was later restored. She is infamous for taking on false identities, like her father, among them Madame Ingomar, Queen Mamaloi and Mrs. van Roorden. In film, she has been portrayed by numerous actresses over the years. Her character is usually renamed in film adaptations because of difficulties with pronunciation. [[Anna May Wong]] played Ling Moy in 1931's ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]''. [[Myrna Loy]] portrayed the similarly named Fah lo See in 1932's ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]''. Gloria Franklin had the role of Fah lo Suee in 1940's ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]''. [[Laurette Luez]] played Karamaneh in 1956's ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'', but the character owed more to Fah lo Suee than Rohmer's depiction of Karamaneh. [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]] portrayed Fu Manchu's daughter, Lin Tang, in the five [[Christopher Lee]] films of the 1960s.\n\n=== Unnamed assistant ===\n\nIn the novel ''The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu'', Dr. Fu-Manchu sent a young beautiful girl for him to go to the crime scene to check whether the victim is dead.

Likewise, Rohmer's publisher, Doubleday, refused to publish further additions to the best-selling series for the duration of World War II once the United States entered the conflict. BBC Radio and Broadway investors subsequently rejected Rohmer's proposals for an original Fu Manchu radio serial and stage show during the 1940s.\n\nThe re-release of ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'' in 1972 was met with protest from the [[Japanese American Citizens League]], who stated that \"the movie was offensive and demeaning to [[Asian Americans]].\"<ref>Gregory William Mank, ''Hollywood Cauldron: 13 Horror Films from the Genres's Golden Age'', McFarland, 2001 (pp.53&ndash;89) {{ISBN|0-7864-1112-0}}</ref> Due to this protest, CBS television decided to cancel a showing of ''The Vengeance of Fu Manchu''.

Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner. pp. 242</ref>  But for still others, Fu Manchu was just one of numerous villains of various ethnic origins, and was seen in counter-balance to positive Asian characters such as police detective [[Charlie Chan]].\n\nAfter World War II, the evil stereotype inspired by Fu Manchu increasingly became a subject of satire. Fred Fu Manchu, a \"famous Chinese bamboo saxophonist\", was a recurring character on ''[[The Goon Show]]'', a 1950s British radio comedy programme. He was featured in the episode \"The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu\" in 1955 (announced as \"Fred Fu-Manchu and his Bamboo Saxophone\"), and made minor appearances in other episodes (including \"China Story\", \"The Siege of Fort Night\", and in \"The Lost Emperor\" as \"Doctor Fred Fu Manchu, oriental tattooist\"). The character was created and performed by [[Spike Milligan]], who used it to mock British xenophobia and self-satisfaction, the traits that summoned the original Fu Manchu into existence, and not as a slur against Asians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.braineater.com/fu.html |title=Blood of Fu Manchu |publisher=Braineater.com |date=}}</ref>  An attempt by Britain's [[Hammer Films]] in the 1970s to revive the older, malignant Fu Manchu in a handful of films starring [[Christopher Lee]] was temporarily successful but did not spread to other films and stories.\n\nIn 1977, [[Cadbury#Brands|Trebor]] produced a \"Fu Munchews\" [[Confectionery|sweet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njedge.net/~knapp/candy.htm |title=FuMunChews |publisher=Njedge.net |date=16 September 1976}}</ref>\n\nFu Manchu was parodied in the character of Fiendish Dr. Wu in the 2009 action-comedy film ''[[Black Dynamite]]'', in which the executor of an evil plan against African-Americans is an insidious, moustache-sporting Kung Fu master.<ref>{{Citation|last=James St. Clair|title=Fiendish Dr. Wu|date=2011-04-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuFL8Le1Pqk|accessdate=2018-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu'' (1913) (U.K. title: ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'').\n* ''The Return of Dr Fu-Manchu'' (1916) (U.K. title: ''The Devil Doctor'')\n* ''The Hand of Fu-Manchu'' (1917) (U.K. title: ''The Si-Fan Mysteries'')\n* ''Daughter of Fu Manchu'' (1931)\n* ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'' (1932)\n* ''Fu Manchu's Bride'' (1933) (U.K. title: ''The Bride of Fu Manchu'')\n* ''The Trail of Fu Manchu'' (1934)\n* ''President Fu Manchu'' (1936)\n* ''The Drums of Fu Manchu'' (1939)\n* ''The Island of Fu Manchu'' (1941)\n* ''Shadow of Fu Manchu'' (1948)\n* ''Re-Enter Fu Manchu'' (1957)  (U.K. title: ''Re-Enter Dr. Fu Manchu'')\n* ''Emperor Fu Manchu'' (1959)  This was Rohmer's last novel, published before his death.\n* ''The Wrath of Fu Manchu'' (1973) was a posthumous anthology containing the title novella, first published in 1952, and three later short stories: \"The Eyes of Fu Manchu\" (1957), \"The Word of Fu Manchu\" (1958), and \"The Mind of Fu Manchu\" (1959).\n* ''Ten Years Beyond Baker Street'' (1984).

This lost university adventure of Holmes is narrated by Conan Doyle's character [[Reginald Musgrave]].\n\nFu Manchu also made appearances in the following non-''Fu Manchu'' books:\n* \"Sex Slaves of the Dragon Tong\" and \"Part of the Game\" are a pair of related short stories by [[F. Paul Wilson]] appearing in his collection, ''Aftershocks and Others: 19 Oddities'' (2009) and feature anonymous appearances by Dr. Fu Manchu and characters from ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''.\n* Fu Manchu appears under the name \"the Doctor\" in several stories in [[August Derleth]]'s [[Solar Pons]] detective series. Derleth's successor, [[Basil Copper]], also made use of the character.\n* Fu Manchu is the name of the Chinese ambassador in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slapstick (novel)|Slapstick]]'' (1976).\n* It is revealed that Chiun, the Master of [[Sinanju (martial art)|Sinanju]] has worked for the Devil Doctor, as have previous generations of Masters in [[The Destroyer (fiction)|The Destroyer]] novel No. 83 ''Skull Duggery''.\n* Fu Manchu also appears in the background to [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series. In this depiction, Fu Manchu was a charlatan and con man rather than a supervillain and in fact he was a Canadian married to a Chinese wife and only pretending to be Chinese himself; the grand criminal schemes attributed to him were mere myths, concocted either by himself or by sensationalist press and publicity-seeking police officers, the latter partly motivated by anti-Chinese prejudice.\n\n== In other media ==\n\n=== Film ===\n\nFu Manchu first appeared on the big screen in the 1923 British silent film serial ''The Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu'' starring [[Harry Agar Lyons]]. Lyons returned to the role the next year in ''The Further Mysteries of Dr. Fu Manchu.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/503748/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Mystery of Dr Fu Manchu, The (1923)|work=screenonline.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 Fu Manchu made his American film debut in Paramount's early talkie, ''[[The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' starring [[Warner Oland]], best known for his later portrayal of [[Charlie Chan]] in the 1930s. Oland repeated the role in 1930's ''[[The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' and 1931's ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' as well as in the short, ''Murder Will Out'' as part of the omnibus film, ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' where the Devil Doctor confronts both [[Philo Vance]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe most infamous incarnation of the character was MGM's ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932) starring [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Myrna Loy]]. The film's tone has long been considered racist and offensive, but that only added to its cult status alongside its campy humour, [[Grand Guignol]] sets and torture sequences. The film was suppressed for many years, but has since received critical re-evaluation and been released on DVD uncut.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nFu Manchu returned to the serial format in 1940 in Republic Pictures' ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]'', a 15-episode serial considered to be one of the best the studio ever made. It was later edited and released as a feature film in 1943.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOther than an obscure, unauthorised 1946 Spanish spoof ''El Otro Fu Manchu'', the Devil Doctor was absent from the big screen for 25 years, until producer [[Harry Alan Towers]] began a series starring [[Christopher Lee]] in 1965. Towers and Lee would make five Fu Manchu films through the end of the decade: ''[[The Face of Fu Manchu]]'' (1965), ''[[The Brides of Fu Manchu]]'' (1966), ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]'' (1967), ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' (1968), and finally ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'' (1969).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/503646/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Face of Fu Manchu, The (1965)|work=screenonline.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe character's last authorised film appearance was in the 1980 [[Peter Sellers]] spoof, ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' with Sellers featured in a double role as both Fu Manchu and Nayland Smith. The film bore little resemblance to any prior film or the original books. In the film, Fu Manchu claims he was known as \"Fred\" at public school, a reference to the character of \"The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu\" from a 1955 episode of ''[[The Goon Show]]'' which had co-starred Sellers.<ref>p.210 Lewis, Roger ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'' Random House, 1995</ref>\n\n[[Jess Franco]], who had directed ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' and ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'', also directed ''[[The Girl From Rio]]'', the second of three [[Harry Alan Towers]] films based on Rohmer's female Fu Manchu character, [[Sumuru (character)|Sumuru]]. He later directed an unauthorised 1986 Spanish film featuring Fu Manchu's daughter, ''Esclavas del Crimen''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn the 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', [[Nicolas Cage]] makes an uncredited comedic cameo appearance as Fu Manchu, during the \"trailer\" for the fake movie ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.\n\n=== Television ===\n\nIn 1956, the television arm of [[Republic Pictures]] produced a 13-episode syndicated series, ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' starring [[Glen Gordon]] as Dr. Fu Manchu, [[Lester Matthews]] as Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and [[Clark Howat]] as Dr. John Petrie. The title sequence depicted Smith and Fu Manchu in a game of chess as the announcer stated that \"the devil is said to play for men's souls. So does Dr. Fu Manchu, evil incarnate.\" At the conclusion of each episode, after Nayland Smith and Petrie had foiled Fu Manchu's latest fiendish scheme, Fu Manchu would be seen breaking a black chess piece in a fit of frustration (black king's bishop, always the same bit of film, repeated) just before the closing credits rolled. It was directed by noted serial director [[Franklin Adreon]] as well as [[William Witney]]. Fu Manchu was never allowed to succeed in this TV series. Unlike the Holmes/Watson type relationship of the films, the series featured Smith as a law enforcement officer and Petrie as a staff member for the [[Surgeon-General (United Kingdom)|Surgeon General]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n=== Music ===\n*American Stoner Rock band Fu Manchu formed in Southern California in 1985.\n*[[Desmond Dekker]] reggae 1969 'fu man chu'\n*[[The Rockin' Ramrods]] had a 1965 song titled \"Don't Fool With Fu Manchu\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2oUnuohuEE |title=DON'T FOOL WITH FU MANCHU - Rockin' Ramrods (1965).wmv |publisher=YouTube |date=10 April 2010}}</ref>\n*[[Quebec]] [[rock music|rock]] singer [[Robert Charlebois]] included an epic three-part song titled \"Fu Man Chu\" on his 1972 album ''Charlebois''\n*Russian hardbass artist XS Project has a song named \"[https://g.co/kgs/UMQfTV Fu Manchu]\"\n*American country music singer, Tim McGraw, published a song called ''Live Like You Were Dying.''

This was a radio programme designed to promote ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' magazine and presented weekly dramatisations of the current issue's stories and serials. Fu Manchu was voiced by Arthur Hughes. A self-titled show on CBS followed in 1932\u201333. [[John C.

Frank Cochrane voiced Fu Manchu. The BBC produced a competing series, ''The Peculiar Case of the Poppy Club'' starting in 1939.

These were reprints of the earlier Leo O'Mealia strips. Original Fu Manchu stories in comics had to wait for [[Avon Comics|Avon]]'s one-shot ''The Mask of Dr. Fu Manchu'' in 1951. A similar British one-shot, ''The Island of Fu Manchu'', was published in 1956.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* In the 1970s, [[Fu Manchu (comics)|Fu Manchu]] appeared as the father of the character [[Shang-Chi]] in the series ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu]].'' However [[Marvel Comics]] cancelled the book in 1983 and issues over licensing the character and concepts from the novels (such as his daughter, Fah Lo Suee) have hampered Marvel's ability to both collect the series in trade paperback format and reference Fu Manchu as Shang-Chi's father. As such, the character is either never mentioned by name, or by an alias (such as \"Mr. Han\").<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #11</ref> In ''Secret Avengers'' #6-10, writer Ed Brubaker officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where a rogue group of S.H.I.E.L.D agents resurrect a zombified version of Fu Manchu only to discover that \"Fu Manchu\" was only an alias; that Shang-Chi's father was really Zheng Zu, an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality.<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/benson-unleashes-shang-chis-deadly-hands-of-kung-fu/ Benson Unleashes Shang-Chi\u2019s \u201cDeadly Hands of Kung Fu\u201d]</ref>\n* Fu Manchu appears as an antagonist in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''.

This '[[Frisian freedom]]' was represented abroad by ''redjeven'' who were elected from among the wealthier farmers or from elected representatives of the autonomous rural municipalities.

He appointed [[Georg Schenck van Toutenburg]], who had crushed the peasants' revolt, as [[Stadtholder]] to rule over the province in his stead. When Charles abdicated in 1556, Frisia was inherited by [[Philip II of Spain]] along with the rest of the Netherlands. In 1566, Frisia joined the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Spanish rule.\n\nIn 1577, [[George de Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg]] was appointed Stadtholder of Frisia and other provinces. A moderate, trusted by both sides, he tried to reconcile the rebels with the Crown. But in 1580, Rennenburg declared for Spain. The [[States of Friesland|States of Frisia]] raised troops and took his strongholds of Leeuwarden, Harlingen and Stavoren. Rennenburg was deposed and Frisia became the fifth Lordship to join the rebels' [[Union of Utrecht]]. From 1580 onward, all stadtholders were members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. With the [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] in 1648, Frisia became a full member of the independent [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nIn 1798, three years after the [[Batavian Revolution]], the Lordship of Frisia was abolished and its territory was divided between the Eems and Oude IJssel departments. This was short-lived, however, as Frisia was revived as a department in 1802. When the Netherlands were annexed by the [[First French Empire]] in 1810, the department was renamed [[Frise (department)|Frise]]. After [[Napoleon]] was defeated in 1813 and a new constitution was introduced in 1814, Friesland became a province of the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands]], then of the unitary [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] a year later.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Friesland 5.62752E 53.13850N.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite photography of Friesland]]\n[[File:Eerste zonnestralen strijken over een winters landschap.

Furthermore, \"Indo-European\" is not a term used until 19th Century|date=September 2015}} Even early Renaissance poet [[Dante Alighieri]] refers to the height of [[Frisians]] in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' when, in the canticle about [[Hell]], he talks about the magnitude of an infernal demon by stating that \"not even three tall Frieslanders, were they set one upon the other, would have matched his height\".<ref>Alighieri, Dante. ''Divine Comedy'', \"Inferno\", Canto 31, line 64, in ''The Portable Dante'', ed. Paolo Milano, trans. Laurence Binyon, Penguin, 1975 {{ISBN|0-14-015032-3}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Friesian Stallion.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friesian horse]]]]\n\nFriesland is mainly an agricultural province. The black and white [[Holstein (cattle)|Frisian cattle]], black and white [[Stabyhoun]] and the black [[Frisian horse]] originated here. [[Tourism]] is another important source of income: the principal tourist destinations include the lakes in the southwest of the province and the islands in the [[Wadden Sea]] to the north. There are [[List of windmills in Friesland|195 windmills]] in the province of Friesland, out of a total of about 1200 in the entire country.\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Languages ===\nFriesland is the only one of the twelve provinces of the Netherlands to have its own language that is recognized as such, [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]. \n\nAccording to a study carried out in 2007, [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is the native language of the 54.3% of the inhabitants of the province of Friesland, then [[Dutch language|Dutch]] with 34.7%, then people who speak other regional languages of the [[Netherlands]] with 9.7%, and then other languages with 1.4%. Frisian speakers were less present in urban areas, while they were predominant in less dense municipalities. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://docplayer.nl/69343301-Rapportage-quick-scan-friese-taal-2007-provincie-fryslan.html|title=Rapportage quick scan Friese taal 2007 Provincie Frysl\u00e2n - PDF|website=docplayer.nl|access-date=2018-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWest Frisian is also spoken in a small adjacent part of the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], to the east. Closely related languages are spoken in nearby areas of Germany. They are [[Saterland Frisian language|East Frisian]] (''Seeltersk'', which is different from [[East Frisian Low Saxon|East Frisian (''Ostfriesisch'')]] and is spoken in the [[Saterland]], and a collection of [[Low German]] dialects of [[East Frisia]]) and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]], spoken in [[North Friesland]]. These languages are also closely related to Modern English.\n\nIn [[Stellingwarfs|Stellingwerf]], in south-east Friesland, a dialect of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] is spoken.<ref>{{Glottolog|stel1238|Stellingwerfs}}</ref>\n\nThe language policy in Friesland is preservation. West Frisian is a mandatory subject in Friesland in primary and secondary schools. There are many bilingual and trilingual primary schools in the province of Friesland which use West Frisian as a language of instruction besides Dutch and Modern English, but no secondary schools that include West Frisian as a language of instruction. The number of Frisians speakers who are able to write in Frisian is estimated at only 12%.<ref>(Hilton, 2013)</ref>\nThe provincial government takes various initiatives to preserve the West Frisian language. All parents in Friesland are provided with information about the language and multilingualism at children\u2019s birth (ex. \u2018taaltaske\u2019). The province also invests in the development of speech pathology materials and strives to create information technology devices for the West Frisian language. The Frisian government subsidizes the Af\u00fbk organization, which offers language courses and actively promotes Frisian in all sectors of society as well as the corporate domain which is currently dominated by Dutch and Modern English.<ref>(Af\u00fbk 2011)</ref> The province also promotes a wide range of art and entertainment in Frisian.<ref>Hilton, N. H., & Gooskens, C. (2013). Language policies and attitudes towards Frisian in the Netherlands. Phonetics in Europe: Perceptions and production, 139-157.</ref>\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[File:Finish 11-stedentocht 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Finish of the [[Elfstedentocht]] in 1956]]\n\nThe province is famous for its [[Speed skating|speed skaters]], with mass participation in cross-country ice skating when weather conditions permit.  When winters are cold enough to allow the freshwater canals to freeze hard, the province holds its traditional [[Elfstedentocht]] (Eleven cities tour), a {{convert|200|km|adj=on}} [[ice skating]] tour. A traditional sport is [[Frisian handball]]. Another Frisian practice is ''[[fierljeppen]]'', a sport with some similarities to pole vaulting. A jump consists of an intense sprint to the pole (''polsstok''), jumping and grabbing it, then climbing to the top while trying to control the pole's forward and lateral movements over a body of water and finishing with a graceful landing on a sand bed opposite to the starting point. Because of all the diverse skills required in fierljeppen, fierljeppers are considered to be very complete athletes with superbly developed strength and coordination. In the warmer months, many Frisians practice ''[[wadlopen]]'', the traditional art of wading across designated sections of the [[Wadden Sea]] at low tide.\n\nThere are currently two top level [[association football|football]] clubs playing in Friesland: [[SC Cambuur]] from Leeuwarden (home stadium [[Cambuur Stadion]]) and [[SC Heerenveen]] (home stadium [[Abe Lenstra Stadion]]).\n\n== Politics ==\n[[File:Leeuwarden Tweebaksmarkt 52 Provinsjeh\u00fbs.jpg|thumb|Seat of the provincial government in [[Leeuwarden]]]]\n\nThe [[King's Commissioner]] of Friesland is [[Arno Brok]].<ref>\"[http://www.fryslan.frl/bestuur/de-heer-arno-brok_41597/ De heer Arno Brok]\" (in Dutch), ''Province of Friesland''.

Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or [[dystopias]] to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{citation | last = Helford | first = Elyce Rae | contribution = Feminism | editor-last = Westfahl | editor-first = Gary | title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: themes, works and wonders | pages = 289\u2013291 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780313329531 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&pg=PA290 Preview.]</ref>\n{{Quotation|Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice.

This can be seen as early as 1666 in [[Margaret Cavendish]]'s ''[[The Blazing World]]'', in which she describes a utopian kingdom ruled by an empress. This foundational work has garnered attention from some [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]], such as [[Dale Spender]], who considered this a forerunner of the [[Science fiction|science fiction genre]], more generally.<ref name=\"Mothers of the Novel\">{{citation | first=Dale | last=Spender | author-link = Dale Spender | contribution = Biographical beginnings: Anne Cllifford, Lucy Hutchinson, Anne Fanshawe, Margaret Cavendish | editor-first=Dale | editor-last=Spender | editor-link = Dale Spender | title=Mothers of the Novel | page=43 | publisher=Pandora Press | location=London | date=1986 | isbn = 9780863580819 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> Another early female [[List of science fiction authors|writer of science fiction]] was [[Mary Shelley]].

Their texts, emerging during the [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminist movement]], often addressed issues of sexism through imagining different worlds that challenged gender expectations. In 1881, ''[[Mizora]]: A Prophecy'' described a [[single-gender world|women-only world]] with technological innovations such as [[parthenogenesis]], videophones, and artificial meat.<ref>Jean Pfaelzer, ''The Utopian Novel in America 1886&ndash;1896: The Politics of Form'', Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984; pp. 146-50.</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was closely followed by other feminist utopian works, such as [[Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett]]'s ''[[New Amazonia|New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future]]'' (1889). In 1892, poet and abolitionist [[Frances Harper]] published ''[[Iola Leroy]]'', one of the first novels by an African American woman. Set during the [[antebellum South]], it follows the life of a [[quadroon|mixed race woman with mostly white ancestry]] and records the hopes of many African Americans for social equality\u2014of race and gender\u2014during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name=\"Borgstrom 2006\">{{Cite journal|last = Borgstrom|first = Michael | title = Face Value: Ambivalent Citizenship in \"Iola Leroy\" | journal = [[African American Review]], special issue: The Curse of Caste | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 779\u2013793 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Winter 2006 | jstor = 40033753 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> ''[[Unveiling a Parallel]]'' (1893) features a male protagonist who takes an \"aeroplane\" to Mars, visiting two different \"Marsian\" societies; in both, there is equality between men and women.

This recently{{when|date=February 2016}} rediscovered novel displays familiar feminist SF conventions: a heroine narrator who masquerades as a man, the exploration of sexist mores, and the description of a future [[hollow earth]] society (like ''Mizora'') where women are equal.\n\n''[[Sultana's dream|The Sultana's Dream]]'' [[1905 in literature|(1905]]), by [[Bengali science fiction|Bengali]] [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain]], engages with the limited role of women in [[British Raj|colonial India]]. Through depicting a gender-reversed [[purdah]] in an alternate technologically futuristic world, Hussain's book has been described {{who|date=July 2018}} as illustrating the potential for cultural insights through role reversals early on in the subgenre's formation. Along these same lines, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] explores and critiques the expectations of women and men by creating a single-sex world in ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' ([[1915 in literature|1915]]), possibly the most well-known of the early feminist SF and utopian novels.\n\n===Between the wars===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, many popular pulp science fiction magazines exaggerated views of masculinity and featured portrayals of women that were perceived as sexist.<ref>[[Lisa Tuttle]] in Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 1344.</ref> These views would be subtly satirized by [[Stella Gibbons]] in ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]'' (1932)<ref>{{Cite book|title = Being Married, Doing Gender: A Critical Analysis of Gender Relationships in Marriage|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k5zrAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2014|isbn = 9781317725121|first = Caroline|last = Dryden}}</ref> and much later by [[Margaret Atwood]] in ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' (2000).

Each highlights what the authors believe to be the socially constructed aspects of [[gender role]]s by creating worlds with genderless societies.<ref>Helford, p.290.</ref> Two of these authors were pioneers in [[feminist criticism]] of science fiction during the 1960s and 70s through essays collected in ''The Language of the Night'' (Le Guin, 1979) and ''How To Suppress Women's Writing'' (Russ, 1983). Men also contributed literature to feminist science fiction. Prominently,  [[Samuel R. Delany]]'s short story, \"[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]\" (1968), which won the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]] in 1970, follows the life of a gay man that includes themes involving sadomasochism, gender, significance of language, and when high and low society encounter one another, while his novel ''[[Babel-17]]'' has an autistic woman of colour as its primary hero and protagonist.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The desperate and the human|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=RELEVANCE&docType=Book+review&tabID=T003&prodId=AONE&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&contentSegment=&currentPosition=1&searchResultsType=MultiTab&inPS=true&userGroupName=s8492775&docId=GALE&#124;A131815930&contentSet=GALE&#124;A131815930|language = |first = Stefen|last = Styrsky|date = 2005|journal = Lambda Book Report}}</ref> Octavia Butler's ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) tells the story of an African American woman living in the United States in 1979 who uncontrollably time travels to the antebellum South.

In \"Rehabilitating Utopia: Feminist Science Fiction and Finding the Ideal\", an article published in Contemporary Justice Review, philosophers against the dream of utopia argue that \"First is the expectation that utopia justifies violence, second is the expectation that utopia collapses individual desires into one communal norm, and third is the expectation that utopia mandates a robotic focus on problem-solving.\" In feminist science fiction, utopias are often realized through a communal want for an ideal society. One such novel is summarized in the aforementioned article, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s novel [[Herland (novel)|''Herland'']], in which \"Gilman perfectly captures the utopian impulse that all problems are solvable. She establishes a society where every consideration about a question aims for the rational answer.\"<ref name=\"curtis\" /> Gilman's utopia is presented as something attainable and achievable without conflict, neither enabling violence nor extinguishing individualism.\n\nIn the Parable trilogy by feminist science fiction novelist [[Octavia Butler]], anti-utopian philosophies are criticized via a dystopian setting. In the first novel, ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', following the destruction of her home and family, Lauren Olamina, one of many who live in a dystopian, ungoverned society, seeks to form her own utopian religion entitled 'Earthseed'. Olamina's utopian creation does not justify the use of violence as a means, no matter how expedient, to justify the end, achieving utopia, no matter how desirable. Yet we witness that she cannot avoid violence, as it results from little more than promulgating ideas different from those held by the majority of those living within the current social structure, however disorganized and ungoverned that social structure may be. Butler posits that utopian society can never be achieved as an entity entirely separate from the outside world, one of the more commonly held  beliefs about conditions necessary to achieve utopia. Olamina's, and Butler's, utopia is envisioned as a community with a shared vision that is not forced on all within it.<ref name=\"curtis\" />\n\nOne common trend in feminist science fiction utopias is the existence of utopian worlds as [[single-gender world|single-gendered]] \u2013 most commonly female. In literary works female utopias are portrayed as free of conflict, and intentionally free of men. The single gendered utopias of female science fiction are free of the conflicts that feminism aims to eliminate, such as patriarchal oppression and the gender inequality inherent in patriarchal society. In a statement about these single gendered utopias, [[Joanna Russ]], author of ''[[The Female Man]]'' , theorized that male-only societies were not written because in patriarchal society, male oppression is not as pressing an issue as is female oppression.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Romaine|first1=Suzanne|title=Communicating Gender|date=1999|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, N.J.|page=329}}</ref>\n\nUtopia as an ideal to strive for is not a concept wholly limited to feminist science fiction, however many non-feminist science fiction works often dismiss utopia as an unachievable goal, and as such, believe that pursuits for utopia should be considered dangerous and barren. Anti-utopian theory focuses on the 'how' in the transition from present to society to a utopian future. In feminist science fiction, the achievement of a utopian future depends on the ability to recognize the need for improvement and the perseverance to overcome the obstacles present in creating a utopian society.<ref name=\"curtis\" />\n\n===Representation of women===\nPerhaps the most obvious attraction of science fiction to women writers \u2013 feminist or not \u2013 is the possibilities it offers for the creation of a female hero. The demands of realism in the contemporary or historical novel set limits which do not bind the universes available to science fiction. Although the history of science fiction reveals few heroic, realistic, or even original images of women, the genre had a potential recognized by the women writers drawn to it in the 1960s and 1970s. Before this time, the appeal for women writers was not that great. The impact of feminism on the science fiction field can be observed not only in science fiction texts themselves, but also on the development of feminist approaches to science fiction criticism and history, as well as conversations and debates in the science fiction community. One of the main debates is about the representation of women in science fiction.\n\nIn her article \"Redefining Women's Power through Feminist Science Fiction\", Maria DeRose suggests that, \"One of the great early socialists said that the status of women in a society is a pretty reliable index of the degree of civilization of that society. If this is true, then the very low status of women in science fiction should make us ponder about whether science fiction is civilized at all\".<ref name=\"DeRose\">{{cite journal |last= DeRose |first= Maria | title= Redefining Women's Power Through Feminist Science Fiction | journal= [[Extrapolation (journal)|Extrapolation]] | volume=46 | issue= 1 | pages= 66\u201389 | publisher = [[Liverpool University Press]] | doi = 10.3828/extr.2005.46.1.8 | date = Spring 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3828/extr.2005.46.1.8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> The women's movement has made most of us conscious of the fact that Science Fiction has totally ignored women. This \"lack of appreciation\" is the main reason that women are rebelling and actively fighting to be noticed in the field anyway.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Norton | first = Andre | author-link = Andre Norton | title = Feminist Pied Piper in SF | journal = [[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]] | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 66\u201370 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/chq.0.0179 | date = Summer 1985 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/chq.0.0179 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nVirginia Wolf relates to this aspect of feminist science fiction in the article \"Feminist Criticism and Science Fiction for Children\". As she discusses the scarcity of women in the field, she states, \"During the first period, that of the nineteenth century, apparently only two women wrote Science Fiction, [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Rhoda Broughton]],\" and continues, \"In the early twentieth century, a few women were successful Science Fiction writers\". But, \"The times changed. Repression gave way to questioning and outright rebellion, and in the Science Fiction of the 1960s stylistic innovations and new concerns emerged 'Many of their stories, instead of dealing with the traditional hardware of science fiction, concentrated on the effects that different societies or perceptions would have on individual characters'\".<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{Cite journal | last = Wolf | first = Virginia | author-link = Virginia Wolf | title = Feminist Criticism and Science Fiction for Children | journal = [[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 13\u201316 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/chq.0.0272 | date = Winter 1982 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/chq.0.0272 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>  Andre Norton, a semi-well known analyst of Science fiction argues along these lines as well. As Norton explored one or more novels she came across, she realized that the creation of characters and how they are shown is a clear connection to the real world situation. From here, she goes in depth of characters in these feminist novels and relates them to the real world. She concludes here article along these lines. She wanted to get the idea out that feminists have a way to get their voice out there. Now, all their works are famous/ popular enough for their ideas to be let out. Virginia Wolf can attest to this fact. She introduced the idea that women were not represented well in the field till the early 1900s and added to the fact by stating, \"Women are not represented well in Science Fiction\".<ref name=\"Wolf\" />{{rp|16}}\n\nIndividual characters, as we come to know, have their own perception and observation of their surroundings. Characters in novels such as ''[[The Girl Who Was Plugged In]]'' by [[James Tiptree Jr.|James Tiptree]] and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' are fully aware of the situation at hand and their role in society. This idea is a continuation of the argument presented by Andre Norton. Wolf argues the same point in her analysis of [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Le Guin]]'s writing, who has many contributions to the works of feminist Science Fiction. Wolf argues, \"What matters to Le Guin is not what people look like or how they behave but whether or not they have choice and whether or not they receive respect for who they are and what they do rather than on the basis of sex. Feminism is for her not a matter of how many women (or characters in Science Fiction) are housewives but a part of our hope for survival, which she believes lies in the search for balance and integration\".<ref name=\"Wolf\" />{{rp|15}} This stirs up many questions about equality (a debate which has been going on for many years) but nobody seems to have an answer. In this continual search for equality, many characters find themselves asking the same question: \"Is Gender Necessary\" (which is, coincidentally, one of Le Guin's novels and also another problem arising from gender biases). [[Robin Roberts (literary historian)|Robin Roberts]], an American [[literary historian]], addresses the link of these characters and what that means for our society today. Roberts believes that men and women would like to be equal, but are not equal. They should be fighting the same battle when in fact they are fighting each other. She also debates that gender equality has been a problem in every reach of feminism, not just in feminist science fiction. Wolf also tackles this problem, \"As she explains in \"Is Gender Necessary?\", ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' convinced her that if men and women were completely and genuinely equal in their social roles, equal legally and economically, equal in freedom, in responsibility, and in self-esteem, ... our central problem would not be the one it is now: the problem of exploitation\u2014exploitation of the woman, of the weak, of the earth' (p.&nbsp;159)\".<ref name=\"Wolf\" />{{rp|13}} Science fiction criticism has come a long way from its defensive desire to create a canon. All of these authors demonstrate that science fiction criticism tackles the same questions as other literary criticism: race, gender, and the politics of Feminism itself. Wolf believes that evaluating primarily American texts, written over the past one hundred and twenty years, these critics locate science fiction's merits in its speculative possibilities. At the same time, however, all note that the texts they analyze reflect the issues and concerns of the historical period in which the literature was written. DeRose introduces her article with, in effect, the same argument. She says, \"the power of women in Science Fiction has greatly depreciated in the past few years\".<ref name=\"DeRose\" />{{rp|70}}\n\n=== Gender identity ===\nFeminist science fiction offers authors the opportunity to imagine worlds and futures in which women are not bound by the standards, rules, and roles that exist in reality. Rather, the genre creates a space in which the [[gender binary]] might be troubled and different sexualities may be explored.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAs Anna Gilarek explains, issues of gender have been a part of feminist discourse throughout the feminist movement, and the work of authors such as [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Marge Piercy]] explore and expose gender based oppression. Gilarek outlines two approaches to social critique via Feminist SF: the use of fantastical elements such as \"invented worlds, planets, moons, and lands\", used to call attention to the ills of society by exaggerating them, or a more straightforward approach, \"relying on realist techniques to convey the message about the deficiencies of our world and its social organization, in particular the continued inequality of women\".<ref name=\"Helford, p.291\"/> There are many examples of redefined gender roles and gender identity found in Feminist SF, ranging from the inversion of gendered oppression to the amplification of [[Gender role|gender stereotypes]] and tropes. In the short story \"[[The Matter of Seggri]]\", by [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Le Guin]], traditional gender roles are completely swapped. Men are relegated to roles of athletes and prostitutes while women control the means of production and have exclusive access to education. In [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', gendered oppression is exaggerated in a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] society in which women's rights are stripped away and fertile women are relegated to the roles of handmaids who will bear children to further the human race.  New books continue the dystopian theme of women living in a society which conforms to the wishes of men, at the expense of women's rights and well-being, such as in [[Louise O'Neill]]'s young adult novel ''[[Only Ever Yours]]''.  In this work, females are no longer born naturally but are genetically designed before birth to conform to the physical desires of men, then placed in a school in which they are taught not to think (they are never taught to read), and to focus on appearance until they are rated by beauty on a scale at age sixteen, with the top ten becoming the brides of elite men, the middle ten forced into concubinage, and the bottom ten forced to continue their lives as instructors at the school in very humiliating circumstances.  At age forty, the women are euthanized.  In the post-apocalyptic novel, ''[[Gather the Daughters]]'', by [[Jennie Melamed]], females living in an island society are sexually exploited from the time they are girls, are forced to marry at adolescence, and after they become grandmothers must commit suicide.\n\nOver the decades, SF and feminist SF authors have taken different approaches to criticizing gender and gendered society. Helen Merrick outlines the transition from what Joanna Russ describes as the \"Battle of the Sexes\" tradition to a more egalitarian or androgynous approach. Also known as the \"Dominant Woman\" stories, the \"Battle of the Sexes\" stories often present [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] societies in which women have overcome their patriarchal oppressors and have achieved dominance. These stories are representative of an anxiety that perceives women's power as a threat to masculinity and the heterosexual norm. As Merrick explains, \"And whilst they may at least hint at the vision of a more equal gendered social order, this possibility is undermined by figuring female desire for greater equality in terms of a (stereotypical) masculine drive for power and domination.\"  Examples of these types of stories, written in the 1920s and 30s through the 50s, include Francis Steven's \"Friend Island\" and Margaret Rupert's \"Via the Hewitt Ray\"; in 1978, [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] released ''[[The Ruins of Isis]]'', a novel about a futuristic matriarchy on a human colony planet where the men are extremely oppressed.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, feminist SF authors shifted from the \"Battle of the Sexes\" writing more egalitarian stories and stories that sought to make the feminine more visible. Ursula Le Guin's ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' portrayed an androgynous society in which a world without gender could be imagined. In [[James Tiptree, Jr.|James Tiptree Jr.]]'s short story \"[[Houston, Houston, Do You Read?]]\", women are able to be seen in their full humanity due to the absence of men in a post-apocalyptic society.<ref name=\"page 78\"/> Joanna Russ's works, including \"When it Changed\" and ''[[The Female Man]]'' are other examples of exploring [[femininity]] and a \"deconstruction of the acceptable, liberal 'whole' woman towards a multiple, shifting postmodernist sense of female 'selfhood'\".<ref name=\"Borgstrom 2006\"/>\n\n==Comic books and graphic novels==\nFeminist science fiction is evidenced in the globally popular mediums of [[comic books]], [[manga]], and [[graphic novels]]. One of the first appearances of a strong female character was that of the [[superhero]] [[Wonder Woman]], co-created by husband and wife team [[William Moulton Marston]] and [[Elizabeth Holloway Marston]]. In December 1941, Wonder Woman came to life on the pages of ''[[All Star Comics]]'', and in the intervening years has been reincarnated in [[Wonder Woman in other media|from animated TV series to live-action films]], with [[Cultural impact of Wonder Woman|significant cultural impact]]. By the early 1960s, [[Marvel Comics]] already contained some strong female characters, although they often suffered from stereotypical female weakness such as fainting after intense exertion.<ref>{{citation | last = Wright | first = Bradford W. | contribution = Great Power and Great Responsibility: Superheroes in a Superpower, 1956\u20131967 | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Bradford W. | title = Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | page = 219 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | location = Baltimore | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780801865145 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iYL9qTMu1EC&pg=PA219 Preview.]</ref> By the 1970s and 1980s, true female heroes started to emerge on the pages of comics.<ref>Wright, p.221.</ref> This was helped by the emergence of self-identified feminist writers including [[Ann Nocenti]], [[Linda Fite]], and [[Barbara Kesel]]. As female visibility in comics increased, the \"fainting heroine\" type began to fade into the past. However, some female comic book writers, such as [[Gail Simone]], believe that female characters are still relegated to plot devices (see ''[[Women in Refrigerators]]'').\n\nFeminism in science fiction [[sh\u014djo manga]] has been a theme in the works of [[Moto Hagio]] among others, for whom the writings of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] have been a major influence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ebihara |first=Akiko |title=Japan's Feminist Fabulation: Reading ''Marginal'' with Unisex Reproduction as a Keyconcept |journal=Genders |volume=36 |publisher=[[University of Colorado]] |date=2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107125736/http://www.genders.org/g36/g36_ebihara.html |archive-date=2014-11-07 |url=http://www.genders.org/g36/g36_ebihara.html |ref=harv |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Film and television==\n\nFeminism has driven the creation of a considerable body of action-oriented science fiction with female [[protagonist]]s: [[Wonder Woman]]<ref>The original creator of [[Wonder Woman]], [[William Moulton Marston]], a psychologist explicitly stated that he wanted a female hero worthy of being a role model for young women. \"Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power.

In ''fellatio'' the ''-us'' is replaced by the ''-io''; the declension stem ends in ''-ion-'', which gives the suffix the form ''-ion'' (cf. French ''fellation''). The ''-io''(''n'') ending is used in English to create nouns from Latin [[adjective]]s and it can indicate a state or action wherein the Latin verb is being, or has been, performed.\n\nFurther English words have been created based on the same Latin root. A person who performs fellatio upon another may be termed a ''fellator''; because of Latin's [[grammatical gender|gender based declension]], this word may be restricted by some English speakers to describing a male. The equivalent term for a female is ''fellatrix''.\n\n==Practice==\n\n===General===\n[[File:\u00c9douard-Henri Avril (20).jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[\u00c9douard-Henri Avril]] of fellatio scene]]\n[[File:We, two boys together clinging - 05 - Picture by Giovanni Dall'Orto, July 30 2014.jpg|thumb|Two men engaging in fellatio|150px]]\n\nA person who performs fellatio on someone may be referred to as the giving partner, and the other person as the receiving partner. Fellatio can be [[Sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] for participants, and males commonly experience [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]] of [[semen]] during the act.<ref name=\"Carroll\"/><ref name=\"Weiten\"/> People may use fellatio as [[foreplay]] to sexually arouse their [[sex partner]] before [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[Anal sex|anal]] intercourse, or other [[sexual activity]],<ref name=\"Carroll\"/><ref name=\"NHS\"/> or they may use it as an [[Eroticism|erotic]] and [[physical intimacy|physically intimate act]] in its own right.<ref name=\"Carroll\"/><ref name=\"Weiten\"/> Though a person who receives fellatio is male, his sex partner may be of either sex. When the penis is [[Pelvic thrust|thrust]] into someone's mouth, it may be called ''[[irrumatio]]'', though the term is rarely used.<ref name=\"SL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/irrumatio|title=irrumatio in Sex-Lexis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}</ref>\n\nThe essential aspect of fellatio is for a man's sex partner to take his penis into their mouth, and then move their mouth up and down the penis to a rhythm set by them mimicking the thrusting motion of vaginal or anal intercourse, with saliva acting as a lubricant, and being careful not to bite or scratch with the teeth.<ref name=\"Carroll\"/> The man receiving fellatio can slow the rhythm of the stimulation by holding his partner's head. The man's partner may also orally play with his penis by licking, sucking, kissing or otherwise playing with the tongue and lips.<ref name=\"Carroll\"/> Fellatio may also include the oral stimulation of the scrotum, whether licking, sucking or taking the entire scrotum into the mouth.<ref name=\"Kar\"/><ref name=\"Crooks\"/>\n\nIt is difficult for some people to perform fellatio, due to their sensitivities to the natural [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]]. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. [[Deep-throating]] is an act in which a man's partner takes the entire erect penis deep into their mouth, in such a way as to enter their throat.\n\n[[Nancy Friday]]'s book, ''Men in Love \u2013 Men's Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love over Rage,'' suggests that swallowing semen is high on a man's intimacy scale.<ref>''Men in Love - Men's Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love over Rage'' (1982) by [[Nancy Friday]]. {{ISBN|978-0-440-15903-2}}</ref> The man receiving fellatio receives direct sexual stimulation, while his partner may derive satisfaction from giving him pleasure. Giving and receiving fellatio may happen simultaneously in sex positions like [[69 (sex position)|69]] and [[Sex position#Group sex|daisy chain]].\n\nFellatio is sometimes practiced when penile penetration would create a physical difficulty for a sex partner. For example, it may be practiced during pregnancy instead of vaginal intercourse by couples wishing to engage in intimate sexual activity while avoiding the difficulty of vaginal intercourse during later stages of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/400_is-it-safe-to-swallow-semen-during-pregnancy_510175_1000.bc |title=Is it safe to swallow semen during pregnancy? |publisher=BabyCenter |accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref> There may be other reasons why a woman may not wish to have vaginal intercourse, such as apprehension of losing her virginity, of becoming pregnant,<ref name=\"Carpenter\"/><ref name=\"Brady\"/> or she may be [[menstruation|menstruating]].\n\nIt is physically possible for men who have sufficient flexibility, penis size or a combination of the two to perform fellatio by oneself as a form of [[masturbation]]; this is called [[autofellatio]].

This is not necessarily a formal position since most Muslims argue that anyone trained in Islamic law may give an opinion (fatw\u0101) on its teachings. If a fatw\u0101 does not break new ground, then it is simply called a ''ruling''.<ref>MacFarquhar, Neil. \"The media relations department of Hizbollah wishes you to die: Unexpected encounters in the changing Middle East\", PublicAffairs, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-58648-635-8}}</ref>\n\nAn analogy might be made to the issue of [[legal opinion]]s from courts in [[common law|common-law]] systems. Fatw\u0101s generally contain the details of the scholar's reasoning, typically in response to a particular case, and are considered binding precedent by those Muslims who have bound themselves to that scholar, including future muftis; mere rulings can be compared to [[memorandum opinion]]s. The primary difference between common-law opinions and fatw\u0101s, however, is that fatw\u0101s are not universally binding; as [[Sharia]] is not universally consistent and Islam is very non-hierarchical in structure, fatw\u0101s do not carry the sort of weight as that of secular common-law opinion.\n\n==Practice==\n\nIn a religious context, the word fatw\u0101 can carry more meaning. Oftentimes, when a Muslim has a question that they need to be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question. The answer is commonly known as a fatw\u0101, which typically carries more weight than the opinion of a lay Muslim. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatw\u0101 based on religious scripture as opposed to personal belief. Therefore, their fatw\u0101 is sometimes regarded as a religious ruling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/understanding-islam/legal-rulings/44-what-is-a-fatwa.html|title=What is a Fatwa?|last=Administrator|website=www.islamicsupremecouncil.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref> An example of a fatw\u0101 may be the following: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A practicing Muslim who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not feel that they are able to perform their prayers on time; therefore, they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatw\u0101 on what is the appropriate thing to do. The scholar would provide a response and support it with Muslim scripture. The fatw\u0101 is not legally binding or final; it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual is not content with the fatw\u0101 given, they can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.\n\nIn Islam, there are four sources from which Muslim scholars extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatw\u0101. The first is the [[Quran]], which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims believe is the direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the [[Sunnah]], which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, did or approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a specific question from the three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs what is known as [[ijtihad]]. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning to come up with the best answer according to the best of their ability.\nMuslims believe that any given action that they perform in their lives falls into one of five categories:\n# [[Fard|\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0628 / \u0641\u0631\u0636 (far\u1e0d/w\u0101jib)]] \u2013 \"Compulsory\"/\"duty\"\n# [[mustahabb|\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0628 (musta\u1e25abb)]] \u2013 Recommended, \"desirable\"\n# [[mubah|\u0645\u0628\u0627\u062d (mub\u0101\u1e25)]] \u2013 Neutral, \"permissible\"\n# [[makruh|\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0648\u0647 (makr\u016bh)]] \u2013 Disliked, \"hated\"\n# \u062d\u0631\u0627\u0645 (\u1e25ar\u0101m) \u2013 Sinful, \"prohibited\"\nAll actions fall into the \"permissible\" category, unless there is evidence from one of the four sources previously mentioned (Quran, Sunnah, Consensus, Ijtihad) that proves otherwise. Here are some examples:\n\n* The five daily prayers are obligatory upon Muslims. Those who do not perform them are committing a sin, and they will be accountable for that on the day of judgment.\n* Performing additional voluntary prayers is commendable. Those who perform them will be rewarded, but those who do not are not committing a sin.\n* Driving an electric car is permissible, meaning that the action of driving is not good or bad in itself. There is no sin or reward attached to it. Most things fall under this category.\n* Divorce is a despised action. Although there is no sin associated with it, it must only be considered as a last resort when all other means of solving the problems between the spouses have been exhausted.\n* Drinking alcoholic drinks is not permitted. Those who do so are committing a sin, and will be held accountable for it on the day of judgment.\nWhen someone asks a Muslim scholar about performing a specific action, the reply will be a fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they would tell you that it is \"Not Permitted\". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is \"Obligatory\". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always feel that they are practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.  \nDifferent scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This is why there is usually more than one fatwa regarding any one question. In fact, there are a number of methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the same question. It is well known that in Islam there are four [[schools of thought]], and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, these differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the [[Day of Judgment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.questionsaboutislam.com/shariah-islamic-law/what-is-a-fatwa.php|title=What is a fatwa? What does fatwa mean?|first=|last=QuestionsAboutIslam.Com|date=|work=questionsaboutislam.com|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the early days of [[Islam]], fatw\u0101s were pronounced by distinguished scholars to provide guidance to other scholars, judges and citizens on how subtle points of Islamic law should be understood, interpreted or applied. There were strict rules on who was eligible to issue a valid fatw\u0101 and who could not, as well as on the conditions the fatw\u0101 must satisfy to be valid.\n\nAccording to the ''[[usul al-fiqh]]'' (principles of jurisprudence), the fatw\u0101 must meet the following conditions in order to be valid:\n# The fatw\u0101 is in line with relevant legal proofs, deduced from Qur'anic verses and a hadith; provided the hadith was not later abrogated by [[Muhammad]].\n# It is issued by a person (or a board) having due knowledge and sincerity of heart;\n# It is free from individual opportunism, and not depending on political servitude;\n# It is adequate with the needs of the contemporary world.\n\nWith the existence of modern independent states, each with its own legislative system, or its own body of [[ulama]]s, each country develops and applies its own rules, based on its own interpretation of religious prescriptions. Many [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] (such as [[Egypt]] and [[Tunisia]]) have an official [[mufti]] position; a distinguished expert in the [[sharia]] is appointed to this position by the civil authorities of the country. But his fatw\u0101s are binding on no one: neither the state that appoints him, nor any citizen.\n\n===Online fatwa===\nFatwas have been transmitted by publication, \"in collections of individual muftis, in annual fatwa collections, ... or in special religious columns of periodicals and newspapers\".<ref name=\"Marcotte-31\">{{cite book|last1=Marcotte|first1=Roxanne D.|editor1-last=Coleman|editor1-first=Elizabeth Burns|editor2-last=White|editor2-first=Kevin|title=Medicine, Religion, and the Body|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|pages=31\u20132|accessdate=4 November 2015|chapter=2.

According to at least one source ([[Sadakat Kadri]]), these sources reintroduced the advice of trained scholars to many Muslims who had turned to do-it-yourself religious interpretation, but also changed the nature of fatwa advice giving, which had traditionally been local and so \"relatively confidential and conditioned by customs familiar to both parties\".<ref name=\"kadri-208\"/> Scholars from Cairo and Saudi Arabia exported their views to mostly (over 80%) non-Arab Muslim world. Muslims are able to observe differences in opinions among scholars of different fatwa sites and to \"contemplate previously unimagined dilemmas and temptations\".<ref name=\"kadri-208\">{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&f=false|}}</ref>\n\n==Issuer qualifications==\n{{see also|Ijazah|Madrasah}}\n\nDuring what is often referred to as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], in order for a scholar to be qualified to issue a fatw\u0101, it was required that he obtained an ''[[Ijazah|ijazat attadris wa'l-ifta]]'' (\"license to teach and issue legal opinions\") from a [[Madrasah]] in the medieval Islamic [[legal education]] system, which was developed by the 9th century during the formation of the ''[[Madh'hab]]'' legal schools.<ref name=Makdisi>{{Cite journal|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April\u2013June 1989|pages=175\u2013182 [175\u201377]|doi=10.2307/604423|jstor=604423}}</ref> Traditionally, the primary issuers of fatwas were [[Muftis]], who were scholars in [[Islam]]. Their job was to interpret [[Shari'a]] and they did so within their own communities. Their authority in law and their ability to issue fatwas was entirely based on their reputation and social standing.\n\nIn post-colonial Middle Eastern states, the issuing of Fatwas moved away from the [[Ancien Regime]] practice of coming from a [[Mufti]] and instead became much more centralized as governments did so. The state department gained the control over appointing [[Muftis]] and the fatwas they were allowed to issue to the public. This did cause some discourse among the public, because of the governments involvement in religious matters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cleveland |first=William L. |authorlink= |title=A History of the Modern Middle East |year=2013 |publisher=Westview Press |page=102}}</ref>\n\n==National level==\nIn nations where [[sharia|Islamic law]] is the basis of civil law, but has not been codified, as is the case of some Arab countries in the [[Middle East]], fat\u0101w\u0101 by the national religious leadership are debated prior to being issued. In theory, such fat\u0101w\u0101 should rarely be contradictory. If two fat\u0101w\u0101 are potentially contradictory, the ruling bodies (combined civil and religious law) would attempt to define a compromise interpretation that will eliminate the resulting ambiguity. In these cases, the national theocracies expect fatw\u0101 to be settled law.\n\nIn the majority of Arab countries, however, Islamic law has been codified in each country according to its own rules, and is interpreted by the judicial system according to the national jurisprudence. Fat\u0101w\u0101 have no direct place in the system, except to clarify very unusual or subtle points of law for experts (not covered by the provisions of modern civil law), or to give [[moral authority]] to a given interpretation of a rule.\n \nIn nations where Islamic law is not the basis of law (as is the case in various Asian and African countries), different [[mujtahid]]s can issue contradictory fat\u0101w\u0101. In such cases, Muslims would typically honour the fatw\u0101 deriving from the leadership of their religious tradition. For example, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims would favor a Sunni fatw\u0101 whereas [[Shi'a Islam|Shiites]] would follow a Shi'a one.\n\nThere exists no international Islamic authority to settle [[fiqh]] issues today, in a legislative sense. The closest such organism is the [[International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah|Islamic Fiqh Academy]], (a member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC)), which has 57 member states. But it can only render fatw\u0101 that are not binding on anyone.\n\n==Legal implications==\nThere is a binding rule that saves the fatw\u0101 pronouncements from creating judicial havoc, whether within a Muslim country or at the level of the Islamic world in general: it is unanimously agreed that a fatw\u0101 is only binding on its author. This was underlined by Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Al-Obeikan, vice-minister of Justice of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with the Arabic daily [[Asharq Al-Awsat]], as recently as on July 9, 2006, in a discussion of the legal value of a fatw\u0101 by the Islamic Fiqh Academy (IFA) on the subject of [[misyar marriage]], which had been rendered by IFA on April 12, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Huda al Saleh |url=http://www.asharqalawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&id=5572 |title=Loading |publisher=Asharqalawsat.com |date=2009-02-15 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205150644/http://www.asharqalawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&id=5572 |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}</ref> He said, \"Even the decisions of the official Ifta authority [the official Saudi fatw\u0101 institute] is binding on no one, whether for the people or the state.\" Al-Obeikan, however, was subsequently removed from his position as advisor to the royal cabinet in May 2012 after opposing moves to relax gender segregation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18042467|title=Saudi King Abdullah sacks conservative adviser|author=|date=11 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and in August 2012, Obeikan\u2019s morning radio show \"Fatwas on Air\", in which he would issue daily fatwas, was canceled after a royal decree that authorizes only members of the [[Council of Senior Scholars (Saudi Arabia)|Council of Senior Scholars]] to issue fatw\u0101s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sandels|first=Alexandra|title=SAUDI ARABIA: Cleric who urged grown men to drink breast milk of unrelated women taken off air|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/08/saudi-arabia-breastmilk-fatwa-cleric-taken-off-air.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nStill, sometimes, even leading religious authorities and theologians misleadingly present their fatw\u0101 as obligatory,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503546692 |title=Boycotting Products of the US & Its Allies: Obligatory? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |publisher=IslamonLine.net |date=2003-03-22 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717082127/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&cid=1119503546692 |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}</ref> or try to adopt some \"in-between\" position.\n\nThus, the [[Sheikh]] of [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar]] in [[Cairo]], [[Muhammad Sayid Tantawy]], who is the leading religious authority in the Sunni Muslim establishment in [[Egypt]], alongside the [[Grand Mufti]] of Egypt, said the following about fatw\u0101s issued by ''himself'' or the entire Dar al-Ifta:\n\n\"Fatw\u0101 issued by [[Al-Azhar]] are not binding, but they are not just whistling in the wind either; individuals are free to accept them, but Islam recognizes that extenuating circumstances may prevent it.

Even then, however, the issue would not necessarily be religiously binding for the residents of that nation. For, the state may have the power to put a fatw\u0101 in effect, but that does not mean that the fatw\u0101 is to be religiously accepted by all. For instance, if a state fatw\u0101 council made abortion acceptable in the first trimester without any medical reason, that would have direct impact on official procedures in hospitals and courts in that country.

Each riyal, dirham&nbsp;... etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.\n\nAmerican goods, exactly like the great Israeli goods, are forbidden. It is also forbidden to advertise these goods, even though in many cases they prove to be superior. America today is a second Israel. It totally supports the Zionist entity. The usurper could not do this without the support of America. \"Israel's\" unjustified destruction and vandalism of everything has been using American money, American weapons, and the American veto. America has done this for decades without suffering the consequences of any punishment or protests about their oppressive and prejudiced position from the Islamic world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503543874 |title=Boycotting Israeli and American Goods - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |publisher=IslamonLine.net |date=2004-04-18 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717080127/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&cid=1119503543874 |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503545220&pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaEAskTheScholar |title=Ulama\u2019s Fatwa on Boycotting Israeli and American Products - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |publisher=IslamonLine.net |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717082116/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503545220&pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaEAskTheScholar |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSheik Sadeq Abdallah bin Al-Majed, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in [[Sudan]], issued a fatw\u0101 that prohibits vaccination of children claiming it is a conspiracy of the [[Jews]] and [[Freemasons]].<ref>{{cite web|author=http://memritv.org |url=http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1522.htm |title=Clip |publisher=Memritv.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1522.htm |title=Clip Transcript |publisher=Memritv.org |date=2007-07-28 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>\n\nIndian Muslim scholars issued a fatw\u0101 of death against [[Taslima Nasreen]], an exiled controversial Bangladeshi writer.

This fatwa has the potential to endanger the lives of ordinary citizens and members of the media due to the connotation of its language and overall ambiguity.

Horn described the original version of \"Relax\" as \"More a jingle than a song\", but he preferred to work with songs that were not professionally finished because he could then \"fix them up\" in his own style.<ref>Reynolds, p. 377</ref> Once the band was signed, ZTT co-founder [[Paul Morley]] mapped out the marketing campaign fashioned as a \"strategic assault on pop\". Morley opted to tackle the biggest possible themes in the band's singles (\"sex, war, religion\"), of which \"Relax\" would be the first, and emphasized the shock impact of Frankie members Holly Johnson's and [[Paul Rutherford (singer)|Paul Rutherford]]'s open [[homosexuality]] in the packaging and music videos.<ref name=\"reynolds379\">Reynolds, p. 379</ref>\n\nHorn dominated the recording of \"Relax\" in his effort for perfectionism. The band were overawed and intimidated by Horn's reputation, and thus were too nervous to make suggestions. Johnson said in his autobiography, \"Whatever he said we went along with\".<ref name=\"reynolds379\" /> When attempts to record with the full band proved unsatisfactory, Horn hired former [[Ian Dury]] backing band [[the Blockheads]] for the sessions, with [[Norman Watt-Roy]] providing the original bass line. Those sessions were later deemed to be not modern sounding enough. Horn then constructed a more electronic-based version of the song with keyboards by session musician [[Andy Richards]] and with rhythm programming assistance from [[J. J. Jeczalik]] of [[Art of Noise]]. Horn developed this version of the recording in his west [[London]] studio while the band remained in their hometown of [[Liverpool]]. Horn had made 3 versions of \"Relax\" prior to Richards and guitarist [[Stephen Lipson]] joining his [[ZTT Records|ZTT Production]] 'Theam' in late 1983. Horn left the studio late one night asking for Lipson to erase the multitrack (of version 3) due to lack of progress, but came back into the studio some time later to hear Richards playing a variety of modal chords based around the key of E minor with Lipson playing guitar along to the unerased multitrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr08/articles/classictracks_0408.htm|title=Classic Tracks: Frankie Goes To Hollywood \u2013 'Relax'|publisher=Sound on Sound|date=April 2008|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=110|title=Zang Tuum Tumb and all that - Articles - The making of relax|first=|last=zttaat.com|website=www.zttaat.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}</ref> Ultimately lead vocalist Johnson was the only band member to perform on the record; the only contribution by the other members was a sample crafted from the sound of the rest of the band jumping into a swimming pool. Horn explained years later, \"I was just . . . Look, 'Relax' ''had'' to be a hit.\" Despite the band's absence from the record, Horn said, \"I could never have done these records in isolation. There was no actual playing by the band, but the whole ''feeling'' came from the band.\" Horn completed the recording having spent \u00a370,000 in studio time.<ref>Reynolds, p. 380</ref>\n\n==Release, controversy and ban by the BBC==\nMorley intentionally courted scandal with the promotion of \"Relax\". ZTT initiated the ad campaign for \"Relax\" with two quarter-page ads in the British music press. The first ad featured images of Rutherford in a sailor cap and a leather vest, and Johnson with a shaved head and rubber gloves. The images were accompanied by the phrase \"ALL THE NICE BOYS LOVE SEA MEN\" and declared \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood are coming&nbsp;... making [[Duran Duran]] lick the shit off their shoes&nbsp;... Nineteen inches that must be taken always.\" The second ad promised \"theories of bliss, a history of Liverpool from 1963 to 1983, a guide to Amsterdam bars\".<ref>Reynolds, p. 381</ref>\n\nWhen first released in November 1983, the initial progress of \"Relax\" on the [[UK Top 75]] was sluggish. First charting at number 67, by its seventh week on the chart it had progressed only to number 35, even falling back slightly during that time. But then on Thursday 5 January 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood performed \"Relax\" on the BBC flagship television chart show, ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The following week it soared to number 6. On 11 January 1984, [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] [[disc jockey]] [[Mike Read]] expressed on air his distaste for both the record's suggestive sleeve (designed by [[Anne Yvonne Gilbert]]) and its lyrics, which centred on the oft-repeated \"Relax, don't do it/When you want to suck to it/Relax, don't do it/ When you want to come.\"<ref>{{cite book \n|title= The People's Songs: The Story of Modern Britain in 50 Records \n|author = Stuart Maconie \n|year = 2013 \n|ISBN = 140903318X \n|page = 263}}</ref> He announced his refusal to play the record, not knowing that the BBC had just decided that the song was not to be played on the BBC anyway.\n\nIn support of their disc jockey, BBC Radio banned the single from its shows a reported two days later (although certain prominent night-time BBC shows&nbsp;\u2014 including those of [[David Jensen|Kid Jensen]] and [[John Peel]]&nbsp;\u2014 continued to play the record, as they saw fit, throughout 1984).<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/959284.stm|title='Banned' Frankie tops chart|date=6 October 2000 | work=BBC News | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> The now-banned \"Relax\" rose to number 2 in the charts by 17 January, and hit the number-one spot on 24 January. By this time, the BBC Radio ban had extended to ''Top of the Pops'' as well, which displayed a still picture of the group during its climactic Number One announcement, before airing a performance by a non-Number One artist.\n\nThis went on for the five weeks that \"Relax\" was at number one. It then began a slow decline on the charts, falling back as far as number 31 in May 1984 before returning to number two in July whilst Frankie's follow-up single \"[[Two Tribes]]\" held the UK number-one spot. In the end, \"Relax\" remained on the Top 75 for 48 consecutive weeks and returned in February 1985 for four more, giving a total of 52.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chartstats.com/release.php?release%3D10950 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824220320/http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=10950 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 August 2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe ban became an embarrassment for the BBC, especially given that UK commercial radio and television stations were still playing the song. Later in 1984 the ban was lifted and \"Relax\" featured on both the [[Christmas Day]] edition of ''Top of the Pops'' and Radio 1's rundown of the best-selling singles of the year.\n\nThroughout the \"Relax\" controversy, the band continued to publicly deny that the song's lyrics were sexual. Nevertheless, by 1984, it was clear that the public were aware of the sexual nature of the lyrics, but the scandal had fuelled sales anyway. In 1985, with the release of the ''[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]'' album (which included \"Relax\"), the band dropped any public pretense about the lyrics: \n{{Quote|Everything I say is complete lies. Like, when people ask you what 'Relax' was about, when it first came out we used to pretend it was about motivation, and really it was about [[Shag (British Slang)|shagging]].|Mark O'Toole|''Welcome to the Pleasuredome'' album liner notes}}\n\nThe track was reissued in September 1993, the first of a string of Frankie Goes to Hollywood singles to be reissued that year. It debuted at a high number six on the UK singles chart and peaked at number five the next week. It spent seven weeks on the Top 75 this time, thus extending its combined total to 59, making it the [[List of songs which have spent the most weeks on the UK Singles Chart|third longest runner of all time]] (seven other singles have since surpassed it; now it is in joint 10th place).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chartstats.com/release.php?release%3D21011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824220448/http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=21011 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 August 2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Original 1983\u20131984 mixes==\n[[File:Relax Last Seven Inches.jpg|thumb|right|width 200px|Relax \"The Last Seven Inches\"]]Although the [[single (music)|7-inch]] version of the single remained unchanged throughout its initial release (a mix generally known as \"Relax (Move)\"), promotional 7-inch records featuring a substantially different mix of \"Relax\" (entitled either \"The Last Seven Inches\" or \"Warp Mix\" because it is a compilation of other versions) were the subject of a limited 1984 release.\n\n{{Listen|filename=Relax (The Last Seven Inches) - ZTAS1DJ.ogg\n|title=Relax (The Last Seven Inches) excerpt|description=An excerpt from ''Relax (The Last Seven Inches)''}}\n\nThree principal [[12 inch|12-inch remixes]] of \"Relax\" were eventually created by producer [[Trevor Horn]]:\n\n<blockquote>One of the reasons we did all the remixes was that the initial 12-inch version of 'Relax' contained something called 'The Sex Mix', which was 16 minutes long and didn't even contain a song. It was really [[Holly Johnson]] just jamming, as well as a bunch of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of the group jumping in the swimming pool and me sort of making disgusting noises by dropping stuff into buckets of water! We got so many complaints about it&nbsp;\u2014 particularly from gay clubs, who found it offensive&nbsp;\u2014 that we cut it in half and reduced it down to eight minutes, by taking out some of the slightly more offensive parts [this became the \"New York Mix\"]. Then we got another load of complaints, because the single version wasn't on the 12-inch&nbsp;\u2014 I didn't see the point in this at the time, but I was eventually put straight about it.<ref name=\"Sound On Sound, August 1994\">{{cite news|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/aug94/trevorhorn.html|publisher=Sound On Sound\n|title=From ABC to ZTT|date=August 1994}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHorn attested that visits to [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Paradise Garage]] club led to the creation of the final \"Relax (U.S. Mix)\", which ultimately replaced the original \"Sex Mix\"/\"New York Mix\" releases:\n\n<blockquote>It was only when I went to this club and heard the sort of things they were playing that I really understood about 12-inch remixes. Although I myself had already had a couple of big 12-inch hits, I'd never heard them being played on a big sound system, and so I then went back and mixed 'Relax' again and that was the version which sold a couple of million over here [in the UK].<ref name=\"Sound On Sound, August 1994\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Relax Picture disk.jpg|thumb|right|Relax picture 12\" disk]]The original 12-inch version of \"Relax\", labelled \"Sex Mix\", ran for over 16 minutes, and is broadly as described by Horn above. The subsequent \"New York Mix\" was an 8-minute-plus edit of the \"Sex Mix\", and can only be distinguished by having ''12ISZTAS1'' etched on the vinyl. The final 12-inch mix, containing no elements from the foregoing versions, was designated the \"U.S. Mix\", and ran for approximately 7:20. This was the most commonly available 12-inch version of \"Relax\" during its worldwide 1984 chart success.\n\nThe UK [[cassette single]] featured as the title track a unique amalgam of excerpts from the \"Sex Mix\", \"U.S. Mix\", \"Move\" and an instrumental version of \"Move\".\n\nSince virtually all of the UK \"Relax\" 12-inch singles were labelled \"Sex Mix\", a method of differentiating between versions by reference to the record's [[matrix numbers]] necessarily became ''de rigueur'' for collectors of Frankie Goes to Hollywood releases (and ultimately collectors of ZTT records in general).\n\n\"Relax (Come Fighting)\" was the version of the song included on the ''Welcome to the Pleasuredome'' album. This is ostensibly a variant of the 7-inch single \"Move\" mix, but readily distinguishable from it in many ways. For example, the \"Move\" mix fades in on a foghorn type sound while the album mix fades in on sustained synth chords. Also, the backing vocals of the \"Move\" mix are panned to the left, whereas they are mixed in the centre on the album version. Additionally, the \"Move\" mix features a prominent reverberated kick drum sound during the introduction that also appears in other parts of the song, which is completely absent from the album mix. The album mix also has a certain post-production sheen (greater stereo separation of parts, more strategic uses of reverb, etc.) that is absent from the original 1983 7-inch single mix. The later \"1993 Classic Mix\" reissue is almost identical to the \"Come Fighting\" album version.\n\nThe original airing of Relax on [[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]], before the band were signed to ZTT, featured another verse that was edited from all the released versions, \"In heaven everything is fine, you've got yours and I've got mine\", presumably removed as it was taken directly from the David Lynch film ''[[Eraserhead]]''.\n\n==B-sides==\nThe 7-inch featured \"One September Monday\", an interview between ZTT's [[Paul Morley]], Holly Johnson and [[Paul Rutherford (singer)|Paul Rutherford]]. During the interview, Holly revealed that the group's name derived from a page of the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine, headlined \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\" and featuring [[Frank Sinatra]] \"getting mobbed by [[teenybopper]]s\".\n\nOn all of the original 12-inch releases, the B-side featured a cover of \"[[Ferry Cross the Mersey|Ferry 'Cross the Mersey]]\", followed by a brief dialogue involving Rutherford attempting to [[unemployment benefit|sign on]], and an a cappella version of the title track's chorus, [[segue]]ing into an instrumental version of \"Relax\", known as \"From Soft to Hard\". \"From Soft to Hard\" has the same structure as the 7-inch \"Move\" mix, but is not simply an instrumental of this mix.\n\nThe UK cassette single included \"Ferry 'Cross the Mersey\" and interview sections not included on \"One September Monday\".\n\n==Videos==\nThe first official video for \"Relax\", directed by [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]] and set in a [[BDSM|S&M]] themed [[Gay bar|gay nightclub]], featuring  the bandmembers accosted by buff [[leather subculture|leathermen]], a glamorous [[drag queen]], and an [[obesity|obese]] admirer dressed up as a [[Roman emperor]], was allegedly banned by [[MTV]] and the [[BBC]], prompting the recording of a second video, directed by [[Godley and Creme]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=11021 |title=Frankie Goes to Hollywood - \"Relax [version 3: lasers&#93;\" |publisher=mvdbase.com |date=1984-10-29 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}</ref> in early 1984, featuring the group performing with the help of laser beams.

Presenting a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], gleeful lyric expressing enthusiasm for [[nuclear war]], it juxtaposes a relentless pounding bass line and guitar riff inspired by American funk and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] pop with influences of Russian classical music, in an opulent arrangement produced by [[Trevor Horn]].\n\nSupported by a striking advertising campaign depicting the band as members of the [[Red Army]] and a wide range of [[remix]]es, the single was a phenomenal success in the UK, immediately entering at the number one position on 10 June 1984<ref name=\"www.number-ones.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://www.number-ones.co.uk/Frankie-Goes-To-Hollywood-number-ones/Two-Tribes.html|publisher=www.number-ones.co.uk\n|title=Number-Ones.co.uk|date=2014}}</ref> and staying at the [[List of Number 1 singles (UK)#1984|top of the UK Singles Chart]] for nine consecutive weeks,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| pages= 437\u20139}}</ref> during which time the group's previous single \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\" climbed back up the charts to number two.

The session version makes clear that the basic structure of the song, including its signature bass-line, percussion arrangement and idiosyncratic introductory and middle eight sections, were already intact prior to any involvement from ZTT or eventual producer [[Trevor Horn]].\n\n{{Listen|filename=Two Tribes Peel Sessions 1982.ogg\n|title=Two Tribes (Peel Sessions 1982) excerpt|description=An excerpt from ''Two Tribes (Peel Sessions 1982)''}}\n\nJohnson also noted: \"There's {{sic}} two elements in the music \u2014 an American funk line and a Russian line. It's the most obvious demonstration of two tribes that we have today.\"<ref name=\"Smash Hits, 26 April 1984\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=55|publisher=Smash Hits\n|title=The War Game|date=26 April 1984}}</ref>  To accentuate the musical tension, Horn arranged the 'Russian' segments as a dramatic string arrangement. The driving funk/rock rhythm section was played on synthesisers.\n\n==Title and lyrics==\nThe single was released at a time when the [[Cold War]] had [[Cold War (1979\u201385)|intensified]] and fears about global [[nuclear warfare]] were at a peak. Although Johnson would attest in a 1984 radio interview that the \"two tribes\" of the song potentially represented any pair of warring adversaries (giving the examples of \"[[cowboy]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] or [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Klingon]]s\"), the line \"On the air America/I modelled shirts by Van Heusen\" is a clear reference to then [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].  Reagan had advertised for [[Phillips Van Heusen]] in 1953 (briefly reviving the association in the early 1980s).  The title of his first film had been ''[[Love Is On the Air|Love Is On The Air]]''.\n\nThe lyric \"working for the black gas\" is, according to Johnson, \"About oil surpassing gold. How you might as well be paid in petrol.\"<ref>No 1 magazine, 4 August 1984 http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=181</ref> And the line \"Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?\" was inspired by the 1959 British film ''[[Cover Girl Killer]]''. Johnson explained, \"The TV was on in the background while I was doing me ironing and suddenly this character came out with that statement.\"<ref>No 1 magazine, 4 August 1984 http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=181</ref> (The actual dialogue, which occurs at about 48 minutes 24 seconds into the film, is \"Surely sex and horror are the new gods in this polluted world of so-called entertainment?\")\n\nThe track featured snippets of narration from actor [[Patrick Allen]], recreating his narration from the British ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' [[public information film]]s about how to survive a nuclear war. (The original ''Protect and Survive'' soundtracks were [[sampling (music)|sampled]] for the 7-inch mixes.)\n\nThe 12-inch A- and B-sides featured voice parts by British actor [[Chris Barrie]] imitating Ronald Reagan.  Barrie also voiced the Reagan puppet on ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Barrie's parts as 'Reagan' included praise for the band, as well as parts of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s speech to a court after the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]: \"You may pronounce us guilty a thousand times over, but the Goddess of the Eternal Court of History will smile and tear to tatters the brief of the State Prosecutor and the sentence of this court, for She acquits us.\" Barrie also voices the last sentence of [[History Will Absolve Me]] (Spanish:\"La historia me absolver\u00e1\") which is the concluding sentence and subsequent title of a four-hour speech made by Fidel Castro on 16 October 1953. Castro made the speech in his own defense in court against the charges brought against him after leading an attack on the Moncada Barracks on 26 July 1953.  Barrie would return for the band's next single, \"[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)|The Power of Love]]\", imitating [[Mike Read]] in a parody of the DJ's ban on their previous single, \"Relax\".\n\nThe song's title derives from the line \"when two great warrior tribes go to war\", from the film ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (the line is also spoken by [[Holly Johnson]] at the beginning of the session version).\n\n==Promotion==\nZTT aggressively marketed the single in terms of its topical political angle, promoting it with images of the group wearing American military garb in combat, as well as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style army uniforms set against an American urban backdrop.\n\nThe original cover art featured a Soviet mural of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in St Petersburg, and images of Reagan and then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The sleeve notes, attributed to ZTT's [[Paul Morley]], dispassionately reported details of the relative nuclear arsenals of each [[superpower]].\n\n==Original 1984 mixes==\nThe song appeared in the form of six [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixes]], including \u201cDecimation\u201d \"Annihilation\", \"Carnage\", \"Hibakusha\", \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"We Don't Want to Die\", and \"For The Victims Of Ravishment\".\n\nThe first 12-inch mix (\"Annihilation\") started with an [[Civil defense siren|air-raid siren]], and included advice from Allen about how to tag and dispose of family members should they die in the fallout shelter (taken from the [[public information film]] ''Casualties'').  This version appeared on CD editions of the album.  \"Annihilation\" was the basis for the \"[[Hibakusha]]\" mix, which was originally released in a limited edition, and appears on the Japanese-only 1985 album ''[[Bang! (1985 Frankie Goes to Hollywood album)|Bang!]]''.\n\n\"For The Victims Of Ravishment\" appeared on the LP and cassette editions of the album ''Welcome To The Pleasuredome''. It is the shortest version, at 3:27 minutes.  This mix derived from the \"Carnage\" mix, which prominently featured strings as well as vocal samples from Allen and the group's B-side interview.\n\nSince 1984, \"Two Tribes\" has been re-issued several times, generally involving third-party remixes bearing little relation to the original releases in terms of either structure or character.\n\n==B-sides==\nThe 7-inch featured \"One February Friday\", an interview between Morley and the group's three musicians, [[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]], [[Brian Nash]] and [[Peter Gill (FGTH drummer)|Peter Gill]], over an otherwise untitled instrumental track.  A similar track had been included on the B-side of \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\", with the title \"One September Monday\".\n\nThe principal B-side to the original 12-inch single was a cover version of \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\", which became the subject of an extended remix (subtitled \"Hidden\") on the single's third UK 12-inch release, where it was promoted as a [[Double A-side|double-A-side]] with \"Carnage\".\n\nThe UK [[cassette single]] featured a cut-together combination of \"Surrender\", \"Carnage\" and \"Annihilation\", plus Reagan snippets and interview sections not included on any other release.\n\n==Videos==\nThe [[Godley & Creme]]-directed video depicted a wrestling match between then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] and then-Soviet leader [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in front of group members and an assembly of representatives from the world's nations.  The match eventually degenerates into global destruction. Certain violent moments (\"Reagan\" is seen, for example, biting \"Chernenko's\" ear) were edited from the version shown on [[MTV]].\n\nA longer version of the video (based on the \"Hibakusha\" mix) included an introductory, heavily [[Film editing|edited]] monologue by [[Richard Nixon]] taken from an ad from his 1960 US Presidential campaign (\"No.. firm diplomacy... No.. peace for America and the world\"), plus similar contributions from other world leaders, including [[Lord Beaverbrook]], [[Yasser Arafat]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. The complete soundtrack to the extended video was eventually released as \"Two Tribes (Video Destructo)\" on the German version of the ''[[Twelve Inches]]'' compilation. A third version of the video, included on the band's compilation of videos, retains the introduction, but omits most of the inserted clips in the main wrestling sequence.\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (1984)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia<ref>{{cite web|title=Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 Top 100 Singles 1984|website=Australian-charts.com.

The lyrics of the song were inspired by the poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\nIn March 1985, the album track was substantially abridged and remixed for release as the group's fourth UK single.\n\nWhile criticized at the time of release and afterward for being a song that glorifies debauchery, the lyrics (and video) make clear that the point of the song, just as Coleridge's poem, is about the ''dangers'' of this kind of lifestyle. This song, along with \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\", made Frankie Goes to Hollywood even more controversial than they already were.\n\n==Original 1985 single==\nDespite the group's record label ([[ZTT Records|ZTT]]) pre-emptively promoting the single as \"their fourth number one\", an achievement that would have set a new UK record for consecutive number one singles by a debuting artist, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" peaked at number two in the UK singles chart, being kept off the top spot by the [[Phil Collins]]/[[Philip Bailey]] duet \"[[Easy Lover]]\". The single spent a total of eleven weeks on the UK chart.\n\nIt was the first release by the group not to reach number one and, despite representing a creditable success in its own right, it symbolically confirmed the end of the chart invincibility that the group had enjoyed during 1984. Frankie Goes to Hollywood would not release another record for seventeen months, and they would ultimately fail to emulate their past glories upon their return.\n\nThe spoken-word introductions to both [[12-inch single|12-inch]] mixes are adapted from [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]'s 1967 translation of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. The recitation on the first 12-inch (\"Real Altered\") is by Gary Taylor, whilst that on the second 12-inch (\"Fruitness\") and the cassette is by actor [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]]. It is unknown whether Palmer's concluding \"Welcome To The Pleasured''r''ome\" was a genuine mistake or a deliberately scripted one.\n\nThis is the only single from the group that was not released on a CD single at that time. \"Relax\", \"[[Two Tribes]]\" and \"The Power of Love\" all saw a CD-maxi release in Germany at the end of the '80s.  \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" was not given such a release. However, the 7\" vinyl single was released in two different mixes, and it was purely random as to which one you ended up with, as both mixes were in identical sleeve designs and carried the same catalogue number. Not only that, but the subtitle used to identify different mixes was identical on both record labels, with only the matrix number on the run out groove giving the game away. The first 7\" (matrix 7 A 1 U) carried the normal 7\" single mix, which was guitar driven. However, the \"secret\" alternative mix (matrix 7 A 7 U or 7 A 8 U) was quite different, and featured on the Apple shaped Picture Disc. The subtitle for that disc was 'alternative reel' but on the 7\" single the subtitle remained unchanged as 'altered real'. \nIn fact, although appearing to be identical sleeves, the two mixes were actually released in slightly different ones. The standard 7\" mix came in a thick paper sleeve, whereas the \"secret\" one came in a thin paper sleeve.\n\n{{Listen|filename=Welcome to the Pleasuredome (The Alternative).ogg\n|title=Welcome to the Pleasuredome (The Alternative) excerpt|description=An excerpt from ''Welcome to the Pleasuredome (The Alternative)''}}\n\n==B-sides==\nAll releases featured either a short, long or even longer version of \"Get It On\", originally recorded for a [[BBC Radio 1]] session in 1983, plus a faded or full length version of \"Happy Hi!\", a brand-new song.\n\nBoth \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]] (International)\" and \"[[Born to Run (song)|Born To Run]]\" are live recordings (with some minor overdubs), based on an actual live appearance on ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'s'' \"Europe A-Go-Go\" in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] during early January 1985.\n\n==Video==\nThe video, by [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]], features the group stealing a car, going to a carnival and encountering all manner of deceptively \"pleasureable\" activities. The audio soundtrack of the video was included as part of the [[cassette single]].\n\n==Promotional releases==\nIn 1984, a few months prior to the album's release, an early instrumental version of the album track was issued as a promotional 12-inch single, entitled \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Pleasure Fix)\", along with a similar early instrumental of \"The Only Star in Heaven\" (subtitled \"Star Fix\"). These tracks were subsequently given wider release as part of the B-side to the second 12-inch of \"[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)|The Power of Love]]\" single.\n\n\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" was also used on several promotional records in the USA during 1985, featuring the following tracks in various combinations:\n*The first UK 7-inch mix of the track (\"Altered Real\"), labeled \"[[Trevor Horn]] Remix\".\n*An edited version of the album track created by the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] radio station KZAP, and known as \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome (KZAP Edit)\" (6:22)\n*A version of the second UK 7-inch mix (\"Alternative Reel\") with a new introduction added, and known as \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Urban Mix)\" (8:08).  This is on the [[Bang! (1985 Frankie Goes to Hollywood album)|Bang!]] Japanese album and CD.\n*A slightly edited (spoken introduction removed) version of \"Relax (International)\" (4:26)\n\n==Chart performance==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1985)\n!Peak<br>position\n!Total<br>weeks\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australian Singles Chart<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=118}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|46\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Austrian Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.austriancharts.at/ austriancharts.at \u2013 Austria Top 40 \u2013 Hitparade \u00d6sterreich<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201091227/http://austriancharts.at/ |date=1 December 2008 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian Singles Chart<ref>http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|41\n|align=\"center\"|11\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Dutch Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.dutchcharts.nl/ dutchcharts.nl \u2013 Dutch charts portal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|French Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.infodisc.fr/Bilan_F.php InfoDisc: Tout les Titres par Artiste<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920093356/http://www.infodisc.fr/Bilan_F.php |date=20 September 2013 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|65\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|German Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.musicline.de/ Die ganze Musik im Internet: Charts, News, Neuerscheinungen, Tickets, Genres, Genresuche, Genrelexikon, K\u00fcnstler-Suche, Musik-Suche, Track-Suche, Ticket-Suche \u2013 musicline.de<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.irishcharts.ie/ The Irish Charts \u2013 All there is to know<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.charts.org.nz/ charts.org.nz \u2013 New Zealand charts portal<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200125/http://www.charts.org.nz/ |date=24 July 2011 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Swiss Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.swisscharts.com/ Die Offizielle Schweizer Hitparade und Music Community \u2013 swisscharts.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart<ref>[http://www.chartstats.com/ Chart Stats \u2013 UK Singles & Albums Chart Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hGWCuqaE?url=http://www.chartstats.com |date=3 June 2009 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">[http://www.allmusic.com/ AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|48\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Dance/Club Play Songs Chart<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>\n|align=\"center\"|31\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|}\n\n==Track listing==\n* All discographical information pertains to the original UK single release only.\n* All songs written by [[Peter Gill (FGTH drummer)|Peter Gill]]/[[Holly Johnson]]/[[Brian Nash]]/[[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]], unless otherwise noted.\n[[File:WTTP - picturediscsingle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|PZTAS 7 picture disc.]]\n\n===7\": ZTT / ZTAS 7 (UK)===\n# \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" (Altered Real) \u2013 4:20\n# \"Get It On\" <small>[longer version]</small> <small>([[Marc Bolan]])</small> \u2014 3:28\n# \"Happy Hi!\" <small>[fade]</small> <small>(Gill/Johnson/O'Toole)</small> \u2014 3:47\n*[[Matrix numbers]] on A-side: 1U/2U\n\n===7\": ZTT / ZTAS 7 (UK)===\n# \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" (Alternative Reel) <small>[a.k.a.

Although these releases have some admirers, and have usefully made available various original mixes on CD for the first time, the accompanying A-side remixes by contemporary DJs have tended on the whole to bear little or no comparison to the spirit of the originals.\n\nReissues in the group's name have also tended to shun any overt reference to the identity of the original artists, and the reissue artwork has notably featured no images of the group. It has been suggested that this situation may relate to Johnson's successful but acrimonious court case against ZTT in 1989, which freed him (and effectively the other group members) from their unfair contract with the label.\n\n'''1993 reissues'''\n\n=== CD: ZTT / FGTH2CD United Kingdom ===\n# \"Welcome To The Pleasuredome\" (Original 7\") \u2013 4:22\n# \"Welcome To The Pleasuredome\" (Brothers In Rhythm Rollercoaster Mix) \u2013 14:36\n# \"Welcome To The Pleasuredome\" (Elevatorman's Non-stop Top Floor Club Mix) \u2013 6:06\n# \"Welcome To The Pleasuredome\" (Pleasurefix Original 12\" Mix) \u2013 9:41\n\nTrack 4 is mislabeled.

It was released on 25 August 1986.\n\n==Background==\nHaving topped the charts around the world with ''Welcome to the Pleasuredome'' and its accompanying singles, Frankie Goes to Hollywood took off to [[Amsterdam]] to record the follow-up album, ''[[Liverpool (album)|Liverpool]]''. Taking on a rockier edge, \"Rage Hard\" was the first single culled from the disc.\n\nThe single's title came from the [[Dylan Thomas]] poem \"[[Do not go gentle into that good night]]\".\n\nOf note, \"Rage Hard\" was a testament to the changing musical landscape in Britain at the time. It was not only the first Frankie single to be featured on CD single, it was also the first single to not feature a cassette release - new rules limited the number items that could count towards the official charts, following the earlier ZTT excesses.\n\n\"Rage Hard\" eventually hit Number 4 in the UK singles charts and Number 1 in [[Germany]] (for two weeks), #5 in [[Switzerland]], #7 in the [[Netherlands]], #12 in [[Austria]], #19 in [[Sweden]] and #32 in [[France]].\n\n== B-sides ==\n\nThe b-sides to \"Rage Hard\" were, for the most part, straight forward cover songs. Firstly there was a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s 1972 glam-rock classic \"Suffragette City\", slightly renamed to \"SuffRAGEtte City\" to fit in with the \"Rage Hard\" promotion. The second cover song was \"Roadhouse Blues\" by [[The Doors]] which featured on the 2nd 12\". A shorter version features on the CD single.\n\nThe original b-side is an odd composition entitled \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\". It was released in two versions, a 4-minute mix and a 6-minute mix and featured [[Holly Johnson]] & Brian (Nasher) Nash imitating [[Count von Count]] (\"Ha ha ha/I am the Count\") from the children's TV show 'Sesame Street'. This was complemented by sampled burps and belches over a backing track.\n{{Listen|filename=Rage Hard Freddy Basstone Mix.ogg\n|title=Rage Hard Freddy Basstone Mix excerpt|description=An excerpt from ''Rage Hard Freddy Basstone Mix.ogg''}}\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===7\": ZTT / ZTAS 22 United Kingdom ===\n\"rage rage\"\n\n# \"Rage Hard\" (7\" mix) - 5:05\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 4:03\n* The standard release features all five coloured fists on the cover\n* 20,000 copies in a pop-up gatefold sleeve (with the Rage Hard fists being the pop-up) (sleeve featured the Orange fist) (ZTD22)\n\n===7\": ZTT / ZTAX 22 United Kingdom ===\n# \"Rage Hard\" (stamped) - 4:55\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 4:03\n\n* The dance mix of Rage Hard was an edit of the \"Broad Mix\" from the 2nd 12\" (sleeve featured the Blue fist)\n[[File:Full Rage Hard releases.jpg|thumb|right|width 200px|Full Rage Hard releases]] (All discographical information pertains to UK releases only)\n\n===12\": ZTT / 12 ZTAS 22 United Kingdom ===\n\"Slam Bam\"\n\n# \"Rage Hard\" \u2295 - 12:08\n# \"[The B-side]\" + \"SuffRAGEtte City\" <small>(David Bowie)</small> - 3:31\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 6:15\n# \"['always note the sequencer...']\" + \"[The End]\" - 0:22\n* An edit (10:05) of this mix is also known as \"Young Person's Guide To The 12-inch\"\n* This 12\" was also released with a 12\" x 24\" poster (12 ZTAQ 22), 20,000 copies.\n* Also released on German CD (Island / 658 434)\n\n===12\": ZTT / 12 ZTAX 22 United Kingdom ===\n# \"Rage Hard\" (Broad Mix) - 8:36\n# \"Roadhouse Blues\" (the full version) - 4:03\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\" - 6:15\n# \"['always note the sequencer...']\" + \"[The End]\" - 0:22\n\n* (sleeve featured the Yellow fist)\n* Note: 12ZTAX22 also came in a limited edition cardboard box which was designed to contain the complete set of Rage Hard UK releases.

It would be the band's final album of all-new material, and lead singer [[Holly Johnson]] would leave the band following the corresponding world tour, followed by a flurry of lawsuits from [[ZTT]]. The album's production was handled by [[Trevor Horn]]'s engineer [[Stephen Lipson]], who urged the band to play their own instruments on this album (Horn having replaced many of the band's performances and arrangements with his session musicians or his own performances on ''[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]''.) ''Liverpool'' therefore features a heavier rock sound than its predecessor. \n\nThe album was a commercial disappointment compared to the band's previous effort, though it charted generally high at #5 in the United Kingdom and Germany, #7 on the [[Austria]]n and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] music charts and #8 in [[Norway]]. The cover photo was different depending on what format was purchased (LP, cassette, or compact disc). It also produced the Top 5 single \"[[Rage Hard]]\" (#1 in Germany), Top 20 single \"[[Warriors of the Wasteland]]\" and Top 30 single \"[[Watching the Wildlife]]\".\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs [[Peter Gill (FGTH drummer)|Gill]]/[[Holly Johnson|Johnson]]/[[Brian Nash|Nash]]/[[Mark O'Toole (musician)|O'Toole]] unless otherwise stated.\n\n# \"[[Warriors of the Wasteland]]\" - 4:58\n# \"[[Rage Hard]]\" - 5:03\n# \"Kill the Pain\" - 6:16\n# \"Maximum Joy\" - 5:32\n# \"[[Watching the Wildlife]]\" - 4:18\n# \"Lunar Bay\" - 5:42\n# \"For Heaven's Sake\" - 4:29\n# \"Is Anybody Out There?\" - 7:25\n\nA later release includes two bonus tracks:\n# \"(Don't Lose What's Left) of Your Mind\"\n# \"[[Suffragette City]]\" <small>([[David Bowie]])</small>\n\n=== Singles ===\n# \"[[Rage Hard]]\"\n# \"[[Warriors of the Wasteland]]\"\n# \"[[Watching the Wildlife]]\"\n\n=== 2-CD Deluxe Edition ===\nIn 2011, a remastered Deluxe Edition of ''Liverpool'' was released, featuring a second disc containing rare and previously unreleased material.

However, many of the settlers were not from [[Scandinavia]], but descendants of Norse settlers in the [[Irish Sea]] region. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, [[Orkney]], or [[Shetland]] often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  As a result, the [[Irish language]] has had some influence on both Faroese and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. There is some debatable evidence of Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of [[Mykines, Faroe Islands|Mykines]], [[St\u00f3ra D\u00edmun]], [[L\u00edtla D\u00edmun]] and [[Argir]] have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: \"blak/bla\u00f0ak\" ([[buttermilk]]), cf. [[Middle Irish]] ''bl\u00e1thach''; \"drunnur\" (tail-piece of an animal), cf. Middle Irish ''dronn'';  \"gr\u00fakur\" ([[head]], headhair), cf. Middle Irish ''gruaig''; \"l\u00e1mur\" ([[hand]], [[paw]]), cf. Middle Irish ''l\u00e1mh''; \"tarvur\" ([[bull]]), cf. Middle Irish ''tarbh''; and \"\u00e6rgi\" ([[pasture]] in the [[outfield]]), cf. Middle Irish ''\u00e1irge''.<ref>Chr. Matras. Greinaval \u2013 m\u00e1lfr\u00f8\u00f0igreinir.

This maintained a rich [[Oral history|spoken tradition]], but for 300 years the language was not used in written form.\n\nThis changed when [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] and the Icelandic grammarian and politician [[J\u00f3n Sigur\u00f0sson]] published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Faroese-language|title=Faroese language|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}</ref> They set a standard for the [[orthography]] of the language, based on its Old Norse roots and similar to that of Icelandic. This had the advantage of being etymologically clear, as well as keeping the kinship with the Icelandic written language. The actual pronunciation, however, often differs from the written rendering. The letter [[\u00f0]], for example, has no specific [[phoneme]] attached to it.\n\n[[Jakob Jakobsen]] devised a rival system of orthography, based on his wish for a phonetic spelling, but this system was never taken up by the speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snar.fo/tema-og-tvoergreinalig-evni/skaldskapur-og-midlar/rithoevundar/j/jakobsen-jakob/|title=Snar.fo, Jakob Jakobsen (1864-1918)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937, Faroese replaced [[Danish language|Danish]] as the official school language, in 1938 as the church language, and in 1948 as the national language by the Home Rule Act of the Faroes. However, Faroese did not become the common language of media and advertising until the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Today Danish is considered a foreign language, although around 5% of residents on the Faroes learn it as a first language, and it is a required subject for students in third grade<ref>[http://www.logir.fo/system/foframe.htm Logir.fo \u2013 Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215092520/http://www.logir.fo/system/foframe.htm |date=2008-12-15 }} Database of laws on the Faroe Islands {{fo icon}}</ref> and up.\n\nThe Visit Faroese tourism organisation launched the Faroe Islands Translate online service in 2017, available in English and another 13 languages including Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and Portuguese.

The language shares many features with both Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian; Old Norwegian appears closer to Old Faroese, whereas Old Icelandic remained rather archaic compared to other medieval varieties of Old West Norse. The most crucial aspects of the development of Faroese are diphthongisation and palatalisation.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThere is not enough data available to establish an accurate chronology of Faroese, but a rough one may be developed through comparison to the chronologies of Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian. In the 12th/13th centuries, ''\u00e1'' and ''\u01eb\u0301'' merged as {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}; later on at the beginning of the 14th century, delabialization took place: ''y'', ''\u00f8y'', ''au'' > /i, \u0254i, \u025bi/; ''\u00ed'' and ''\u00fd'' merged in addition to ''i'' and ''y'', but in the case of ''\u00ed'' and ''\u00fd'', it appears that labialisation took place instead as is documented by later development to {{IPA|/\u028a\u026a/}}. Further, the language underwent a palatalisation of ''k'', ''g'' and ''sk'' before [[Old Norse]] ''e'', ''i'', ''y'', ''\u00f8'', ''au'' > {{IPA|/k<sup>j</sup>, \u0261<sup>j</sup>, sk<sup>j</sup>/}} > {{IPA|/c<sup>\u00e7</sup>, \u025f<sup>\u029d</sup>, \u0255c<sup>\u00e7</sup>/}} > {{IPA|/t\u0283\u02b0, t\u0283, \u0283/}}. Before the palatalisation ''\u00e9'' and ''\u01fd'' merged as {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and approximately in the same period [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''u'' is inserted into word-final {{IPA|/Cr/}} and {{IPA|/CrC/}} clusters. The Great Quantity Shift{{citation needed|date=January 2016|reason=Is it really called this in the literature?}} operated in the 15th/16th centuries. In the case of [[Faroese phonology#Skerping|''skerping'']], it took place after delabialization but before loss of post-vocalic ''\u00f0'' and ''g'' {{IPA|/\u0263/}}. The shift of ''hv'' {{IPA|/hw/}} to {{IPA|/kw/}}, the deletion of {{IPA|/h/}} in (remaining) word-initial {{IPA|/h/}}\u2013sonorant clusters (''hr'', ''hl'', ''hn'' > ''r'', ''l'', ''n''), and the dissolution of ''\u00fe'' (''\u00fe'' > ''t''; ''\u00fe'' > ''h'' in demonstrative pronouns and adverbs)<ref>{{citation|last=Petersen|first=Hjalmar P.|title=The Change of ''\u00fe'' to ''h'' in Faroese |url=https://setur.fo/uploads/tx_tcpublications/Petersen_HP_The_Change_of_%C3%BE_to_h.pdf}}</ref> appeared before the end of the 13th century. Another undated change is the merger of ''\u01eb'', ''\u00f8'' and ''\u01ff'' into {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}; pre-nasal ''\u01eb'', ''\u01eb\u0301'' > ''o'', ''\u00f3''. ''enk'', ''eng'' probably became ''eing'', ''eink'' in the 14th century; the development of ''a'' to {{IPA|/\u025b/}} before ''ng'', ''nk'' appeared after the palatalisation of ''k'', ''g'', and ''sk'' had been completed, such a change is quite a recent development, as well as change ''Cve'' > ''Cv\u00f8''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Development of vowels from Old Norse to Modern Faroese<ref name=\"Loanwords\">According to Hjalmar Petersen in: T\u00f3r\u00f0ur J\u00f3ansson: ''English loanwords in Faroese''.

Geminated stops may be pre-aspirated in intervocalic and word-final position. Intervocalically the aspirated consonants become pre-aspirated unless followed by a closed vowel. In clusters, the preaspiration merges with a preceding nasal or apical approximant, rendering them voiceless.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+Faroese consonants\n! colspan=2|\n!

Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks, while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the observable universe's total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all [[baryon]]s, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.\n\nSome estimates imply that there are roughly {{10^|80}} baryons (almost entirely protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.<ref name=\"heile\">\nFrank Heile.\n[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/is-the-total-number-of-pa_b_4987369.html \"Is the Total Number of Particles in the Universe Stable Over Long Periods of Time?\"].\n2014.\n</ref><ref>\nJared Brooks.\n[http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~tt/PHYS133/hws5.pdf \"Galaxies and Cosmology\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152801/http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~tt/PHYS133/hws5.pdf |date=2014-07-14 }}.\n2014.\np. 4, equation 16.\n</ref><ref name=\"mrob\" />\n\nThe number of protons in the observable universe is called the [[Eddington number]].\n\nIn terms of number of particles, some estimates imply that nearly all the matter, excluding [[dark matter]], occurs in neutrinos, and that roughly {{10^|86}} elementary particles of matter exist in the visible universe, mostly neutrinos.<ref name=\"mrob\">\n{{cite web\n |author=Robert Munafo\n |date=24 Jul 2013\n |title=Notable Properties of Specific Numbers\n |url=http://mrob.com/pub/math/numbers-19.html\n |accessdate=2013-08-28\n}}</ref> Other estimates imply that roughly {{10^|97}} elementary particles exist in the visible universe (not including [[dark matter]]), mostly photons and other massless force carriers.<ref name=\"mrob\" />\n\n== Standard Model ==\n{{main|Standard Model}}\nThe Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary [[fermion]]s, plus their corresponding [[antiparticle]]s, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the [[Higgs boson]], which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]). However, the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, since it is not known if it is compatible with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the [[graviton]], the particle that would carry the [[gravity|gravitational force]], and [[superpartner|sparticle]]s, [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] partners of the ordinary particles.\n\n=== Fundamental fermions ===\n{{main|Fermion}}\n\nThe 12&nbsp;fundamental fermions are divided into 3&nbsp;[[generation (particle physics)|generations]] of 4&nbsp;particles each. Half of the fermions are [[lepton]]s, three of which have an electric charge of &minus;1, called the electron ({{Subatomic particle|electron-}}), the [[muon]] ({{Subatomic particle|muon-}}), and the [[tau (particle)|tau]] ({{Subatomic particle|tau-}}), the other three leptons are [[neutrino]]s ({{Subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|muon neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|tau neutrino}}), which are the only elementary fermions with no electric or color charge.

Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.\n\n==== Antiparticles ====\n{{main|Antimatter}}\n\nThere are also 12&nbsp;fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these 12&nbsp;particles.  For example, the [[antielectron]] (positron) ''{{Subatomic particle|antielectron}}'' is the electron's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ '''Particle Generations'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\"| '''[[Lepton|Antileptons]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''First generation''\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''Second generation''\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''Third generation''\n|-\n|''Name'' || ''Symbol'' || ''Name'' || ''Symbol'' || ''Name'' || ''Symbol''\n|-\n| [[positron]] || {{Subatomic particle|antielectron}} || [[antimuon]] || {{Subatomic particle|antimuon}} || [[antitau]] || {{Subatomic particle|antitau}}\n|-\n| [[electron antineutrino]] || {{Subatomic particle|electron antineutrino}} || [[muon antineutrino]]|| {{Subatomic particle|Muon antineutrino}} || [[tau antineutrino]] || {{Subatomic particle|Tau antineutrino}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\"| '''[[Quark|Antiquarks]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''First generation''\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''Second generation''\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''Third generation''\n|-\n| [[up antiquark]] || {{Subatomic particle|Up antiquark}} || [[charm antiquark]] || {{Subatomic particle|Charm antiquark}} || [[top antiquark]] || {{Subatomic particle|Top antiquark}}\n|-\n| [[down antiquark]] || {{Subatomic particle|Down antiquark}} || [[strange antiquark]] || {{Subatomic particle|Strange antiquark}}  ||  [[bottom antiquark]]|| {{Subatomic particle|Bottom antiquark}}\n|}\n\n==== Quarks ====\n{{main|Quark}}\n\nIsolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by [[Colour confinement|confinement]]. Every quark carries one of three [[color charge]]s of the [[strong interaction]]; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via [[gluon]] exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via [[photon]] exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.\n\nHowever, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral [[meson]]. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being \"red\", another \"blue\", another \"green\". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral [[baryon]]. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors \"antired\", \"antiblue\" and \"antigreen\" can form a color-neutral [[antibaryon]].\n\nQuarks also carry fractional [[electric charge]]s, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +{{2/3}} or \u2212{{1/3}}, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either \u2212{{2/3}} or +{{1/3}}.\n\nEvidence for the existence of quarks comes from [[deep inelastic scattering]]: firing [[electron]]s at [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to determine the distribution of charge within [[nucleon]]s (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the [[electric field]] around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a [[jet (particle physics)|jet of particles]] is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.\n\n=== Fundamental bosons ===\n{{main|Boson}}\n\nIn the Standard Model, vector ([[spin (physics)|spin]]-1) bosons ([[gluon]]s, [[photon]]s, and the [[W and Z bosons]]) mediate forces, whereas the [[Higgs boson]] (spin-0) is responsible for the intrinsic [[mass]] of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state ([[Pauli exclusion principle]]). Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like [[meson]]s. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.\n\n==== Gluons ====\n{{main|Gluon}}\n\nGluons mediate the [[strong interaction]], which join quarks and thereby form [[hadron]]s, which are either [[baryon]]s (three quarks) or [[meson]]s (one quark and one antiquark).  Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the [[atomic nucleus]].  Like quarks, gluons exhibit [[color charge|color]] and anticolor\u2014unrelated to the concept of visual color\u2014sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of gluons.\n\n==== Electroweak bosons ====\n{{main|W and Z bosons|Photon}}\n\nThere are three [[weak gauge boson]]s: ''W<sup>+</sup>'', ''W<sup>\u2212</sup>'', and ''Z<sup>0</sup>''; these mediate the [[weak interaction]]. The W bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay. The ''W<sup>\u2212</sup>'' converts a neutron into a proton then decay into an electron and electron antineutrino pair. The ''Z<sup>0</sup>'' does not convert charge but rather changes momentum and is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange. The massless [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.\n\n==== Higgs boson ====\n{{main|Higgs boson}}\n\nAlthough the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single [[electroweak force]] at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]] collider at [[DESY]].  The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the ''W'' and ''Z'' bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the [[Higgs mechanism]]. Through the process of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain massless (the photon). On 4 July 2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the [[Higgs boson]] was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. [[Peter Higgs]] who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |author=Lizzy Davies\n |date=4 July 2014\n |title=Higgs boson announcement live: CERN scientists discover subatomic particle\n |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-discovered-live-coverage-cern\n |work=[[The Guardian]]\n |accessdate=2012-07-06\n}}</ref>  The Higgs boson is believed to have a mass of approximately 125 GeV.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |author=Lucas Taylor\n |date=4 Jul 2014\n |title=Observation of a new particle with a mass of 125 GeV\n |url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/observation-new-particle-mass-125-gev\n |publisher=[[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]\n |accessdate=2012-07-06\n}}</ref>  The [[statistical significance]] of this discovery was reported as 5-sigma, which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]. Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.\n\n==== Graviton ====\n\n{{main|Graviton}}\n\nThe [[graviton]] is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to [[Graviton#Experimental observation|the difficulty inherent in its detection]], it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles.<ref name=\"PFIp1-3\"/> The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing massive [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory|Kaluza\u2013Klein]] gravitons.<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0910.1535|bibcode = 2010PhLB..682..446C|title = Massless versus Kaluza-Klein gravitons at the LHC|journal = Physics Letters B|volume = 682|issue = 4\u20135|pages = 446\u2013449|last1 = Calmet|first1 = Xavier|last2 = De Aquino|first2 = Priscila|last3 = Rizzo|first3 = Thomas G.|year = 2010|doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2009.11.045|hdl = 2078/31706}}</ref>\n\n== Beyond the Standard Model ==\n\nAlthough experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the [[Standard Model]], some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysteries, for instance the [[hierarchy problem]]. Theories [[beyond the Standard Model]] attempt to resolve these shortcomings.\n\n=== Grand unification ===\n{{main|Grand Unified Theory}}\n\nOne extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the [[electroweak interaction]] with the [[strong interaction]] into a single 'grand unified theory' (GUT). Such a force would be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] into the three forces by a [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs-like mechanism]]. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of [[X and Y bosons]], which cause [[proton decay]]. However, the non-observation of proton decay at the [[Super-Kamiokande]] neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10).\n\n=== Supersymmetry ===\n{{main|Supersymmetry}}\n\nSupersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of [[supersymmetric particle]]s, abbreviated as ''[[sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s, and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by {{1/2}} from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s would not be powerful enough to produce them. However, some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected by the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].\n\n=== String theory ===\n{{main|String theory}}\n\nString theory is a model of physics where all \"particles\" that make up [[matter]] are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-dimensional (according to [[M-theory]], the leading version) or 12-dimensional (according to [[F-theory]]<ref>Cumrun Vafa. \"Evidence for F-theory.\" ''Nucl.Phys.'' '''B'''469: 403-418,1996\n[[DOI:10.1016/0550-3213(96)00172-1]]. [[arXiv]]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602022 hep-th/9602022]</ref>) universe.  These strings vibrate at different frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin.  A string can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, like a circle).  As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a ''[[world line#World lines as a tool to describe events|world sheet]]''.  String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-[[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]] being a string and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the \"fabric\" of space using the [[uncertainty principle]] (e.g., the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere else in the universe at any given moment).\n\nString theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which exist the 3 space dimensions and the 1 time dimension that we observe.  The remaining 6 theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the \"[[multiverse]]\" outside our known universe).\n\nSome predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the [[graviton]].\n\n=== Technicolor ===\n{{main|Technicolor (physics)}}\n\nTechnicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is that the Higgs-Boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these objects.\n\n=== Preon theory ===\n{{main|Preon}}\n\nAccording to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from \"pre-quarks\". In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the Standard Model did for the [[particle zoo]] that came before it. Most models assume that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three to half a dozen more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.\n\n=== Acceleron theory ===\nAccelerons are the hypothetical [[subatomic particle]]s that integrally link the newfound mass of the [[neutrino]] to the [[dark energy]] conjectured to be accelerating the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]].<ref name=acceleron/>\n\nIn theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their interactions with accelerons. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull neutrinos apart.<ref name=acceleron>\n{{cite web\n |date=28 Jul 2004\n |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/07/040728090338.htm\n |title=New theory links neutrino's slight mass to accelerating Universe expansion\n |publisher=''[[ScienceDaily]]''\n |accessdate=2008-06-05\n}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Particles of the Standard Model}}\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Asymptotic freedom]]\n* [[List of particles]]\n* [[Physical ontology]]\n* [[Quantum field theory]]\n* [[Quantum gravity]]\n* [[Quantum triviality]]\n* [[UV fixed point]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== General readers ===\n*[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.P.]] & [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg, S.]] (1987) ''Elementary Particles and the Laws of Physics:  The 1986 Dirac Memorial Lectures''.

[[Miami]], [[Florida]]. They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League East|East]] division. Their home park is [[Marlins Park]]. Though one of only two MLB franchises to have never won a division title (the other is the [[Colorado Rockies]]), the Marlins have won two [[World Series]] championships as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team. \n\nThe team began play as an [[1993 Major League Baseball expansion|expansion team]] in the 1993 season as the '''Florida Marlins''' and played home games from their inaugural season to the 2012 season at [[Joe Robbie Stadium]], which they shared with the [[Miami Dolphins]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The stadium was later called Pro Player Park, Pro Player Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Land Shark Stadium, and Sun Life Stadium during their tenancy.

It ran for three series of 13 half-hour episodes and was broadcast on [[ABC Television|ABC TV]] in 1994, 1995, and 1997.\n\n==Production==\n{{further|Working Dog Productions}}\nThe series was written, directed and produced by [[Jane Kennedy (actor)|Jane Kennedy]], [[Santo Cilauro]], [[Rob Sitch]] and [[Tom Gleisner]]. They created and performed in the television shows ''[[The D-Generation]]'' and ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)|The Late Show]]'' before creating ''Frontline'' (as well as ''[[Funky Squad]]'' between seasons 1 and 2 of Frontline). After ''Frontline'' they moved into feature films, making several popular Australian movies including ''[[The Castle (1997 Australian film)|The Castle]]'' and ''[[The Dish]]'', and hosted ''[[The Panel (Australian TV series)|The Panel]]'' for several years, before moving on to ''[[Thank God You're Here]]'' and later ''[[Have You Been Paying Attention?]]''.\n\nThe series was partly inspired by a ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' special \"Has the media gone too far?\". It bears some similarity to the UK series ''[[Drop the Dead Donkey]]''.\n\n==Setting==\n\n===A commercial network===\nThe series follows the fortunes of a fictional current affairs show, ''Frontline''. In the show, ''Frontline'' competes directly with [[Nine Network|Nine]]'s ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' and [[Seven Network|Seven]]'s ''[[Real Life (TV program)|Real Life]]'', which changed its name to ''[[Today Tonight]]'' from 1995 onwards.\n\nThe ''Frontline'' office showcases and satirises the machinations of the ruthless producers, the self-obsessed airhead host, and the ambitious, cynical reporters, all of whom resort to any sort of underhanded trick to get ratings and maintain their status \u2013 including the use of hidden cameras, [[foot-in-the-door]], bullying interview techniques, and [[chequebook journalism]]. They ingratiate themselves with the all-powerful network bosses, while the real work is in fact done by their long-suffering production staff.\n\nThe station itself also runs other television shows referenced by ''Frontline'' staff, such as 6 o'clock news program, a 3-hour news review show ''Sunday Forum'', a [[sketch comedy|sketch]] show ''The Komedy Bunch'', a game show ''Jackpot'', a teen soap opera ''Sunshine Cove'' which later changed to ''Rainbow Island'', also lesser mentioned shows such as the football show ''Ball-to-Ball'', ''Late-Night OZ'', ''Cartoon Crazies'', and ''Vacation''.\n\n===As a commentary===\n\nThe characters and situations were often thinly-disguised parodies of recent real events and real people, giving the show's comedy a black edge. Episodes such as \"The Siege\" were replays of controversial events which had occurred a few months prior, told as though ''Frontline'' had covered the story.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128289322|title=Frontliners back in ABC firing line|last=Rosenberg|first=Jen|date=27 July 1995|work=Canberra Times|access-date=2 October 2018|pages=31}}</ref>\n\nThe dim witted, egotistical host Mike Moore was a parody of current television hosts and journalists. Sitch has claimed that none of the characters were directly based on a single person, and indeed the character of Moore was a combination of well-known characteristics of several high-profile television figures, including ''A Current Affair'' host [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]], Martin's predecessor [[Mike Willesee]],<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130564274|title=Back-door view of 'Frontline'|last=Leedham|first=Nicole|date=15 October 1995|work=Canberra Times|access-date=2 October 2018|pages=34}}</ref> and ''Real Life'' host [[Stan Grant (journalist)|Stan Grant]].\n\nThe ABC's media review show ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' featured in the show. Much of the real life journalistic misconduct reported on ''Media Watch'' later appeared on ''Frontline'' in fictionalised form. One example of this was when ''Media Watch'' reported that [[David Richardson (Australian)#In Barcelona Tonight|Dave \"Sluggo\" Richardson]] had made a highly misleading report on [[Christopher Skase]] for ''Today Tonight''. Richardson was suspended from duty for a month, and in the \"One Rule for One\" episode of ''Frontline'', fictional reporter Martin di Stasio is suspended for a month for doing exactly the same thing.\n* [http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/broadband/mpg/barcelona_tonight.mpg A video of Media Watch's original report about Richardson's Skase story]\n\nAlso, multiple episodes of ''Frontline'' featured ''Media Watch'' segments criticising the show.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Frontline (Australian TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of Frontline (Australian TV series) episodes}}\n\n== Characters ==\n\n===Reporters===\n* '''Mike Moore''' ([[Rob Sitch]]) is the anchor of ''Frontline''. He is self-centred and dim-witted, but his intentions are generally noble. Mike is very protective of what he calls his \"journalistic integrity\" and resents any insinuation that he is a lightweight. He believes that he is on the cutting edge of journalism, but is oblivious to most of ''Frontline''{{'}}s content, as the executive producers go to some length to keep him out of production meetings, and a running gag within the show sees Mike ignore most of the stories that ''Frontline'' airs despite his position as host. Mike is desperate for any sort of publicity he can get, but his public appearances as a constant source of amusement for the rest of the ''Frontline'' team, as they typically end in disaster. While usually harmless, Mike is not above using underhanded tactics to get his way \u2013 in \"A Hole in the Heart\" (series 3), he steals a story from Marty because viewers are responding positively to it, while in \"[[Addicted to Fame]]\", he demands that Geoffrey's television show be cancelled because he is jealous of the attention his friend is getting. In the first two series Mike's position is constantly under threat from senior reporter Brooke Vandenberg, who has a better press profile, but by the last series he has been cemented as one of the network's most valuable stars and considerably more effort is made to pander to his whims. While Mike is usually portrayed as simply dumb (for example, in \"A Man of His Convictions\" in series 2 he writes a letter to media commentator [[Stuart Littlemore]] full of basic spelling and grammatical errors) he occasionally surprises his colleagues with his sneakiness: in \"Give 'em Enough Rope\" (series 2) he traps the network owner into admitting to contravening the Broadcasting Act in a live interview, after first getting the owner to publicly commit to allowing him to ask difficult questions without threat to his job. Many gags centre around how easily he is manipulated by his executive producer, the most typical case being when Mike refuses to present a story and then is convinced to run it by an appeal to his supposed fearlessness or journalistic integrity.\n* '''Brooke Vandenberg''' ([[Jane Kennedy (actor)|Jane Kennedy]]) is a reporter on ''Frontline''. She is ambitious, amoral and publicity hungry. While there are constant rumours that she has affairs with male celebrities in order to build her profile, in some cases she simply creates the rumours herself; in \"The Desert Angel\" (series 1) she confesses to [[Pat Cash]] that she started a rumour about having an affair with him. Like most of the employees of ''Frontline'', she has no ethical problems with any action the show takes to get a good story. She is, however, portrayed as being very hypocritical; in \"The Invisible Man\" (series 1), she has no issues with violating peoples' privacy when she runs a story using a hidden camera to catch shoplifters in a store change room, but is outraged when a rival network violates her own privacy in the same way when broadcasting a similar story. Brooke is also very vain, and tends to edit her stories to give herself as much screen time as she can manage. When a new segment producer edits footage of Brooke out of a story in \"I Disease\" (series 3), she becomes upset to the point where she demands that the producer be fired for it. In \"A Hole in the Heart\", Brooke discovers she is pregnant to a former boyfriend and is bribed into having an abortion by a new hosting offer.\n* '''Martin \"Marty\" Di Stasio''' ([[Tiriel Mora]]) is a senior reporter on ''Frontline''. He is Mike's major antagonist on the team, often baiting him about sensitive topics, such as the supposedly [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] golf club of which Mike is a member (\"A Hole in the Heart\"), or whenever Mike's public appearances end in disaster. He is the most experienced journalist on the team: a few references are made to him winning a [[Walkley Awards|Walkley Award]]. Like Brooke, he is uncritical of the show's journalistic tactics (although in the episode \"Judge and Jury\", he has reservations about their persecution of a priest accused of rape, mainly because he is a lapsed Catholic); in fact he is usually the confidante of the executive producers, and the one they can trust to do what is needed to get a good story, or to persuade Mike to present a story. His position on ''Frontline'' is more tenuous than that of Mike or Brooke: in \"Dick on the Line\" (series 3) he tells Mike and Brooke that at his age he signs his yearly contract immediately and does not mess about negotiating.\n\n===Producers===\n* '''Emma Ward''' ([[Alison Whyte]]) is the Line Producer on ''Frontline''. She questions the show's practices most frequently and acts as the viewers' conscience. In \"Heroes and Villains\" (series 2), she is the only member of the team to have read the supposedly racist book the show is attacking and objects to their incendiary treatment of its author. Early in series 2 and 3, the executive producers of the time approach Marty and ask him to explain Emma. Marty explains that while she has moral qualms like Mike does, she is more difficult to handle because she is intelligent. Despite often objecting, Emma is usually party to ethically questionable practices and occasionally finds them amusing. In \"A Hole in the Heart (part 2)\", to placate a director from charity organisation Rotary, she allows the executive producer to yell at her and pretend to fire her over one of the show's decisions, when in reality she is receiving a large pay rise in return for her part of the act.\n* '''Kate Preston''' ([[Trudy Hellier]]) is the segment producer. While Kate is friendly with Emma, who has a more senior position, Kate has fewer ethical qualms about stories than Emma, and tends to be in the middle of conflicts between Emma and the executive producer.\n* '''Brian \"Thommo\" Thompson''' ([[Bruno Lawrence]]) is the executive producer during series 1. He is fired by the network in the first episode of series 2, although he is never shown on screen in that episode; the real reason for this is that Lawrence died of lung cancer between the filming of series 1 and series 2, forcing the writers to create a new executive producer character, Sam (see below).\n* '''Sam Murphy''' ([[Kevin J. Wilson]]) is the executive producer during series 2, hired immediately after Brian is fired. Thommo and Sam's characters are similar; a hard-nosed EP who would not hesitate to air questionable stories to attract ratings.\n* '''Graham \"Prowsey\" Prowse''' ([[Steve Bisley]]) is the executive producer during series 3, hired after the producer who took ''Frontline'' to the top retires. Prowsey is much more aggressive and unpleasant than his two predecessors. He has a bad temper, is unpleasant to the staff and is unashamedly [[sexist]]: groping the female staff, dismissing [[bulimia]] as a \"chick thing\" and writing off Brooke's bad moods as [[Premenstrual stress syndrome|PMS]]. He is however, like his predecessors, capable of being charming when needed to deceive Mike, placate Emma or feed Brooke's ego.\n\n===Supporting staff===\n* '''Domenica Baroni''' ([[Anita Smith (actor)|Anita Cerdic]]) is the office receptionist, and the only person in the office who truly admires Mike. Her increasingly bizarre hairstyles become a running gag, culminating in \"Give 'em Enough Rope\", when she is completely bald and festooned with ribbons. Her reactions to the show usually reflect the target audience's responses. She is a reluctant and sometimes traitorous party to the office's determination to keep Mike away from production meetings. She is always very supportive of Mike and there are often hints that she actually has a crush on him. Domenica occasionally contributes to stories run by the show, such as when she receives a tipoff from a relative in \"Divide the Community, Multiply the Ratings\" or when she is the only female staff member willing to go undercover in a nightclub in \"My Generation\".\n* '''Shelley Cohen''' ([[Linda Ross]]) is the executive producer's secretary. She has worked for the network for many years and is usually unfazed by the mishaps in the office.\n* '''Stuart \"Stu\" O'Hallaran''' ([[Pip Mushin]]) is the office's main cameraman and shoots most of Brooke's and Marty's stories. He, Marty and Jase are all friends and frequently make fun of Mike.\n* '''Jason \"Jase\" Cotter''' ([[Torquil Neilson]]) is the sound recorder who works with Stu. Jase is not actually heard speaking until series 3 despite appearing in most episodes in series 1 and 2. He is fired in the episode \"I Get the Big Names\" for audio taping Brooke Vandanberg while she urinates on the toilet and then leaking it to the media.\n* '''Hugh Tabbagh''' ([[Marcus Eyre]]) is the editor of videos, who is almost always seen editing in the audio-visual room whilst sitting, smoking cigarettes, coughing wildly and inhaling an asthma puffer.\n* '''Trev''' ([[Stephen Curry (comedian)|Stephen Curry]]) appears as Jase's replacement as the sound recorder towards the end of the third series.\n\n=== Network employees ===\n* '''Geoffrey Salter''' ([[Santo Cilauro]]) is the network's weatherman and Mike's closest friend at work. Geoff usually appears in private conversations in his office with Mike, and is often the catalyst for Mike to question the reassurance he has been given by a producer that the story of the moment is being ethically pursued. Despite his being Mike's closest friend, Mike frequently ignores Geoff's issues, and their conversations often serve to reinforce Mike's beliefs. Geoff is unpopular with the rest of the ''Frontline'' staff to the point where he is banned from the ''Frontline'' set, but they are all supportive when he unexpectedly achieves popularity with his own one-hour programme in \"Addicted to Fame\" (series 3), though he is unaware that Mike demanded the plans for the expansion of the show be cancelled because he was jealous of the attention Geoff was getting. He is the focus of a running gag where he will laugh hysterically along with Mike at any anecdote Mike tells him, before admitting that he does not understand it.\n* '''Ian Farmer''' ([[Gerard Kennedy (actor)|Gerard Kennedy]]) is the Station Manager, the boss of the local studios. He appears only in season one. He and Brian Thompson are good friends, and frequently play golf together.\n* '''Bob Caville''' ([[Peter Stratford]]) is the network's managing director, and definitively pulls the office into line.\n* '''Jan Whelan''' ([[Genevieve Mooy]])<ref name=\":0\" /> is the network's head of publicity in series 1 and 2. Jan refers to everyone as \"poppet\" and \"darling\" and has extravagantly [[camp (style)|camp]] mannerisms, but is in fact practical and efficient.\n* '''Trish''' ([[Lynda Gibson]]) is the network's head of publicity in series 3. Gibson also appears in \"Workin' Class Man\" from series 2 as the wife/mother of three of a working class family who is visited by Brooke for a story regarding the difficulties of making ends meet.\n* '''Elliot Rhodes''' ([[Boris Conley]]) is a comedian and musician, performing short musical sketches about current events at the end of Friday night episodes of ''Frontline''. Mike detests his act but is required to laugh uproariously and compliment it on air every week. In two episodes, he was fired at Mike's request.\n\n=== Special guests ===\n''Frontline'' frequently featured celebrity cameos, unusually including major Australian politicians appearing as themselves, often but not always as interviewees. The most memorable{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} appearance is that of [[Pauline Hanson]] in \"The Shadow We Cast\" (series 3), in which she turns her famous \"please explain?\" phrase on Mike. [[Noel Pearson]] appears as an interviewee later in the same episode. Other appearances include: [[John Hewson]] in \"The Souffl\u00e9 Rises\" (series 1); [[Pat Cash]] in \"The Desert Angel\"; [[Cheryl Kernot]] in \"We Ain't Got Dames\" (series 1); [[Ben Elton]], [[Bert Newton]], [[Rosemary Margan]], [[Amanda Keller]] and [[Anne Fulwood]] in \"This Night of Nights\" (series 1); [[Glenn Ridge]] in \"Add Sex and Stir\" and \"Office Mole\" (series 2); [[Glenn Robbins]] and [[Molly Meldrum]] in \"Add Sex and Stir\"; [[George Negus]] in \"Add Sex and Stir\" and \"Dick on the Line\" (series 3); and [[Ian Baker-Finch]] in \"A Hole in the Heart\". [[Harry Shearer]]<ref name=\":1\" /> appeared in the series 2 episode \"Changing the Face of Current Affairs\", where he played the character of Larry Hadges. [[Merv Hughes]] also starred in the series 2 episode \"Workin' Class Man\".\n\nOther guest stars appeared in mock-ups of their own shows: Mike Moore appeared on fictitious episodes of ''[[Burke's Backyard]]'' with [[Don Burke]], [[Rex Hunt]]'s fishing show, and ''[[The AFL Footy Show]]'' with [[Sam Newman]]. [[Stuart Littlemore]], who at the time was hosting the media commentary show ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', appeared in several fictitious episodes as a critic of ''Frontline''.\n\n== Production strategies ==\n\n''Frontline'' broke new ground for Australian situation comedy, by adopting some innovative production strategies. Its rapid production schedule was inspired by UK series ''[[Drop The Dead Donkey]]'', where each episode was written and taped in a single week and scripts were closely based on the real news stories of the preceding seven days.\n\nThe ''Frontline'' scripts were likewise written and the series filmed with a short period, often within a single week. It was a fully collaborative effort, with Cilauro, Kennedy, Gleisner and Sitch all sharing writing and directing duties, and the cast all contributing ideas during all stages of production. So sometimes when the show appeared on then-current events, it was a coincidence, as episodes were delayed by several months. In other cases there was direct commentary on real events, albeit not extremely recent ones.\n\nTo create a heightened illusion of grainy documentary realism, footage was shot under [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] in an actual office building set, and taped on hand-held [[Hi-8]] [[camcorder|video cameras]] usually operated by Gleisner and Cilauro. The footage was then transferred onto film and finally transferred back to videotape<ref>The process used is described by Lawrie Zion in the front piece of Cilauro et al. (1995:8)</ref> (see: [[Kinescope]]). Footage that was portrayed as being part of the Frontline broadcast (i.e. Studio or field reports) was shot at broadcast quality, to increase the \"realism\" of the satire and complement the behind the scenes footage.\n\n== Other airings ==\n\nIn 1997, Channel Seven bought the rights to the series,<ref>[http://groups.google.com.au/group/aus.tv/browse_thread/thread/c0f9e69d4e0ea3cd/ Press Release] [[Usenet]] newsgroup aus.tv, 12 August 1997</ref> however they only aired a handful of episodes. The show was perceived by management as \"too close to the bone\" for a network significantly focused upon its prime time current affairs ratings battle with rival stations. [[The Comedy Channel]] has shown the series as late as 2005.\n\nIn America, ''Frontline'' was shown as either ''Behind the Frontline'' on cable or as ''Breaking News'' on PBS (which already has a news series entitled ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'').\n\nIn the UK, series 1 and 2 were shown by the Paramount Comedy Channel.  Series 3, however, was never screened.\n\n== Impact ==\n\nThe series was extremely popular through its run, winning a [[Logie Award]] for Most Outstanding Achievement in Comedy in 1995, and a Logie for [[Alison Whyte]] as most outstanding actress in 1997. A ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' industry poll rated it No. 2 in the 25 all-time greatest Australian TV shows.\n\nSix episodes from series one were a core text in the Year 12 English Advanced syllabus for the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] in [[New South Wales]] (2000\u20132008) for Module C: Representation and Text: Elective 1: Telling the Truth. The episodes are \"Playing The Ego Card\", \"Add Sex and Stir\", \"The Siege\", \"Smaller Fish To Fry\", \"We Ain't Got Dames\", and \"This Night of Nights\". The show has also been used as a text response for both Years 11 and 12 in the English units of the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]].

His father, Pierre Bastiat, was a prominent businessman in the town. His mother died in 1808 when Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was seven years old.<ref name=Roche>{{cite book|last=Roche III|first=George Charles|title= Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat: A Man Alone|year=1971|publisher=Arlington House|location=New Rochelle, New York|isbn=0-87000-116-7}}</ref> His father moved inland to the town of [[Mugron]], with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric following soon afterward. The Bastiat estate in Mugron had been acquired during the [[French Revolution]] and had previously belonged to the Marquis of Poyanne. Pierre Bastiat died in 1810, leaving Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric an orphan. He was fostered by his paternal grandfather and his maiden aunt, Justine Bastiat.<ref name=Roche /> He attended a school in Bayonne, but his aunt thought poorly of it and so enrolled him in the school [[Saint-Sever]]. At age 17, he left school at [[Sor\u00e8ze]] to work for his uncle in his family's export business. It was the same firm where his father had been a partner.\n\n[[File:Buste-bastiat.JPG|thumb|290px|Bust of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat in Mugron, France]]\nBastiat began to develop an intellectual interest as he no longer wished to work with his uncle and desired to go to Paris for formal studies. This hope never came true as his grandfather was in poor health and wished to go to the Mugron estate. Bastiat accompanied him and cared for him. The next year when Bastiat was 24, his grandfather died, leaving him the family estate, thereby providing him with the means to further his theoretical inquiries.<ref name=\"Roche\"/> Bastiat developed intellectual interests in several areas including [[philosophy]], history, politics, religion, travel, poetry, [[political economy]] and biography.\n\nAfter the middle-class [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]], Bastiat became politically active and was elected [[justice of the peace]] of Mugron in 1831 and to the [[General councils (France)|Council General]] (county-level assembly) of Landes in 1832.\n\nBastiat was elected to the national legislative assembly soon after the [[French Revolution of 1848]].<ref name=\"Great\"/>\n\nHis public career as an economist began only in 1844, when his first article was published in the ''[[Journal des \u00e9conomistes]]'' during October of that year and it was ended by his untimely death in 1850. Bastiat contracted [[tuberculosis]], probably during his tours throughout France to promote his ideas and that illness eventually prevented him from making further speeches (particularly at the legislative assembly to which he was elected in 1848 and 1849) and ended his life. During the autumn of 1850, he was sent to Italy by his doctors and he first traveled to Pisa, then to Rome.\n\nOn 24 December 1850, Bastiat called those with him to approach his bed and he murmured twice the words \"the truth\" before he died.<ref name=Roche/>\n\n==Works==\nBastiat was the author of many works on economics and political economy, generally characterized by their clear organization, forceful argumentation and acerbic wit. Economist [[Murray Rothbard]] wrote that \"Bastiat was indeed a lucid and superb writer, whose brilliant and witty essays and fables to this day are remarkable and devastating demolitions of [[protectionism]] and of all forms of government [[subsidy]] and control. He was a truly scintillating advocate of an unrestricted [[free market]]\".<ref name=Great/> However, Bastiat himself declared that subsidy should be available, but limited: \"Under extraordinary circumstances, for urgent cases, the State should set aside some resources to assist certain unfortunate people, to help them adjust to changing conditions\".<ref>Justice and fraternity, in Journal des \u00c9conomistes, 15 June 1848, pg. 313</ref> Among his better known works is ''Economic Sophisms'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Economic Sophisms|last=Bastiat |first=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric [1845] |others=Goddard, A.

Bastiat wrote the work while living in England to advise the shapers of the French Republic on perils to avoid. ''Economic Sophisms'' was translated and adapted for an American readership in 1867 by the economist and historian of money [[Alexander del Mar]], writing under the pseudonym Emile Walter.<ref>\"Emile Walter\" (del Mar, Alexander, pseud.)

It defines a just system of laws and then demonstrates how such law facilitates a free society.\n\nIn ''The Law'', he wrote that everyone has a right to protect \"his person, his liberty, and his property\". The state should be only a \"substitution of a common force for individual forces\" to defend this right. \"Justice\" (defense of one's [[life, liberty, and property|life, liberty and property]]) has precise limits, but if government power extends further into philanthropic endeavors, then government becomes so limitless that it can grow endlessly. The resulting statism is \"based on this triple hypothesis: the total inertness of mankind, the omnipotence of the law, and the infallibility of the legislator\". The public then becomes [[social engineering (political science)|socially engineered]] by the legislator and must bend to the legislators' will \"like the clay to the potter\": <blockquote>Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.\n\nI do not dispute their right to invent social combinations, to advertise them, to advocate them, and to try them upon themselves, at their own expense and risk. But I do dispute their right to impose these plans upon us by law \u2013 by force \u2013 and to compel us to pay for them with our taxes.</blockquote>\n\nBastiat posits that the law becomes perverted when it punishes one's right to self-defense (of his life, liberty and property) in favor of another's right to \"[[Legal plunder|legalized plunder]]\", which he defines as \"if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime,\" in which he includes the tax support of \"protective tariffs, subsidies, guaranteed profits, guaranteed jobs, relief and welfare schemes, public education, progressive taxation, free credit, and public works.\" <ref>[http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html The Law, at bastiat.org]</ref> Bastiat was thus against [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]].\n\n===\"What is Seen and What is Unseen\"===\nIn his 1850 essay \"Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas\" (\"[[What is seen and what is not seen|What is Seen and What is Unseen]]\"), through the [[parable of the broken window]], he introduced the concept of [[opportunity cost]] in all but name\u2014this term was not coined until over 60 years after his death by [[Friedrich von Wieser]] in 1914.\n\n=== Debate with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ===\nHe also famously engaged in a debate between 1849 and 1850 with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] about the legitimacy of interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/FB-PJP-DOI.htm |title=Bastiat-Proudhon Debate on Interest |publisher=Praxeology.net |date= |accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref> As [[Robert Leroux (sociologist)|Robert Leroux]] argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon's anti-interest doctrine \"was the complete antithesis of any serious approach\".<ref>Leroux, Robert. \"Political Economy and Liberalism: The Economic Contribution of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat\" Routledge, 2011, p. 118.</ref> Proudhon famously lost his temper and declared to Bastiat: \"Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake...You are a man for whom logic does not exist...You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything...You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity...Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero...Scientifically, Mr. Bastiat, you are a dead man\".<ref>Roche, Charles George. \"Frederic Bastiat: A Man Alone\". Arlington House, 1971, p. 153.</ref>\n\n==Views==\n{{Liberalism sidebar}}\n{{Libertarianism sidebar}}\nBastiat asserted that the sole purpose of government is to protect the right of an individual to life, liberty and property and why it is dangerous and morally wrong for government to interfere with an individual's other personal matters. From this, Bastiat concluded that the law cannot defend life, liberty and property if it promotes \"legal [or legalized] plunder\", which he defined as using government force and laws to take something from one individual and give it to others (as opposed to a transfer of property via mutually-agreed contracts without using fraud nor violent threats against the other party, which Bastiat considered a legitimate transfer of property).<ref name=\"TheLaw\"/>\n\nIn ''The Law'', Bastiat explains that if the privileged classes or socialists use the government for \"legalized plunder\", this will encourage the other socioeconomic class to also use \"legal plunder\" and that the correct response to both the socialists and the [[Corporatism|corporatists]] is to cease all \"legal plunder\". Bastiat also explains in ''The Law'' why his opinion is that the law cannot defend life, liberty and property if it promotes socialist policies. When used to obtain \"legalized plunder\" for any group, he says that the law is perverted against the only things (life, liberty and property) it is supposed to defend.<ref name=\"TheLaw\">Bastiat, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. ''The Law''. Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007.</ref>\n\nBastiat was also a strong supporter of [[free trade]]. He was inspired by and routinely corresponded with [[Richard Cobden]] and the English [[Anti-Corn Law League]] and worked with free-trade associations in France.<ref name=Great/>\n\nBecause of his stress on the role of consumer demand in initiating economic progress (a form of [[Supply and demand|demand-side]] economics), Bastiat has been described by [[Mark Thornton]], [[Thomas DiLorenzo]] and other economists as a forerunner of the [[Austrian School]]. In his ''Economic Harmonies'', Bastiat states: {{quote|We cannot doubt that self-interest is the mainspring of human nature. It must be clearly understood that this word is used here to designate a universal, incontestable fact, resulting from the nature of man, and not an adverse judgment, as would be the word selfishness.}}\n\nThornton posits that Bastiat through taking this position on the motivations of human action demonstrates a pronounced \"Austrian flavor\".<ref name=\"Thornton\">Thornton, Mark. \"[https://www.mises.org/journals/scholar/BastiatAustrian.pdf Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat as an Austrian Economist].\" ''Mises.org''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bastiat big.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]]\nOne of Bastiat's most important contributions to economics was his admonition to the effect that good economic decisions can be made only by taking into account the \"full picture\". That is, economic truths should be arrived at by observing not only the immediate consequences{{spaced ndash}}that is, benefits or liabilities{{spaced ndash}}of an economic decision, but also by examining the long-term second and third consequences. Additionally, one must examine the decision's effect not only on a single group of people (say candlemakers) or a single industry (say candlemaking), but on all people and all industries in the society as a whole. As Bastiat famously put it, an economist must take into account both \"What is Seen and What is Not Seen\". Bastiat's \"rule\" was later expounded and developed by [[Henry Hazlitt]] in his work ''[[Economics in One Lesson]],'' in which Hazlitt borrowed Bastiat's trenchant \"[[Parable of the broken window|Broken Window Fallacy]]\" and went on to demonstrate how it applies to a wide variety of economic falsehoods.\n\n===Negative railroad===\nA famous section of ''Economic Sophisms'' concerns the way that tariffs are inherently counterproductive. Bastiat posits a theoretical railway between Spain and France that is built in order to reduce the costs of trade between the two countries. This is achieved by making goods move to and from the two nations faster and more easily. Bastiat demonstrates that this situation benefits both countries' consumers because it reduces the cost of shipping goods and therefore reduces the price at market for those goods.\n\nHowever, each country's producers begin to criticize their governments because the other country's producers can now provide certain goods to the domestic market at reduced price. Domestic producers of these goods are afraid of being outcompeted by the newly viable industry from the other country, therefore these domestic producers demand that tariffs be enacted to artificially raise the cost of the foreign goods back to their pre-railroad levels so that they can continue to compete.\n\nBastiat makes two significant statements here:\n# Even if the producers in a society are benefited by these tariffs (which they are not, according to Bastiat), the consumers in that society are clearly hurt by the tariffs as they are now unable to secure the goods they want at the low price at which they should be able to secure them.\n# The tariffs completely negate any gains made by the railroad and therefore make it essentially pointless.\n\nTo further demonstrate his statements, Bastiat suggests\u2014in a classic ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''\u2014that rather than enacting tariffs, the government should simply destroy the railroad anywhere that foreign goods can outcompete local goods.

(For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)\"</ref><ref name=\"reproducibility\">For an actual falsification to occur, the basic statement must be  [[Reproducibility|reproducible]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66}}: \"We say that a theory is falsified only if we have accepted basic statements which contradict it (cf. section 11, rule 2). This condition is necessary, but not sufficient; for we have seen that non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words, we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis.\"</ref> For example, the claim \"all swans are white\" is falsifiable since it is contradicted by this basic statement: \"In 1697, during the [[Willem de Vlamingh|Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh]] expedition, there were black swans on the shore of the Swan River in Australia\", which in this case is a true observation.<ref>Back in those days it was assumed that everyone (in Europe) believed that swans had to be white {{harv|Life On Perth|2007}}, but this changed, because this basic statement is reproducible: swans can be seen at different times and locations.</ref><ref name=\"observation\">Popper put as an example of falsifiable statement with failed falsifications  Einstein's [[equivalence principle]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XX}}: \"Einstein's principle of proportionality of inert and (passively) heavy mass. This equivalence principle '''conflicts with many potential falsifiers: events whose observation is logically possible'''. Yet despite all attempts (the experiments by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, more recently refined by Rickle) to realize such a falsification experimentally, the experiments have so far corroborated the principle of equivalence.\"</ref> The concept is also known by the terms '''refutable''' and '''refutability'''.\n\nThe concept was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]].   He saw falsifiability as the logical part and the cornerstone of his scientific [[epistemology]], which sets the limits of scientific inquiry.  He proposed that statements and theories that are not falsifiable are [[unscientific]].  Declaring an unfalsifiable theory to be [[scientific method|scientific]] would then be [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe classical view of the [[philosophy of science]] is that it is the goal of science to prove [[hypotheses]] like \"All swans are white\" or to [[inductive reasoning|induce]] them from observational data. The [[Inductive reasoning|Inductivist]] methodology supposes that one can somehow move from a series of statements such as 'here is a white swan', 'over there is a white swan', and so on, to a universal statement such as 'all swans are white'. As observed by  [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and later by Popper and others, this method is clearly ''deductively'' invalid, since it is always possible that there may be a non-white swan that has eluded observation<ref>{{Harvnb|Popper|1959|p=4}} : \"Now it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we are justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white.\"</ref> (and, in fact, the discovery of the Australian [[black swan]] demonstrated the deductive invalidity of this particular statement). This is known as the [[problem of induction]].\n\nOne solution to the problem of induction, proposed by Immanuel Kant in [[Critique of Pure Reason]], is to consider as valid absolutely [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the conclusions that we would otherwise have drawn from these dubious inferential inductions.<ref>In {{harvnb|Kant|1787|loc=sec II, B4}}: \"If, therefore, a judgment is thought with strict universality, i.e., so that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely a priori.\"</ref> Following Kant, Popper accepted that we have to work with unproven hypotheses, but he refused that we have to justify them in any way<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=9}}: \"According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way\u2014an anticipation, a hypothesis, a theoretical system, or what you will\u2014conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction. These conclusions are then compared with one another and with other relevant statements, so as to find what logical relations (such as equivalence, derivability, compatiblity, or incompatibility) exist between them.\"</ref> and he wrote {{harv|Popper|1959|p=6}}: \"I do not think that his ingenious attempt to provide an a priori justification for synthetic statements was successful.\" However, if one finds one single swan that is not white, deductive logic admits the conclusion that the statement that all swans are white is false. Falsificationism thus strives for questioning, for falsification, of hypotheses instead of proving them or trying to view them as valid in any way.\n\nFor a statement to be questioned using observation, it needs to be at least theoretically possible that it can come into conflict with observation. A key observation of falsificationism is thus that a criterion of demarcation is needed to distinguish those statements that can come into conflict with observation and those that cannot, but the criterion itself concerns only the logical form of the theory: \n\n{{Quote|text=I shall require that [the] logical form [of the theory] shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}\n\nPopper always insisted on a clear distinction between the logic (of falsifiability) and its applied less precise methodology.<ref |group=notes>{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=Sec. 3}}: \"Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology.\"</ref><sup>,</sup><ref |group=notes>{{harvnb|Popper|1959|loc=section 23, 1er paragraphe}} : \"The requirement of falsifiability which was a little vague to start with has now been split into two parts. The first, the methodological postulate (cf. section 20), can hardly be made quite precise. The second, the logical criterion, is quite definite as soon as it is clear which statements are to be called \u2018basic\u2019.\"</ref> The required logical form, the criterion,  is that there must exist basic statements that contradict the theory (and also some that corroborate it because the theory must be consistent). This logical form informally implies the possibility of refutations by experience because, in its informal methodological context, a basic statement must be intersubjective and interpretable in terms of observations.\n\nObjections can be raised against falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation similar to those which can be raised against [[Formal verification|verifiability]].  For example, as pointed out by many{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} and reformulated by Colin McGinn, \n{{quote|text=[w]e have to be able to infer that if a falsifying result has been found in a given experiment it will be found in future experiments; ... this is clearly an inductive inference.|author=Colin McGinn|source={{harvnb|McGinn|2002|loc=sec. 3}}}}\n\nVery early, in anticipation of this specific objection Popper wrote,  \n{{Quote|text=This attack would not disturb me.  My proposal is based upon an ''asymmetry'' between verifiability and falsifiability; an asymmetry which results from the logical form of universal statements. For these are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}\n\nIn its simple form, the point here is that although a singular existential statement such as 'there is a white swan in Europe' cannot be used to affirm a universal statement, it can be used to show that one is false: the statement 'there is a non white swan in Australia' implies that the universal statement 'all swans are white' is false. Moreover, this singular existential statement is empirical: it is impractical to observe all the swans in the world to verify that they are all white, but one can observe one swan that is not white.  This shows the fundamental difference between verifiability and falsifiability. Also, in the logical form of the theory, there is no notion of future experiments, but only a (formal) class of basic statements that contradict it.<ref name=\"reproducibility\" /><ref name=\"empiricalisalogicalrequirement\"/>\n\nSuch a simple contradiction with a basic statement is not what Popper calls a falsification.<ref name=\"falsifiabilityVsfalsification\">{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66|loc=sec. 22}}: \"We must clearly distinguish between falsifiability and falsification. We have introduced falsifiability solely as a criterion for the empirical character of a system of statements. As to falsification, special rules must be introduced which will determine under what conditions a\nsystem is to be regarded as falsified.\"</ref> A falsification usually entails a derivation from a system of statements, which include the universal statement and initial conditions, to a singular statement, which is contradicted by a falsifying hypothesis,<ref name=\"reproducibility\"/><ref>{{harv|Popper|1959|p=55}}: \"We may distinguish, within a theoretical system, statements belonging to various levels of universality. The statements on the highest level of universality are the axioms; statements on the lower levels can be deduced from them. Higher level empirical statements have always the character of hypotheses relative to the lower level statements deducible from them: they can be falsified by the falsification of these less universal statements. ... The falsifying mode of inference here referred to\u2014the way in which the falsification of a conclusion entails the falsification of the system from which it is derived\u2014is the modus tollens of classical logic. It may be described as follows:  Let p be a conclusion of a system t of statements which may consist of theories and initial conditions ...\"</ref> but the argument can be generalized. Popper explains \n{{quote|text=\"... it is possible by means of purely deductive inferences (with the help of the modus tollens of classical logic) to argue from the truth of singular statements to the falsity of universal statements. Such an argument to the falsity of universal statements is the only strictly deductive kind of inference that proceeds, as it were, in the \u2018inductive direction\u2019; that is, from singular to universal statements.\"|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=19}}}}   Contemporary philosopher [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] mentions{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} that other similar objections have been anticipated and answered by Popper.{{sfn|Popper|1972|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\nThe falsifiability criterion does not imply that unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics are not parts of science.<ref>{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Popper, however, to assert that a theory is unscientific, is not necessarily to hold that it is unenlightening, still less that it is meaningless, for it sometimes happens that a theory which is unscientific (because it is unfalsifiable) at a given time may become falsifiable, and thus scientific, with the development of technology, or with the further articulation and refinement of the theory. Further, even purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function in the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of reality.\"</ref>  Contrary to intuition, unfalsifiable statements can be embedded in\u2014and [[logical consequence|deductively entailed]] by\u2014falsifiable theories. For example, while \"all men are mortal\" is unfalsifiable, it is a [[logical consequence]] of the falsifiable theory that \"all men die 150 years after their birth at the latest\".{{sfn|Keuth|2004|p=45}} Similarly, the ancient metaphysical and unfalsifiable idea of the existence of atoms has led to corresponding falsifiable modern theories. Popper invented the notion of [[metaphysical]] research programs to name such unfalsifiable ideas that guide the search for a new theory.{{sfn|Popper|1982|loc=Introductory comments}}\n\nThus falsificationism has two levels. At the logical level, scientists use deductive logic to attempt to falsify theories. At the non-logical level, they decide on some criteria, which use falsification and other factors, to pick which theories they will study, improve, replace, apply or (further) test. These other criteria may take into account a metaphysical research program. They are not considered in the formal falsifiability criterion, but they can give a meaning to this criterion. Needless to say, for Popper, these other criteria, the so called rules of the game, are necessary. Some philosophers consider them  as parts of Popper's demarcation criterion, but Popper viewed them only as a necessary context.\n\nIn contrast to [[Positivism]], which held that statements are meaningless if they cannot be verified or falsified, Popper claimed that falsifiability is merely a special case of the more general notion of [[critical rationalism]],<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=26}}: \"The proper answer to my question 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?' is, I believe, 'By criticizing the theories or guesses of others and--if we can train ourselves to do so--by criticizing our own theories or guesses.' (The latter point is highly desirable, but not indispensable; for if we fail to criticize our own theories, there may be others to do it for us.) This answer sums up a position which I propose to call 'critical rationalism'.\"</ref> even though he admitted that empirical refutation is one of the most effective methods by which theories can be criticized. Criticizability, in contrast to falsifiability, and thus rationality, may be comprehensive (i.e., have no logical limits), though this claim is controversial, even among proponents of Popper's philosophy and critical rationalism.\n\n==Definition==\nFor Popper (and others) in any scientific discussion we accept a background knowledge.<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=238}}: While discussing a problem we always accept (if only temporarily) all kinds of things as unproblematic: they constitute for the time being, and for the discussion of this particular problem, what I call our background knowledge.\"</ref> Such a background knowledge is thus implicit in the definition of falsifiability and corresponds to different types of statements, their relationship<ref name=\"twomeanings\">{{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XXII}}: \"We must distinguish two meanings of the expressions ''falsifiable'' and ''falsifiability'':<br />\n\"1) ''Falsifiable'' as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability.

(For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)\"</ref> and their interpretation in terms of observations and measurements.<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=84}}: \"... that is to say, basic statements must be testable, inter-subjectively, by \u2018observation\u2019. Since they are singular statements, this requirement can of course only refer to observers who are suitably placed in space and time (a point which I shall not elaborate).\"</ref>\n\n===Different types of statements===\nRecall that a theory is falsifiable if it is contradicted by a basic statement. It remains to define what kind of statements create theories and what are basic statements. [[Physical law|Scientific theories]]  are a particular kind of [[universal quantification|universal statements]].<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=37}}: \" The empirical sciences are systems of theories. The logic of scientific knowledge can therefore be described as a theory of theories.  Scientific theories are universal statements.\"</ref> Basic statements are particular kind of [[existential quantification|existential statements]].<ref name=\"basicstatements\">{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=83\u201384}}: \"A statement of the form \u2018There is a so-and-so in the region k\u2019 or \u2018Such-and-such an event is occurring in the region k\u2019 (cf. section 23) may be called a \u2018singular existential statement\u2019 or a \u2018singular there-is statement\u2019. And the statement which results from negating it, i.e. \u2018There is no so-and-so in the region k\u2019 or \u2018No event of such-and-such a kind is occurring in the region k\u2019, may be called a \u2018singular non-existence statement\u2019, or a \u2018singular there-is-not statement\u2019.  We may now lay down the following rule concerning basic statements: basic statements have the form of singular existential statements.\"</ref>  Not all universal statements are theories and not all existential statements are basic statements. Theories have the form of '''strictly''' universal statements.<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=48}}: \"The theories of natural science, and especially what we call natural laws, have the logical form of strictly universal statements; thus they can be expressed in the form of negations of strictly existential statements or, as we may say, in the form of non-existence statements (or \u2018there-is-not\u2019 statements). For example, the law of the conservation of energy can be expressed in the form: \u2018There is no perpetual motion machine\u2019, or the hypothesis of the electrical elementary charge in the form: \u2018There is no electrical charge other than a multiple of the electrical elementary charge\u2019.\"</ref> Basic statements have the form of [[wiktionary:singular existential statement|'''singular''' existential statements]].<ref name=\"basicstatements\" /> Thus we need to distinguish between  existential and universal statements and also between singular  and strict  statements.\n\nExistential and universal statements are built-in concepts in [[First-order logic|logic]]. The first are statements  such as \"there is a white swan\".  Logicians call these statements [[existential quantification|existential statements]], since they assert the existence of something.  They are equivalent to a first-order logic statement of the form: ''There exists an x such that x is a swan, and x is white.'' The second are statements that categorize all instances of something, such as \"all swans are white\". Logicians call these statements [[universal quantification|universal]]. They are usually parsed in the form: ''For all x, if x is a swan, then x is white''.\n\nUnlike existential and universal statements, singular and strict statements are not built-in concepts in logic, because they correspond to a specific perspective on our experience of the world.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=42}}  We can understand them in terms of the concepts of universal or individual names: {{quote |text=\"... \u2018dictator\u2019, \u2018planet\u2019, \u2018H2O\u2019 are universal concepts or universal names. \u2018Napoleon\u2019, \u2018the earth\u2019, \u2018the Atlantic\u2019 are singular or individual concepts or names. In these examples individual concepts or names appear to be characterized either by being proper names, or by having to be defined by means of proper names, whilst universal concepts or names can be defined without the use of proper names.\"|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=42\u201343}}}}\n\nA statement is strict or pure, if it does not use any individual name. So, a law of nature cannot refer to particular things. The sentence \"This apple is attracted by the planet earth\" is not a scientific statement. Popper wrote an entire section on strictly universal and strictly existential statements,{{sfn|Popper|1959|pp=47-50}} because he considers the distinction between universal and individual concepts\nor names to be of fundamental importance.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}}\n\nA statement is singular if it contains an individual name or the equivalent.<ref>This is Popper's definition. There is no well established definition of ''singular statement'', ''singular sentence'' or ''singular proposition''. For example,  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says that it is a sentence without variables, free or bound. This is also the definition adopted by Alfred Tarski in ''Introduction to logic and to the methodology of deductive sciences''. However, in the debate between Fregeans and Russellians in the philosophy of language, the definition is more restrictive: a singular sentence means a sentence with a single subject that respects a property such as \"Mont Blanc is more than 4000 meters high\" - see \"Singular Propositions and\nSingular Thoughts\" by Arthur Sullivan.</ref>   So, a basic statement must make reference to a specific thing or specific location and time. The sentence \"There exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, but the statement \"There is a black swan on the shore of the Swan River\" is a basic statement, it is a singular existential statement.\n\nPopper arrived at these conditions through an analysis of what one expects from basic statements.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=83}}  In addition, a basic statement must be inter-subjective.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=84}} So, \"John saw a  black swan on the shore of the Swan River\" is not a basic statement.<ref>Unless, of course, the theory is about people seeing black swans, in which case, we view John as a thing, just as the shore is a thing.</ref>\n\n===Methodological rules and falsifying hypotheses===\nFalsifiability is defined strictly in terms of the logical form of the theory,<ref name=\"twomeanings\" /> but this criterion of demarcation can not work without being complemented by methodological rules.<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=28\u201329}}: \"If therefore we characterize empirical science merely by the formal or logical structure of its statements, we shall not be able to exclude from it that prevalent form of metaphysics which results from elevating an obsolete scientific theory into an incontrovertible truth. Such are my reasons for proposing that empirical science should be characterized by its methods: by our manner of dealing with scientific systems: by what we do with them and what we do to them. Thus I shall try to establish the rules, or if you will the norms, by which the scientist is guided when he is engaged in research or in discovery, in the sense here understood.\"</ref> Thus, contemporary philosophers consider that Popper's demarcation criterion has two parts: the logical part (stated in terms of rules of inference - ways to logically infer new statements from existing statements) and the methodological part (stated in terms of rules that do not claim to prove anything).<ref>{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}}: \"Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology. The logic of his theory is utterly simple: if a single ferrous metal is unaffected by a magnetic field it cannot be the case that all ferrous metals are affected by magnetic fields. Logically speaking, a scientific law is conclusively falsifiable although it is not conclusively verifiable. Methodologically, however, the situation is much more complex: no observation is free from the possibility of error\u2014consequently we may question whether our experimental result was what it appeared to be.\"</ref>  The methodological rules define falsification. They should not be confused with the (logical) rules of inferences used to define falsifiability, which is about the logical form of the theory.<ref name=\"falsifiabilityVsfalsification\"/>\n\nIn this larger picture, the fact that a single basic statement can contradict a strictly universal statement, though true logically, is in itself useless, because it cannot lead to a falsification. To support falsification, Popper requires that a class of basic statements corroborate a falsifying hypothesis.<ref name=\"reproducibility\"/> A  basic statement corroborates the falsifying hypothesis, if it does not logically contradict it, but contradicts the theory to be falsified. Though it corresponds to the empirical notion of reproducible experiments, this requirement exists entirely at the formal level<ref name=\"empiricalisalogicalrequirement\">{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=66\u201367}}: \"The requirement that the falsifying hypothesis must be empirical, and so falsifiable, only means that it must stand in a certain logical relationship to possible basic statements; thus this requirement only concerns the logical form of the hypothesis.\"</ref> and must be complemented by methodological rules in a falsification process.\n\n==Na\u00efve falsification{{anchor|Na\u00efve|Na.C3.AFve}}==<!-- see [[Karl Popper]] -->\n\nNa\u00efve falsificationism is an unsuccessful attempt to prescribe a rationally unavoidable method for science. Sophisticated methodological falsification, on the other hand, is a prescription of a way in which scientists ought to behave as a matter of choice. The object of this is to arrive at an incremental process whereby theories become ''less bad''.{{Citation needed|reason=We don't even know what naive falsification means here|date=June 2018}}\n\nNa\u00efve falsification considers scientific statements individually. Scientific theories are formed from groups of these sorts of statements, and it is these groups that must be accepted or rejected by scientists. Scientific theories can always be defended by the addition of [[ad hoc hypothesis|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]].{{Citation needed|reason=The two previous sentences are not connected - what is the point?|date=June 2018}}  As Popper put it, a ''decision'' is required on the part of the scientist to accept or reject the statements that go to make up a theory or that might falsify it. At some point, the weight of the ''ad hoc'' hypotheses and disregarded falsifying observations will become so great that it becomes unreasonable to support the base theory any longer, and a decision will be made to reject it.{{Citation needed|reason=Where Popper says that|date=June 2018}}\n\nAlthough the logic of na\u00efve falsification is valid, it is rather limited. Nearly any statement can be made to fit the data, so long as one makes the requisite 'compensatory adjustments'. Popper drew attention to these limitations in ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' in response to criticism from [[Pierre Duhem]]. [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] expounded this argument in detail, calling it [[confirmation holism]]. To logically falsify a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]], one must find a true falsifying singular statement. But Popper pointed out that it is always possible to ''change'' the universal statement or the existential statement so that falsification does not occur.<ref>[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"</ref> On hearing that a black swan has been observed in Australia, one might introduce the ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis, 'all swans are white except those found in Australia'; or one might adopt another, more cynical view about some observers, 'Australian [[ornithology|bird watchers]] are incompetent'.\n\nThus, na\u00efve falsification ought to, but does not, supply a way of handling competing hypotheses for many subject controversies (for instance [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[urban legends]]). People arguing that there is no support for such an observation may argue that there is nothing to see, that all is normal, or that the differences or appearances are too small to be statistically significant.  On the other side are those who concede that an observation has occurred and that a universal statement has been falsified as a consequence.  Therefore, na\u00efve falsification does not enable scientists, who rely on [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria, to present a definitive falsification of universal statements.{{Citation needed|reason=Who says that|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Falsificationism==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn place of na\u00efve falsification, Popper envisioned science as progressing by the successive rejection of falsified theories, rather than falsified statements.  Falsified theories are to be replaced by theories that can account for the [[phenomena]] that falsified the prior theory, that is, with greater [[explanatory power]]. For example, [[Aristotle|Aristotelian mechanics]] explained observations of everyday situations, but were falsified by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s experiments, and were replaced by Newtonian mechanics, which accounted for the phenomena noted by Galileo (and others). [[Newtonian mechanics]]' reach included the observed motion of the planets and the mechanics of gases. The Youngian wave theory of light (i.e., waves carried by the [[luminiferous aether]]) replaced Newton's (and many of the Classical Greeks') particles of light but in turn was falsified by the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] and was superseded by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electrodynamics and Einstein's [[special relativity]], which did account for the newly observed phenomena. Furthermore, Newtonian mechanics applied to the atomic scale was replaced with [[quantum mechanics]], when the old theory could not provide an answer to the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], the [[Gibbs paradox]], or how [[Atomic orbital|electron orbits]] could exist without the particles radiating away their energy and spiraling towards the centre. Thus the new theory had to posit the existence of unintuitive concepts such as [[energy levels]], [[quantum|quanta]] and [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]].\n\nAt each stage, experimental observation made a theory untenable (i.e., falsified it) and a new theory was found that had greater ''explanatory power'' (i.e., could account for the previously unexplained phenomena), and as a result, ''provided greater opportunity for its own falsification''.\n\n==Criterion of demarcation==\nPopper uses falsification as a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]] to draw a sharp line between those theories that are scientific and those that are unscientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if for no other reason than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory, or come to see an unfalsifiable theory as unsupportable. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.\n\nThe Popperian criterion excludes from the domain of science not unfalsifiable ''statements'' but only ''whole theories'' that ''contain no'' falsifiable statements; thus it leaves us with the [[confirmation holism|Duhemian]] problem of what constitutes a 'whole theory' as well as the problem of what makes a statement 'meaningful'.  Popper's own falsificationism, thus, is not only an alternative to verificationism, it is also an acknowledgement of the conceptual distinction that previous theories had ignored.\n\n===Verificationism===\n{{Main|Verificationist}}\n{{See also|Abductive reasoning}}\n\nIn the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism (also known as the verifiability theory of meaning) holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be both meaningful and scientific.\nThis was an essential feature of the [[logical positivism]] of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] that included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], the Berlin philosopher [[Hans Reichenbach]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both. In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation.\n\nThus, Popper urged that verifiability be replaced with falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation. On the other hand, he strictly opposed the view that non-falsifiable statements are meaningless or otherwise inherently bad, and noted that falsificationism is only  concerned with meaningful statements.<ref>{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=18|loc=footnote 3}}: \"Falsifiability separates two kinds of perfectly meaningful statements: the falsifiable and the non-falsifiable. It draws a line inside meaningful language, not around it.\"</ref>\n\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases (see below). A survey of 303 federal judges<ref>Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N = 619). Only 303 usable surveys were\nobtained for a response rate of 51% (see {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}).</ref> conducted in 1998 (and fully reported in {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}) revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"\n\n==== The McLean v. Arkansas case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law; \n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law;  \n* It is testable against the empirical world; \n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and \n* It is falsifiable. \nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== The Daubert case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.<ref>The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.</ref>  These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Kaye is distinguished professor of law at [[Penn State Law]].</ref> argued that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that \"inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kaye|2005|p=2}}: \"... several courts have treated the abstract possibility of falsification as sufficient to satisfy this aspect of the screening of scientific evidence. This essay challenges these views. It first explains the distinct meanings of falsification and falsifiability. It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"</ref>\n\n==Unfalsifiable statistics/double evidence standards combo==\nThere are combinations of prediction types and methodologies that, while each component is compatible with falsifiability on its own, renders falsification impossible together. One example is the combination of statistical predictions in which individual exceptions do not falsify the theory with different evidence standards for different data points in which one type of data point only require ordinary evidence while another require extraordinary evidence. On one hand, the theory that there are no black swans is falsifiable even if there is a requirement of extraordinary evidence for a black swan, since it is not impossible for an individual observation of a black swan to eventually meet the requirement of extraordinary evidence. On the other hand, in a country where there are in reality the same number of black swans as white swans, the theory that there are more white swans than black swans at a population level with individual exceptions is falsifiable as long as the level of evidence required to record a white swan is the same as that for recording black swans. But if the theory is that white swans are more statistically common than black swans with exceptions and a higher level of evidence is required for recording a black swan than for recording a white swan, the difference in evidence standards will cause more white swans than black swans to be recorded even in a country where the ratio is in fact 50/50. This makes the combination of statistical prediction with exceptions and differences in evidence standards incompatible with falsifiability. This have been implicated in the [[replication crisis]], especially in [[psychology]] in which the two methodologies are more common than in other fields and therefore more often combine to prevent falsifiability even though the two factos are not unheard of on their own in other fields, as well as the problem being caused by active application of methodologies and therefore spreading the issues to other fields that psychology interacts with through interdisciplines such as [[evolutionary psychology]] spreading the problems to evolution research, and not allowing the other fields to help falsifiability in psychology as would have been possible had the problem been a passive lack of components for falsifiability.<ref>Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence | David Miller, 2015</ref><ref>A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories: Publication Bias and Psychological Science\u2019s Aversion to the Null | Christopher J.

That anyway is what is said at the beginning of the advertisement for a recent conference on induction at a celebrated seat of learning in the UK.  It shows how much critical rationalists still have to do to make known the message of ''Logik der Forschung'' concerning what empirical evidence is able to do and what it does.|author=[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]]|source=\"Some hard questions for critical rationalism\", 2011{{sfn|Miller|2014}}}}\n\n===Kuhn and Lakatos===\nWhereas Popper was concerned in the main with the ''logic'' of science, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' examined in detail the [[history of science]]. Kuhn argued that scientists work within a conceptual [[paradigm]] that strongly influences the way in which they see data. Scientists will go to great length to defend their paradigm against falsification, by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses to existing theories. Changing a 'paradigm' is difficult, as it requires an individual scientist to break with his or her peers and defend a heterodox theory.\n\nSome falsificationists saw Kuhn's work as a vindication, since it provided historical evidence that science progressed by rejecting inadequate theories, and that it is the ''decision'', on the part of the scientist, to accept or reject a theory that is the crucial element of falsificationism. Foremost amongst these was [[Imre Lakatos]].\n\nLakatos attempted to explain Kuhn's work by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific universal statements of na\u00efve falsification. In Lakatos' approach, a scientist works within a research program that corresponds roughly with Kuhn's 'paradigm'. Whereas Popper rejected the use of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses as unscientific, Lakatos accepted their place in the development of new theories.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978}}\n\n===Feyerabend===\n[[Paul Feyerabend]] examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method. Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticized falsifiability on the grounds that it does not accurately describe the way science really works. They argue that theories are used because of their successes, not because of the failures of other theories. Their discussion of Popper, falsifiability and the philosophy of science comes in a chapter entitled \"Intermezzo,\" which contains an attempt to make clear their own views of what constitutes truth, in contrast with the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.\n\nSokal and Bricmont write, \"When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher subjective probability. ... But Popper will have none of this: throughout his life he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of 'confirmation' of a theory, or even of its 'probability'. ... [but] the history of science teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of their successes.\" (Sokal and Bricmont 1997, 62f)\n\nThey further argue that falsifiability cannot distinguish between astrology and astronomy, as both make technical predictions that are sometimes incorrect.\n\n[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]], a contemporary philosopher of critical rationalism, has attempted to defend Popper against these claims.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Sokal and Bricmont: Back to the Frying Pan|journal=Pli|volume=9|year=2000|pages=156\u201373|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003401/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}, also chapter 6 of {{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Out of Error|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate}}</ref> Miller argues that astrology does not lay itself open to falsification, while astronomy does, and this is the litmus test for science.\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from falsifiable to unfalsifiable.<ref>{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"</ref>\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ]</ref><ref name=\"Mises_Action\">Ludwig von Mises.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"<ref name=\"popperc\">{{cite book\n|title=Research training for social scientists: a handbook for postgraduate researchers\n|first1=Dawn\n|last1=Burton\n|publisher=SAGE\n|year=2000\n|isbn=0-7619-6351-0\n|pages=12\u201313\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibePpZ-6lkgC&pg=PA12}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ibePpZ-6lkgC&pg=PA12 Chapter 1, p. 12]\n</ref> and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,<ref name=\"popperc\" />  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, \"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.</ref>\n\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|l2=Scientific method and mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|l3=Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's \"two senses\" theory|l4=Popper's \"two senses\" theory}}\n\n==Quotations==\n* Albert Einstein is reported to have said something that can be paraphrased into: No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.<ref>{{cite book | last = Calaprice | first = Alice | title = The New Quotable Einstein | publisher = Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem | year = 2005 | location = US | page = 291 | isbn = 0-691-12074-9 }}Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A.

On 15 July 1759, Frederick ordered the creation of a squadron of volunteer [[hussar]]s to be attached to the 1st Regiment of Hussars (von Kleist's Own). He entrusted the creation and command of this new unit to Colonel Friedrich Wilhelm von Kleist. This first squadron (80 men) was raised in [[Dresden]] and consisted mainly of Hungarian deserters. This squadron was placed under the command of Lieutenant Johann Michael von Kovacs. At the end of 1759, the first four squadrons of [[dragoon]]s (also called horse grenadiers) of the ''Freikorps'' were organised. They initially consisted of Prussian volunteers from [[Berlin]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Leipzig]], but later recruited deserters. The ''Freikorps'' were regarded as unreliable by regular armies, so they were mainly used as sentries and for minor duties.\n\nThese early ''Freikorps'' appeared during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and especially the Seven Years' War, when France, Prussia and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] embarked on an escalation of [[petty warfare]] while conserving their regular regiments. Even during the last [[Kabinettskriege|Kabinettskrieg]], the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]], ''Freikorp'' formations were formed in 1778. Germans, [[Hungarians]], [[Poles]], [[Lithuanians]] and [[South Slavs]], as well as [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Tatars]] and [[Cossacks]], were believed by all warring parties to be inherently good fighters. The nationality of many soldiers can no longer be ascertained as the ethnic origin was often described imprecisely in the regimental lists. Slavs (Croats, Serbs) were often referred to as \"Hungarians\" or just \"Croats\", and Muslim recruits ([[Albanians]], [[Bosnians]], Tatars) as \"Turks\".\n\nFor Prussia, the [[Pandur]]s, who were made up of Croats and Serbs, were a clear model for the organization of such \"free\" troops. Frederick the Great created 14 \"[[free infantry]]\" (''Frei-Infanterie'') units, mainly between 1756 and 1758, which were intended to be attractive to those soldiers who wanted military \"adventure\", but did not want to have to do military drill. A distinction should be made between the ''Freikorps'' formed up to 1759 for the final years of the war, which operated independently and disrupted the enemy with surprise attacks and the free infantry which consisted of various military branches (such as infantry, hussars, dragoons, ''j\u00e4ger'') and were used in combination. They were often used to ward off [[Maria Theresa]]'s Pandurs. In the era of [[linear tactics]], light troops had been seen necessary for outpost, reinforcement and reconnaissance duties. During the war, eight such volunteer corps were set up:\n\n* [[Friedrich Adolf Rudolf von Tr\u00fcmbach|Tr\u00fcmbach]]'s ''Freikorps'' (Voluntaires de Prusse) (FI)\n* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gottfried Arnd von Kleist|Kleist]]'s ''Freikorps'' (FII)\n* [[Joachim Reinhold von Glasenapp|Glasenapp]]'s Free Dragoons (F III)\n* Schony's ''Freikorps'' (F IV)\n* Gschray's ''Freikorps'' (F V)\n* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bauer|Bauer]]'s Free Hussars (F VI)\n* [[L\u00e9gion Britannique]] (FV - of the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]])\n* Volontaires Auxiliaires (F VI).<ref>Background, formation and numbering according to Bleckwenn (1986) Vol. IV, pp. 82ff</ref>\n\nBecause, with some exceptions, they were seen as undisciplined and less battleworthy, they were used for less onerous guard and [[garrison]] duties. In the so-called \"petty wars\", the ''Freikorps'' interdicted enemy supply lines with [[guerrilla warfare]]. In the case of capture, their members were at risk of being executed as irregular fighters. In Prussia the ''Freikorps'', which Frederick the Great had despised as \"vermin\", were disbanded. Their soldiers were given no entitlement to pensions or invalidity payments.\n\nIn France, many corps continued to exist until 1776. They were attached to regular dragoon regiments as ''j\u00e4ger'' [[squadron (army)|squadron]]s. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Austria recruited various ''Freikorps'' of [[Slavs|Slavic]] origin. The [[Slavonia|Slavonic]] Wurmser ''Freikorps'' fought in Alsace. The combat effectiveness of the six Viennese ''Freikorps'' (37,000 infantrymen and cavalrymen), however, was low. An exception were the border regiments of Croats and Serbs who served permanently on the Austro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] border.\n\n== Napoleonic era ==\n [[File:Kersting - Vorposten.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of three famous Free Corps members in 1815: [[Heinrich Hartmann]], [[Theodor K\u00f6rner (author)|Theodor K\u00f6rner]], and [[Friedrich Friesen]]]]\n''Freikorps'' in the modern sense emerged in Germany during the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They fought not so much for money but rather out of [[patriotism|patriotic]] motives, seeking to shake off the French [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. After the French under Emperor [[Napoleon]] had either conquered the German states or forced them to collaborate, remnants of the defeated armies continued to fight on in this fashion. Famous formations included the [[King's German Legion]], who had fought for Britain in French-occupied Spain and were mainly recruited from Hanoverians, the [[L\u00fctzow Free Corps]] and the [[Black Brunswickers]].\n\nThe ''Freikorps'' attracted many nationally disposed citizens and students. ''Freikorps'' commanders such as [[Ferdinand von Schill]], [[Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von L\u00fctzow]] or [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], known as the \"Black Duke\", led their own attacks on Napoleonic occupation forces in Germany. Those led by Schill were decimated in the [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)]]; many were killed in battle or executed at Napoleon's command in the aftermath. The ''Freikorps'' were very popular during the period of the [[German War of Liberation]] (1813\u201315), during which von L\u00fctzow, a survivor of Schill's ''Freikorps'', formed his L\u00fctzow Free Corps. The anti-Napoleonic ''Freikorps'' often operated behind French lines as a kind of commando or guerrilla force.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, these anti-Napoleonic ''Freikorps'' were greatly praised and glorified by German nationalists, and a heroic myth built up around their exploits. This myth was invoked, in considerably different circumstances, in the aftermath of Germany's defeat in [[World War I]].\n\n== 1815\u20131871 ==\n\nEven in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era, ''Freikorps'' were set up with varying degrees of success.\n\nDuring the March 1848 riots, student ''Freikorps'' were set up in Munich.\n\nIn [[First Schleswig War]] of 1848 the ''Freikorps'' of [[Ludwig Freiherr von und zu der Tann-Rathsamhausen|''von der Tann'']], [[Heinrich von Zastrow|''Zastrow'']] and others distinguished themselves.\n\nIn 1864 in [[Mexico]], the French formed the so-called ''Contreguerrillas'' under former Prussian hussar officer, Milson. In [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] formed his famous ''[[Freischar]]s'', notably the \"Thousand of Marsala\", which landed in [[Sicily]] in 1860.\n\nEven before the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870/71, ''Freikorps'' were developed in [[France]] that were known as [[franc-tireur]]s.\n\n== Post\u2013World War I ==\n\nThe meaning of the word ''Freikorps'' changed over time. After 1918, the term was used for the [[paramilitary]] organizations that sprang up around Germany as soldiers returned in defeat from [[World War I]]. They were the key [[Weimar paramilitary groups]] active during that time. Many German veterans felt disconnected from civilian life, and joined a ''Freikorps'' in search of stability within a [[military]] structure. Others, angry at their sudden, apparently inexplicable defeat, joined up in an effort to put down [[communist]] uprisings, such as the [[Spartacist uprising]], or exact some form of revenge on those they considered [[Stab-in-the-back myth|responsible for the armistice]]. They received considerable support from Minister of Defence [[Gustav Noske]], a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. Noske used them to crush the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]] and the [[Marxist]] [[Spartacist League]], including arresting [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who were killed on 15 January 1919. They were also used to defeat the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] in May 1919.<ref>{{cite book|title=The German Freikorps 1918\u201323: 1918\u201323|author=Carlos Caballero Jurado, Ramiro Bujeiro|year=2001|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-184-2}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 May 1919, members of ''Freikorps'' L\u00fctzow in [[Ramersdorf-Perlach|Perlach]] near [[Munich]], acted on a tip from a local cleric and arrested and killed twelve alleged communist workers (most of them actually members of the Social Democratic Party).

Numerous future members and leaders of the [[Nazi Party]] had served in the ''Freikorps'', including [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], future head of the [[Sturmabteilung]], or SA, [[Heinrich Himmler]], future head of the [[Schutzstaffel]], or SS, and [[Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]], the future ''Kommandant'' of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. [[Hermann Ehrhardt]], founder and leader of [[Marinebrigade Ehrhardt]], and his deputy Commander Eberhard Kautter, leaders of the [[Viking League]], refused to help Hitler and [[Erich Ludendorff]] in their [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and conspired against them.\n\nHitler eventually viewed some of them as threats. A huge ceremony was arranged on 9 November 1933 in which the ''Freikorps'' leaders symbolically presented their old battle flags to Hitler's SA and SS. It was a sign of allegiance to their new authority, the Nazi state.<ref>[[#Waite1969|Waite]], p.&nbsp;197.</ref> When Hitler's internal purge of the party, the [[Night of the Long Knives]], came in 1934, a large number of Freikorps leaders were targeted for killing or arrest, including Ehrhardt and R\u00f6hm.

They were tasked with attacking German troops guarding the [[Siegfried Line]]. Future [[Vichy_France|Vichy]] [[Collaborationism#France|collaborationist]], [[Anti-communism|Anti-Bolshevik]] and [[Waffen-SS|SS]] [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer|Major]] [[Joseph_Darnand#Vichy_collaborator|Joseph Darnand]] was one of the more famous participants in these [[commando]] actions. \n\nIn May of 1940, the experience of the Funny War era Corps Franc was an influence in creating the [[Groupes Franc Motoris\u00e9 de Cavalerie|Groupes Francs Motoris\u00e9 de Cavalerie (GFC)]] who played storied role in the delaying operations and last stands of the [[Battle of France]], notably in the defenses of [[Battle_of_France#Weygand_Plan|the Seine]] and [[Battle_of_Saumur_(1940)|the Loire]].\n\nOn November 25 1942, in the immediate aftermath of the [[Operation Torch|Allied Invasion of Vichy French North Africa]] the [[Corps Francs d'Afrique|Corps Francs d'Afrique (CFA)]](African Corps Franc) was stood up in [[French_protectorate_in_Morocco|French Morocco]] within the [[Free French Forces]] by [[Henri_Giraud|General Giraud]]. Giraud drew the members of the all-volunteer unit from [[Moroccans]] of diverse religious backgrounds (Christian, Jew, and Muslim) and gave them the title of ''[[V\u00e9lite (First French Empire)|V\u00e9lite]]'' a name inspired by the elite light infantry of [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] [[Imperial_Guard_(Napoleon_I)|Imperial Guard]] who were named after the [[Roman_army_of_the_mid-Republic|Roman]] [[Velites]]. Much of the Corps was drawn from [[Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Aboulker]]'s [[G\u00e9o Gras Group|G\u00e9o Gras]] [[French Resistance|French Resistance Group]] which had been responsible for the [[G\u00e9o_Gras_Group#November_8,_1942|Algiers Insurrection]] where the Resistance seized control of [[Algiers]] on the night of November 8 1942 in coordination with the [[Operation_Torch|Allied landings]] happening that same night. In taking over Algiers, they managed to capture both [[Fran\u00e7ois_Darlan|Admiral Darlan]] and [[Alphonse Juin|General Juin]] which led to the [[Fran\u00e7ois_Darlan#Darlan's_deal_in_North_Africa|Darlan Deal]] wherein [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces came over to the Allied side. [[Fran\u00e7ois_Darlan|Darlan]] was later assassinated by [[Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle]] an early member of the Corps Franc d'Afrique. They functioned as the [[Free French Forces|Free French]] equivalent to the [[British_Army|British]] [[Commandos_(United_Kingdom)|Commandos]]. \nThe Corps Francs d'Afrique went on to fight [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel's]] [[Afrikakorps]] in [[Tunisian_Campaign|Tunisia]] with the [[United States Army|U.S.]] [[United_States_Army_North#World_War_II|5th Army]]. They fought alongside the [[139th_(Sherwood_Foresters)_Brigade|British 139th Brigade]] at [[Battle of Kassarine Pass|Kassarine]] and [[Operation_Ochsenkopf|Sidi Nasr]] where they famously conducted a heroic bayonet charge, facing two to one odds, against the [[Military_history_of_Italy_during_World_War_II|Italian]] [[Bersaglieri|34th Battalion of the 10th Bersaglieri]] near the mountain of [[Sejnane|Kef Zilia]] on the road to [[Bizerte]], taking 380 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]], killing the Italian Battalion Commander, and capturing the plans for [[Operation Auslading]]. They participated in [[Tunisian_Campaign#Battle|the capture of]] [[Bizerte]] in [[May 1943]].\n\nFor its actions, the Corps Franc d'Afrique was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]]. \n\nThe CFA was formally dissolved on July 9 1943, with its members and equipment forming the corps of the newly created [[Groupe des Commandos d'Afrique|African Commando Group (GCA)]] on July 13 1943 in [[Damous|Dupleix]], [[French_Algeria|Algeria]], today seen as a forbear to the post war [[11e_r\u00e9giment_parachutiste_de_choc|Parachutist Shock Battalions]] and the modern day [[13th_Parachute_Dragoon_Regiment|13th RDP]].

Madero - 38\u00b0 Presidente de M\u00e9xico|website=presidentes.mx|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> He was an advocate for [[social justice]] and democracy. Madero was notable for challenging Mexican President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] for the presidency in 1910 and being instrumental in sparking the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nBorn into an extremely wealthy landowning family in northern Mexico, Madero was an unusual politician, who until he ran for president in the 1910 elections, had never held office. In his 1908 book entitled ''The Presidential Succession in 1910'', Madero called on voters to prevent the sixth reelection of Porfirio D\u00edaz, which Madero considered anti-democratic. His vision would lay the foundation for a democratic, 20th-century Mexico, but without polarizing the social classes. To that effect, he bankrolled the Anti-Reelectionist Party (later the [[Progressive Constitutionalist Party (Mexico)|Progressive Constitutional Party]]) and urged Mexicans to rise up against D\u00edaz, which ignited the Mexican Revolution in 1910.\n\nMadero's candidacy against D\u00edaz garnered widespread support in Mexico, since he was possessed of independent financial means, ideological determination, and the bravery to oppose D\u00edaz when it was dangerous to do so.<ref>Cumberland, Charles C. ''Mexican Revolution: Genesis Under Madero''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1952, p. 70.</ref> Arrested by the dictatorship shortly after being declared presidential candidate by his party, the opposition leader escaped from prison and launched the [[Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed]] from the United States, in this manner beginning the Mexican Revolution.\n\nFollowing the resignation of D\u00edaz from the presidency on 25 May 1911 after the signing of the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], Madero became the highest political leader of the country. Known as \"Maderistas\", Madero's followers referred to him as the \"caudillo de la Revoluci\u00f3n\" (leader of the Revolution). He was elected president on 15 October 1911 by almost 90% of the vote. Sworn into office on 6 November 1911, he became one of Mexico's youngest elected presidents, having just turned 38. Despite his considerable popularity amongst the people, Madero's administration soon encountered opposition both from more radical revolutionaries and from remnants of the former regime.\n\nIn February 1913, a military coup took place in the Mexican capital led by General [[Victoriano Huerta]], the military commander of the city, and supported by the United States ambassador. Madero was arrested and a short time later assassinated along with his Vice-President, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]], on 22 February 1913, following the series of events known as the [[Ten Tragic Days]] (la ''Decena Tr\u00e1gica''). The death of Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez led to a national and international outcry which eventually paved the way for the fall of the Huerta Dictatorship, the triumph of the Mexican Revolution and the establishment of the 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico]] under ''Maderista'' President [[Venustiano Carranza]].\n\n==Family and early years, 1873\u20131903==\nMadero was born in the [[hacienda]] of El Rosario, in [[Parras de la Fuente]], [[Coahuila]], the first son of Francisco Ignacio Madero Hern\u00e1ndez and Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o, and the first grandson of family patriarch, Evaristo Madero, governor of Coahuila. He was sickly as a child, and was small in stature as an adult.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, pp. 245\u201346.</ref> It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ygnacio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/acces/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=264:revolucion--francisco-i-madero-con-qiq-de-ignacio-por-alejandro-rosas&catid=3:revolucion&Itemid=13|title=Revoluci\u00f3n / Francisco I. Madero: con \"I\" de Ignacio, por Alejandro Rosas|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.bicentenario.gob.mx|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> \n\nHis family has been described as one of the five wealthiest families in Mexico. His grandfather, Evaristo Madero, started as a founder of a regional carting business, but he took advantage of economic opportunity and transported cotton from Texas during the [[U.S. Civil War]]. Having built a diversified fortune, but before his real success, he first married Rafaela Hern\u00e1ndez Lombra\u00f1a, half-sister of the powerful miner and banker Antonio V. Hern\u00e1ndez. Alongside his brother in law, and other of his new political family's relations, he founded the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Industrial de Parras'', initially involved in vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, [[guayule]] rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. For many years, the family prospered during [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]'s regime, and by 1910 the family was one of richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15&nbsp;million U.S. dollars<ref>Ross, Stanley R. ''Francisco I. Madero, Apostle of Democracy''. New York: Columbia University Press 1955, 3.</ref> of the day, and almost $500 million U.S. dollars in today's money). After widowing from his first wife, and having built his success, he remarried to do\u00f1a Manuela de Far\u00edas Benavides, member of one of northern Mexico's most aristocratic families, daughter of don Juan Francisco de Far\u00edas, mayor of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]. Evaristo Madero also served as governor of Coahuila from 1880 to 1884,<ref>Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 4.</ref> during the four-year [[interregnum]] of Porfirio D\u00edaz's rule, but was permanently sidelined from political office when D\u00edaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and served until 1911. From both his wives, Evaristo Madero produced a total of 18 children, 14 of which would survive until adulthood, and whose descendants make up some of Mexico's most influential families until this day. Thus, young Francisco was a member of a huge and powerful northern Mexican family with long-standing issues with the D\u00edaz regime.{{fact|date=April 2017}}\n\nFrancisco and his brother [[Gustavo A. Madero]] attended the [[Jesuit]] college in [[Saltillo]], but his early Catholic education had little lasting impact. Instead, his father's subscription to the magazine ''Revue Spirite'' awakened in the young Madero an interest in [[Spiritism]], an offshoot of [[Spiritualism]]. As a young man, Madero's father sent him to the [[HEC Paris|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris]] (HEC). During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a [[Mediumship|medium]]. He then attended high school at [[Culver Academies]]. Following business school, Madero traveled to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study agricultural techniques and to improve his English. During his time there, he was influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophist]] ideas of [[Annie Besant]], which were prominent at nearby [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn 1893, the 20-year-old Madero returned to Mexico and assumed management of the Madero family's [[hacienda]] at [[San Pedro, Coahuila]]. Well traveled and well educated, he was now in robust health.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\"/> He installed new irrigation, introduced American cotton, and built a soap factory and also an ice factory. He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself [[homeopathy]] and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Ra\u00fal, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation. Madero became a vegetarian and stopped drinking alcohol and smoking.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 248.</ref>\n[[File:Mr and Mrs Francisco Indalecio Madero cph.3b47072.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco I.

Madero believed that, as a [[mediumship|medium]], he was in contact with the [[spirit]] of Benito Ju\u00e1rez.]]\nOn 2 April 1903, [[Bernardo Reyes]], governor of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], violently crushed a political demonstration, an example of the increasingly authoritarian policies of president [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the [[spirit]] of his late brother Ra\u00fal, he decided to act.<ref>Madero had another brother, also named Ra\u00fal, who survived to adulthood and participated in the Mexican Revolution. Ross, ''Madero'', p. 15.</ref> The spirit of Ra\u00fal told him, \"Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism.\"<ref>quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 248, and 820, footnote 10 who cites a Madero manuscript in a private collection.</ref> Madero founded the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of [[Arjuna]] (a prince from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'').<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 249.</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the government of Porfirio D\u00edaz. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (''El Dem\u00f3crata'') and a satirical periodical (''El Mosco'', \"The Fly\"). Madero's preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio D\u00edaz in the 1905 governmental elections. D\u00edaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco's father be asked to control his increasingly political son.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\"/>\n\n===Leader of the Anti-Re-election Movement, 1908\u20131909===\n[[File:Creelman04.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Photo of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (1830\u20131915) that accompanied the [[James Creelman|Creelman]] interview in ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' (1908).]]\nIn an interview with journalist [[James Creelman]] published in 17 February 1908 issue of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', President D\u00edaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.\n\nMadero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Ju\u00e1rez himself.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 251\u2013253.</ref> This book, published in late 1908, was titled ''La sucesi\u00f3n presidencial en 1910'' (''The Presidential Succession of 1910''). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man \u2013 Porfirio D\u00edaz \u2013 for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio D\u00edaz's political slogan had been \"No Re-election\". Madero acknowledged that Porfirio D\u00edaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico.  However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the [[Yaqui people]], the repression of workers in [[Cananea]], excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]]. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan ''Sufragio efectivo, no reelecci\u00f3n'' (\"Valid Voting, No Re-election\").  Porfirio D\u00edaz could either run in a free election or retire.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 252\u2013253.</ref>\n\nMadero's book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero ''[[the Apostle of Democracy]]''. Madero sold off much of his property \u2013 often at a considerable loss \u2013 in order to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in [[Mexico City]] in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical ''[[El Antirreeleccionista]]'', which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and another intellectual, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 253\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 253.</ref> In Puebla, [[Aquiles Serd\u00e1n]], from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize particularly among working class Mexicans for the 1910 elections.<ref>LaFrance, David G. \"Aquiles Serd\u00e1n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1341.

In a show of U.S. support, D\u00edaz and [[William Howard Taft]] planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico.<ref name=\"Harris2009\">{{cite book |last1=Harris|first1=Charles H.

Only the candidate and the president were present for the meeting, so the only account of it is Madero's own in correspondence. A political solution and compromise might have been possible, with Madero withdrawing his candidacy.<ref name=\"Ross, p. 100\">Ross, ''Francisco I.

Nevertheless, it will be necessary to start a revolution to overthrow him. But who will crush it afterwards?\"<ref>quoted in Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 100.</ref> Madero was worried that Porfirio D\u00edaz would not willingly relinquish office, warned his supporters of the possibility of electoral fraud and proclaimed that \"Force shall be met by force!\"<ref>quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 254.</ref>\n\n===Beginning of the Mexican Revolution, 1910\u20131911===\n[[File:Francisco I Madero campaigning.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Francisco I.

Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez]] took over the nomination, but during Madero's time in jail, a fraudulent election was held that gave D\u00edaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.\n\nMadero's father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 7 October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. He was then smuggled across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S. border]], hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers.\n\nMadero set up shop in [[San Antonio]], Texas, and quickly issued his [[Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed]], which had been written during his time in prison, partly with the help of [[Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Velarde]]. The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6&nbsp;pm on 20 November 1910, against the \"illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of D\u00edaz\". At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners.\n\nThe family drew on resources to make regime change possible, with Madero's brother [[Gustavo A.

However, his uncle showed up late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Ra\u00fal (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nIn February 1911, Madero entered Chihuahua and led 130 men in an attack on [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]]. Madero was reported wounded in the fighting (although this was later denied)<ref>Los Angeles Herald, Volume 33, Number 56, 26 November 1910</ref> but was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general [[M\u00e1ximo Castillo]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=M\u00e1ximo Castillo and the Mexican Revolution|last=Castillo|first=M\u00e1ximo|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0807163887|editor-last=Vald\u00e9s|editor-first=Jes\u00fas Vargas|location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana|pages=154|translator-last=Aliaga-Buchenau|translator-first=Ana-Isabel}}</ref> He spent the next several months as the head of the Mexican Revolution. Madero successfully imported arms from the United States, with the American government under [[William Howard Taft]] doing little to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries.  By April the Revolution had spread to eighteen [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|states]], including [[Morelos]] where the leader was [[Emiliano Zapata]].\n[[File:Corrido de Madero.png|thumb|right|150px|''[[Corrido]]'' [[sheet music]] celebrating the entry of Francisco Madero into [[Mexico City]] in 1911.]]\n\nOn 1 April 1911, Porfirio D\u00edaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President D\u00edaz and Vice-President [[Ram\u00f3n Corral]]. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders&nbsp;\u2013 they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with D\u00edaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco Villa]] disagreed and went ahead with an attack on [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively and on 21 May 1911, the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] was signed.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, D\u00edaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with D\u00edaz's [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], taking over as interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections.\n\nThis first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with D\u00edaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered [[Mexico City]] in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting \"''\u00a1Viva Madero!''\"\n\n===Interim Presidency of Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra, May\u2013November 1911===\nAlthough Madero had forced Porfirio D\u00edaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, he pursued a moderate policy, leaving Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra, one of D\u00edaz's supporters, as president. He also left in place the [[Congress of Mexico]], which was full of candidates whom D\u00edaz had handpicked for the 1910 election.\n[[File:Francisco Leon de la Barra.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]] (1863\u20131939), whose interim presidency in 1911 gave Madero's enemies time to organize.]]\nMadero now called for the disbanding of all revolutionary forces, arguing that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the D\u00edaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at [[Cuernavaca]] and [[Cuautla, Morelos]]. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed would be carried out when Madero became president.\n\nHowever, in Madero's absence, several landowners from Zapata's state of [[Morelos]] had appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata's irregulars, calling Zapata the \"[[Attila]] of the South\". De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under [[Victoriano Huerta]] to suppress Zapata's revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta's troops were advancing on [[Yautepec de Zaragoza]]. Zapata's suspicions proved accurate as Huerta's Federals moved violently into Yautepec de Zaragoza. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta's actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata's demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. However, he promised the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.\n\nBefore becoming president, Madero published another book, this one under the pseudonym of [[Bhima]] (one of Arjuna's brothers in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'') called a ''Spiritualist Manual''.\n\n===Madero as president of Mexico, November 1911 \u2013 February 1913===\n[[File:El presidente Francisco I. Madero y su estado mayor presidencial (c. 1911), de Agust\u00edn V\u00edctor Casasola.tif|thumbnail|right|Madero and his presidential military staff, 1911]]\n[[File:Bernardo Reyes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bernardo Reyes]] (1850\u20131913), whose brutality as [[Governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] in 1903 resulted in Madero's politicization, and who launched a rebellion against Madero in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] in December 1911.]]\nMadero became president in November 1911, and, intending to reconcile the nation, appointed a cabinet which included many of Porfirio D\u00edaz's supporters. However, Madero was unable to achieve the reconciliation he desired since conservative Porfirians had managed to get themselves organized during the interim presidency of Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra and now mounted a sustained and effective opposition to Madero's reform program. Conservative Porfirians in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero's allies denounced him for being overly reconciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms: thus, on 25 November 1911, [[Emiliano Zapata]] issued his [[Plan of Ayala]], denouncing Madero for being uninterested in pursuing land reform.\n\nAfter years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found [[freedom of the press]] to criticize Madero's performance as president harshly. [[Gustavo A. Madero]], the president's brother, remarked that \"the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle.\"  Francisco Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship.\n\nThe press was particularly critical of Madero's handling of three rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president:\n\n(1) In December 1911, [[Bernardo Reyes]] (the popular general whom Porfirio D\u00edaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because D\u00edaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency) launched a rebellion in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], where he had previously served as governor. Reyes' rebellion lasted only eleven days before Reyes surrendered at [[Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco prison in [[Mexico City]].\n[[File:V Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Victoriano Huerta]] (1850\u20131916), general who defeated the [[Liberation Army of the South]] in 1911 and [[Pascual Orozco]] in 1912. Huerta quarreled with Madero over the insubordination of [[Pancho Villa]] and ultimately turned against Madero during the ''[[Decena tr\u00e1gica]]''.]]\n\n(2) In March 1912, Madero's former general [[Pascual Orozco]], who was personally resentful of how Madero had treated him, launched a rebellion in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] with the financial backing of [[Luis Terrazas]], a former [[Governor of Chihuahua]] who was the largest landowner in Mexico. Madero despatched troops under General Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Salas to put down the rebellion, but they were initially defeated by Orozco's troops.  General Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Salas committed suicide and [[Victoriano Huerta]] assumed control of the federalist forces.  Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco's troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.\n[[File:F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz.JPG|thumb|right|120px|[[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]] (1868\u20131945), nephew of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], who launched a rebellion against Madero in 1912.  F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would later conspire with [[Victoriano Huerta]] during the ''[[Decena tr\u00e1gica]]''.]]\nRelations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when [[Pancho Villa]], the commander of the ''[[Divisi\u00f3n del Norte]]'', refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912.<ref>Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', Henselstone Verlag LLC, 2012, p. 212</ref> Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.\n\n(3) In October 1912, [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]] (nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz) launched a rebellion in [[Veracruz]], \"to reclaim the honor of the army trampled by Madero.\" This rebellion was quickly crushed and F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz was imprisoned. Madero was prepared to have F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz executed, but the [[Supreme Court of Mexico]] declared that F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would be imprisoned, but not executed.\n\nBesides managing rebellions, Madero did have a number of accomplishments during his presidency:\n\n# He created the Department of Labor; introduced regulation of the labor practices in the textile industry; and oversaw the creation of the ''Casa del Obrero Mundial'' (\"House of the World Worker\"), an organization with [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] connections, that would play a major role in the subsequent Mexican labor movement.\n# Although not as radical as the Zapatistas would have liked, Madero did introduce some agrarian reforms, such as a reorganization of rural credit and the creation of agricultural stations.\n# He launched an infrastructure program, building schools, railroads, and new highways.\n# He introduced new taxation on foreign oil companies.\n# He launched a modest programme of school lunches for the poor.<ref>''The Course of Mexican History'' by Michael C. Meyer and William L. Sherman</ref>\n\n===Overthrow of Madero===\n[[File:Ciudadela.png|thumb|250px|left|Citizens throng around The Citadel (''La ciudadela'') building during ''La decena tragica'' in 1913.]]\n{{Main|La decena tr\u00e1gica}}\n\nIn early 1913, [[Victoriano Huerta]], the commander of the armed forces conspired with [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]] (Porfirio D\u00edaz's nephew), [[Bernardo Reyes]], and [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|US Ambassador]] [[Henry Lane Wilson]] against Madero, which culminated in a ten-day siege of La Ciudadela known as ''[[La decena tragica]]'' (the Tragic Ten Days). Madero accepted Huerta's \"protection\" from the D\u00edaz/Reyes forces, only to be betrayed by Huerta and arrested. Madero's brother and advisor [[Gustavo A. Madero]] was kidnapped off the street, tortured, and killed. Following Huerta's coup d'\u00e9tat on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, [[Pedro Lascur\u00e1in]] was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.\n\n==Death==\nFollowing his enforced resignation, Madero and his Vice-President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]] were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15&nbsp;pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Su\u00e1rez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Captain Francisco C\u00e1rdenas, an officer of the [[rurales]]. The journalists on foot were outdistanced by the motor vehicles, which were driven towards the penitentiary. The correspondent for the ''New York World'' was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Su\u00e1rez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Captain C\u00e1rdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire.<ref>Aitken, Ronald. ''Revolution! Mexico 1910\u201320'', pp. 142\u2013143, 586 03669 5</ref> This account was treated with general disbelief, although the American ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]], a strong supporter of Huerta, reported to Washington that, \"I am disposed to accept the (Huerta) government's version of the affair and consider it a closed incident\".\n\nPresident Madero, dead at 39, was buried quietly in the French cemetery of Mexico City. A series of contemporary photographs taken by Manuel Ramos show Maderos's coffin being carried from the penitentiary and placed on a special funeral tram car for transportation to the cemetery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.smu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/mex/id/138/rec/38|title=President Madero's coffin being placed in funeral car, Mexico City :: Mexico - Photographs, Manuscripts, and Imprints|website=digitalcollections.smu.edu|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> Only his close family were permitted to attend, leaving for Cuba immediately after. Ambassador Wilson was later dismissed from his position after US president Woodrow Wilson took office.

He answers to, and receives guidance from, the [[President of Afghanistan]], [[Ashraf Ghani]].\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has close and friendly relations with a number of countries around the world, including: [[Afghan\u2013Turkish relations|Turkey]], [[Afghanistan \u2013 United States relations|United States]], [[Afghanistan\u2013United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], [[Afghanistan\u2013Japan relations|Japan]], [[Afghanistan-Germany relations|Germany]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]], [[Italy]], [[Afghanistan\u2013India relations|India]], [[Afghanistan\u2013People's Republic of China relations|China]], [[Afghanistan\u2013Canada relations|Canada]], [[Afghanistan\u2013United Arab Emirates relations|United Arab Emirates]] and many others.\n\n==Overview==\n1980s [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet war]], Afghanistan pursued a policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]] and nonalignment rein its foreign relations, being one of a few independent nations to stay neutral in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In international forums, Afghanistan generally followed the voting patterns of Asian and African non-aligned countries. During the 1950s and 1960s, Afghanistan was able to use the [[Soviet Union|Russian]] and American need for allies during the [[Cold War]] as a way to receive economic assistance from both countries. However, given that unlike Russia, America refused to give extensive military aid to the country, the government of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Daoud Khan]] developed warmer ties with the [[USSR]] while officially remaining non-aligned. Following the [[Saur Revolution|coup of April 1978]], the government under [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] developed significantly closer ties with the Soviet Union and its communist [[satellite state|satellite]]s.\n\nAfter the December 1979 Soviet invasion, Afghanistan's foreign policy mirrored that of the Soviet Union. Afghan foreign policymakers attempted, with little success, to increase their regime's low standing in the noncommunist world. With the signing of the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]], President [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] unsuccessfully sought to end the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]'s isolation within the Islamic world and in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nMost [[Western countries]], including the United States, maintained small diplomatic missions in the capital city of [[Kabul]] during the Soviet occupation. Many countries subsequently closed their missions due to instability and heavy fighting in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.\n\nMany countries initially welcomed the introduction of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban regime]], who they saw as a stabilizing, law-enforcing alternative to the [[warlord]]s who had ruled the country since the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992. The Taliban soon became alienated of those countries' positive feelings with knowledge of the harsh [[Sharia]] law being enforced in Taliban-controlled territories spreading around the world. The brutality towards women who attempted to work, learn, or leave the house without a male escort caused outside aid to the war-torn country to be limited.\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Enduring Freedom|October 2001 American invasion]] and the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|new government]] under the leadership of [[Hamid Karzai]] started to re-establish diplomatic relationships with many countries who had held close diplomatic relations before the communist coup d'\u00e9tat and the subsequent civil war.\n\nThe Afghan government is focused on securing continued assistance for rebuilding the economy, infrastructure, and [[military of Afghanistan|military]] of the country. It has continued to maintain close ties with North America, the [[European Union]], South Korea, Japan, Australia, India, China, Russia and the [[Greater Middle East]] as well as African nations. It also seeks to establish relations with more [[South American]] or Latin nations. In late 2011, relations between Afghanistan and Dominican Republic were established.\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n===Africa===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Egypt}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Afghanistan has an embassy in [[Cairo]].\n* Egypt has an embassy in [[Kabul]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|South Africa}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Afghanistan does not have an accreditation to South Africa.\n* South Africa is accredited to Afghanistan from its embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan.\n|}\n\n===Americas===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Argentina}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Afghanistan is accredited to Argentina from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.\n* Argentina is accredited to Afghanistan from its embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan.<ref>[http://epaki.cancilleria.gov.ar/es/content/embajada-argentina-en-islamabad Embassy of Argentina in Pakistan]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Brazil}}||<!--Date started-->1952||\n\n* Afghanistan is accredited to Brazil from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.\n* Brazil is accredited to Afghanistan from its embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Canada}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Afghanistan\u2013Canada relations]]\n[[File:William Crosbie speaking in May 2011.jpg|thumb|Canadian Ambassador William Crosbie makes remarks during the opening of the refurbished Turquoise Mountain Foundation in Kabul on 9 May 2011.]]\nThe [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the U.S. prompted Canada to re-evaluate its policies toward Afghanistan.

Louis Goethe Dreyfus, who previously served as Minister Plenipotentiary, became the [[United States Ambassador to Afghanistan|U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan]] from 1949 to 1951.<ref name=\"USembassy\"/> The first official Afghanistan Ambassador to the United States was [[Habibullah Khan Tarzi]] who served from 1948 to 1953.\n\nSince the 1950s the U.S. extended an economic assistance program focused on the development of Afghanistan's physical infrastructure which included roads, dams, and power plants. Later, U.S. aid shifted from infrastructure projects to technical assistance programs to help develop the skills needed to build a modern economy. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] visited Kabul in December 1959, becoming the first U.S. President to travel to Afghanistan. The [[Peace Corps]] was active in Afghanistan between 1962 and 1979. During the early 1960s King of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah, visited the United States and met with [[John F. Kennedy]].\n[[File:Embassy of Afghanistan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington, D.C.]]]]\n\nAfter the April 1978 coup, relations deteriorated. In February 1979, U.S. Ambassador [[Adolph Dubs|Adolph \"Spike\" Dubs]] was murdered in Kabul after security forces burst in on his kidnappers. The U.S. then reduced bilateral assistance and terminated a small military training program. All remaining assistance agreements were ended after the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].\n\nFollowing the Soviet invasion, the United States supported diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawal. In addition, generous U.S. contributions to the refugee program in Pakistan played a major part in efforts to assist Afghans in need. U.S. efforts also included helping Afghans living inside Afghanistan. This cross-border [[humanitarian assistance]] program aimed at increasing Afghan self-sufficiency and helping Afghans resist Soviet attempts to drive civilians out of the rebel-dominated countryside. During the period of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the U.S. provided about $3 billion in military and economic assistance to the Afghan [[Mujahideen]]s.\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]], the United States launched an attack on the [[Taliban]] government as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

For decades, Russia and Britain struggled for influence in Afghanistan, strategically positioned between their two empires, in what became known as \"[[The Great Game]]\".  Following the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the new Soviet Union established more cordial relations with Afghanistan, and in 1919 became the first country to recognise Afghan sovereignty.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nRelations between the two nations became complicated following the 1978 communist coup known as the [[Saur Revolution]].  The new communist [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] was highly dependent on the Soviet Union, and the Soviet support for the widely disliked communist regime, and the ensuing [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], led to a great hatred for the Soviets in much of the Afghan population.  The Soviets occupied Afghanistan in the face of a bitter ten-year insurgency before withdrawing in 1989.  Even following the withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Soviet Union provided massive support to the embattled DRA government, reaching a value of $3 billion a year in 1990.  However, this relationship dissolved in 1991 along with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] itself.  On 13 September 1991, the Soviet government, now dominated by Boris Yeltsin, agreed with the United States on a mutual cut off of military aid to both sides in the Afghan civil war beginning on 1 January 1992.  The post-coup Soviet government then attempted to develop political relations with the Afghan resistance. In mid-November it invited a delegation of the resistance's Afghanistan Interim Government (AIG) to Moscow where the Soviets agreed that a transitional government should prepare Afghanistan for national elections. The Soviets did not insist that Najibullah or his colleagues participate in the transitional process. Having been cut adrift both materially and politically, Najibullah's faction torn government began to fall apart, and the city of Kabul fell to the Mujahideen factions in April 1992.\n\nIn 2009, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] announced that he wanted to be more involved in Afghanistan, supporting development of infrastructure and the army. This came as relations between Afghan President Karzai and American President Obama reached a low.\n* Afghanistan has an embassy in [[Moscow]].\n* Russia has an embassy in Kabul and a consulate-general in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Spain}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Afghanistan has an embassy in [[Madrid]].\n* Spain has an embassy in Kabul.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Sweden}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Afghanistan has an embassy in [[Stockholm]].\n* Sweden has an embassy in Kabul.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United Kingdom}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Afghanistan\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n\n{{further|The Great Game|First Anglo-Afghan War|Second Anglo-Afghan War|Third Anglo-Afghan War|Fourth Anglo-Afghan War}}\n\nBritish interest involves the protection of India, especially from Russia\u2014a contest called [[The Great Game]] in the late 19th century.  A series of [[Anglo-Afghan wars]] between 1839 and 1919 have historically shaped the backdrop for relations between Afghanistan and the United Kingdom.  After nearly a century of Anglo-Indian influence in Afghanistan, the state was declared independent in 1919.  The United Kingdom did not contribute nor actively oppose the communist led [[Saur Revolution]], it opposed the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and had no involvement in the series of civil wars that followed the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.<ref>Edgar O'Ballance, ''Afghan wars 1839-1992: what Britain gave up and the Soviet Union lost'' (Brassey's, 1993).</ref>\n* Afghanistan has an embassy in [[London]].\n* United Kingdom has an embassy in Kabul.\n|}\n\n===Oceania===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Australia}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Afghanistan has an embassy in [[Canberra]].\n* Australia has an embassy in Kabul.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|New Zealand}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Afghanistan is accredited to New Zealand from its embassy in Canberra, Australia.\n* New Zealand is accredited to Afghanistan from its embassy in Tehran, Iran.\n|}\n\n==United Nations==\nDuring the Soviet occupation, the United Nations was highly critical of the U.S.S.R.'s interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and was instrumental in obtaining a negotiated Soviet withdrawal under the terms of the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the Accords and subsequent Soviet withdrawal, the United Nations has assisted in the repatriation of refugees and has provided humanitarian aid such as health care, educational programs, and food and has supported [[demining|mine-clearing]] operations. The [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] and associated agencies have undertaken a limited number of development projects. However, the UN reduced its role in Afghanistan in 1992 in the wake of fierce factional strife in and around Kabul. The [[UN Secretary General]] has designated a personal representative to head the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) and the Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), both based in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan. Throughout the late 1990s, 2000, and 2001, the UN unsuccessfully strived to promote a peaceful settlement between the Afghan factions as well as provide humanitarian aid, this despite increasing Taliban restrictions upon UN personnel and agencies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Afghanistan]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Afghanistan]]\n* [[Visa requirements for Afghan citizens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook}}\n* {{StateDept}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adamec, Ludwig W.

In addition, upon conviction of a felony in a court of law, a person is known as a '''convicted felon''' or a '''convict'''. In the [[United States]], where the felony/misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor. The actual prison sentence handed out has no effect on the classification, which is based on the ''maximum'' sentence possible under law.<ref>{{usc|18|3559}}</ref> Individual states may differ in that definition by using other categories, such as seriousness or context.\n\nSimilar to felonies in some [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries (such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]) are ''[[delict]]s'', but in others (such as [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Switzerland]]), ''crimes'' are more serious and ''delicts'' (or d\u00e9lits) are less serious. In still others (such as [[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]]), ''crimes'' and ''delicts'' are synonymous (more serious) and are opposed to [[contravention]]s (less serious).\n\n== Overview ==\n=== Classification by subject matter ===\nFelonies include but are not limited to the following:\n* [[Murder]]\n* Aggravated [[assault]] or [[Battery (crime)|battery]]\n* [[Manslaughter]] (unintentional killing of another)\n* [[Animal cruelty]]\n* [[Vehicular homicide]]\n* [[Larceny]]\n* [[Arson]]\n* [[Burglary]]\n* [[Tax evasion]]\n* Various forms of [[fraud]]\n* [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act|Computer Crime Fraud and Abuse]] (computer hacking)\n* The [[Illegal drug trade|manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute]] of certain types or quantities of illegal drugs\n* In some states, the simple possession (possession without intent to distribute, ''e.g.'', for [[Drug abuse|personal use]]) of certain types of illegal drugs, usually in more than a certain quantity but regardless of quantity for some drugs in some jurisdictions (such as [[Virginia]] for [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]])\n* [[Grand larceny]] or [[grand theft]], ''i.e.'', [[larceny]] or [[theft]] above a certain statutorily established value or quantity of goods\n* [[Vandalism]] on federal property.\n* [[Treason]]\n* [[Rape]]/[[sexual assault]]\n* [[Kidnapping]]\n* [[Obstruction of justice]]\n* [[Perjury]]\n* [[Check fraud]]\n* [[Copyright infringement]]<ref>Legislative History \u2013 Copyright Felony Act. H.R. REP. NO. 997.</ref>\n* [[Child pornography]]\n* [[Mail and wire fraud]]\n* [[Forgery]]\n* [[Threatening the government officials of the United States|Threatening an official]] (police officer, judge)\n* [[Extortion]]\n* [[Blackmail]]\n\nBroadly, felonies can be characterized as either violent or nonviolent:\n* Violent offenses usually contain some element of force or a threat of force against a person. Some jurisdictions classify as violent certain property crimes involving a strong likelihood of [[psychological trauma]] to the property owner; for example, Virginia treats both common-law [[burglary]] (the [[breaking and entering]] of a dwelling house at night with the intent to commit larceny, assault and battery, or any felony therein) and statutory burglary (breaking and entering with [[Specific intent|further criminal intent]] but without the dwelling-house or time elements, such that the definition applies to break-ins at any time and of businesses as well as of dwelling houses) as felonies.\n\nSome offenses, though similar in nature, may be felonies or misdemeanors depending on the circumstances. For example, the illegal manufacture, distribution or possession of controlled substances may be a felony, although possession of small amounts may be only a [[misdemeanor]]. Possession of a deadly weapon may be generally legal, but carrying the same weapon into a restricted area such as a school may be viewed as a serious offense, regardless of whether there is intent to use the weapon. Additionally, [[driving while intoxicated]] in some states may be a misdemeanor if a first offense, but a felony on subsequent offenses.\n\n:\"The [[common law]] divided participants in a felony into four basic categories: (1) first-degree principals, those who actually committed the crime in question; (2) second-degree principals, aiders and [[abettor]]s present at the scene of the crime; (3) [[Accessory (legal term)|accessories]] before the fact, aiders and abettors who helped the principal before the basic criminal event took place; and (4) accessories after the fact, persons who helped the principal after the basic criminal event took place. In the course of the 20th century, however, American jurisdictions eliminated the distinction among the first three categories.\" ''Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez'', {{ussc|source=j|549|183|2007|pin=}} (citations omitted).\n\n=== Classification by seriousness ===\nA felony may be punishable with imprisonment for two or more years or [[capital punishment|death]] in the case of the most serious felonies, such as [[murder]]. Indeed, at [[common law]] when the British and American legal systems divorced in 1776, felonies were crimes punishable by either [[capital punishment|death]] or [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of [[property]]. All felonies remain a [[High crime|serious crime]], but concerns of [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] (i.e., that the punishment fit the crime) have in modern times prompted legislatures to require or permit the imposition of less serious punishments, ranging from lesser terms of [[imprisonment]] to the substitution of a [[jail]] sentence or even the [[Suspended sentence|suspension]] of all incarceration contingent upon a defendant's successful completion of [[probation]].<ref>''Doing Justice \u2013 The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220</ref><ref>''Criminology'', Larry J.

Lynch and Mona J. E. Danner, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k82650582x366612/]</ref> to quantitatively estimate and compare the effects of a crime upon its specific victims or upon society generally.\n\nIn some states, all or most felonies are placed into one of various classes according to their seriousness and their potential punishment upon conviction. The number of classifications and the corresponding crimes vary by state and are determined by the legislature. Usually, the legislature also determines the maximum punishment allowable for each felony class; doing so avoids the necessity of defining specific sentences for every possible crime. For example:\n* Virginia classifies most felonies by number,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/000/cod/18.2-10.HTM|title=\u00a7 18.2-10. Punishment for conviction of felony; penalty.|website=Leg1.state.va.us|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref> ranging from Class 6 (least severe: 1 to 5 years in prison or up to 12 months in jail) through Class 2 (20 years to life, ''e.g.'', first-degree murder and aggravated malicious [[wounding]]) up to Class 1 ([[life imprisonment]] or the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], reserved for certain types of murders). Some felonies remain outside the classification system.\n* New York State classifies felonies by letter, with some classes divided into sub-classes by Roman numeral; classes range from Class E (encompassing the least severe felonies) through Classes D, C, B, and A\u2013II up to Class A\u2013I (encompassing the most severe).\n* Massachusetts classifies felony as an offense that carries any prison time.\n* Ohio classifies felonies by degree ranging from first, second, third, fourth, to fifth degree. First-degree felonies are the most serious category, while fifth-degree felonies are the least serious. This is broadly the approach taken by the [[Model Penal Code]], although the Code identifies only three degrees of felony.<ref>MPC \u00a7 6.01</ref>\n\n==England and Wales==\n===History===\n[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] wrote that felony \"comprises every species of crime, which occasioned at common law the forfeiture of lands or goods.\"<ref>Blackstone, W. (1765). ''[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-407.htm Commentaries on the Laws of England]'' (Book IV chapter 7) Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]].</ref> The word ''felony'' was feudal in origin, denoting the value of a man's entire property: \"...the consideration for which a man gives up his fief.\"<ref name=\"Blackstone\">Blackstone.</ref> Blackstone refutes the misconception that felony simply means an offense punishable by death, by demonstrating that not every felony is capital, and not every [[Capital punishment|capital offense]] is a felony. However he concedes that \"the idea of felony is indeed so generally connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it hard to separate them; and to this usage the interpretations of the law do now conform.\"<ref>Blackstone, W. (1765). ''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/blackstone/william/comment/book4.7.html Commentaries on the Laws of England]'' (Book IV, Chapter 7).</ref>\n\nThe death penalty for felony could be avoided by pleading [[benefit of clergy]], which gradually evolved to exempt everybody (whether clergy or not) from that punishment for a first offense, except for [[high treason]] and offenses expressly excluded by statute. During the 19th century criminal law reform incrementally reduced the number of capital offenses to five ''(see [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom]])'', and forfeiture for felony was abolished by the [[Forfeiture Act 1870]]. Consequently, the distinction between felony and misdemeanor became increasingly arbitrary. The surviving differences consisted of different rules of evidence and procedure, and the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] recommended that felonies be abolished altogether. This was done by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], which made all felonies (except treason) misdemeanours, and introduced a new system of classifying crimes as either \"arrestable\" and \"non-arrestable\" offenses (according to which a general power of arrest was available for crimes punishable by five years' imprisonment or more).\n\nArrestable offenses were abolished in 2006,<ref>[[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].</ref> and today crimes are classified as [[Indictable offence|indictable]] or [[Summary offence|summary]] offenses.\n\n===Procedure===\n\nThe [[Trials for Felony Act 1836]] (6 & 7 Will 4 c 114) allowed persons indicted for felonies to be represented by counsel or attorney.\n\n===Terminology===\n\nA person prosecuted for felony was called a [[Prisoner#English law|prisoner]].<ref>[[Owen Hood Phillips|O.

This was followed by creating its own wheeled transport litter in 1875 (the St John Ambulance), and in 1877 established the St John Ambulance Association (the forerunner of modern-day [[St John Ambulance]]) \"to train men and women for the benefit of the sick and wounded\".<ref>Fletcher NC.

The first classes were conducted in the hall of the Presbyterian school in Woolwich (near Woolwich barracks where Shepherd was based) using a comprehensive first aid curriculum.\n\nFirst aid training began to spread through the [[British Empire]] through organisations such as St John, often starting, as in the UK, with high risk activities such as ports and railways.<ref>[http://www.sja.org.uk/history/victorian_britain.asp Industrial Revolution: St. John Ambulance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220111208/http://www.sja.org.uk/history/victorian_britain.asp |date=2007-02-20 }}, retrieved December 10, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Aims==\nThe key aims of first aid can be summarized in three key points, sometimes known as 'the three Ps':<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidents and first aid|publisher=NHS Direct|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=450|accessdate=2008-10-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080503201513/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=450 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-03}}</ref>\n* '''Preserve life''': The overriding aim of all medical care which includes first aid, is to save lives and minimize the threat of death.\n* '''Prevent further harm''': Prevent further harm also sometimes called '''prevent the condition from worsening''', or '''danger of further injury''', this covers both external factors, such as moving a patient away from any cause of harm, and applying first aid techniques to prevent worsening of the condition, such as applying pressure to stop a bleed becoming dangerous.\n* '''Promote recovery''': First aid also involves trying to start the recovery process from the illness or injury, and in some cases might involve completing a treatment, such as in the case of applying a plaster to a small wound.\n\n==Key skills==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\n[[File:Tongue blocking airway.svg|right|thumb|300px|In case of tongue fallen backwards, blocking the airway, it is necessary to hyperextend the head and pull up the chin, so that the tongue lifts and clears the airway.]]\n\nCertain skills are considered essential to the provision of first aid and are taught ubiquitously. Particularly the \"[[ABC (medicine)|ABC]]\"s of first aid, which focus on critical life-saving intervention, must be rendered before treatment of less serious injuries. <!-- Before editing this section to change circulation to Compressions, please read the article at ABC (medicine) -->ABC stands for ''Airway'', ''Breathing'', and ''Circulation''.<!-- Before editing this section to change Circulation to Compressions, please read the article at ABC (medicine) --> The same [[mnemonic]] is used by all [[emergency medicine|emergency health professionals]]. Attention must first be brought to the [[airway]] to [[basic airway management|ensure it is clear]]. [[airway obstructions|Obstruction]] ([[choking]]) is a life-threatening emergency. Following evaluation of the airway, a first aid attendant would determine adequacy of [[breath]]ing and provide [[rescue breathing]] if necessary. Assessment of [[Circulatory system|circulation]] is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but [[pulse]] checks may be done on less serious patients.\n\nSome organizations add a fourth step of \"D\" for ''[[Bleeding|Deadly bleeding]]'' or ''[[Defibrillation]]'', while others consider this as part of the ''Circulation'' step. Variations on techniques to evaluate and maintain the ABCs depend on the skill level of the first aider.  Once the ABCs are secured, first aiders can begin additional treatments, as required. Some organizations teach the same order of priority using the \"3Bs\": ''Breathing'', ''Bleeding'', and ''Bones'' (or \"4Bs\": ''Breathing'', ''Bleeding'', ''Burns'', and ''Bones''). While the ABCs and 3Bs are taught to be performed sequentially, certain conditions may require the consideration of two steps simultaneously. This includes the provision of both [[artificial respiration]] and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|chest compressions]] to someone who is not breathing and has no pulse, and the consideration of [[cervical spine]] injuries when ensuring an open airway.\n\n=== Preserving life ===\nTo save a person's life, you need to have an open airway so it makes a clear passage where air can go through the [[mouth]] or [[human nose|nose]] through the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] and down into the lungs, without obstruction. [[Conscious]] people will maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a [[Glasgow coma scale|GCS]] of less than 8) may be unable to maintain a patent airway, as the part of the brain which automatically controls breathing in normal situations may not be functioning.\n\nIf the patient was breathing, a first aider would normally then place them in the [[recovery position]], with the patient leant over on their side, which also has the effect of clearing the tongue from the [[pharynx]]. It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents.\n\nThe airway can also become blocked through a foreign object becoming lodged in the pharynx or larynx, commonly called [[choking]]. The first aider will be taught to deal with this through a combination of \u2018back slaps\u2019 and \u2018[[abdominal thrusts]]\u2019.\n\nOnce the airway has been opened, the first aider would assess to see if the patient is breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally, such as [[agonal breathing]], the first aider would undertake what is probably the most recognized first aid procedure\u2014CPR, which involves breathing for the patient, and manually massaging the heart to promote blood flow around the body.\n\nThe first aider is also likely to be trained in dealing with injuries such as [[wounds|cuts]], [[Abrasion (medical)|grazes]] or [[bone fracture]]. They may be able to deal with the situation in its entirety (a small adhesive bandage on a paper cut), or may be required to maintain the condition of something like a broken bone, until the next stage of definitive care (usually an [[ambulance]]) arrives.\n==Training==\n[[File:Suicide-prague.jpg|thumb|First aid scenario training in progress]]\n\nBasic principles, such as knowing to use an adhesive bandage or applying direct pressure on a bleed, are often acquired passively through life experiences. However, to provide effective, life-saving first aid interventions requires instruction and practical training. This is especially true where it relates to potentially fatal illnesses and injuries, such as those that require CPR; these procedures may be invasive, and carry a risk of further injury to the patient and the provider. As with any training, it is more useful if it occurs ''before'' an actual [[emergency]], and in many countries, emergency ambulance dispatchers may give basic first aid instructions over the phone while the ambulance is on the way.\n\nTraining is generally provided by attending a course, typically leading to certification. Due to regular changes in procedures and protocols, based on updated clinical knowledge, and to maintain skill, attendance at regular refresher courses or re-certification is often necessary. First aid training is often available through community organizations such as the [[Red Cross]] and [[St. John Ambulance]], or through commercial providers, who will train people for a fee. This commercial training is most common for training of employees to perform first aid in their workplace. Many community organizations also provide a commercial service, which complements their community programmes.\n\n===Specific disciplines===\nThere are several types of first aid (and first aider) which require specific additional training. These are usually undertaken to fulfill the demands of the work or activity undertaken.\n* '''Aquatic/Marine first aid''' is usually practiced by professionals such as [[lifeguards]], professional [[mariner]]s or in [[diver rescue]], and covers the specific problems which may be faced after water-based rescue or delayed [[MedEvac]].\n* '''[[Battlefield medicine|Battlefield first aid]]''' takes into account the specific needs of treating wounded [[combatants]] and [[non-combatants]] during [[armed conflict]].\n* '''[[Hyperbaric medicine|Hyperbaric]] first aid''' may be practiced by [[Scuba diving|SCUBA diving]] professionals, who need to treat conditions such as [[decompression sickness|the bends]].\n* '''[[Oxygen therapy|Oxygen]] first aid''' is the providing of oxygen to casualties who suffer from conditions resulting in [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].\n* '''[[Wilderness first aid]]''' is the provision of first aid under conditions where the arrival of emergency responders or the evacuation of an injured person may be delayed due to constraints of terrain, weather, and available persons or equipment. It may be necessary to care for an injured person for several hours or days.\n* '''[[Mental health first aid]]''' is taught independently of physical first aid.  How to support someone experiencing a mental health problem or in a crisis situation.  Also how to identify  the first signs of someone developing mental ill health and guide people towards appropriate help.\n\n==First aid services==\n[[File:First aider in parade.jpg|First aider of the [[British Red Cross]] accompanies parade of morris dancers at the [[Knutsford]] Royal May Day 2012|thumb]]\n\nSome people undertake specific training in order to provide first aid at public or private events, during filming, or other places where people gather.  They may be designated as a '''first aider''', or use some other title.  This role may be undertaken on a voluntary basis, with organisations such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance, or as paid employment with a medical contractor\n\nPeople performing a first aid role, whether in a professional or voluntary capacity, are often expected to have a high level of first aid training and are often uniformed.\n\n==Symbols==\n{{details|Emblems of the Red Cross#Use of the emblems}}\nAlthough commonly associated with first aid, the symbol of a red cross is an official protective symbol of the [[Red Cross]]. According to the [[Geneva Conventions]] and other international laws, the use of this and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Protection symbols vs. organizational emblems|similar symbols]] is reserved for official agencies of the '''[[International Red Cross and Red Crescent]]''', and as a protective emblem for medical personnel and facilities in combat situations. Use by any other person or organization is illegal, and may lead to prosecution.\n\nThe internationally accepted symbol for first aid is the white cross on a green background shown below.\n\nSome organizations may make use of the [[Star of Life]], although this is usually reserved for use by ambulance services, or may use symbols such as the [[Maltese Cross]], like the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] and [[St John Ambulance]]. Other symbols may also be used.\n<gallery>\nFile:ISO 7010 E003 - First aid sign.svg| ISO First Aid Symbol\nFile:St. Andrews First Aid.png| St. Andrew's First Aid Badge\nFile:Flag of the Red Cross.svg| Emblem of the Red Cross\nFile:Maltese-Cross-Heraldry.svg| Maltese or Amalfi Cross\nFile:Star of life2.svg| Star of life\nFile:CivilDefence.svg| Civil defence\n</gallery>\n\n==Conditions that often require first aid==\n''Also see [[medical emergency]].''\n* [[Altitude sickness]], which can begin in susceptible people at altitudes as low as 5,000 feet, can cause potentially fatal [[High altitude cerebral edema|swelling of the brain]] or [[High altitude pulmonary edema|lungs]].<ref name=MedicalProblems>{{cite journal |author1=Cymerman, A |author2=Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments.

The etymology of ''feodum'' is complex with multiple theories, some suggesting a Germanic origin (the most widely held view) and others suggesting an [[Arabic]] origin. Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a ''beneficium'' (Latin).<ref name=lubetski>Meir Lubetski (ed.).

''Feudalism'', 1961, pg. 106.</ref> Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term ''*fehu-\u00f4d'', in which ''*fehu'' means \"cattle\" and ''-\u00f4d'' means \"goods\", implying \"a moveable object of value.\"<ref name=bloch-ety1/><ref name=bloch-ety2/> Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with moveable objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as ''feos'', a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word ''feos'' meaning movable property changed little by little to ''feus'' meaning the exact opposite: landed property.<ref name=bloch-ety1/><ref name=bloch-ety2/>\n\nAnother theory was put forward by [[Archibald R. Lewis]].<ref name=lubetski/> Lewis said the origin of 'fief' is not ''feudum'' (or ''feodum''), but rather ''foderum'', the earliest attested use being in [[Astronomus]]'s ''[[Vita Hludovici]]'' (840).<ref name=arlewis>[[Archibald R. Lewis]]. ''The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050'', 1965, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> In that text is a passage about [[Louis the Pious]] that says ''annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant'', which can be translated as \"Louis forbade that military [[provender]] (which they popularly call \"fodder\") be furnished..\"<ref name=lubetski/>\n\nAnother theory by [[Alauddin Samarrai]] suggests an Arabic origin, from ''fuy\u016b'' (the plural of ''fay'', which literally means \"the returned\", and was used especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight').<ref name=lubetski/><ref name=samarrai>[[Alauddin Samarrai]]. \"The term 'fief': A possible Arabic origin\", ''Studies in Medieval Culture'', 4.1 (1973), pp. 78\u201382.</ref> Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include ''feo'', ''feu'', ''feuz'', ''feuum'' and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a [[loanword]]. The first use of these terms is in [[Languedoc]], one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Muslim Spain. Further, the earliest use of ''feuum'' (as a replacement for ''beneficium'') can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at [[Fraxinetum]] ([[La Garde-Freinet]]) in [[Provence]] was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the Arabic word ''fuy\u016b'' (the plural of ''fay''), which was being used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms \u2013 ''feo, feu, feuz, feuum'' and others \u2013 from which eventually ''feudum'' derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically \"fanciful roots\" in order to claim the most outlandish things to be of Arabian or Muslim origin.<ref name=samarrai/>\n\n==History==\n{{English Feudalism}}\n\nFeudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the [[decentralization]] of an empire: especially in the [[Carolingian]] empires, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure{{clarify|date=September 2012}} necessary to support cavalry without the ability to allocate land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.<ref name=\"Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332\">Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. pp. 332\u2013343</ref>\n\nThese acquired powers significantly [[federation|diminished unitary power]] in these empires. Only when the infrastructure existed to maintain unitary power\u2014as with the European monarchies\u2014did feudalism begin to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappear.<ref name=\"Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332\"/>\n\n===Classic feudalism===\n:''See also [[Feudalism in England]], [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Examples of feudalism]]''\nThe classic [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Ganshof]] version of feudalism<ref name=ebo/><ref name=ganshof/> describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s. A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of  service to the lord. There were many varieties of [[feudal land tenure]], consisting of  military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.<ref name=ganshof/>\n\n===Vassalage===\n[[File:Hommage du comt\u00e9 de Clermont-en-Beauvaisis.png|thumbnail|[[Homage (feudal)|Homage]] of [[Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]]]]\nBefore a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a [[commendation ceremony]],  which was composed of the two-part act of [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] and oath of [[fealty]]. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. ''Fealty'' comes from the Latin ''fidelitas'' and denotes the [[fidelity]] owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. \"Fealty\" also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage. Such an oath follows homage.<ref name=stephenson>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism ''Medieval Feudalism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209083705/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism |date=2012-02-09 }}, by [[Carl Stephenson (historian)|Carl Stephenson]]. Cornell University Press, 1942. Classic introduction to Feudalism.</ref>\n\nOnce the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was to \"aid\", or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal was responsible to answer calls to military service on behalf of the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed [[court baron]], or at the king's court.<ref>Encyc. Brit. op.cit. It was a standard part of the feudal contract (fief [land], fealty [oath of allegiance], faith [belief in God]) that every tenant was under an obligation to attend his overlord's court to advise and support him; [[Sir Harris Nicolas]], in ''Historic Peerage of England'', ed. [[William Courthope (officer of arms)|Courthope]], p.18, quoted by Encyc. Brit, op.cit., p. 388: \"It was the principle of the feudal system that every tenant should attend the court of his immediate superior\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|France in the late 15th century: a mosaic of feudal territories]]\nIt could also involve the vassal providing \"counsel\", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the [[manor]] this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied; see [[examples of feudalism]].\n\n===The \"Feudal Revolution\" in France===\nIn its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of \"politics of land\" (an expression used by the historian [[Marc Bloch]]).  The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a \"feudal revolution\" or \"mutation\" and a \"fragmentation of powers\" (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or Germany in the same period or later:<ref>Chris Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 522-3.</ref> Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as [[castellan]]s and lesser seigneurs took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, most importantly the highly profitable rights of justice, but also travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations to use the lord's mill, etc.<ref name=\"auto1\">Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 518.</ref> (what [[Georges Duby]] called collectively the \"''seigneurie banale''\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>).  Power in this period became more personal.<ref>Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p.522.</ref>\n\nThis \"fragmentation of powers\" was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later.<ref>Wickham, p.523.</ref>  Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords.  In response to this, the idea of a \"[[liege lord]]\" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.<ref>Elizabeth M. Hallam. ''Capetian France 987\u20131328'', p.17.</ref>\n\n===End of European feudalism (1500\u20131850s)===\n{{Further|Abolition of feudalism in France}}\n\nFeudalism effectively ended by about 1500.<ref>\"The End of Feudalism\" in J.H.M. Salmon, ''Society in Crisis: France in the Sixteenth Century'' (1979) pp 19\u201326</ref> This was partly since the military shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters thus reducing the nobility's claim on power, but also because the [[Black Death]] reduced the nobility's hold over the lower classes. Vestiges of the Feudal system hung on in France until the French Revolution, and the system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. Russia finally abolished [[serfdom]] in 1861.<ref>John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Age of Napoleon'' (1996) pp 12\u201313</ref><ref>Jerzy Topolski, Continuity and discontinuity in the development of the feudal system in Eastern Europe (Xth to XVIIth centuries)\" ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1981) 10#2 pp: 373\u2013400.</ref>\n\nEven when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] explains how at an early stage of the [[French Revolution]], on just one night of August 4, 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, \"The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.\" Lefebvre explains:\n\n{{quote|Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude \u2014 which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office, conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices.... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Georges|title=The French Revolution: Vol. 1, from Its Origins To 1793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-JDOw8v5QC&pg=PA130|year=1962|publisher=Columbia U.P,|page=130}}</ref>}}\n\nOriginally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a fourth of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners.<ref>Robert Forster, \"The survival of the nobility during the French Revolution.\" ''Past and Present'' (1967): 71\u201386 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650023 in JSTOR].</ref> The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.<ref>Paul R.

Tr. L.A. Manyon. Two volume. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961 {{ISBN|0-226-05979-0}}</ref> offers a wider definition than Ganshof's and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the [[peasant]]ry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the \"powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes\" came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classical feudal hierarchy.\n\n==Historiography==\nThe idea of ''feudalism'' was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Medieval Period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.\n\n===Evolution of the concept===\nThe concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] ''De L'Esprit des Lois'' (1748; published in English as ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''), and [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]]\u2019s ''Histoire des anciens Parlements de France'' (1737; published in English as ''An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom'', 1739).<ref name=cheyette/> In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', or French monarchy. This was [[the Age of Enlightenment]] when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the \"Dark Ages\" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain.<ref name=bartlett>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Robert Bartlett]]. \"Perspectives on the Medieval World\" in ''Medieval Panorama'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}</ref> For them \"feudalism\" meant [[Fiefdom|seigneurial]] privileges and prerogatives. When the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|French Constituent Assembly]] abolished the \"feudal regime\" in August 1789 this is what was meant.\n\n[[Adam Smith]] used the term \"feudal system\" to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by [[serf]]s to landowning nobles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/Feudal.htm |title=Feudalism |author=Richard Abels |date= |work= |publisher=usna.edu |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Karl Marx===\n[[Karl Marx]] also used the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society's economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal [[mode of production]]) as the order coming before [[capitalism]]. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the [[aristocracy]]) in their control of arable land, leading to a [[class society]] based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under [[serfdom]] and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents.<ref name=daileader/> Marx thus defined feudalism primarily by its economic characteristics.\n\nHe also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: \u2018in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny \u2014 under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs\u2019.<ref>Peter Singer, ''Marx: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) [first published 1980], p. 91.</ref> Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. [[Eric Wolf]]) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with Imperial Chinese and pre-Columbian Incan societies as 'tributary'.\n\n===Later studies===\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[John Horace Round]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions as to the character of English society before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (Holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).\n\nIn the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian [[Marc Bloch]], arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian.,<ref name=daileader/> approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in ''Feudal Society'' (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection \u2013 both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centered on \"lordship\", and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.<ref name=daileader/>\n\nIn contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Ganshof]] defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in ''Qu'est-ce que la f\u00e9odalit\u00e9?'' (\"What is feudalism?\", 1944; translated in English as ''Feudalism''). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars,<ref name=daileader>[[Philip Daileader]], \"Feudalism\", ''The High Middle Ages'', Course No. 869, [[The Teaching Company]], {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}</ref> though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.\n\nAlthough he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and [[Lucien Febvre]] that came to be known as the [[Annales School]], [[Georges Duby]] was an exponent of the ''Annaliste'' tradition. In  a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled ''La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aux XIe et XIIe si\u00e8cles dans la r\u00e9gion m\u00e2connaise'' (''Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the [[M\u00e2connais]] region''), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian [[Cluny Abbey|monastery of Cluny]], as well as the dioceses of [[Ancient Diocese of M\u00e2con|M\u00e2con]] and [[Dijon]], Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the [[M\u00e2connais]] region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutions\u2014particularly comital courts established under the [[Carolingian]] monarchy\u2014that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.\n\n===Challenges to the feudal model===\nIn 1974, U.S. historian [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]<ref name=ebrown>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.2307/1869563\n| volume = 79\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 1063\u201388\n| last = Brown\n| first = Elizabeth A.

Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of ''feudalism'', she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back \"tyrannically\" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely.<ref name=daileader/> In ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted'' (1994),<ref name=reynolds>Reynolds, Susan, ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-19-820648-8}}</ref> [[Susan Reynolds]] expanded upon Brown's original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds's methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument.<ref name=daileader/> Reynolds argues:\n:Too many models of feudalism used for comparisons, even by Marxists, are still either constructed on the 16th-century basis or incorporate what, in a Marxist view, must surely be superficial or irrelevant features from it.  Even when one restricts oneself to Europe and to feudalism in its narrow sense it is extremely doubtful whether feudo-vassalic institutions formed a coherent bundle of institutions or concepts that were structurally separate from other  institutions  and concepts of the time.<ref>Reynolds, p 11</ref>\n\nThe term ''feudal'' has also been applied to non-Western societies in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (See [[Examples of feudalism]]). Japan has been extensively studied in this regard.<ref>John Whitney Hall, \"Feudalism in Japan\u2014a reassessment,\" ''Comparative studies in Society and History'' (1962) 5#1 pp: 15\u201351 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/177767 in JSTOR]</ref>  Friday notes that in the 21st century historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.<ref>Karl Friday,  \"The Futile Paradigm: In Quest of Feudalism in Early Medieval Japan,\" ''History Compass'' 8.2 (2010): 179\u2013196.</ref> Ultimately, critics say, the many ways the term ''feudalism'' has been used have deprived it of specific meaning, leading some historians and [[political theorist]]s to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.<ref name=daileader/>\n\nRichard Abels notes that \"Western Civilization and World Civilization textbooks now shy away from the term 'feudalism'.\"<ref>Richard Abels, \"The Historiography of a Construct: 'Feudalism' and the Medieval Historian.\" ''History Compass'' (2009) 7#3 pp: 1008\u20131031.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bastard feudalism]]\n* [[Cestui que]]\n* [[Examples of feudalism]]\n* [[English feudal barony]]\n* [[Feudal duties]]\n* [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n* [[Lehnsmann]]\n* [[Majorat]]\n* [[Neo-feudalism]]\n* ''[[Nulle terre sans seigneur]]''\n* [[Protofeudalism]]\n* [[Quia Emptores]]\n* [[Scottish feudal barony]]\n* [[Statutes of Mortmain]]\n* [[Suzerainty]]\n* [[Vassal]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Military:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Knights]]\n* [[Medieval warfare]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Non-European:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Fengjian]] (Chinese)\n* [[Hacienda]]\n* [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan|Feudal Japan]]\n* [[Feudalism in Pakistan]]\n* [[Indian feudalism]]\n* [[Mandala (political model)]]\n* [[Ziamet]]\n* [[Zemene Mesafint]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bloch, Marc, ''Feudal Society.''

Gibson, \"McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism\", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275\u2013281.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nFoundationalism is an attempt to respond to the [[regress problem]] of justification in epistemology. According to this argument, every proposition requires [[theory of justification|justification]] to support it, but any justification also needs to be justified itself. If this goes on ''[[ad infinitum]]'', it is not clear how anything in the chain could be justified. Foundationalism holds that there are 'basic beliefs' which serve as foundations to anchor the rest of our beliefs.<ref>O'Brien 2006, pp. 61-62</ref> Strong versions of the theory assert that an indirectly justified belief is completely justified by basic beliefs; more moderate theories hold that indirectly justified beliefs require basic beliefs to be justified, but can be further justified by other factors.<ref>Audi 2003, p. 194</ref>\n\nDuring thousands of years, [[Western philosophy]] pursued a solid foundation as the ultimate and eternal reference system of knowledge called foundationalism. It has existed since [[ancient Greece]], the focus of this theory is that all [[knowledge]] or cognitive awareness of the subject (human being) are based on a solid foundation. This foundation serves not only as the starting point merely as a basis for knowledge of the truth of [[existence]]. Thinking is the process of proving the validity of knowledge, not proving the rationality of the foundation from which knowledge is shaped. This means, with ultimate cause, the foundation is true, absolute, entire and impossible to prove. [[Neopragmatism|Neopragmatist]] philosopher [[Richard Rorty]], a proponent of [[anti-foundationalism]], said that the fundamentalism confirmed the existence of the ''privileged representation''<ref>Rorty, Richard (1979). Philosophy and the mirror of nature. Princeton University Press. pp.165 \u2013 173</ref>  which constitutes the foundation, from which dominates epistemology. [[Plato]]'s [[theory of Forms]] is the earliest foundationalism. So from the point of view of Plato, the Forms shows the general [[concept]] which plays as a model for the release of existence, which is only the faint copy of the Forms of eternity, that means, understanding the expression of objects leads to acquiring all knowledge, then acquiring knowledge accompanies achieving the truth. Achieving the truth means understanding the foundation. This idea still has some appeal in for example [[international relations]] studies.<ref>Smith, Steve, Ownens Patrica, \"Alternative approaches to international relations theory\" in \"The Globalisation of World Politics\", Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, p177</ref>\n\n===Classical foundationalism===\nFoundationalism holds basic beliefs exist, which are justified without reference to other beliefs, and that nonbasic beliefs must ultimately be justified by basic beliefs. Classical foundationalism maintains that basic beliefs must be [[Infallibility#In philosophy|infallible]] if they are to justify nonbasic beliefs, and that only [[deductive reasoning]] can be used to transfer justification from one belief to another.<ref>Lemos 2007, pp. 50-51</ref> [[Laurence BonJour]] has argued that the classical formulation of foundationalism requires basic beliefs to be infallible, incorrigible, indubitable, and certain if they are to be adequately justified.<ref>BonJour 1985, p. 27</ref> Mental states and immediate experience are often taken as good candidates for basic beliefs because it is argued that beliefs about these do not need further support to be justified.<ref>Dancy 1985, pp. 53-54</ref>\n\n===Modest foundationalism===\nAs an alternative to the classic view, modest foundationalism does not require that basic perceptual beliefs are infallible, but holds that it is reasonable to assume that perceptual beliefs are justified unless evidence to the contrary exists.<ref name=OB>O'Brien 2006, pp. 72-74</ref> This is still foundationalism because it maintains that all non-basic beliefs must be ultimately justified by basic beliefs, but it does not require that basic beliefs are infallible and allows [[inductive reasoning]] as an acceptable form of inference.<ref>Lemos 2007, p.55</ref> For example, a belief that 'I see red' could be defeated with psychological evidence showing my mind to be confused or inattentive. Modest foundationalism can also be used to avoid the problem of inference. Even if perceptual beliefs are infallible, it is not clear that they can infallibly ground empirical knowledge (even if my belief that the table looks red to me is infallible, the inference to the belief that the table actually is red might not be infallible). Modest foundationalism does not require this link between perception and reality to be so strong; our perception of a table being yellow is adequate justification to believe that this is the case, even if it is not infallible.<ref name=OB/>\n\n[[Reformed epistemology]] is a form of modest foundationalism which takes religious beliefs as basic because they are non-inferentially justified: their justification arises from [[religious experience]], rather than prior beliefs. This takes a modest approach to foundationalism \u2013 religious beliefs are not taken to be infallible, but are assumed to be ''[[prima facie]]'' justified unless evidence arises to the contrary.<ref>O'Brien 2006, p. 184</ref>\n\n===Internalism and externalism<!--Linked from 'Alvin_Goldman'-->===\nFoundationalism can take [[internalism|internalist]] and [[externalism|externalist]] forms. Internalism requires that a believer's justification for a belief must be accessible to them for it to be justified.<ref>O'Brien 2006, p.87</ref> Foundationalist internalists have held that basic beliefs are justified by [[mental event]]s or states, such as experiences, that do not constitute beliefs. Alternatively, basic beliefs may be justified by some special property of the belief itself, such as its being [[self-evident]] or [[infallible]]. Externalism maintains that it is unnecessary for the means of justification of a belief to be accessible to the believer.<ref>O'Brien 2006, p. 88</ref>\n\n[[Reliabilism]] is an externalist foundationalist theory, initially proposed by [[Alvin Goldman]], which argues that a belief is justified if it is reliably produced, meaning that it will be probably true. Goldman distinguished between two kinds of justification for beliefs: belief-dependent and belief-independent. A belief-dependent process uses prior beliefs to produce new beliefs; a belief-independent process does not, using other stimuli instead. Beliefs produced this way are justified because the processes that cause them are reliable; this might be because we have evolved to reach good conclusions when presented with [[sense-data]], meaning the conclusions we draw from our senses are usually true.<ref name=SEP>{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/#4 | title=Foundationalist Theories of Epistemic Justification | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 February 2000 | accessdate=August 19, 2018 | author=Fumerton, Richard}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nCritics of foundationalism often argue that for a belief to be justified it must be supported by other beliefs;<ref name=SEP/> in [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s phrase, \"only a belief can be a reason for another belief\". For instance, [[Wilfrid Sellars]] argued that non-[[doxastic logic|doxastic]] mental states cannot be reasons, and so noninferential warrant cannot be derived from them. Similarly, critics of [[externalist]] foundationalism argue that only mental states or properties the believer is aware of could make a belief justified.\n\nAccording to [[skepticism]], there are no beliefs that are so obviously certain that they require support from no other beliefs. Even if one does not accept this very strong claim, foundationalists have a problem with giving an uncontroversial or principled account of which beliefs are [[self-evident]] or indubitable.\n\n[[Postmodernists]] and [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] such as [[Richard Rorty]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] have attacked foundationalism on the grounds that the truth of a statement or discourse is only verifiable in accordance with other statements and discourses. Rorty in particular elaborates further on this, claiming that the individual, the community, the human body as a whole have a 'means by which they know the world' (this entails language, culture, semiotic systems, mathematics, science etc.). In order to verify particular means, or particular statements belonging to certain means (e.g. the propositions of the natural sciences), a person would have to 'step outside' the means and critique them neutrally, in order to provide a foundation for adopting them. However, this is impossible. The only way in which one can know the world is through the means by which they know the world; a method cannot justify itself. This argument can be seen as directly related to [[Wittgenstein]]'s theory of language, drawing a parallel between postmodernism and late [[logical positivism]] that is united in critique of foundationalism.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Constructivist epistemology]]\n* [[Evidentialism]]\n* [[Foundherentism]]\n* [[Panrationalism]]\n* [[Pragmatism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book | title=Epistemology: A Contemporary Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge | author=Audi, Robert | publisher=Routledge | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-415-28109-6}}\n*{{cite book | title=The Structure of Empirical Knowledge | author=BonJour, Laurence | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-67484-381-3}}\n*{{cite encyclopaedia | title=Foundationalism | encyclopaedia=[[ACPI Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]] | author=Coelho, Ivo | editor=Puthenpurackal, Johnson J. | publisher=Asian Trading Corporation | year=2010 | isbn=978-8-17086-574-2}}\n*{{cite book | title=Introduction to Contemporary Epistemology | author=Dancy, Jonathan | publisher=Blackwell | year=1985 | isbn=0-631-13622-3}}\n*{{cite book | title=Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context | last1=Franke | first1=John R. | last2=Grenz | first2=Stanley James | publisher=Westminster John Knox Press | year=2001 | isbn=9780664257699}}\n*{{cite book | author=Greco, John | title=Putting Skeptics in Their Place | year=2000 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK | isbn=978-0-521-04553-7}}\n*{{cite book | title=An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge | author=Lemos, Noah Mercelino | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-13946-185-6}}\n*{{cite book | title=An introduction to the Theory of Knowledge | author=O'Brien, Dan | publisher=Polity | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-74563-316-9}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=justep-foundational/ |title=Foundationalist Theories of Epistemic Justification |last=Fumerton |first=Richard}}\n*{{PhilPapers|category|foundationalism}}\n*{{InPho|taxonomy|2385}}\n*{{cite IEP |url-id=found-ep/}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list=\n{{Philosophy topics}}\n{{epistemology}}\n{{philosophy of science}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Epistemological theories]]\n[[Category:Justification]]\n[[Category:Foundationalism| ]]", "sha1": "knzjh498u4t1pz5eczidwnsjmxe0to3"}}, {"title": "Felidae", "ns": "0", "id": "11302", "revision": {"id": "866570680", "parentid": "866563783", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T04:28:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Apokryltaros", "id": "318802"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/24.203.27.212|24.203.27.212]] ([[User talk:24.203.27.212|talk]]) to last revision by BhagyaMani.

At one point, biologists had to consider whether the short tail also found in the lynx was the ancestral or derived trait. Without looking at the fossil record, researchers were able to look at the character states found in their outgroups. Because all animals belonging to Felidae's sister taxa, Viverridae, have long tails, scientists could infer that this character state represents the ancestral trait.<ref name=convergence />\n\nSome domestic cats display a rosette pattern on their coats. This character state, however, is not related to the rosettes found on big cats. Domestic cats and big cats underwent convergent evolution for this trait. The most common ancestor to all cats had a flecked coat. Lynxes display this character state. The jaguarundi lost this character state secondarily. The most common recent ancestor of snow leopards, tigers, jaguars, lions, and leopards developed a coat with rosette patterns from the flecked patterns. Tigers and lions, however, do not display rosettes as adults. They both have lost this ancestral character state over time. Adult tigers actually display elongated rosettes that now appear as stripes. Adult lions seem to lack any distinctive markings altogether. Both juvenile tigers and lions, however, display partial rosettes. This ancestral character state appears only during these early stages, supporting the notion that ontogeny reflects phylogeny. The rosette patterns found on snow leopards, jaguars, and leopards all have a common origin.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Werdelin|first= L.|last2= Olsson|first2= L. |year=2008 |title=How the leopard got its spots: a phylogenetic view of the evolution of felid coat patterns |journal= Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=62 |issue=3|pages=383\u2013400 |doi= 10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01632.x}}</ref>\n\nFossil occurrences indicate that the Felidae arrived in North America about 10 million years later than the [[Canidae]], and about 20 million years later than the [[Ursidae]] and the [[Nimravidae]].<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Silvestro, D., Antonelli, A., Salamin, N. and Quental, T.B. |year=2015 |title=The role of clade competition in the diversification of North American canids |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=28 |pages=8684\u22128689 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1502803112|pmid=26124128 |pmc=4507235 |bibcode=2015PNAS..112.8684S }}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nTraditionally, five subfamilies have been distinguished within the Felidae based on [[Phenotype|phenotypical]] features: the [[Felinae]], the [[Pantherinae]], the [[Acinonychinae]] (cheetahs), the extinct [[Machairodontinae]], and the extinct [[Proailurinae]].<ref name=\"McKenna & Bell\" />\n\n[[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular phylogenetic analysis]] suggests that living (extant) felids fall into eight lineages (clades).<ref name=MSW3/><ref name=Johnson06/><ref name=Johnson97/><ref name=Johnson05/> The placement of the cheetah within the Puma lineage invalidates the traditional subfamily Acinonychinae, and recent sources use only two subfamilies for extant genera.<ref name=MSW3/> The eight lineages divide between these as follows:\n\n*Subfamily [[Pantherinae]]:\n**Lineage 1 (Panthera lineage):  ''[[Panthera]]'', ''[[Neofelis]]''\n*Subfamily [[Felinae]]:\n**Lineage 2 (Bay cat lineage): ''[[Pardofelis]]'', ''[[Catopuma]]''\n**Lineage 3 (Caracal lineage): ''[[Leptailurus]]'', ''[[Caracal]]''\n**Lineage 4 (Ocelot cat lineage): ''[[Leopardus]]''\n**Tribe [[Felini (tribe)|Felini]]:\n***Lineage 5 (Lynx lineage): ''[[Lynx]]''\n***Lineage 6 (Puma lineage): ''[[Puma (genus)|Puma]]'', ''[[Acinonyx]]'', ''[[Herpailurus]]''\n***Lineage 7 (Leopard cat lineage): ''[[Prionailurus]]'', ''[[Otocolobus]]''\n***Lineage 8 (Domestic cat lineage): ''[[Felis]]''\n\nThe last four lineages are more related to each other than to any of the first four, so form a [[clade]] within the subfamily Felinae of family Felidae.<ref name=Johnson06/>\n\n===Extant species===\n{{main|List of felid species}}\n[[Image:Tigress in Bandhavgarh NP.jpg|thumb|[[Tiger]]]]\n[[Image:Lion waiting in Namibia.jpg|thumb|[[Lion]]]]\n[[Image:Standing jaguar.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar]]]]\n[[Image:Leopard (Panthera pardus).jpg|thumb|[[Leopard]]]]\n[[Image:Lodjur fotograferad pa Polar Zoo Norge (3).jpg|thumb|[[Eurasian lynx]]]]\n[[File:Mountain-lion-01623.jpg|thumb|[[Cougar]]]]\n[[Image:Cheetah4.jpg|thumb|[[Cheetah]]]]\n[[Image:Ocelot.jpg|thumb|[[Ocelot]]]]\n[[Image:Margaykat Leopardus wiedii.jpg|thumb|[[Margay]]]]\n[[Image:Bengalkatze.jpg|thumb|[[Leopard cat]]]]\n[[Image:Cat March 2010-1.jpg|thumb|[[Cat|Domestic cat]]]]\n[[Image:Wildkatze.jpg|thumb|[[European wildcat]]]]\n\nThe following is the complete list of genera within the Felidae, grouped according to the traditional phenotypical classification with the corresponding genotypical lineages indicated.

Some are adapted to [[desert]] environments, some to [[wetland]]s, some to high altitude [[mountain]]ous terrain. Those cat species living in [[forest]]s are generally agile climbers. All cat species are [[obligate carnivores]] and require meat. Apart from the [[lion]], wild cats are generally solitary and secretive. [[Feral]] domestic cats form [[feral cat colony|colonies]]. Cheetah males are known to live and hunt in groups. Activity pattern of cat species ranges from [[nocturnal]] to [[crepuscular]] and [[Diurnality|diurnal]], depending on their preferred prey species.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:Smilodon01.jpg|thumb|Skull of the machairodontine ''[[Smilodon]]'' (reconstruction)]]\n[[Image:Panthera leo Kruger Skull.jpg|thumb|[[Skull]] of a [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]] from Kruger National Park]]\nAll members of the cat family have the following characteristics in common:\n*They have lithe and flexible bodies with muscular limbs.<ref name=WCoW>{{cite book |author=Sunquist, M. |author2=Sunquist, F. |year=2002 |title= Wild Cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=[[Chicago]] |isbn=978-0-226-77999-7}}</ref>\n*They are [[digitigrade]], have five toes on their forefeet and four on their hind feet.<ref name=Pocock1917>{{cite journal |author=Pocock, R.I. |year=1917 |title=VII.\u2014On the external characters of the Felid\u00e6 |journal=Journal of Natural History |volume=19 |issue=109 |pages=113\u2212136 |url=}}</ref>\n*The [[wikt:plantar#Adjective|plantar]] pads of both fore and hind feet form compact three-lobed cushions.<ref name=Pocock1939>{{cite book |author=Pocock, R.

The [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] are large, reaching exceptional size in the extinct saber-toothed species.

Their night vision is especially good due to the presence of a [[tapetum lucidum]], which reflects light back inside the eyeball, and gives felid eyes their distinctive shine. As a result, the eyes of felids are about six times more light sensitive than those of humans, and many species are at least partially [[nocturnal]]. The [[retina]] of felids also contains a relatively high proportion of [[rod cell]]s, adapted for distinguishing moving objects in conditions of dim light, which are complemented by the presence of [[cone cell]]s for sensing colour during the day.<ref name=WCoW/>\n*Their [[pinna (anatomy)|external ears]] are large, and especially sensitive to high-frequency sounds in the smaller cat species. This sensitivity allows them to locate small [[rodent]] prey.<ref name=WCoW/>\n*Relative to body size, they have shorter [[baculum|bacula]] than [[canid]]s.<ref name=\"Ewer1973\">{{cite book|author=Ewer, R.

Kondakov]]\nFelids also have a highly developed sense of smell, although not to the degree seen in [[canidae|canids]]; this is further supplemented by the presence of a [[vomeronasal organ]] in the roof of the mouth, allowing the animal to \"taste\" the air. The use of this organ is associated with the [[Flehmen response]], in which the upper lip is curled upwards. Most felids are unable to taste sweetness due to a mutated gene in their taste buds.\n\nMost felids are able to land on their feet after a fall due to the [[cat righting reflex]].\n\n===Vocalisations===\nAll felids share a broadly similar set of vocalisations, but with some variation between species. In particular, the pitch of calls varies, with larger species producing deeper sounds.\n\nAll felids are able to spit, hiss, [[growling|growl]], snarl, and mew. The first four sounds are all used in an aggressive context. The spitting sound is a sudden burst, typically used when making threats, especially towards other species. The hiss is a prolonged, atonal sound used in close range to other members of the species, when the animal is uncertain whether to attack or retreat.\n\nThe mewing sound may be used either as a close-contact call, typically between a mother and kittens, or as a louder, longer distance call, primarily during the mating season. The acoustic properties of the mew vary somewhat between different felid species; extreme examples include the whistling sound made by cougars and the mew-grunt of lions and tigers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[file:Purring_and_meowing.ogg|left|thumb|Domestic cat purring and meowing.]]\nMost felids seem to be able to [[purr]], vibrating the muscles in their [[larynx]] to produce a distinctive buzzing sound. In the wild, purring is used while a mother is caring for kittens. Precisely which species of felids are able to purr is a matter of debate, but the sound has been recorded in most of the smaller species, as well as being common for the cheetah and cougar, and may also be found in other [[big cat]]s.\n\nOther common felid vocalisations include the gurgle, wah-wah, [[prusten]], and [[roar (utterance)|roar]]. The first two sounds are found only among the Felinae (small cats). Gurgling is a quiet sound used during meetings between friendly individuals, as well as during courtship and when nursing kittens. The wah-wah is a short, deep-sounding call used in close contact, and is not found in all species (it is, for example, absent in the domestic cat).\n\nIn contrast, only ''Panthera'' species can prusten and roar. Prusten is a short, soft, snorting sound reported in tigers, jaguars, snow leopards, and clouded leopards; it is used during contact between friendly individuals. The roar is an especially loud call with a distinctive pattern that depends on the species. The ability to roar comes from an elongated and specially adapted larynx and [[hyoid bone|hyoid apparatus]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Weissengruber | first = G.

These include [[oral traditions]] such as [[Narrative|tales]], [[proverbs]] and [[jokes]]. They include [[material culture]], ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes [[Tradition|customary lore]], the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a [[Cultural artifact|folklore artifact]]. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the [[fine arts]]. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called [[Folklore studies]].\n\n==Overview==\nTo fully understand folklore, it is helpful to clarify its component parts: the terms '''folk''' and '''lore'''. It is well-documented that the term was coined in 1846 by the Englishman [[William Thoms]]. He fabricated it to replace the contemporary terminology of \"popular antiquities\" or \"popular literature\". The second half of the compound word, ''[[:wikt:lore|lore]]'', proves easier to define as its meaning has stayed relatively stable over the last two centuries. Coming from Old English l\u0101r 'instruction,' and with German and Dutch cognates, it is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group, frequently passed along by word of mouth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/lore|title=lore - Definition of lore in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of ''folk'' proves somewhat more elusive. When Thoms first created this term, ''folk'' applied only to rural, frequently poor and illiterate peasants. A more modern definition of ''folk'' is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits, who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. \"Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] or to a [[Family folklore|single family.]]\"<ref>{{harv |Dundes|1969|page=13, footnote 34}}</ref> This expanded social definition of ''folk'' supports a broader view of the material, i.e. the lore, considered to be ''folklore artifacts''. These now include all \"things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)\".<ref>{{harv|Wilson|2006|page=85}}</ref> Folklore is no longer circumscribed as being chronologically old or obsolete. The folklorist studies the [[traditional]] artifacts of a social group and how they are transmitted.\n\n'''Transmission''' is a vital part of the folklore process. Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time, they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists. For folklore is also a verb. These [[Cultural artifacts|folk artifacts]] continue to be passed along informally, as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants. The folk group is not individualistic, it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community. \"As new groups emerge, new folklore is created\u2026 surfers, motorcyclists, [[:Category:Computer folklore|computer programmers]]\".<ref name=\"Dundes\">{{harv|Dundes|1980|page=7}}</ref> In direct contrast to [[high culture]], where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law, folklore is a function of shared identity within the social group.<ref name=\"Bauman\">{{harv|Bauman|1971}}</ref>\n\nHaving identified folk artifacts, the professional folklorist strives to understand the '''significance''' of these beliefs, customs and objects for the group. For these cultural units<ref>{{harv|Dundes|1971}}</ref> would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group. That meaning can however shift and morph. So [[Halloween]] of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages, and even gives rise to its own set of  [[Poisoned candy myths|urban legends]] independent of the historical celebration. The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew. Compare this to brushing your teeth, also transmitted within a group, which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition.<ref>{{harv|Dundes|1965|page=1}}</ref> For tradition is initially remembered behavior. Once it loses its practical purpose, there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action. This meaning is at the core of folkloristics, the study of folklore.\n\nWith an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group, it is indeed all around us.<ref>{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|pages=7\u20138}}</ref> It does not have to be old or antiquated. It continues to be created, transmitted and in any group is used to differentiate between \"us\" and \"them\".\n\n==Origin and development of folklore studies==\n{{main article|Folkloristics#History of Folklore Studies}}\n\nFolklore began to distinguish itself as an autonomous discipline during the period of romantic nationalism in Europe. A particular figure in this development was [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], whose writings in the 1770s presented oral traditions as organic processes grounded in locale. After the German states were invaded by Napoleonic France, Herder's approach was adopted by many of his fellow Germans who systematized the recorded folk traditions and used them in their process of [[nation building]]. This process was enthusiastically embraced by smaller nations like Finland, Estonia, and Hungary, which were seeking political independence from their dominant neighbours.<ref>{{harv|Noyes|2012|p=20}}</ref>\n\nFolklore as a field of study further developed among 19th century European scholars who were contrasting [[tradition]] with the newly developing [[modernity]]. Its focus was the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations, which were considered as residue and survivals of the past that continued to exist within the lower strata of society.<ref>{{harv|Noyes|2012|pages=15\u201316}}</ref> The \"[[Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]\" of the [[Brothers Grimm]] (first published 1812) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry of that time. This interest in stories, sayings and songs continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folkloristics with literature and mythology. By the turn into the 20th century the number and sophistication of folklore studies and folklorists had grown both in Europe and North America. Whereas European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogenous peasant populations in their regions, the American folklorists, led by [[Franz Boas]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], chose to consider [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folkloristics with [[cultural anthropology]] and [[ethnology]], using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folkloristics between the humanities in Europe and the social sciences in America offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folkloristics as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself.<ref>{{harv|Zumwalt|Dundes|1988}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''Folkloristics'', along with its synonym ''Folklore Studies'',<ref group=note>The word ''Folkloristics'' is favored by Alan Dundes, and used in the title of his publication {{harv|Dundes|1978}}. The term ''Folklore Studies'' is defined and used by [[Simon Bronner]], see {{harv|Bronner|1986|page=xi}}.</ref> gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the [[cultural artifacts|folklore artifacts]] themselves. With the passage in 1976 of the American Folklife Preservation Act, (P.L. 94-201),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/public_law.html|title=Public Law 94-201 (The Creation of the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> passed by the U.S. Congress in conjunction with the Bicentennial Celebration in 1976, folkloristics in the United States came of age.\n\n<blockquote>\"\u2026[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction.\" </blockquote>\n\nAdded to the panoply of other legislation designed to protect the natural and [[cultural heritage]] of the United States, this law also marks a shift in national awareness. It gives voice to a growing understanding that cultural diversity is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection. Paradoxically, it is a unifying feature, not something that separates the citizens of a country. \"We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans\".<ref>{{harv|Hufford|1991}}</ref> This diversity is celebrated annually at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] and many other [[List of folk festivals|folklife fests]] around the country.\n\n==Definition of folk==\n\nThe folk of the 19th century, the social group identified in the [[Folkloristics#From Antiquities to Lore|original term \"folklore\"]], was characterized by being rural, illiterate and poor. They were the peasants living in the countryside, in contrast to the urban populace of the cities. Only toward the end of the century did the urban proletariat (on the coattails of Marxist theory) become included with the rural poor as folk. The common feature in this expanded definition of folk was their identification as the underclass of society.<ref>{{harv|Dundes|1980|page=8}}</ref>\n\nMoving forward into the 20th century, in tandem with new thinking in the [[History of sociology#20th century: critical theory.2C postmodernism.2C and positivist revival|social sciences]], folklorists also revised and expanded their concept of the folk group. By the 1960s it was understood that [[social groups]], i.e. folk groups, were all around us; each individual is enmeshed in a multitude of differing identities and their concomitant social groups. The first group that each of us is born into is the family, and each family has its own unique [[Family folklore|folklore]]. As a child grows into an individual, its identities also increase to include age, language, ethnicity, occupation, etc. Each of these cohorts has its own folklore, and as one folklorist points out, this is \"not idle speculation\u2026 Decades of fieldwork have demonstrated conclusively that these groups do have their own folklore.\"<ref name=\"Dundes\" /> In this modern understanding, folklore is a function of shared identity within any social group.<ref name=\"Bauman\" />\n\nThis folklore can include jokes, sayings and expected behavior in multiple variants, always transmitted in an informal manner. For the most part it will be learned by observation, imitation, repetition or correction by other group members. This informal knowledge is used to confirm and re-inforce the identity of the group. It can be used both internally within the group to express their common identity, for example in an initiation ceremony for new members. Or it can be used externally to differentiate the group from outsiders, like a folkdance demonstration at a community festival. Significant to folklorists here is that there are two opposing but equally valid ways to use this in the study of a group: you can start with an identified group in order to explore its folklore, or you can identify folklore items and use them to identify the social group.<ref>{{harv|Bauman|1971|page=41}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, a further expansion of the concept of folk began to unfold in folkloristics. Individual researchers identified folk groups which had previously been overlooked and ignored. One major example of this is found in an issue of \"The Journal of American Folklore\", published 1975. This edition is dedicated exclusively to articles on women's folklore, with approaches that were not coming from a man's perspective.<ref group=note>Contributors of this issue were, among others, Claire Farrer, Joan N. Radner, Susan Lanser, Elaine Lawless, and Jeannie B. Thomas.</ref> Other groups that were highlighted as part of this broadened understanding of the folk group were [[Family folklore#Family as a folk group|non-traditional families]], occupational groups, and families that pursued production of folk items through multiple generations.\n\n==Genres: the lore of folklore==\nIndividual folklore artifacts are commonly classified as one of three types: material, verbal or customary lore. For the most part self-explanatory, these categories include physical objects ('''material folklore'''), common sayings, expressions, stories and songs ('''verbal folklore'''), and beliefs and ways of doing things ('''customary folklore'''). There is also a fourth major subgenre defined for [[Childlore|children's folklore]] and games ('''childlore'''), as the collection and interpretation of this fertile topic is peculiar to school yards and neighborhood streets.<ref name=\"Opie\">{{harv|Opie|Opie|1969}}</ref>  Each of these genres and their subtypes is intended to organize and categorize the folklore artifacts; they provide common vocabulary and consistent labeling for folklorists to communicate with each other.\n\nThat said, each artifact is unique; in fact one of the characteristics of all folklore artifacts is their variation within genres and types.<ref>{{harv|Georges|Jones|1995|pages=10\u201312}}</ref> This is in direct contrast to manufactured goods, where the goal in production is to create products which are identical, and variations are considered mistakes. It is however just this required variation that makes identification and classification of the defining features a challenge. And while this classification is essential for the subject area of folkloristics, it remains just labeling, and adds little to an understanding of the traditional development and meaning of the artifacts themselves.<ref>{{harv|Toelken|1996|page=184}}</ref> \n  \nNecessary as they are, genre classifications are misleading in their oversimplification of the subject area. Folklore artifacts are never self-contained, they do not stand in isolation but are particulars in the self-representation of a community. Different genres are frequently combined with each other to mark an event.<ref>{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=17}}</ref>  So a birthday celebration might include a song or formulaic way of greeting the birthday child (verbal), presentation of a cake and wrapped presents (material), as well as customs to honor the individual, such as sitting at the head of the table, and blowing out the candles with a wish.  There might also be special games played at birthday parties which are not generally played at other times. Adding to the complexity of the interpretation, the birthday party for a seven-year-old will not be identical to the birthday party for that same child as a six-year-old, even though they follow the same model. For each artifact embodies a single variant of a performance in a given time and space. The task of the folklorist becomes to identify within this surfeit of variables the constants and the expressed meaning that shimmer through all variations: honoring of the individual within the circle of family and friends, gifting to express their value and worth to the group, and of course, the festival food and drink as [[Signified and signifier|signifiers]] of the event.\n\n===Verbal tradition===\n[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', [[Arthur Rackham]], 1909]]\nThe formal definition of verbal lore is words, both written and oral, which are \"spoken, sung, voiced forms of traditional utterance that show repetitive patterns.\"<ref name=\"Dorson\">{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=2}}</ref> Crucial here are the repetitive patterns. Verbal lore is not just any conversation, but words and phrases conforming to a traditional configuration recognized by both the speaker and the audience. For [[narratology|narrative types]] by definition have consistent structure, and follow an existing model in their narrative form.<ref group=note>[[Vladimir Propp]] first defined a uniform structure in Russian fairy tales in his groundbreaking monograph ''Morphology of the Folktale'', published in Russian in 1928. See {{harv|Propp|1928}}</ref> As just one simple example, in English the phrase \"An elephant walks into a bar\u2026\" instantaneously flags the following text as a [[Joke#Telling jokes|joke]]. It might be one you've already heard, but it might be one that the speaker has just thought up within the current context. This is folklore in action. Another example is the child's song [[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]], where each performance is distinctive in the animals named, their order and their sounds. Songs such as this are used to express cultural values (farms are important, farmers are old and weather-beaten) and teach children about different domesticated animals.<ref>{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=13}}</ref> This is folklore in action.\n\nVerbal folklore was the [[Folkloristics#From Antiquities to Lore|original folklore]], the artifacts defined by [[William Thoms]] as older, oral cultural traditions of the rural populace. In his 1846 published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of verbal lore. By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary.<ref>{{harv| Georges|Jones|1995|pages=112\u2013113}}</ref> Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. This was later expanded into the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system]] by [[Stith Thompson]] and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified oral artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs, giving rise to the [[Folkloristics#Aarne-Thompson and the Historic-Geographic Method|Historic-Geographic Method]], a methodology which dominated folkloristics in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nWhen William Thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations, it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate. Over the past two centuries this belief has proven to be wrong; folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups. Some variants might have been captured in published collections, but much of it is still transmitted orally and indeed continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate.\n\n[[File:Prince Salim (the future Jahangir) and his legendary illicit love.jpg|thumb|The story of [[Jahangir]] and [[Anarkali]] is popular folklore in the former territories of the [[Mughal Empire]].]]\n\nBelow is listed a small sampling of types and examples of verbal lore.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[Aloha]]\n* [[Ballads]]\n* [[Blessing]]s\n* [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]]\n* [[Town Musicians of Bremen|Bremen Town Musicians]]\n* [[Chants]]\n* [[Spell (paranormal)|Charms]]\n* [[Cinderella]]\n* [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]]\n* [[Country music]]\n* [[Cowboy poetry]]\n* [[Creation stories]]\n* [[Curses]]\n* [[:wikt:Category:English similes|English similes]]\n* [[Epic poetry]]\n* [[Fable]]\n* [[Fairy tale]]\n* [[Folk belief]]\n* [[Folk etymologies]]\n* [[Metaphor|Folk metaphors]]\n* [[Ethnopoetics|Folk poetry]]\n* [[Folk music]]\n* [[Folksongs]]\n* [[Slang|Folk speech]]\n* [[Oral tradition|Folktales]]\n* [[Ghost stories]]\n* [[Greetings]]\n* [[Hog-calling]]\n* [[Insults]]\n* [[Jokes]]\n* [[Keening]]\n* [[Latrinalia]]\n* [[Legend]]s\n* [[Limericks]]\n* [[Lullabies]]\n* [[Myth]]\n* [[Oaths]]\n* [[Parting phrase|Leave-taking formulas]]\n* [[Pecos Bill]]\n* [[Place name origins|Place names]]\n* [[Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep|Prayers at bedtime]]\n* [http://www.reformjudaism.org/practice/prayers-blessings/daily-blessings-foods Prayers at table] \n* [[Proverbs]]\n* [[Retorts]]\n* [[Riddle]]\n* [[Riddles]]\n* [[Roast (comedy)|Roasts]]\n* [[Sagas]]\n* [[Sea shanty]]s\n* [[Hawker (trade)|Street vendors]]\n* [[Superstition]]\n* [[Tall tale]]\n* [[Taunts]]\n* [[Toast (honor)|Toasts]]\n* [[Tongue-twisters]]\n* [[Urban legends]]\n* [[Word games]]\n* [[Yodeling]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Material culture===\n[[File:Horse and Sulky weathervane - SAAM - DSC00796.JPG|thumb|Horse and [[sulky]] weathervane, Smithsonian American Art Museum]]\n\nThe genre of [[material culture]] includes all artifacts that you can touch, hold, live in or eat. They are tangible objects, with a physical presence intended for use either permanently or just at the next meal. Most of these folklore artifacts are single objects which have been created by hand for a specific purpose. However folk artifacts can also be mass-produced, such as dreidels or Christmas decorations. These items continue to be considered folklore due to their long (pre-industrial) history and their customary use. All of these material objects \"existed prior to and continue alongside mechanized industry. \u2026 [They are] transmitted across the generations and subject to the same forces of conservative tradition and individual variation\"<ref name=\"Dorson\" /> that are found in all folk artifacts. Of interest to folklorists are their physical form, their method of manufacture or construction, their pattern of use as well as the procurement of the raw materials.<ref>{{harv|Vlach|1997}}</ref> The meaning to those who both make and use these objects is important. Of primary significance in these studies is the complex balance of continuity over change in both their design and their decoration.\n\n[[File:At a goldsmith's workshop Podhale region.webm|thumb|Traditional highlanders' pins hand-made by a goldsmith in [[Podhale]], Poland]]In Europe before the [[Industrial Revolution]] everything was made by hand. While some folklorists of the 19th century wanted to secure the oral traditions of the rural folk before the populace became literate, other folklorists sought to identify hand-crafted objects before their production processes were lost to industrial manufacturing. Just as verbal lore continues to be actively created and transmitted in today's culture, so these [[handicrafts]], possibly with a shift in purpose and meaning, can still be found all around us. For there are many reasons to continue to hand make objects for use. It could mean these skills are needed to repair manufactured items. Or perhaps a unique design is wanted which is not (or cannot be) found in the stores. Many crafts are considered to be simple home maintenance, such as cooking, sewing and carpentry. Handicrafts have also become for many an enjoyable and satisfying hobby. Last but not least, handmade objects have taken on the sheen of prestige, where extra time and thought is spent in their creation and their uniqueness is valued.<ref>{{harv|Roberts|1972|page=236 ff}}</ref> For the folklorist, these hand-crafted objects embody multifaceted relationships in the lives of the craftsmen and the users, which is completely lacking in mass-produced items without connection to an individual craftsman.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/33637|title=Material Culture (review)|first=Michael B.|last=Schiffer|date=1 October 2000|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=41|issue=4|pages=791\u2013793|accessdate=8 October 2017|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0178}}</ref> Regardless of the motivation for the handicraft, this is folklore in action.\n\nMany traditional crafts have been elevated to the [[fine art|fine]] or [[applied arts]] and taught in art schools, such as ironworking and glass-making.<ref>{{harv|Roberts|1972|page=236 ff, 250}}</ref> Or they are repurposed as [[folk art]], characterized as objects in which the decorative form supersedes its utilitarian needs. Folk art is found in hex signs on Pennsylvania Dutch barns, tin man sculptures made by metalworkers, front yard Christmas displays, decorated school lockers, carved gun stocks, and tattoos. \"Words such as naive, self-taught, and individualistic are used to describe these objects, and the exceptional rather than the representative creation is featured.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/guide/materialculture.html|title=Material Culture: American Folklife Center: An Illustrated Guide (Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> This is in contrast to our understanding of folklore artifacts which are nurtured and passed along in community.<ref group=note>[[Henry Glassie]], a distinguished folklorist studying technology in cultural context, notes that in Turkish one word, sanat, refers to all objects, not distinguishing between art and craft. The latter distinction, Glassie emphasizes, is not based on medium but on social class. This raises the question as to the difference between arts and crafts; is the difference found merely in the labeling?</ref>\n\nMany objects of material folklore, big and small, are challenging to classify, difficult to archive and unwieldy to store. How do we preserve these bulky artifacts of material culture, and how do we use them? That is the assigned task of museums. Toward this goal the concept of the [[Living history museum|Living history]] or open-air museum has been developed, beginning in Scandinavia at the end of the 19th century. These museums are here to teach, not just display. Actors show how items were used, reenacting everyday living by people from all segments of society. In order to achieve this, these museums rely heavily on the material artifacts of a pre-industrial society. Many locations even duplicate the processing of the objects, thus creating new objects of an earlier historic time period. These [[List of open-air and living history museums in the United States|Living history museums]] are now found throughout the United States and the world as part of a thriving [[heritage industry]]. This is folklore in action.\n\nThis list represents just a small sampling of objects and skills which are included in studies of material culture.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n\n* [[Autograph book]]s\n* [[Bunad]]\n* [[Embroidery]] \n* [[Folk art]]\n* [[Folk costume]]\n* [[History of herbalism|Folk medicines]]\n* [[Challah|Food recipes and presentation]]\n* [[Foodways]]\n* [[Handicraft#List of common handicrafts|Common Handicrafts]]\n* [[List of wooden toys|Handmade toys]]\n* [[Hay#Loose hay stacking|Haystacks]]\n* [[Hex signs]]\n* [[Ironwork|Decorative ironworks]]\n* [[Pottery]]\n* [[Quilting]] \n* [[Stone carving|Stone sculpting]]\n* [[Tipis]]\n* [[Wattle (construction)|Traditional Fences]]\n* [[Vernacular architecture]]\n* [[Weather vane|Weather vanes]]\n* [[Woodworking]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Customs===\n[[Tradition|Customary culture]] is remembered enactment, i.e. re-enactment.

Each of these is a folklore artifact in its own right, potentially worthy of investigation and cultural analysis. Together they combine to build the custom of a birthday party celebration, a scripted combination of multiple artifacts which have meaning within their social group.\n\n[[File:Pvt. Evan Allen Dancer, center, smiles as Santa Claus, right, hands gifts to Destiny Hawley and her brother Justin Hawley of Scipio, Ind., during the 3rd Annual Operation Christmas Blessing event at Muscatatuck 111212-A-QU728-005.jpg|thumb|[[Santa Claus]] giving gifts to children, a common folk practice associated with [[Christmas]] in Western nations]]\n\nFolklorists divide customs into several different categories.<ref name=\"Sweterlitsch\" />  A custom can be a '''seasonal celebration''', such as [[Thanksgiving]] or [[New Year's Day|New Year's]]. It can be a '''life cycle celebration''' for an individual, such as baptism, birthday or wedding. A custom can also mark a '''community festival''' or event; examples of this are [[Cologne Carnival|Carnival in Cologne]] or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras in New Orleans]]. This category also includes the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] celebrated each summer on the Mall in Washington, DC. A fourth category includes customs related to '''folk beliefs'''. Walking under a ladder is just one of many [[List of unlucky symbols|symbols considered unlucky]]. '''Occupational groups''' tend to have a rich history of customs related to their life and work, so the [[Sailors' superstitions|traditions of sailors]] or [[Lumberjack#Lumberjack culture|lumberjacks]].<ref group=note>The folklorist [[Archie Green]] specialized in workers' traditions and the lore of labor groups.</ref> The area of [[folk religion|ecclesiastical folklore]], which includes modes of worship not sanctioned by the established church<ref>{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=4}}</ref> tends to be so large and complex that it is usually treated as a specialized area of folk customs; it requires considerable expertise in standard church ritual in order to adequately interpret folk customs and beliefs that originated in official church practice.\n\nCustomary folklore is by definition folklore in action; it is always a performance, be it a single gesture or a complex of scripted customs. Participating in the custom, either as performer or audience, signifies acknowledgment of that social group. Some customary behavior is intended to be performed and understood only within the group itself, so the [[handkerchief code]] sometimes used in the gay community or the [[Masonic ritual and symbolism|initiation rituals]] of the Freemasons. Other customs are designed specifically to represent a social group to outsiders, those who do not belong to this group. The [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States#New York City|St. Patrick's Day Parade]] in New York and in other communities across the continent is a single example of an ethnic group parading their separateness (differential behavior<ref>{{harv|Bauman|1971|page=45}}</ref>), and encouraging Americans of all stripes to show alliance to this colorful ethnic group. Another multicolored social group, the [[Gay Pride|Gay Pride Movement]], also [[Pride parade|parades]] in communities across the country to show the strength of their culture and demonstrate for recognition of their group within the contemporary legal and social systems.\n\n[[File:Deal Hoodeners, 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Practitioners of [[hoodening]], a folk custom found in [[Kent]], southeastern England, in 1909]]\n\nThese festivals and parades, with a target audience of people who do not belong to the social group, intersect with the interests and mission of [[Public folklore|public folklorists]], who are engaged in the documentation, preservation, and presentation of traditional forms of folklife. With a swell in popular interest in folk traditions, these [[List of folk festivals|community celebrations]] are becoming more numerous throughout the western world. While ostensibly parading the diversity of their community, economic groups have discovered that these folk parades and festivals are good for business. All shades of people are out on the streets, eating, drinking and spending. This attracts support not only from the business community, but also from federal and state organizations for these local street parties.<ref>{{harv|Sweterlitsch|1997|page=170}}</ref> Paradoxically, in parading diversity within the community, these events have come to authenticate true community, where business interests ally with the varied (folk) social groups to promote the interests of the community as a whole.\n\nThis is just a small sampling of types and examples of customary lore.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n\n* [[Amish]]\n* [[Barn raising]]\n* [[Birthday]]\n* [[Cakewalk]]\n* [[Cat's cradle]]\n* [[Christmas]]\n* [[Crossed fingers]]\n* [[Folk dance]]\n* [[Folk drama]]\n* [[Folk medicine]]\n* [[Giving the finger]]\n* [[Halloween]]\n* [[Hoodening]]\n* [[List of gestures|Gestures]] \n* [[Groundhog Day]]\n* [[Louisiana Creole people]]\n* [[Mime]]\n* [[Culture of the Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiians]]\n* [[Ouiji|Ouiji board]]\n* [[Powwow]]s\n* [[Practical jokes]]\n* [[St John's Eve]]\n* [[Shakers]]\n* [[Symbols]]\n* [[Thanksgiving]]\n* [[Thumbs down]]\n* [[Trick or Treating]]\n* [[Whaling]]\n* [[Yo-yo]]s\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Childlore and games===\n [[File:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 041b.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] (1560) shows five boys playing buck buck in the bottom right hand corner of the painting.]]\n\n[[Childlore]] is a distinct branch of folklore that deals with activities passed on by children to other children, away from the influence or supervision of an adult.<ref>{{harv|Grider|1997|page=123}}</ref> Children's folklore contains artifacts from all the standard folklore genres of verbal, material and customary lore; it is however the '''child-to-child conduit''' that distinguishes these artifacts. For childhood is a social group where children teach, learn and share their own traditions, flourishing in a [[Children's street culture|street culture]] outside the purview of adults. This is also ideally where it needs to be collected; as [[Iona and Peter Opie]] demonstrated in their pioneering book ''Children's Games in Street and Playground''.<ref name=\"Opie\" /> Here the social group of children is studied on its own terms, not as an derivative of adult social groups. It is shown that the [[Childlore|culture of children]] is quite distinctive; it is generally unnoticed by the sophisticated world of adults, and quite as little affected by it.<ref>{{harv|Grider|1997|page=125}}</ref>\n\nOf particular interest to folklorists here is the mode of transmission of these artifacts; this lore circulates exclusively within an informal pre-literate children's network or folkgroup. It does not include artifacts taught to children by adults. However children can take the taught and teach it further to other children, turning it into childlore. Or they can take the artifacts and turn them into something else; so Old McDonald's farm is transformed from animal noises to the scatological version of animal poop. This childlore is characterized by \"its lack of dependence on literary and fixed form. Children\u2026operate among themselves in a world of informal and oral communication, unimpeded by the necessity of maintaining and transmitting information by written means.<ref>{{harv|Grider|1997}}</ref> This is as close as folklorists can come to observing the transmission and social function of this folk knowledge before the spread of literacy during the 19th century.\n\nAs we have seen with the other genres, the original collections of children's lore and games in the 19th century was driven by a fear that the culture of childhood would die out.<ref>{{harv|Grider|1997|page=127}}</ref> Early folklorists, among them [[Alice Gomme]] in Britain and [[William Wells Newell]] in the United States, felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost. This fear proved to be unfounded. In a comparison of any modern school playground during recess and the painting of \"Children's Games\" by [[Pieter Breugel the Elder]] we can see that the activity level is similar, and many of the games from the 1560 painting are recognizable and comparable to modern variations still played today.\n\nThese same artifacts of childlore, in innumerable variations, also continue to serve the same function of learning and practicing skills needed for growth. So bouncing and swinging rhythms and rhymes encourage development of [[Vestibular system|balance and coordination]] in infants and children. Verbal rhymes like [[Peter Piper|Peter Piper picked\u2026]] serve to increase both the oral and aural acuity of children. Songs and chants, accessing a different part of the brain, are used to memorize series ([[Alphabet song]]). They also provide the necessary beat to complex physical rhythms and movements, be it hand-clapping, jump roping, or ball bouncing. Furthermore, many physical games are used to develop strength, coordination and endurance of the players. For some team games, negotiations about the rules can run on longer than the game itself as social skills are rehearsed.<ref>{{harv|Georges|Jones|1995|page=243\u2013254}}</ref> Even as we are just now uncovering the [[neuroscience]] that undergirds the developmental function of this childlore, the artifacts themselves have been in play for centuries.\n\nBelow is listed just a small sampling of types and examples of childlore and games.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n\n* [[Buck buck]]\n* [[Children's song|Counting rhymes]]\n* [[Children's song|Dandling rhymes]]\n* [[Children's song|Finger and toe rhymes]]\n* [[Counting-out game]]s\n* [[Dreidel]]\n* [[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]\n* [[Games]]\n* [[List of traditional children's games|Traditional games]]\n* [[London Bridge Is Falling Down]]\n* [[Lullabies]]\n* [[Nursery rhymes]]\n* [[Playground song]]s\n* [[Playground song|Ball-bouncing rhymes]]\n* [[Rhymes]]\n* [[Riddle]]s\n* [[Ring a Ring o' Roses|Ring a Ring o Roses]]\n* [[Skipping-rope rhyme|Jump-rope rhymes]]\n* [[Stickball]]\n* [[Street games]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==In action: performance in context==\nLacking context, the folklore artifacts in the [[Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections|Smithsonian Folklife Archive]] contain as much life as the stuffed elephant down the street in the Natural History Museum. It is only in performance that they come alive as an active and meaningful component of a social group; this is where the intergroup communication lives, where transmission of these cultural elements takes place. \"Folklore is folklore only when performed\".<ref>{{harv|Abrahams|1972|page=35}}</ref> Without transmission, these items are not folklore, they are just individual quirky tales and objects.\n\nThis understanding in folkloristics only occurred in the second half of the 20th century, when the two terms \"[[Performance studies|folklore performance]]\" and \"text and context\" dominated discussions among folklorists. These terms are not contradictory or even mutually exclusive. As borrowings from other fields of study, one or the other linguistic formulation is more appropriate to any given discussion. Performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore, whereas context is used in discussions of material lore. Both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding, specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community.\n\nThe concept of cultural (folklore) performance is shared with [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]] among other social sciences. The cultural anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance. These are playfulness, [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]], using symbolic language and employing the [[subjunctive mood]].<ref>{{harv|Ben-Amos|1997a|pages=633\u2013634}}</ref> In performance the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make-believe, \"what if\". That this fits well with all types of verbal lore, where reality finds no footing among the symbols, fantasies, and nonsense of traditional tales, proverbs, and jokes is self-evident. Customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance.\n\nMaterial culture requires some kneading to turn it into a performance. Should we consider the performance of the production, as in a quilting party, or the performance of the recipients who use the quilt to cover their marriage bed? Here the language of context works better to describe the quilting of patterns copied from the grandmother, quilting as a social event during the winter months, or the gifting of a quilt to signify the importance of the event. Each of these, the traditional pattern chosen, the social event and the gifting occur within the broader context of the community. That said, even in a discussion of context the structure and characteristics of performance can be recognized, including an audience, a framing event, and the use of decorative figures and symbols which go beyond the utility of the object.\n\n===Backstory===\nBefore the Second World War, folk artifacts had been understood and collected as cultural shards of an earlier time. They were considered individual vestigial artifacts, with little or no function in the contemporary culture. Given this understanding, the goal of the folklorist was to capture and document them before they disappeared. They were collected with no supporting data, bound in books, archived and classified more or less successfully. The [[Folkloristics#Aarne-Thompson and the Historic-Geographic Method|Historic-Geographic Method]] worked to isolate and track these collected artifacts, mostly verbal lore, across space and time.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, folklorists began to articulate a more holistic approach toward their subject matter. In tandem with the growing sophistication in the [[History of sociology#20th century: critical theory, postmodernism, and positivist revival|social sciences]], attention was no longer limited to the isolated artifact, but extended to include the artifact embedded in an active cultural environment. One early proponent was [[Alan Dundes]] with his essay \"Texture, Text and Context\", first published 1964.<ref>{{harv|Dundes|1980}}</ref> A public presentation in 1967 by [[Dan Ben-Amos]] at the American Folklore Society brought the behavioral approach into open debate among folklorists. In 1972 [[Richard Dorson]] called out the \"young Turks\" for their movement toward a behavioral approach to folklore. This approach \"shifted the conceptualization of folklore as an extractable item or 'text' to an emphasis on folklore as a kind of human behavior and communication. Conceptualizing folklore as behavior redefined the job of folklorists...\"<ref>{{harv|Gabbert|1999|page=119}}</ref><ref group=note>A more extensive discussion of this can be found in \"The 'Text/Context' Controversy and the Emergence of Behavioral Approaches in Folklore\", {{harv|Gabbert|1999}}</ref>\n\nFolklore became a verb, an action, something that people do, not just something that they have.<ref>{{harv|Bauman|Paredes|1972|page=xv}}</ref> It is in the performance and the active context that folklore artifacts get transmitted in informal, direct communication, either verbally or in demonstration. Performance became the [[umbrella term]] for all the different modes and manners in which this transmission occurs.\n\n===Tradition-bearer and audience===\n[[File:Walaskie fujary.webm|thumb|Presentation of traditional Wallachian pipes at the [[Wallachian Open Air Museum]], Ro\u017enov pod Radho\u0161t\u011bm, Czech Republic, 2017]]\nTransmission is a communicative process requiring a binary: one individual or group who actively transmits information in some form to another individual or group. Each of these is a defined role in the folklore process. The tradition-bearer<ref>{{harv|Ben-Amos|1997b}}</ref> is the individual who actively passes along the knowledge of an artifact; this can be either a mother singing a lullaby to her baby, or an Irish dance troupe performing at a local festival. They are named individuals, usually well known in the community as knowledgeable in their traditional lore. They are not the anonymous \"folk\", the nameless mass without of history or individuality.\n\nThe audience of this performance is the other half in the transmission process; they listen, watch, and remember. Few of them will become active tradition-bearers; many more will be passive tradition-bearers who maintain a memory of this specific traditional artifact, in both its presentation and its content.\n\nThere is active communication between the audience and the performer. The performer is presenting to the audience; the audience in turn, through its actions and reactions, is actively communicating with the performer.<ref>{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005 |page=127 }}</ref> The purpose of this performance is not to create something new but to re-create something that already exists; the performance is words and actions which are known, recognized and valued by both the performer and the audience. For folklore is first and foremost remembered behavior. As members of the same cultural [[reference group]], they identify and value this performance as a piece of shared cultural knowledge.\n\n[[File:Bikkessy Heinbucher T\u00e1ncol\u00f3 magyarok.jpg|thumb|''Dancing Hungarians'', 1816.]]\n[[File:XIX \u00fcldtantsupidu 13.JPG|thumb|Some elements of folk culture might be in the center of local culture and an import part of self-identity. For instance [[folk dance]] is highly popular in [[Estonia]] and it has evolved into a sort of a national sport.<ref group=note>See [http://www.estonica.org/en/Culture/The_art_of_dance/Folk_dance/ Folk dance] Estonica</ref> XIX Estonian Dance Celebration in 2015 that was held together with [[Estonian Song Festival]].]]\n\n===Framing the performance===\nTo initiate the performance, there must be a [[Framing (social sciences)|frame]] of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance. The frame brackets it as outside of normal discourse. In customary lore such as life cycle celebrations (ex. birthday) or dance performances, the framing occurs as part of the event, frequently marked by location. The audience goes to the event location to participate. Games are defined primarily by rules,<ref>{{harv|Beresin|1997|page=393}}</ref> it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed. The folklorist Barre Toelken describes an evening spent in a Navaho family playing [[string figure]] games, with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other.<ref>{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=118 ff}}</ref>\n\nIn verbal lore, the performer will start and end with recognized linguistic formulas. An easy example is seen in the common introduction to a joke: \"Have you heard the one...\", \"Joke of the day...\", or \"An elephant walks into a bar\". Each of these signals to the listeners that the following is a [[joke]], not to be taken literally. The joke is completed with the [[punch line]] of the joke. Another traditional narrative marker in English is the framing of a fairy tale between the phrases \"[[Once upon a time]]\" and \"They all lived happily ever after.\" Many languages have [[Once upon a time#Other languages|similar phrases]] which are used to frame a traditional tale. Each of these linguistic formulas removes the bracketed text from ordinary discourse, and marks it as a recognized form of stylized, formulaic communication for both the performer and the audience.\n\n===In the subjunctive voice===\nFraming as a narrative device serves to signal to both the story teller and the audience that the narrative which follows is indeed a fiction (verbal lore), and not to be understood as historical fact or reality. It moves the framed narration into the [[subjunctive mood]], and marks a space in which \"fiction, history, story, tradition, art, teaching, all exist within the narrated or performed expressive 'event' outside the normal realms and constraints of reality or time.\"<ref>{{harv|Sims|Stephens|page=141}}</ref> This shift from the [[realis mood|realis]] to the [[irrealis mood]] is understood by all participants within the reference group. It enables these fictional events to contain meaning for the group, and can lead to very real consequences.<ref>{{harv|Ben-Amos|1997a}}</ref>\n\n===Anderson's law of auto-correction===\nThe theory of self-correction in folklore transmission was first articulated by the folklorist [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] in the 1920s; this posits a feedback mechanism which would keep folklore variants closer to the original form.<ref>{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=131}}</ref><ref group=note>Anderson is best known for his monograph ''[[King John and the Bishop|Kaiser und Abt]]'' (Folklore Fellows' Communications 42, Helsinki 1923) on folktales of type AT 922.</ref>\nThis theory addresses the question about how, with multiple performers and multiple audiences, the artifact maintains its identity across time and geography. Anderson credited the audience with censoring narrators who deviated too far from the known (traditional) text.<ref>{{harv|El-Shamy|1997}}</ref>\n\nAny performance is a two-way communication process. The performer addresses the audience with words and actions; the audience in turn actively responds to the performer. If this performance deviates too far from audience expectations of the familiar folk artifact, they will respond with negative feedback. Wanting to avoid more negative reaction, the performer will adjust his performance to conform to audience expectations. \"Social reward by an audience [is] a major factor in motivating narrators...\"<ref name=\"El-Shamy\">{{harv|El-Shamy|1997|page=71}}</ref> It is this dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience which gives stability to the text of the performance.<ref>{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=127}}</ref>\n\nIn reality, this model is not so simplistic; there is multiple redundancy in the active folklore process. The performer has heard the tale multiple times, he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions. In turn, he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience, and they expect to hear the version they know. This expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance; corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate.<ref>{{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=131\u2013132}}</ref> \"At the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the 'virality' of meme transmission... it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity [of the artifact] in certain features ... sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type.\"<ref>{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=138}}</ref>\n\n===Context of material lore===\nFor material folk artifacts, it becomes more fruitful to return to the terminology of Alan Dundes: text and context. Here the text designates the physical artifact itself, the single item made by an individual for a specific purpose. The context is then unmasked by observation and questions concerning both its production and its usage. Why was it made, how was it made, who will use it, how will they use it, where did the raw materials come from, who designed it, etc. These questions are limited only by the skill of the interviewer.\n\nIn his study of southeastern Kentucky chair makers, Michael Owen Jones describes production of a chair within the context of the life of the craftsman.<ref>{{harv|Jones|1975}}</ref> For [[Henry Glassie]] in his study of Folk Housing in Middle Virginia<ref>{{harv|Glassie|1975}}</ref> the investigation concerns the historical pattern he finds repeated in the dwellings of this region: the house is planted in the landscape just as the landscape completes itself with the house.<ref>{{harv|Glassie|1983|page=125}}</ref> The artisan in his roadside stand or shop in the nearby town wants to make and display products which appeal to customers. There is \"a craftsperson's eagerness to produce 'satisfactory items' due to a close personal contact with the customer and expectations to serve the customer again.\" Here the role of consumer \"... is the basic force responsible for the continuity and discontinuity of behavior.\"<ref name=\"El-Shamy\" />\n\nIn material culture the context becomes the cultural environment in which the object is made (chair), used (house), and sold (wares). None of these artisans is \"anonymous\" folk; they are individuals making a living with the tools and skills learned within and valued in the context of their community.\n\n===Toelken's conservative-dynamic continuum===\nNo two performances are identical. The performer attempts to keep the performance within expectations, but this happens despite a multitude of changing variables. He has given this performance one time more or less, the audience is different, the social and political environment has changed. In the context of material culture, no two hand-crafted items are identical. Sometimes these deviations in the performance and the production are unintentional, just part of the process. But sometimes these deviations are intentional; the performer or artisan want to play with the boundaries of expectation and add their own creative touch. They perform within the tension of conserving the recognized form and adding innovation.\n\nThe folklorist Barre Toelken identifies this tension as \"... a combination of both changing (\"dynamic\") and static (\"conservative\") elements that evolve and change through sharing, communication and performance.\"<ref>{{harv|Sims|Stephens|2005|page=10}}</ref> Over time, the cultural context shifts and morphs: new leaders, new technologies, new values, new awareness. As the context changes, so must the artifact, for without modifications to map existing artifacts into the evolving cultural landscape, they lose their meaning. [[Joke|Joking]] as an active form of verbal lore makes this tension visible as [[Joke#Joke cycles|joke cycles]] come and go to reflect new issues of concern. Once an artifact is no longer applicable to the context, transmission becomes a nonstarter; it loses relevancy for a contemporary audience. If it is not transmitted, then it is no longer folklore and becomes instead an historic relic.<ref name=\"El-Shamy\" />\n\n===In the electronic age ===\nIt is too soon to identify how the advent of electronic communications will modify and change the performance and transmission of folklore artifacts. Just by looking at the development of one type of verbal lore, [[Joke#Electronic joking|electronic joking]], it is clear that the internet is modifying folkloric process, not killing it. Jokes and joking are as plentiful as ever both in traditional face-to-face interactions and through electronic transmission. New communication modes are also transforming traditional stories into many different configurations. The fairy tale [[Snow White]] is now offered in [[Snow White (disambiguation)|multiple media forms]] for both children and adults, including a television show, a video game, and a programming language.\n\nA more generalized analysis of [[Folkloristics#Leaning into the 21st century|folklore in the electronic age]] will have to wait for further studies to be published in the field.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Folklore}}\n{{For| a list of folklores of countries|Category:Folklore by country}}\n{{For| a list of folklores of European countries|European folklore}}\n{{For| a list of folklores by region|Category:Folklore by region}}\n{{For| a list of folklores by ethnicity|Category:Folklore by ethnicity}}\n* [[Applied folklore]]\n* [[Costumbrismo]]\n* [[Family folklore]]\n* [[Folkloristics]]\n* [[Intangible cultural heritage]]\n* [[Legend]]\n* [[Memetics]]\n* [[Public folklore]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Abrahams|first1=Roger D.|chapter=Personal Power and Social Restraint|pages=20\u201339|editor1-last=Bauman|editor1-first=Richard|editor2-last=Paredes|editor2-first=Americo|title=Toward New Perspectives in Folklore|date=1972|publisher=Trickster Press|location=Bloomington, IN}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Anderson|first1=Walter|title= Kaiser und Abt.

Some fusion cuisines have themselves become accepted as a national cuisine, as with Peruvian Nikkei cuisine, which combines Japanese spices and seasonings and Peruvian ingredients like aj\u00ed (Peruvian peppers) with seafood.

For example, Hayes describes a \"[[block world]]\" with rules about stacking blocks together. In a FOL system, additional [[axiom]]s are required to make inferences about the environment (for example, that a block cannot change position unless it is physically moved).

In the logical context, actions are typically specified by what they change, with the implicit assumption that everything else (the frame) remains unchanged.\n\n==Description==\nThe frame problem occurs even in very simple domains. A scenario with a door, which can be open or closed, and a light, which can be on or off, is statically represented by two [[proposition]]s <math>\\textit{open}</math> and <math>\\textit{on}</math>. If these conditions can change, they are better represented by two [[Predicate (computer programming)|predicate]]s <math>\\textit{open}(t)</math> and <math>\\textit{on}(t)</math> that depend on time; such predicates are called [[fluent (artificial intelligence)|fluent]]s. A domain in which the door is closed and the light off at time 0, and the door opened at time 1, can be directly represented in logic{{clarify|reason=What kind of logic? If ordinary predicate logic is meant, what is the purpose of the 'true \u2192' in the 3rd formula? If some other logic (situation calculus?) is meant, it should be stated explicitly here, together with the purpose of the 'true \u2192' (e.g. some empty action?) in that logic.|date=August 2013}} by the following formulae:\n\n:<math>\\neg \\textit{open}(0)</math>\n:<math>\\neg \\textit{on}(0)</math>\n:<math>\\textit{true} \\rightarrow \\textit{open}(1)</math>\n\nThe first two formulae represent the initial situation; the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1. If such an action had preconditions, such as the door being unlocked, it would have been represented by <math>\\neg \\textit{locked}(0) \\rightarrow \\textit{open}(1)</math>. In practice, one would have a predicate <math>\\textit{executeopen}(t)</math> for specifying when an action is executed and a rule <math>\\forall t . \\textit{executeopen}(t) \\wedge \\textit{true} \\rightarrow \\textit{open}(t+1)</math> for specifying the effects of actions.  The article on the [[situation calculus]] gives more details.\n\nWhile the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what is known, they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences. While the following conditions (representing the expected situation) are consistent with the three formulae above, they are not the only ones.\n\n:{|\n| <math>\\neg \\textit{open}(0)</math> &nbsp; &nbsp;  || <math>\\textit{open}(1)</math>\n|-\n| <math>\\neg \\textit{on}(0)</math>   || <math>\\neg \\textit{on}(1)</math>\n|}\n\nIndeed, another set of conditions that is consistent with the three formulae above is:\n\n:{|\n| <math>\\neg \\textit{open}(0)</math> &nbsp; &nbsp;  || <math>\\textit{open}(1)</math>\n|-\n| <math>\\neg \\textit{on}(0)</math>   || <math>\\textit{on}(1)</math>\n|}\n\nThe frame problem is that specifying only which conditions are changed by the actions does not entail that all other conditions are not changed. This problem can be solved by adding the so-called \u201cframe axioms\u201d, which explicitly specify that all conditions not affected by actions are not changed while executing that action. For example, since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door, a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1:\n\n:<math>\\textit{on}(0) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{on}(1)</math>\n\nThe frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition.{{clarify|reason=Shouldn't then the frame axiom be the following modification of the above rule: '\u2200t.executeopen(t)\u2192open(t+1)\u2227(on(t+1)\u2194on(t))' ? In contrast, the formula 'on(0)\u2194on(1)' seems to be too particular taylored to the 'executeopen(0)' situation.|date=August 2013}} In other words, the problem is that of formalizing a dynamical domain without explicitly specifying the frame axioms.\n\nThe solution proposed by McCarthy to solve this problem involves assuming that a minimal amount of condition changes have occurred; this solution is formalized using the framework of [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]. The [[Yale shooting problem]], however, shows that this solution is not always correct. Alternative solutions were then proposed, involving predicate completion, fluent occlusion, [[successor state axiom]]s, etc.; they are explained below. By the end of the 1980s, the frame problem as defined by McCarthy and Hayes was solved{{clarify|reason=Mention the (combination of) approach(es) by which the frame problem was solved.|date=August 2013}}. Even after that, however, the term \u201cframe problem\u201d was still used, in part to refer to the same problem but under different settings (e.g., concurrent actions), and in part to refer to the general problem of representing and reasoning with dynamical domains.\n\n== Solutions ==\nThe following solutions depict how the frame problem is solved in various formalisms. The formalisms themselves are not presented in full: what is presented are simplified versions that are sufficient to explain the full solution.\n\n===Fluent occlusion solution===\nThis solution was proposed by [[Erik Sandewall]], who also defined a [[formal language]] for the specification of dynamical domains; therefore, such a domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically translated into logic. In this article, only the expression in logic is shown, and only in the simplified language with no action names.\n\nThe rationale of this solution is to represent not only the value of conditions over time, but also whether they can be affected by the last executed action. The latter is represented by another condition, called occlusion. A condition is said to be ''occluded'' in a given time point if an action has been just executed that makes the condition true or false as an effect. Occlusion can be viewed as \u201cpermission to change\u201d: if a condition is occluded, it is relieved from obeying the constraint of inertia.\n\nIn the simplified example of the door and the light, occlusion can be formalized by two predicates <math>\\textit{occludeopen}(t)</math> and <math>\\textit{occludeon}(t)</math>. The rationale is that a condition can change value only if the corresponding occlusion predicate is true at the next time point. In turn, the occlusion predicate is true only when an action affecting the condition is executed.\n\n:<math>\\neg \\textit{open}(0)</math>\n:<math>\\neg \\textit{on}(0)</math>\n:<math>\\textit{true} \\rightarrow \\textit{open}(1) \\wedge \\textit{occludeopen}(1)</math>\n:<math>\\forall t . \\neg \\textit{occludeopen}(t) \\rightarrow (\\textit{open}(t-1) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{open}(t))</math>\n:<math>\\forall t . \\neg \\textit{occludeon}(t) \\rightarrow (\\textit{on}(t-1) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{on}(t))</math>\n\nIn general, every action making a condition true or false also makes the corresponding occlusion predicate true. In this case, <math>\\textit{occludeopen}(1)</math> is true, making the antecedent of the fourth formula above false for <math>t=1</math>; therefore, the constraint that <math>\\textit{open}(t-1) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{open}(t)</math> does not hold for <math>t=1</math>. Therefore, <math>\\textit{open}</math> can change value, which is also what is enforced by the third formula.\n\nIn order for this condition to work, occlusion predicates have to be true only when they are made true as an effect of an action. This can be achieved either by [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]] or by predicate completion. It is worth noticing that occlusion does not necessarily imply a change: for example, executing the action of opening the door when it was already open (in the formalization above) makes the predicate <math>\\textit{occludeopen}</math> true and makes <math>\\textit{open}</math> true; however, <math>\\textit{open}</math> has not changed value, as it was true already.\n\n===Predicate completion solution===\nThis encoding is similar to the fluent occlusion solution, but the additional predicates denote change, not permission to change. For example, <math>\\textit{changeopen}(t)</math> represents the fact that the predicate <math>\\textit{open}</math> will change from time <math>t</math> to <math>t+1</math>. As a result, a predicate changes if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true. An action results in a change if and only if it makes true a condition that was previously false or vice versa.\n\n:<math>\\neg \\textit{open}(0)</math>\n:<math>\\neg \\textit{on}(0)</math>\n:<math>\\neg \\textit{open}(0) \\wedge \\textit{true} \\rightarrow \\textit{changeopen}(0)</math>\n:<math>\\forall t. \\textit{changeopen}(t) \\leftrightarrow (\\neg \\textit{open}(t) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{open}(t+1))</math>\n:<math>\\forall t. \\textit{changeon}(t) \\leftrightarrow (\\neg \\textit{on}(t) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{on}(t+1))</math>\n\nThe third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened. Precisely, it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed. The last two conditions state that a condition changes value at time <math>t</math> if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true at time <math>t</math>. To complete the solution, the time points in which the change predicates are true have to be as few as possible, and this can be done by applying predicate completion to the rules specifying the effects of actions.\n\n===Successor state axioms solution===\nThe value of a condition after the execution of an action can be determined by\nthe fact that the condition is true if and only if:\n\n# the action makes the condition true; or\n# the condition was previously true and the action does not make it false.\n\nA [[successor state axiom]] is a formalization in logic of these two facts. For\nexample, if <math>\\textit{opendoor}(t)</math> and <math>\\textit{closedoor}(t)</math> are two\nconditions used to denote that the action executed at time <math>t</math> was\nto open or close the door, respectively, the running example is encoded as\nfollows.\n\n: <math>\\neg \\textit{open}(0)</math>\n: <math>\\neg \\textit{on}(0)</math>\n: <math>\\textit{opendoor}(0)</math>\n: <math>\\forall t . \\textit{open}(t+1) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{opendoor}(t) \\vee (\\textit{open}(t) \\wedge \\neg \\textit{closedoor}(t))</math>\n\nThis solution is centered around the value of conditions, rather than the\neffects of actions. In other words, there is an axiom for every condition,\nrather than a formula for every action. Preconditions to actions (which are not\npresent in this example) are formalized by other formulae. The successor state\naxioms are used in the variant to the [[situation calculus]] proposed by\n[[Ray Reiter]].\n\n===Fluent calculus solution===\nThe [[fluent calculus]] is a variant of the situation calculus. It solves the frame problem by using first-order logic\n[[First-order logic#Formation rules|terms]], rather than predicates, to represent the states. Converting\npredicates into terms in first-order logic is called [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]]; the\nfluent calculus can be seen as a logic in which predicates representing the\nstate of conditions are reified.\n\nThe difference between a predicate and a term in first-order logic is that a term is a representation of an object (possibly a complex object composed of other objects), while a predicate represents a condition that can be true or false when evaluated over a given set of terms.\n\nIn the fluent calculus, each possible state is represented by a term obtained by composition of other terms, each one representing the conditions that are true in state. For example, the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term <math>\\textit{open} \\circ \\textit{on}</math>. It is important to notice that a term is not true or false by itself, as it is an object and not a condition. In other words, the term <math>\\textit{open} \\circ \\textit{on}</math> represent a possible state, and does not by itself mean that this is the current state. A separate condition can be stated to specify that this is actually the state at a given time, e.g., <math>\\textit{state}(\\textit{open} \\circ \\textit{on}, 10)</math> means that this is the state at time <math>10</math>.\n\nThe solution to the frame problem given in the fluent calculus is to specify the effects of actions by stating how a term representing the state changes when the action is executed. For example, the action of opening the door at time 0 is represented by the formula:\n\n: <math>\\textit{state}(s \\circ \\textit{open}, 1) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{state}(s,0)</math>\n\nThe action of closing the door, which makes a condition false instead of true, is represented in a slightly different way:\n\n: <math>\\textit{state}(s, 1) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{state}(s \\circ \\textit{open}, 0)</math>\n\nThis formula works provided that suitable axioms are given about <math>\\textit{state}</math> and <math>\\circ</math>, e.g., a term containing the same condition twice is not a valid state (for example, <math>\\textit{state}(\\textit{open} \\circ s \\circ \\textit{open}, t)</math> is always false for every <math>s</math> and <math>t</math>).\n\n===Event calculus solution===\nThe [[event calculus]] uses terms for representing fluents, like the fluent calculus, but also has axioms constraining the value of fluents, like the successor state axioms. In the event calculus, inertia is enforced by formulae stating that a fluent is true if it has been true at a given previous time point and no action changing it to false has been performed in the meantime. Predicate completion is still needed in the event calculus for obtaining that a fluent is made true only if an action making it true has been performed, but also for obtaining that an action had been performed only if that is explicitly stated.\n\n===Default logic solution===\nThe frame problem can be thought of as the problem of formalizing the principle that, by default, \"everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is\" ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], \"An Introduction to a Secret Encyclop\u00e6dia\", ''c''. 1679).  This default, sometimes called the ''commonsense law of inertia'', was expressed by [[Raymond Reiter]] in [[default logic]]:\n\n: <math>\\frac{R(x,s)\\; :\\ R(x,\\textit{do}(a,s))}{R(x,\\textit{do}(a,s))}</math>\n\n(if <math>R(x)</math> is true in situation <math>s</math>, and it can be assumed<ref>i.e., no contradicting information is known</ref> that <math>R(x)</math> remains true after executing action <math>a</math>, then we can conclude that <math>R(x)</math> remains true).\n\nSteve Hanks and [[Drew McDermott]] argued, on the basis of their [[Yale shooting problem|Yale shooting]] example, that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory.  Hudson Turner showed, however, that it works correctly in the presence of appropriate additional postulates.\n\n===Answer set programming solution===\nThe counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of [[answer set programming]] is a rule with [[stable model semantics#Strong negation|strong negation]]:\n\n:<math>r(X,T+1) \\leftarrow r(X,T),\\ \\hbox{not }\\sim r(X,T+1)</math>\n\n(if <math>r(X)</math> is true at time <math>T</math>, and it can be assumed that <math>r(X)</math> remains true at time <math>T+1</math>, then we can conclude that <math>r(X)</math> remains true).\n\n===Action description languages===\n[[Action description language]]s elude the frame problem rather than solving it. An action description language is a formal language with a syntax that is specific for describing situations and actions. For example, that the action <math>\\textit{opendoor}</math> makes the door open if not locked is expressed by:\n\n: <math>\\textit{opendoor}</math> causes <math>\\textit{open}</math> if <math>\\neg \\textit{locked}</math>\n\nThe semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express (concurrent actions, delayed effects, etc.) and is usually based on [[transition system]]s.\n\nSince domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic, the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic. Typically, however, a translation is given from these languages to [[answer set programming]] rather than first-order logic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Yale shooting problem]]\n* [[Binding problem]]\n* [[Ramification problem]]\n* [[Qualification problem]]\n* [[Common sense]]\n* [[Commonsense reasoning]]\n* [[Defeasible reasoning]]\n* [[Non-monotonic logic]]\n* [[Symbol grounding]]\n* [[Linear logic]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Doherty | first1 = P. | last2 = Gustafsson | first2 = J. | last3 = Karlsson | first3 = L. | last4 = Kvarnstr\u00f6m | first4 = J. | year = 1998 | title = TAL: Temporal action logics language specification and tutorial | url = http://www.ep.liu.se/ej/etai/1998/009 | journal = Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence | volume = 2 | issue = 3-4| pages = 273\u2013306 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Gelfond | first1 = M. | last2 = Lifschitz | first2 = V. | year = 1993 | title = Representing action and change by logic programs | url = | journal = Journal of Logic Programming | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 301\u2013322 | doi=10.1016/0743-1066(93)90035-f}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Gelfond | first1 = M. | last2 = Lifschitz | first2 = V. | year = 1998 | title = Action languages | url = http://www.ep.liu.se/ej/etai/1998/007 | journal = Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence | volume = 2 | issue = 3-4| pages = 193\u2013210 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Hanks | first1 = S. | last2 = McDermott | first2 = D. | year = 1987 | title = Nonmonotonic logic and temporal projection | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 379\u2013412 | doi=10.1016/0004-3702(87)90043-9}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Levesque | first1 = H. | authorlink3 = Raymond Reiter | last2 = Pirri | first2 = F. | last3 = Reiter | first3 = R. | year = 1998 | title = Foundations for the situation calculus | url = http://www.ep.liu.se/ej/etai/1998/005 | journal = Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence | volume = 2 | issue = 3-4| pages = 159\u2013178 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Liberatore | first1 = P. | year = 1997 | title = The complexity of the language A | url = http://www.ep.liu.se/ej/etai/1997/002 | journal = [[Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1-3| pages = 13\u201337 }}\n* {{cite journal |first=V. |last=Lifschitz |year=2012 |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vl/papers/jmc.pdf |title=The frame problem, then and now |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]]}} Presented at ''Celebration of John McCarthy's Accomplishments'', [[Stanford University]], March 25, 2012.\n* {{cite journal | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = J. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = P.

Peyton]], first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1967 with illustrations by [[Victor Ambrus]]. Alternatively, \"Flambards\" is the trilogy (1967\u20131969) or series (1967\u20131981) named after its first book. The series is set in England just before, during, and after [[World War I]].\n\nThe novel ''Flambards'' (book one) features a teenage orphan and heiress Christina Parsons, who comes to live at Flambards, the impoverished [[Essex]] [[Estate (land)|estate]] owned by her crippled and tyrannical uncle, William Russell, and his two sons, Mark and Will.\n\n== Novel summary ==\n\nChristina Parsons, who has been shunted around the family since she was orphaned at the age of five years in 1901, is sent to live at Flambards with her mother's half-brother, the crippled Russell. Her Aunt Grace speculates that Russell plans for Christina to marry his son Mark to restore Flambards to its former glory using the money that she will inherit on her twenty-first birthday. Mark is as brutish as his father, with a great love for hunting, whereas the younger son William is terrified of horses after a hunting accident and aspires to be an aviator. Christina soon finds friendship with the injured William, who challenges her ideas on class boundaries, as well as her love for horses and hunting. William and Christina eventually fall in love and run away from the hunt ball to London, hoping to marry.\n\n==Series==\n\nThe fourth book controversially reversed the ending of the original trilogy, twelve years later and following the television series.\n\n* ''Flambards'' (Oxford, 1967)\n* ''[[The Edge of the Cloud]]'' (Oxford, 1969)\n* ''[[Flambards in Summer]]'' (Oxford, 1969)\n* ''[[Flambards Divided]]'' (1981)\n\nFor ''The Edge of the Cloud'', Peyton won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].<ref name=medal1969/> She was a commended runner-up for both the first and third books, the latter in competition with her Medal-winning work.<ref name=ccsu/><ref group=lower-alpha name=HC/>\n\nShe also won the 1970 [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], conferred by ''The Guardian'' newspaper and judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=relaunch/> Ordinarily the prize recognises one fiction book published during the preceding calendar year; exceptionally Peyton won for the Flambards trilogy completed in 1969.<ref name=peyton/><ref group=lower-alpha name=GCFP/>\n\nThe trilogy was [[film adaptation|adapted]] as a 13-part television series in 1979, ''[[Flambards (TV series)|Flambards]]'' starring [[Christine McKenna]] as Christina Parsons.\n\nWorld Publishing issued a US edition of the first book in 1968, retaining the Ambrus illustrations.<ref name=LCC2/> World (Cleveland and New York) also published US editions of the second and third books in 1969 and 1970, also with the original illustrations, although all three novels were reset with a greater page-counts.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar |Children's literature |Horses }} <!-- delete \"bar\" when there are about two ordinary See also -->\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=lower-alpha |refs=\n<ref group=lower-alpha name=HC>\nSince 1995 there are usually eight books on the Carnegie shortlist.  \nAccording to CCSU some runners up through 2002 were Commended (from 1955) or Highly Commended (from 1966).

Written by [[Irish people|Irish]] writers [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]] & [[Graham Linehan]] and starring a predominantly Irish cast, it originally aired over three series from 21 April 1995 until 1 May 1998, including a Christmas special, for a total of [[List of Father Ted episodes|25 episodes]]. The show aired on [[RT\u00c9 Two]] in Ireland, and in Australia on [[Nine Network]] (series 1) and [[ABC Television]] (series 2 and 3).\n\nSet on the fictional Craggy Island, a remote location off Ireland's west coast, the show starred [[Dermot Morgan]] as the eponymous [[Father Ted Crilly]], alongside fellow priests [[Father Dougal McGuire]] ([[Ardal O'Hanlon]]) and [[Father Jack Hackett]] ([[Frank Kelly]]). Exiled on the island for various past incidents, the priests live together in the [[parochial house]] with their housekeeper [[Mrs Doyle]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]). The show was critically acclaimed, receiving several [[BAFTA]] awards, and remains a popular sitcom in Britain and Ireland. In 2004, it was ranked Number 11 in a poll to find [[Britain's Best Sitcom]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Further|List of Father Ted characters}}\nThe show follows the misadventures of three Irish [[Roman Catholic]] priests who live in a parish on the fictional Craggy Island, located off the west coast of [[Ireland]]. [[Father Ted Crilly]], [[Father Dougal McGuire]] and [[Father Jack Hackett]] live chaotically together in Craggy Island's parochial house, along with their housekeeper [[Mrs Doyle]], who always wants to serve them tea.\n\nThe three priests answer to Bishop [[List of Father Ted characters#Bishop Brennan|Len Brennan]], who has banished them to Craggy Island as punishment for different incidents in their past: Ted for alleged financial impropriety (apparently involving some money 'resting' in his account and a child being deprived of a visit to [[Lourdes]] so that Ted could go to [[Las Vegas]]), Dougal for something only referred to as the \"Blackrock Incident\" (resulting in many nuns' \"lives [being] irreparably damaged\"), and Jack for his [[alcoholism]] and [[Lothario|womanising]], particularly for an incident at a wedding in [[Athlone]].\n\nThe show revolves around the priests' lives on Craggy Island, sometimes dealing with matters of the church but more often dealing with Father Ted's schemes to either resolve a situation with the parish or other Craggy Island residents, or to win games of one-upmanship against his enemy, Father Dick Byrne of the nearby Rugged Island parish.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Father Ted episodes}}\n''Father Ted'' ran for three series from 1995 to 1998, including a Christmas special.

The trio began writing comedy sketches to accompany their act. Mathews created the Father Ted character for his short-lived stand-up routine. Before The Joshua Trio played at gigs, Mathews would occasionally come on-stage as Father Ted and tell jokes involving his great friend, Father Dougal McGuire.<ref name=\"Independent\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/incoming/u2-beware-its-the-joshua-trio-musical-26789120.html|title=U2 beware \u2013 It's the Joshua Trio musical|date=5 November 2011|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Mathews left his job at ''Hot Press'' and moved into Linehan's London home. Over the next three to four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows while at the same time writing for sketch shows such as ''[[The All New Alexei Sayle Show]]'' and ''[[The Fast Show]]''. One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called ''Irish Lives'', with six episodes, each focusing on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|Maynooth College]]. Producer [[Geoffrey Perkins]] suggested that the episode's concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.<ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.ie/index.php/component/content/article/13-entertainment-news/138-graham-linehan-father-ted-was-a-specific-kind-of-magic |title=Graham Linehan: 'Father Ted was a specific kind of magic' |last=O'Malley |first=JP |work=irishpost.ie |accessdate=7 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-arthur-mathews-and-graham-linehan-1244844.html|title=HOW WE MET: ARTHUR MATHEWS AND GRAHAM LINEHAN|last=Feay|first=Suzi|work=independent.co.uk|date=10 August 1997|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nMathews was originally intended to play Ted, but decided he lacked the acting ability the role required. [[Maurice O'Donoghue]], who plays Father Dick in the series, was their second choice for the role of Ted, being the right age and having a similar look and lightness.

When Pulp declined involvement, they contacted [[Neil Hannon]], frontman of Northern Irish [[chamber pop]] band [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]]. Hannon's first effort, a jaunty composition, was rejected on Geoffrey Perkins's advice. Hannon composed a second theme, which the team found acceptable. This theme was recorded by Hannon and co-producer [[Darren Allison]] at [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]'s private studio. One of [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]]'s guitars was selected by Allison and Hannon to carry the main tune, which was played by Hannon.  Both themes were also reworked, with new lyrics, for inclusion on The Divine Comedy's 1996 album ''[[Casanova (The Divine Comedy album)|Casanova]]'': the final ''Father Ted'' theme became \"Songs of Love\", while Hannon's rejected theme became \"A Woman of the World\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashortsite.com/songs/?keyword=fatherted |title=Father Ted Theme |work=ashortsite.com |accessdate=10 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106005804/http://www.ashortsite.com/songs/?keyword=fatherted |archivedate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>As stated by Neil Hannon in the documentary ''Half Minute Melodies'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 3 February 2000.

He [Hannon] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and \"Songs of Love\", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [Perkins] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.'

It's a job to him. He doesn't care about religion.\" While writing, he says the show's creators imagined Ted and Dougal as \"just two people who happen to be [priests]\".<ref name=\"Baird interview\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Father Ted'' was met with critical acclaim and is one of the most popular sitcoms in Irish TV history.<ref>Bex, T, Burke, M. & Stockwell, P.

The remake would be scripted by [[Spike Feresten]], who previously wrote for US sitcoms ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Ferensten stated: \"I was raised Catholic and this show just felt right to me. The essence of the show is about men who are also priests and, as men, they have many foibles.\" Hat Trick founders [[Denise O'Donoghue]] and [[Jimmy Mulville]] were set to produce. The US production company was Pariah Productions, which previously adapted ''[[The Kumars at No. 42]]'' for an American audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/01/broadcasting|title=Father Ted crosses the pond|work=guardian.co.uk|last=Cozens|first=Claire|date=1 July 2003|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2004, Supanet Limited reported that an American remake was in development. This version would be set on a fictional island off the coast of New York. [[Steve Martin]] and [[Graham Norton]] would reportedly play Ted and Dougal. Martin had not been expected to take the role because of his stature, but agreed because he was a fan of the original series, and would reportedly be paid \u00a3500,000 per episode. Norton was cast based on his popularity with American audiences, and in reference to his appearance as Father Noel Furlong in the original series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/cgi-bin/news/showfeed.pl?id=1079275308-2&area=entertainment |title=Martin And Norton Team Up Martin And Norton Team Up |publisher=[[Supanet Limited]] |date=14 March 2004 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040423160956/http://www.supanet.com/cgi-bin/news/showfeed.pl?id=1079275308-2&area=entertainment |archivedate=23 April 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, a separate American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version would be set in an unfortunate fishing village in [[New England]]. American actor [[John Michael Higgins]] was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the show's religious themes: \"The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We don't have that in our country, we're frightened of it. It's basically that you guys are doing an Irish joke also, we don't have that.

He stated that he would never revive the television series itself, \"because of the risk you poison people's memories of the original\", but that the completely new format would make the project worthwhile. Linehan mentioned the possibility of a dance number with \"spinning cardinals\". He said that the musical would have to reference the [[Roman Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland|Catholic child abuse scandals]], stating, \"The jokes would have to have a little bit more edge, because you just can't ignore this stuff.\" Mathews was \"not as convinced\" of the musical idea, though Linehan still insisted it could work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-01-05/father-ted-the-musical-is-a-heavenly-idea-says-graham-linehan|title=Father Ted the musical is a heavenly idea says Graham Linehan|last=Dowell|first=Ben|publisher=''[[Radio Times]]''|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December, Mathews said that he and Paul Woodfull were developing a Joshua Trio musical and a show focusing on a \"[[Michael Cleary (priest)|Father Michael Cleary]]-type character\", and that the ''Father Ted'' musical may follow.

This was the first time that Fosters had been available on draught anywhere in the world; in Australia it had only been available first in bottles, then later in cans. The draught product was based on Carlton Lager,{{cn|date=August 2017}} another Carlton United Brewers product, and it was first brewed in the UK at the pilot brewery at Truman's Brick Lane Brewery in mid 1981. In 1986, Courage obtained the rights to brew and distribute Foster's alongside Watney Mann and Truman Brewers.  This was a result of a deal done following Courage's acquisition by Carlton United Breweries,{{when|date=August 2017}}{{cn|date=August 2017}} which by that time had been re-named as Foster's Brewing Group.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  In 1990, Courage took over Watney Mann and Truman Brewers following the pubs for breweries swap with WMTB's parent company Grand Met.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 2011, CUB and its product lines, including Foster's, were bought by the South African and British conglomerate [[SABMiller]], which in turn was incorporated into the multinational (Belgian, Brazilian, and American) [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] in 2016.{{cn|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Production==\nAdvertising from the early 20th century claimed Foster's Lager was [[adjuncts|adjuncted]] with cane sugar.<ref name=\"auspostalhistory.com\"/> A number of breweries advertised a sugar content, (e.g. [[Queensland Brewery Ltd|Bulimba]]), as it implied a lighter less bitter brew than was commonly sold.

Foster's Draught was introduced, served on tap alongside established draught brands such as Castlemaine XXXX and Toohey's Draught. Despite some initial success, bolstered by heavy advertising, the brand did not prove to be popular and was eventually withdrawn from sale.

At its commencement, the sponsorship by Foster's was the most lucrative sponsorship ever given to an English football club.\n\nThe brand sponsored [[Formula One]] events regularly from 1986 to 2006.

The three overlapping seals on the left are the seal of the [[U.S. Department of State]] (similar to the [[Great Seal of the United States]]) and the seal of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] while on the right is the seal of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]]]\n\nThe '''FBI Most Wanted Terrorists''' was a list created and first released on October 10, 2001, with the authority of [[United States President]] Bush, following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]]. Initially, the list contained 22 of the top terrorists chosen by the [[FBI]], all of whom had earlier been indicted for acts of terrorism between 1985 and 1998. None of the 22 had been captured by US or other authorities by that date. Of the 22, only [[Osama bin Laden]] was by then already listed on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list.\n\nNo particular legal consequences flowed from the creation of and inclusion on the list. On January 17, 2002, the FBI released a third major FBI wanted list, which has now become known as the [[FBI Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism list]], to enlist the public's help in reporting information which may prevent future terrorist attacks. The information sought to be reported is not necessarily relating to any person on any of the FBI wanted lists.\n\n==Initial persons alleged to be terrorist fugitives==\nOn the fugitive group wanted poster, the FBI did not list the persons in any particular stated order, except perhaps for the consistent placing of bin Laden in the number one position of the top row. However, the 22 can easily fit into distinct categories of over the two decades, based on the [[terrorist attacks]] in which they were, according to US authorities, involved. \n\nFor organization and ease of reference here, the relevant major terrorist attacks are listed by date below, with a brief summary for each, identifying the terror cells most directly responsible for the attack. The 22 on the list are then grouped beneath the attack for which each person was first accused of involvement.<ref name=\"List Released\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/10/inv.mostwanted.list/ |title=Most wanted terrorists list released |date=October 1, 2001 |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714134800/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/10/inv.mostwanted.list/ |archivedate=July 14, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

To enlist the public's help in this effort, the FBI sought a way to deliver the early known suspected terror attack information, often very limited, out to the public as quickly as possible. So, on January 17, 2002, the third major FBI wanted list was first released, which has now become known as the [[FBI Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism list]].\n\nAs the name of this list implies, the FBI's intent is to acquire any critical information from the public, as soon as possible, about the suspected terrorists, who may be in the planning stages of terror attacks against United States nationals at home and abroad. The first such list profiled five persons about whom little was known, but who were suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in [[martyr]]dom operations. The main evidence against the five was five videos they had produced, found in the rubble of [[Mohammed Atef]]'s destroyed home outside [[Kabul, Afghanistan|Kabul]], Afghanistan.\n\n==Additions to the list==\nBy 2006, more than four years had passed since the FBI had listed the original 22 alleged terrorists on the Most Wanted Terrorist list. Of those 22, by then four had been qualified for removal from the list, due to death or capture. Also by then, the FBI determined that new persons qualified to be listed as Most Wanted Terrorists. Some of these persons were indicted for attacks and plots that had taken place since the original list had been compiled. The original indictments had been for incidents only through 1998. Since then, the U.S. had become victim to at least two major terror attacks, which would generate some of the new indictments for the Most Wanted Terrorists, notably:\n\n* [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded 40 on October 12, 2000, off the port coast of [[Aden, Yemen]]\n* [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in [[Manhattan]], [[Washington D.C.]], and [[Pennsylvania]]\n\nIn addition, after the original 2001 list had been compiled and released to the public, the U.S. had foiled and issued indictments for numerous other plots, involving some new listed Most Wanted Terrorists. Those notable other plots involved:<ref name=\"release\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mwtl_yemen022306.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411074732/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mwtl_yemen022306.htm|archivedate=April 11, 2010|title=Recent Escapees From Yemen Prison Added to Most Wanted Terrorists and Seeking Information - War on Terrorism Lists|date=February 23, 2006|accessdate=August 14, 2012|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref>\n\n* The [[Buffalo Six]], a [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York cell, or Lackawanna Cell, exposed September 2002\n* [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], on [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) charges for plots based from [[Syria]] since 1995\n* [[Abu Sayyaf]] kidnappings and murders of foreign nationals in the [[Philippines]]\nIn February 2006, the FBI completed two groups of additions to the Most Wanted Terrorists list, the first such additions in over four years. On February 24, 2006, the day after adding two name to the list, the FBI added an additional six fugitive terrorists, for various plots and attacks. One of the entries was for an indictment dating back to the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA flight 847 by Hezbollah (see above).\n\nAdditionally, the FBI also added to the Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism list an additional three persons, most notably, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the notorious leader of [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]].<ref name=\"24threlease\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mostwantedterrorists022406.htm|title=FBI Updates Most Wanted Terrorists and Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism Lists|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830144046/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mostwantedterrorists022406.htm|archivedate=August 30, 2010|accessdate=January 3, 2012|date=February 24, 2010|publisher=FBI.gov}}</ref> This marked the first time that al-Zarqawi had appeared on any of the three major FBI wanted lists.

He served both as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] and as [[Lord Chancellor]] of England. After his death, his works remained influential in the development of the [[scientific method]] during the [[scientific revolution]].\n\nBacon has been called the father of [[empiricism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm |title=Empiricism: The influence of Francis Bacon, John Locke, and David Hume |publisher=Sweet Briar College|date= |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708012140/http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm|archivedate=2013-07-08}}</ref> His works argued for the possibility of [[science|scientific]] [[knowledge]] based only upon [[inductive reasoning]] and careful observation of events in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the ''[[Baconian method]]'', did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and [[methodology]] today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories\u2014history, poetry, and philosophy\u2014which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.\n\nBacon is the first recipient of the [[Queen's Counsel|Queen's counsel]] designation, which was conferred in 1597 when [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reserved Bacon as her legal advisor. After the accession of [[James VI and I|King James I]] in 1603,  Bacon was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. He was later created [[Baron Verulam]] in 1618{{sfnp|Adamson|1878|p=200}} and Viscount St. Alban in 1621.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contemporary spelling, used by Bacon himself in his letter of thanks to the king for his elevation.{{cite book |last=Birch |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Birch |title=Letters, Speeches, Charges, Advices, &c of Lord Chancellor Bacon |volume=6 |year=1763 |publisher=Andrew Millar |location=London |pages=271\u20132 |oclc=228676038 }}</ref> Because he had no heirs, both titles became extinct upon his death in 1626, at 65 years of age.

Inscription around his head reads: ''Si tabula daretur digna animum mallem'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"If one could but paint his mind\". [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]\n\nFrancis Bacon was born on 22 January 1561 at [[York House, Strand|York House]] near the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[London]], the son of [[Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper)|Sir Nicholas Bacon]] by his second wife, [[Anne Bacon|Anne (Cooke) Bacon]], the daughter of the noted [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] [[Anthony Cooke]]. His mother's sister was married to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], making Burghley Bacon's uncle.<ref>\"Sir Francis Bacon's Journals\". p. 191. universe, 2007</ref>\n\nBiographers believe that Bacon was educated at home in his early years owing to poor health, which would plague him throughout his life. He received tuition from John Walsall, a graduate of Oxford with a strong leaning toward [[Puritan]]ism. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on 5 April 1573 at the age of 12,<ref>{{acad|id=BCN573F|name=Bacon, Francis }}</ref> living for three years there, together with his older brother [[Anthony Bacon (1558\u20131601)|Anthony Bacon]] under the personal tutelage of [[John Whitgift|Dr John Whitgift]], future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Bacon's education was conducted largely in Latin and followed the medieval curriculum. He was also educated at the [[University of Poitiers]]. It was at Cambridge that he first met [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]], who was impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to calling him \"The young lord keeper\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Arthur |title=The English Baronetage: Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of All the English Baronets, Now Existing: Their Descents, Marriages, and Issues; Memorable Actions, Both in War, and Peace; Religious and Charitable Donations; Deaths, Places of Burial and Monumental Inscriptions {{sic}} |publisher=Printed for Tho.

His reverence for [[Aristotle]] conflicted with his rejection of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], which seemed to him barren, disputatious and wrong in its objectives.\n\n[[File:york Water Gate.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Italianate]] York Water Gate \u2013 the entry to York House, built about 1626, the year of Bacon's death]]\n\nOn 27 June 1576, he and Anthony entered ''de societate magistrorum'' at [[Gray's Inn]]. A few months later, Francis went abroad with Sir [[Amias Paulet]], the English ambassador at Paris, while Anthony continued his studies at home. The state of government and society in France under [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] afforded him valuable political instruction.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} For the next three years he visited [[Blois]], [[Poitiers]], [[Tours]], Italy, and Spain.<ref name=\"travels\">[[Stephen Gaukroger]] (2001). \"Francis Bacon and the Transformation of Early-Modern Philosophy\". p. 46.

On at least one occasion he delivered diplomatic letters to England for [[Francis Walsingham|Walsingham]], Burghley, and [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester]], as well as for the queen.<ref name=\"travels\"/>\n\nThe sudden death of his father in February 1579 prompted Bacon to return to England. Sir Nicholas had laid up a considerable sum of money to purchase an estate for his youngest son, but he died before doing so, and Francis was left with only a fifth of that money.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} Having borrowed money, Bacon got into debt. To support himself, he took up his residence in law at Gray's Inn in 1579,{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} his income being supplemented by a grant from his mother Lady Anne of the manor of [[Marks (manor house)|Marks]] near [[Romford]] in Essex, which generated a rent of \u00a346.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Spall | first = JEH | title = Francis Bacon's connections with Marks Manor House | journal = Romford Record | volume = No. 4 | pages = 32\u201337 | publisher = Romford and District Historical Society | location = Romford | date = 1971\n}}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentarian===\n[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]\n\nBacon stated that he had three goals: to uncover truth, to serve his country, and to serve his church. He sought to further these ends by seeking a prestigious post. In 1580, through his uncle, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], he applied for a post at court that might enable him to pursue a life of learning, but his application failed. For two years he worked quietly at [[Gray's Inn]], until he was admitted as an [[outer barrister]] in 1582.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Robert.

In 1584 he took his seat in [[Parliament of England|parliament]] for [[Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Melcombe]] in Dorset, and in 1586 for [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]]. At this time, he began to write on the condition of parties in the church, as well as on the topic of philosophical reform in the lost tract ''Temporis Partus Maximus''. Yet he failed to gain a position that he thought would lead him to success.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} He showed signs of sympathy to Puritanism, attending the sermons of the Puritan chaplain of Gray's Inn and accompanying his mother to the [[Temple Church]] to hear [[Walter Travers]]. This led to the publication of his earliest surviving tract, which criticised the English church's suppression of the Puritan clergy. In the Parliament of 1586, he openly urged execution for the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\nAbout this time, he again approached his powerful uncle for help; this move was followed by his rapid progress at the bar. He became a [[bencher]] in 1586 and was elected a [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Reader]] in 1587, delivering his first set of lectures in Lent the following year. In 1589, he received the valuable appointment of [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] to the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]], although he did not formally take office until 1608; the post was worth \u00a31,600 a year.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}}{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}\n\nIn 1588 he became MP for [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] and then for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]] in 1593.

Though a friend of the crown, he opposed feudal privileges and dictatorial powers. He spoke against religious persecution. He struck at the House of Lords in its usurpation of the Money Bills. He advocated for the union of England and Scotland, which made him a significant influence toward the consolidation of the United Kingdom; and he later would advocate for the integration of Ireland into the Union.

Throughout this period Bacon managed to stay in the favour of the king while retaining the confidence of the Commons.\n\nIn 1613 Bacon was finally appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|attorney general]], after advising the king to shuffle judicial appointments.

Although he was allowed to stay, parliament passed a law that forbade the attorney general to sit in parliament. His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as [[Lord Chancellor]]. On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon '''[[Baron Verulam]]''', of [[Verulamium|Verulam]], in the [[Peerage of England]];  he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}\n\nBacon continued to use his influence with the king to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage, as '''[[Viscount St Alban]]''', on 27 January 1621.\n\n===Lord Chancellor and public disgrace===\n[[File:Bacon vs Parliament.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon and the members of the Parliament on the day of his political fall]]\n\nBacon's public career ended in disgrace in 1621.

It is true that there were men in his own time, and will be men in all times, who are better pleased to count spots in the sun than to rejoice in its glorious brightness. Such men have openly libelled him, like Dewes and Weldon, whose falsehoods were detected as soon as uttered, or have fastened upon certain ceremonious compliments and dedications, the fashion of his day, as a sample of his servility, passing over his noble letters to the Queen, his lofty contempt for the Lord Keeper Puckering, his open dealing with Sir Robert Cecil, and with others, who, powerful when he was nothing, might have blighted his opening fortunes for ever, forgetting his advocacy of the rights of the people in the face of the court, and the true and honest counsels, always given by him, in times of great difficulty, both to Elizabeth and her successor.

He believed that philosophy and the natural world must be studied inductively, but argued that we can only study arguments for the existence of God. Information on His attributes (such as nature, action, and purposes) can only come from special revelation. But Bacon also held that knowledge was cumulative, that study encompassed more than a simple preservation of the past. \"Knowledge is the rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate,\" he wrote.

Bacon wrote two sonnets proclaiming his love for Alice. The first was written during his courtship and the second on his wedding day, 10 May 1606. When Bacon was appointed lord chancellor, \"by special Warrant of the King\", Lady Bacon was given precedence over all other Court ladies. Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, wrote in his biography of Bacon that his marriage was one of \"much conjugal love and respect\", mentioning a robe of honour that he gave to Alice and which \"she wore unto her dying day, being twenty years and more after his death\".<ref name=\"Rawley\" />\n\n[[File:Alice Barnham.gif|thumb|Engraving of [[Alice Barnham]]]]\n\nHowever, an increasing number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than she had once been accustomed to. It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, she complained bitterly. Bunten wrote in her ''Life of Alice Barnham''<ref>Alice Chambers Bunten, ''Life of Alice Barnham, Wife of Sir Francis Bacon'', London: Oliphants Ltd. 1928.</ref> that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends.

In his progressive view, humanity would be better if the access to educational resources were provided to the public. Hence the need to organize it. His approach to learning reshaped the Western view of our knowledge theory from an individual to a social interest. <br>\nThe original classification proposed by Bacon organized all types of knowledge in three general groups: history, poetry, and philosophy. He did that based on his understanding of how we process information: Memory, Imagination, and Reason, respectively. His methodical approach to the categorization of knowledge goes hand in hand with his principles of scientific methods. <br>\nWe owe Bacon, not only his inductive approach to science, but his efforts to bring his meticulous and systematic vision to the organization of information which was the platform for further research and advancement for centuries after him.<br>\nBacon\u2019s writings were the starting point for [[William_Torrey_Harris|William Torrey Harris]] classification system for libraries in the United States by the second half of the 1800s.\n\n==Historical debates==\n\n===Bacon and Shakespeare===\n{{main|Baconian theory|Bacon's cipher}}\n\nThe Baconian hypothesis of [[Shakespearean authorship]], first proposed in the mid-19th century, contends that Francis Bacon wrote some or even all of the plays conventionally attributed to [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dobson|first1=Michael|title=The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare|date=29 November 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=33}}</ref>\n\n===Occult theories ===\n{{main|Occult theories about Francis Bacon}}\nFrancis Bacon often gathered with the men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing.<ref>Frances Yates, ''Theatre of the World'', London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1969</ref> Bacon's alleged connection to the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, others, including [[Daphne du Maurier]] in her biography of Bacon, have argued that there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians.<ref>Daphne du Maurier, ''The Winding Stair, Biography of Bacon'' 1976.</ref> [[Frances Yates]]<ref>Frances Yates, ''The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age'', pages 61\u201368, London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979</ref> does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day.

Josephson-Storm also rejects conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and does not make the claim that Bacon was an active Rosicrucian. However, he argues that Bacon's \"rejection\" of magic actually constituted an attempt to purify magic of Catholic, demonic, and esoteric influences and to establish magic as a field of study and application paralleling Bacon's vision of science. Furthermore, Josephson-Storm argues that Bacon drew on magical ideas when developing his experimental method.<ref>Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 46</ref> Josephson-Storm finds evidence that Bacon considered nature a living entity, populated by spirits, and argues Bacon's views on the human domination and application of nature actually depend on his spiritualism and personification of nature.<ref>Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 50-1</ref>\n\nThe Rosicrucian organisation [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|AMORC]] claims that Bacon was the \"Imperator\" (leader) of the Rosicrucian Order in both England and the European continent, and would have directed it during his lifetime.<ref name=\"HistoryofLife\">{{cite web |title=The Mastery of Life |url=http://www.rosicrucian.org/about/mastery/mastery.pdf |format=PDF |page=31 |publisher=Rosicrucian.org |accessdate=21 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBacon's influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors, and on groups that have utilised his writings in their own belief systems.<ref>Saint Germain Foundation.

This page is to keep track of what has been incorporated into Wikipedia. Anyone who wants to help, jump right in. As entries are imported, simply add '''DONE''' after the link.\n\n[[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/symbols - B|symbols - B]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/C - D|C - D]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/E - H|E - H]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/I - K|I - K]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/L - N|L - N]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/O - Q|O - Q]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/R - S|R - S]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/T - W|T - W]] -- [[Wikipedia:Free_On-line_Dictionary_of_Computing/X - Z|X - Z]]\n\nA few notes:\n* Many entries will have to be renamed, such as number-only titles (since we generally reserve number entries for years). For example, [[8086]] becomes [[Intel 8086]]. Also titles that clash with non-computing subjects will need new names.\n\n* Some entries we won't need or want to import (we might already have the information in an article, for example). In these cases, the entry should be marked as '''NO IMPORT''', and the reason given. In particular there are thousands of entries from the [[Jargon File]], most of which do not make encyclopedia articles.\n\n* Many articles contain outdated information, especially note about technologies that were superseded, companies whose ownership has changed, etc. As a general principle, '''never do data dump'''.\n\n* Generally, acronyms should be expanded. For example, the [[Industry Standard Architecture| ISA]] article should be found at [[Industry Standard Architecture]], rather than pointing to ISA the disambiguation page. Many entries occur twice e.g., [[TCP]] and [[Transmission control protocol]] -- one should [[Wikipedia:redirect|redirect]] to the other as appropriate.  Also, you may update the [[List of computing and IT abbreviations|existing list]] of computing abbreviations.\n\n* If an article already exists on a given topic but the FOLDOC entry has information that we don't, it should be integrated with our article, rather than tacked onto the end. If our article and the FOLDOC one contradict each other, mention the contradiction on the appropriate Talk page so it can be discussed.\n\n* When importing a full entry, or integrating it with one of our current entries, it would be good to leave a note similar to this at the bottom, though FOLDOC's editor, Denis Howe, doesn't require it: \n\n::<nowiki>''This article was originally based on material from [[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing|FOLDOC]], used with [[Wikipedia:Foldoc license|permission]]. Update as needed.''</nowiki>\n\n: Alternatively, the <nowiki>{{FOLDOC}}</nowiki> message template may be used to incorporate an appropriate message.\n\n* New entries and changes appear on FOLDOC from time to time at http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/new.html\n\n''See also:'' [[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing]]\n\n== Mirrors ==\n\nThese are FOLDOC mirrors, which may not be up-to-date:\n*

The player snapping the ball (known officially as the \"snapper\" in rule books) delivers the ball to another player, and that action is the snap.  The snapper may hand, throw, or even roll the ball to the other player.  The snap must be a quick and continuous movement of the ball by one or both hands of the snapper, and the ball must leave the snapper's hands. The various rules codes have additional requirements, all of which have the effect of requiring the ball to go backwards to a player behind the line of scrimmage (i.e. in the \"backfield\"). The snapper almost always passes the ball between his legs, but only in Canadian football is that required.\n\nIn the standard [[Formation (American football)|gridiron football formation]], the [[center (gridiron football)|center/centre]] is the snapper and is situated in the middle of the line of scrimmage. Only in [[arena football]] is the center required by rule to be the snapper. In other codes, a [[guard (gridiron football)|guard]], [[offensive tackle|tackle]], [[tight end]] or [[wide receiver|split end]] can legally deliver the snap; such scenarios, known as an ''unbalanced line'', are seldom used outside of [[trick play]]s and novelties.\n\n[[Image:2005PoinsettaBowl-Navy-Snap.jpg|thumb|left|Exchange of the snap between the center's legs.]]\nFor a handed snap, the snapper will usually have his head up, facing opponents.  For a thrown snap, especially in formations wherein the ball may be snapped to players in different positions, the snapper will commonly [[wikt:bend over|bend over]] looking between his legs.  Because of the vulnerability of a player in such a position, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Federation of State High School Associations (\"Fed\") have adopted rules providing that if a player is positioned at least 7 yards behind the neutral zone to receive a snap, opponents are not to deliberately contact the snapper until one second after the snap (NCAA), or until the snapper has a chance to react (Fed).  However, in professional football it is common for a center to be able to practice a single [[Shotgun formation|\"shotgun\" formation]] thrown snap enough to keep his head up and toss it blindly.\n\nIn the [[National Football League]] (and presumably other levels), the snap is considered a backward pass and not a handoff.  This rule was highlighted in a preseason 2014 game between the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and the [[Minnesota Vikings]], when [[Zach Bauman]] picked up the ball from the turf after a bad snap and ran it six yards for a touchdown.  Since the loose ball was a dropped backward pass and not a fumble, any player could pick up the ball and advance the ball\u2014if it were a fumble, only the original carrier could advance the ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/zach-bauman-arizona-cardinals-minnesota-Vikings|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=Cardinals RB Zach Bauman scores most bizarre TD of early NFL preseason|first=Tom|last=Pelissero|date=August 17, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Snap count==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}\nThe team entitled to snap the ball will usually know in advance the moment when the snap is to occur as one of their players calls out signals, which usually include a loud sound such as \"hut\" voiced one or more times, the number of which they know; they are thus said to know the \"snap count\".  Therefore, they have a considerable advantage over their opponents. The Center is not, however, allowed to make motions simulating part of the snap action; therefore their opponents can be confident the first motion of the ball or the Center's hands is the beginning of the snap.\n\nThe snap count is decided on in the [[huddle]], usually expressed as \"...on <number>.\" being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the [[line of scrimmage]].  The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start.  The defensive players want to predict the snap, and build up speed such that they cross the [[line of scrimmage]] exactly as the play begins, so as to increase their chances of getting a tackle for a loss or a sack. By varying the snap count, a quarterback forces the defensive players to react to the movement of the offensive players, or risk being called for an [[Penalty (American football)#Offside|offsides]] or [[Encroachment (American football)|encroachment]] penalty. Unfortunately for the offense, this advantage can sometimes become a disadvantage. When faced with an exceptionally loud stadium, players may be unable to hear the snap count, and are forced to concentrate more on visual cues (silent snap count or a [[Hard count (American football)|hard count]]), or risk [[false start]] penalties.\n\nThe offense must also be mindful of the [[play clock]]. If they fail to snap the ball in time they incur a delay of game penalty.  Also, with a dwindling play clock, the defense has better chances of guessing when the ball will be snapped.  It is easier to predict when the ball will be snapped with 2 seconds left on the play clock, rather than 5 seconds.\n\nThe defensive team is not allowed to simulate, by calling out numbers, the offense's snap count. Successfully simulating the count would cause members of the offensive team to act too early ruining co-ordination of the play and inviting penalties. Current rules, unlike earlier rules, position officials so far from the line of scrimmage for 50 minutes of the 60-minute game that it is extremely difficult to hear if the defense is simulating the count.\n\n== History and rationale ==\n\nThe snap, the set [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]] and [[Rugby union gameplay#Ruck|ruck]] in today's [[rugby union]], and the [[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play-the-ball]] in [[rugby league]] have common origins in [[rugby football]].  As the rules of rugby's scrimmage were written when the game came to North America, they had a significant flaw which was corrected by custom elsewhere, but by the invention of the snap in American football.<ref>http://users.bestweb.net/~robgood/football/uncontested.txt Why the Uncontested Scrimmage</ref>\n\nThe rule adopted by a committee for American football in 1880 first provided for the uncontested right of one side to play the ball by foot (in any direction) for a scrimmage.  A certain use of the foot on the ball which had the same effect as heeling it back was known as a \"snap\".  Later in the 19th Century the option of snapping the ball back by hand was added.  The option to play the ball with the foot was preserved, however, for several decades, although by early in the 20th Century it was restricted to kicking the ball forward.  The kick forward in scrimmage was a surprise play which did not work against a prepared defense.  Also for several decades alternatives to the scrimmage for playing the ball from across the sideline after it had gone out of bounds\u2014a throw-in or \"fair\", and \"bounding in\"\u2014existed.  Note also that until well into the 20th Century, rather than an official readying the ball for scrimmage, the side entitled to the snap had complete custody of the ball and could snap it from the required spot at any time; for instance, a tackled ball carrier might feign injury, then suddenly snap the ball while recumbent, there being no stance requirement yet.  The neutral zone and the right of the Center not to be contacted by an opponent before the snap also was not an original feature.  As the 20th Century drew to a close, the NCAA and National Federation of State High School Associations extended that protection to some time '''after''' the snap, in cases where a player is positioned at least 7 yards deep to receive a thrown snap.\n\nCanadian football used the rugby scrimmage unaltered until near the end of the 19th Century, when, regionally at first, under the influence of the American scrimmage, the number of players in the scrimmage was limited to three\u2014a \"centre scrimmager\" bound on either side by props called \"side scrimmagers\".  The centre scrimmager was later renamed the \"snap\", and in intercollegiate play one side was given the right to put foot to ball first.  Beginning regionally again and universally by 1923, the [[Burnside rules]] led to the 3-man scrimmage being reduced to the centre alone, the number of players on the field being reduced commensurately from 14 to 12, and a snap rule and neutral zone similar to that of American football was adopted.  In addition to the between-the-legs requirement noted above, for several years after the adoption of the hand snap, a hand-to-hand snap was illegal, the ball required to be thrown instead, in Canadian football. (Though it was technically legal, the hand-to-hand snap was not used on the American side of the border until the 1930s.)  Apparently a complete break was desired from system of backheeling, and the T formation having gone into eclipse in American football at the time, the Canadian snap was modeled on the formations then in common use in the USA, such as the single wing.\n\nThe game design rationale for requiring the snap to be a quick and continuous motion to the backfield is to eliminate the need for rules provisions for a live ball in scrimmage.  In Rugby Union the ball may be retained by the forwards and played for a time via the foot in a scrummage (which Rugby League has as well) or [[Rugby union gameplay#Ruck|ruck]], or by the hands in a [[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]], necessitating additional restrictions on play and player positioning during those intervals.  In American and Canadian football, the ball as it is put in play is only held in the line (by the Center) for a fraction of a second.  The uncontested possession also, as [[Walter Camp]] pointed out, allows for better offensive and defensive planning by the side entitled to snap the ball and their opposition, respectively.  A [[Muffed punt|muffed]] snap can be recovered by either team.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glossary of American football]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Gridiron football maneuvers}}\n\n[[Category:American football terminology]]", "sha1": "r0j13omkox6x4jhq38o8aqfyy3gbhpn"}}, {"title": "Firewire (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "11346", "revision": {"id": "793398918", "parentid": "630982647", "timestamp": "2017-08-01T14:10:54Z", "contributor": {"ip": "124.149.151.100"}, "comment": "Added link to Wiki article on Linear Heat Detection.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''[[FireWire]]''' is Apple's trademark for the IEEE 1394 interface.\n\n'''Firewire''' or '''Fire wire''' may also refer to:\n\n* Firewire, a [[Kidde]] trademark for a [[Linear Heat Detection|linear fire detection]] element, used in aircraft engine bays\n* [[Firewire (Lateef the Truthspeaker album)|''Firewire'' (Lateef the Truthspeaker album)]]\n* ''Firewire'', an album by jazz guitarist [[Larry Carlton]]\n* [[Fire Wire (song)]], a 2001 single by Cosmic Gate\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "gddps1apfzza8urz4um3bpc3te8v9qo"}}, {"title": "FIFO (computing and electronics)", "ns": "0", "id": "11347", "revision": {"id": "859572135", "parentid": "852891816", "timestamp": "2018-09-14T21:58:45Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2A02:8108:4A40:D2E0:BD50:F558:D252:6C87"}, "comment": "citation for 1st known FIFO in electronics", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Fifo queue.png|thumb|350px|Representation of a FIFO (queue) with ''enqueue'' and ''dequeue'' operations.]]\n\n'''FIFO''' is an [[acronym]] for '''first in, first out''', a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or 'head' of the queue, is processed first.

[[Queueing theory]] encompasses these methods for processing [[data structure]]<nowiki/>s, as well as interactions between strict-FIFO queues.\n\n==Computer science==\n\n===Data structure===\n[[Image:Data Queue.svg|thumb|300px|Representation of a FIFO (first in, first out) queue]]\n\nDepending on the application, a FIFO could be implemented as a hardware shift register, or using different memory structures, typically a [[circular buffer]] or a kind of [[List (abstract data type)|list]]. For information on the abstract data structure, see [[Queue (data structure)]]. Most software implementations of a FIFO queue are not [[thread safe]] and require a locking mechanism to verify the data structure chain is being manipulated by only one thread at a time.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Code ===\nThe following code shows a [[linked list]] FIFO [[C++]] language implementation. In practice, a number of list implementations exist, including popular Unix systems C sys/queue.h macros or the C++ [[Standard Template Library|standard library]] std::list template, avoiding the need for implementing the data structure from scratch.\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <iostream>\n#include <stdexcept>\n \ntemplate <typename T>\nclass FIFO\n{\nprivate:\n\n    struct Node {\n        T     value;\n        Node *next;\n\n        Node(T _value) : value(_value), next(NULL) {}\n    };\n\n    Node *front;\n    Node *back;\n\npublic:\n    FIFO() : front(NULL), back(NULL) {}\n\n    ~FIFO() {\n        while (front != NULL)\n            dequeue();\n    }\n\n    void enqueue(T _value) {\n        Node *newNode = new Node(_value);\n\n        if (front == NULL)\n            front = newNode;\n        else\n            back->next = newNode;\n\n        back = newNode;\n    }\n\n    T dequeue() {\n        if (front == NULL)\n           throw std::underflow_error(\"Nothing to dequeue\");\n\n        Node *temp   = front;        \n        T     result = front->value;\n\n        front = front->next;\n        delete temp;\n\n        return result;\n    }\n};\n</source>\n\n===Head or tail first===\n\nThe ends of a FIFO queue are often referred to as ''head'' and ''tail''. Unfortunately, a controversy exists regarding those terms:\n* To many people, items should enter a queue at the tail, and remain in the queue until they reach the head and leave the queue from there. This point of view is justified by analogy with queues of people waiting for some kind of service and parallels the use of ''front'' and ''back'' in the above example.\n* Other people believe that items enter a queue at the head and leave at the tail, in the manner of food passing through a snake. Queues written in that way appear in places that could be considered authoritative, such as the [[operating system]] [[Linux]].\n\n===Pipes===\nIn computing environments that support the [[pipes and filters]] model for [[interprocess communication]], a FIFO is another name for a [[named pipe]].\n\n===Disk scheduling===\nDisk controllers can use the FIFO as a disk scheduling algorithm to determine the order in which to service disk I/O requests.\n\n===Communications and networking===\nCommunication [[network bridge]]s, [[Network switch|switches]] and [[Network router|routers]] used in [[computer networks]] use FIFOs to hold data packets en route to their next destination. Typically at least one FIFO structure is used per network connection. Some devices feature multiple FIFOs for simultaneously and independently queuing different types of information.\n\n==Electronics==\n\n[[File:Fifo schedule.png|thumb|FIFO schedule.]]\n\nFIFOs are commonly used in [[electronics|electronic]] circuits for buffering and flow control between hardware and software. In its hardware form, a FIFO primarily consists of a set of read and write pointers, storage and control logic. Storage may be [[static random access memory]] (SRAM), flip-flops, latches or any other suitable form of storage. For FIFOs of non-trivial size, a dual-port SRAM is usually used, where one port is dedicated to writing and the other to reading.\n\nA synchronous FIFO is a FIFO where the same clock is used for both reading and writing. An asynchronous FIFO uses different clocks for reading and writing. Asynchronous FIFOs introduce [[metastability]] issues.\nA common implementation of an asynchronous FIFO uses a [[Gray code]] (or any unit distance code) for the read and write pointers to ensure reliable flag generation. One further note concerning flag generation is that one must necessarily use pointer arithmetic to generate flags for asynchronous FIFO implementations. Conversely, one may use either a ''[[leaky bucket]]'' approach or pointer arithmetic to generate flags in synchronous FIFO implementations.\n\nExamples of FIFO status flags include: full, empty, almost full, almost empty, etc.\n\nThe first known FIFO implemented in electronics was done by Peter Alfke in 1969 at Fairchild Semiconductors <ref>[http://www.fpga-faq.com/archives/10775.html#10794 Peter Alfke's post at comp.arch.fpga on 19 Jun 1998]</ref>. Peter Alfke was later a director at [[Xilinx]].\n\n=== FIFO full-empty ===\nA hardware FIFO is used for synchronization purposes. It is often implemented as a [[circular queue]], and thus has two pointers:\n#Read pointer / read address register\n#Write pointer / write address register\n\nRead and write addresses are initially both at the first memory location and the FIFO queue is ''empty''.\n;FIFO empty: When the read [[address register]] reaches the write address register, the FIFO triggers the ''empty'' signal.\n;FIFO full: When the write address register reaches the read address register, the FIFO triggers the ''full'' signal.\nIn both cases, the read and write addresses end up being equal. To distinguish between the two situations, a simple and robust solution is to add one extra bit for each read and write address which is inverted each time the address wraps. With this set up, the disambiguation conditions are:\n#When the read address register equals the write address register, the FIFO is empty.\n#When the read address LSBs equal the write address LSBs and the extra MSBs are different, the FIFO is full.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[FINO]] (first in, never out)\n* [[Garbage in, garbage out]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* [http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO2.pdf Cummings et al.,  Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design with Asynchronous Pointer Comparisons, SNUG San Jose 2002]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Queueing theory}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fifo (Computing)}}\n[[Category:Cybernetics]]\n[[Category:Scheduling algorithms]]\n[[Category:Queue management]]\n[[Category:Inter-process communication]]", "sha1": "s0pkmdzx2uqrbu0jgc6kuut27pbpx3z"}}, {"title": "Firewall (construction)", "ns": "0", "id": "11350", "revision": {"id": "850629235", "parentid": "844535782", "timestamp": "2018-07-17T01:50:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Deli nk", "id": "560563"}, "comment": "Not needed when disambiguation is in the title", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Brandwand_2.jpg|thumb|250px|Firewall residential [[construction]], separating the building into two separate residential units, and fire areas.]]\n[[File:Brandwand_3.jpg |thumb|Firewall, as seen on the inside of a newly constructed [[townhouse]] unit, showing how the firewall extends above the roofline.]]\n[[File:Power_systems_in_Toppila_Jun2008.jpg|thumb|Example of a [[High-voltage transformer fire barriers|firewall]] used to inhibit the spread of a fire at an [[electrical substation]].]]\nA '''firewall''' is a fire-resistant barrier used to prevent the spread of fire for a prescribed period of time. Firewalls are built between or through buildings, structures, electrical substation transformers, or within an aircraft or vehicle.\n\n==Applications==\nFirewalls can be used to subdivide a [[building]] into separate fire areas and are constructed in accordance with the locally applicable [[building code]]s. Firewalls are a portion of a building's [[passive fire protection]] systems.\n\nFirewalls can be used to separate-high value transformers at an [[electrical substation]] in the event of a mineral oil tank rupture and ignition. The firewall serves as a fire containment wall between one oil-filled transformer and other neighboring transformers, building structures, and site equipment.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Firewall construction 2.JPG|thumb|right|A building under construction, showing the structurally independent cinderblock firewalls subdividing the building]]\n[[File:Waynesboro Outlet Village Building 4.jpg|thumb|right|Building 4 of the [[Waynesboro Outlet Village]], showing a [[concrete]] firewall running through the building]]\n[[File:Waynesboro Outlet Village Building 7 after fire.jpg|thumb|right|Concrete firewalls still standing on Building 7 of the former [[Waynesboro Outlet Village]], following a firefighter training exercise which intentionally burned the building]]\nThere are three main classifications of ''fire rated walls'': fire walls, fire barriers, and fire partitions. To the layperson, the common use of language typically includes all three when referring to a ''firewall'' unless distinguishing between them becomes necessary. In addition specialty fire-rated walls such as a High Challenge Fire Wall would require further distinctions.\n*A ''firewall'' is an assembly of materials used to separate transformers, structures, or large buildings to prevent the spread of fire by constructing a wall which extends from the foundation through the roof with a prescribed fire resistance duration and independent structural stability. This allows a building to be subdivided into smaller sections. If a section becomes structurally unstable due to fire or other causes, that section can break or fall away from the other sections in the building. <ref>NFPA 221, ''Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls'', 2009 Edition, section 3.3.14.6, NFPA 850-10 ''Fire Protection fotric Generating Plants and High Voltage DC Converter Stations'' 2010 Edition section 5.1.4.3-4</ref>\n*A ''fire barrier wall'', or a ''fire partition'', is a fire-rated wall assembly that provides lower levels of protection than typically provided by a fire wall. The main differences are that these fire resistant walls are not structurally self-sufficient. <ref>NFPA 221, ''Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls'', 2009 Edition, section 3.3.14.5</ref>\n\nFire barrier walls are typically continuous from an exterior wall to an exterior wall, or from a floor below to a floor or roof above, or from one fire barrier wall to another fire barrier wall, having a fire resistance rating equal to or greater than the required rating for the application. Fire barriers are continuous through concealed spaces (e.g., above a ceiling) to the floor deck or roof deck above the barrier. Fire partitions are not required to extend through concealed spaces if the construction assembly forming the bottom of the concealed space, such as the ceiling, has a fire resistance rating at least equal to or greater than the fire partition.<ref>NFPA 221, ''Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls'', 2006 Edition, section 3.3.12.7</ref>\n*A ''high challenge fire wall'' is a wall used to separate transformers, structures, or buildings or a wall subdividing a building with high fire challenge [[occupancy|occupancies]], having enhanced fire resistance ratings and enhanced appurtenance protection to prevent the spread of fire, and having structural stability.<ref>NFPA 221, ''Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls'', 2009 Edition, section 3.3.14.7, NFPA 850-10 ''Fire Protection for Electric Generating Plants and High Voltage DC Converter Stations'' 2010 Edition section 5.1.4.3-4</ref>\n\nPortions of structures that are subdivided by fire walls are permitted to be considered separate buildings, in that fire walls have sufficient structural stability to maintain the integrity of the wall in the event of the collapse of the building construction on either side of the wall.<ref>NFPA 221, ''Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls'', 2006 Edition, section A3.3.12.6</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n*Fire rating - Fire walls are constructed in such a way as to achieve a code-determined [[fire-resistance rating]], thus forming part of a fire compartment's [[passive fire protection]].

They are usually finished off on the top with [[flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] ([[sheet metal]] cap) for protection against [[weather|the elements]].\n\n===Materials===\n[[File:Smolina 20, Ulan-Ude.jpg|thumb|Firewalls between the old buildings in [[Ulan-Ude]]]]\n*Building and [[building engineering|structural]] firewalls in [[North America]] are usually made of [[concrete]], [[concrete masonry unit|concrete blocks]], or [[reinforced concrete]].

Penetrations (holes) must not defeat the structural integrity of the wall, such that the wall cannot withstand the prescribed fire duration without threat of collapse.<ref>NFPA 221, ''Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls'', 2006 Edition, section 4.9</ref>\n*Openings \u2013 Other openings in Fire walls, such as doors and windows, must also be fire-rated ''[[fire door]] assemblies'' and ''fire window assemblies''.<ref>NFPA 221, ''Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls'', 2006 Edition, section 4.8.3</ref>\n\n==Performance based design==\nFirewalls are used in varied applications that require specific design and performance specifications. Knowing the potential conditions that may exist during a fire are critical to selecting and installing an effective firewall. For example, a firewall designed to meet National Fire Protection Agency, (NFPA), 221-09 section A.5.7 which indicates an average temperature of 800&nbsp;\u00b0F, is not designed to withstand higher temperatures such as would be present in higher challenge fires, and as a result would fail to function for the expected duration of the listed wall rating.\n\nPerformance based design takes into account the potential conditions during a fire. Understanding thermal limitations of materials is essential to using the correct material for the application. Laboratory testing is used to simulate fire scenarios and wall loading conditions. The testing results in an assigned listing number for the fire-rated assembly that defines the expected fire resistance duration and wall structural integrity under the tested conditions. Designers may elect to specify a listed fire wall assembly or design a wall system that would require performance testing to certify the expected protections before use of the designed fire-rated wall system.\n\n==Firewalls in vehicles==\n{{Main|Firewall (engine)}}\n[[File:Dash firewall.svg|right|thumb|The firewall in an automobile (indicated by the red line)]]\n[[File:JeepLiberty FirewallPenetration Insulation.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeep Liberty]] firewall insulation]]\nFirewalls are also regularly found in [[aircraft]] and in specially prepared [[automobile|cars]] for [[compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalisation]] and competition use. For example, a typical conversion of a production car for [[rallying]] will include a metal firewall which seals the [[fuel]] tank off from the interior of the vehicle. In the event of an accident, resulting in fuel spillage, the firewall can prevent burning fuel from entering the passenger compartment, where it could cause serious injury or death. In regular stock cars, the firewall separates the engine compartment from the cabin and can, at times, contain fibreglass insulation. Automotive firewalls have to be fitted so that they form a complete seal. Usually this is done by bonding the [[sheet metal]] to the bodywork using [[fibreglass]] [[resin]].\n\nThe term firewall is also commonly used in American English to refer to the barrier between the [[passenger]] and [[engine]] compartments of a vehicle. The inner and outer surfaces of the firewall are often coated with [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH) absorber to prevent most engine noise from reaching the passenger compartment. In British English, the term for this barrier is [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]].\n\n==[[High-voltage transformer fire barriers]]==\n'''[https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=850 NFPA 850]''' refers to fire barriers used around large electrical transformers as firewalls. These are used to prevent a [[domino effect]], whereby, if one transformer caught on fire and/or exploded, the idea is to prevent it from starting its neighbouring transformer on fire, which could affect the surrounding [[electric grid]], particularly during peak times. Unlike most fire barriers, transformer fire barriers are often expected to not only defeat fire and heat, but also [[ballistics]], [[explosion]]s and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Firebreak]] (forestry)\n*[[Fireproofing]]\n*[[Firestop]] (construction)\n*[[Listing and approval use and compliance]]\n*[[High-voltage transformer fire barriers]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Firewalls (construction)}}\n*[http://www.maca.gov.nt.ca/ofm/docs/bulletins/FM-054-98.html Government of Northwest Territories: Fire Marshal Technical Bulletins Treatise on Firewalls]\n*[http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_121-247.html FAA Regulation about firewalls in aircraft]\n*[http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/documents/ss/STANDATA/building/bci/06BCI005.pdf Government of Alberta, February 2008 Building Code Interpretation concerning Firewalls]\n\n{{Fire fighting}}\n\n[[Category:Firefighting]]\n[[Category:Passive fire protection]]\n[[Category:Types of wall]]", "sha1": "ir34eptex5nu7hrdhthhtx9f82g5pc9"}}, {"title": "Feudal system", "ns": "0", "id": "11351", "redirect": {"title": "Feudalism"}, "revision": {"id": "492168743", "parentid": "492167217", "timestamp": "2012-05-12T08:02:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Uhai", "id": "2810812"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Undid revision 492167217 by [[Special:Contributions/Feuraul|Feuraul]] ([[User talk:Feuraul|talk]]) unexplained redirect change", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Feudalism]]", "sha1": "gi4b8fiepdshw987mz2tg90rx7n78ze"}}, {"title": "Fenrir (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "11352", "revision": {"id": "758927262", "parentid": "748458287", "timestamp": "2017-01-08T08:26:22Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2606:6000:C083:8400:A568:1DFB:4418:2CE5"}, "comment": "/* Video games */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|Fenrir|fenir}}\n'''[[Fenrir]]''', '''Fenrisulfr''' or '''Fenris''' is a [[Norse mythology|Norse]] mythological wolf.

Illustrated (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]].]]\nIn [[Germanic mythology]], '''Frigg''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|\u026a|g}};<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/frigg \"Frigg\"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> [[Old Norse]]), '''Frija''' ([[Old High German]]), '''Frea''' ([[Langobardic language|Langobardic]]), and '''Frige''' ([[Old English]]) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god [[Odin]]. In Old High German and [[Old Norse]] sources, she is also connected with the goddess [[Fulla]]. The English weekday name [[Friday]] ([[etymology|etymologically]] Old English \"Fr\u012bge's day\") bears her name.\n\nFrigg is described as a goddess associated with foreknowledge and wisdom in [[Norse mythology]], the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god [[Odin]] and dwells in the wetland halls of [[Fensalir]], is famous for her [[Precognition|foreknowledge]], is associated with the goddesses Fulla, [[Lofn]], [[Hl\u00edn]], and [[Gn\u00e1 and H\u00f3fvarpnir|Gn\u00e1]], and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity [[J\u00f6r\u00f0]] (Old Norse \"Earth\"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god [[Baldr]]. Due to significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess [[Freyja]].\n\nAfter [[Christianization]], mention of Frigg continued to occur in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art, and receives modern veneration in [[Germanic Neopaganism]].\n\n==Etymology, ''Friday'', and toponymy==\nThe [[theonym]]s ''Frigg'' (Old Norse) and ''Frija'' (Old High German) are [[cognate]] forms\u2014linguistic siblings of the same origin\u2014that descend from a substantivized feminine of [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''frijaz'' (via [[Holtzmann's law]]). *''frijaz'' descends from the same source ([[Proto-Indo-European]]) as the feminine [[Sanskrit]] noun ''priy\u0101'' and the feminine [[Avestan]] noun ''fry\u0101'' (both meaning \"own, dear, beloved\").{{sfnp|Orel|2003|p=114}} In the modern period, an [[Latin declension#First declension (a)|-a suffix]] is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form ''Frigga''.<ref name=ASUFFIX>See for example {{harvp|Bulfinch|1913|p=344}}.</ref> This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]''.{{sfn|Sheard|2011|p=238}}\n\nThe connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess [[Freyja]] with Frigg in the [[Common Germanic deities|Proto-Germanic]] period ([[Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis]]) is a matter of scholarly debate.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56\u201366}} The name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]]. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] *''[[Frijj\u014d]]''. Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse ''Freyja'' descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56\u201366}}\n\nRegarding a Freyja\u2013Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}\n\nThe English [[weekday]] name ''[[Friday]]'' comes from Old English ''Fr\u012b\u0121ed\u00e6\u0121'', meaning 'day of Frige'. It is cognate with [[Old High German]] ''fr\u00eeatac''.{{sfnp|Simek|2007|pp=93\u201394}} Several [[toponymy|place names]] refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.{{sfnp|Pulsiano|Wolf|1993|p=503}}\n\n==Attestations==\n\n===''Origi Gentis Langobardorum'' and ''Historia Langobardorum''===\n[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Godan and Frea look down from their window in the heavens to the Winnili women in an illustration by [[Emil Doepler]], 1905]]\n[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster II by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Winnili women with their hair tied as beards look up at Godan and Frea in an illustration by Emil Doepler, 1905]]\nThe 7th-century ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'', and [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' derived from it, recount a founding myth of the [[Langobards]], a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see [[Lombardy]]). According to this legend, a \"small people\" known as the ''[[Winnili]]'' were ruled by a woman named [[Gambara]] who had two sons, [[Ybor and Agio]]. The [[Vandals]], ruled by [[Ambri and Assi]], came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the ''Origo''): \"Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory.\"{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=315\u201316}}\n\nMeanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counseled them that \"at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands\". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked \"who are those Long-beards?\" Frea responded to Godan, \"As you have given them a name, give them also the victory\". Godan did so, \"so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory\". Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the ''Langobards'' ([[Lombardic language|Langobardic]] \"long-beards\").{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=316\u201317}}\n\n===Second Merseburg Incantation===\n[[File:Wodan Heilt Balders Pferd by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|\"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse\" by Emil Doepler, 1905]]\nA 10th-century manuscript found in what is now [[Merseburg]], Germany, features an invocation known as the [[Merseburg Incantations|Second Merseburg Incantation]].

In the first mention, the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son [[Baldr]] in [[Fensalir]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=8}} Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin himself is referred to as the \"beloved of Frigg\" and his future death is referred to as the \"second grief of Frigg\".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=11}} Like  the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied \"first grief\" is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, [[Baldr]].<ref name=\"LARRINGTON-266\">See, for example, {{harvp|Larrington|1999|p=266}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Frigg and Odin in Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|The goddess Frigg and her husband, the god Odin, sit in Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf and gaze into \"all worlds\" and make a wager as described in ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' in an illustration by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]], 1895]]\nIn the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'', Frigg plays a prominent role. The prose introduction recounts that two sons of king [[Hrau\u00f0ungr]], Agnar (age 10) and Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish. However, wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore and there they met a [[Croft (land)|crofter]]. They stayed on the croft for one winter. During that winter, the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}}\n\nThe boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said \"go where an evil spirit may get thee.\"{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=18}} Away went the ship and Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was king. He \"became a splendid man\".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in [[Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf]], \"look[ing] into [[Norse cosmology|all the worlds]]\".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} Odin says: \"'Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse ''[[g\u0233gi]]''] in a cave? while Geirr\u00f6d, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.' Frigg answered, 'He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.'\"{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}\n\nOdin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her \"waiting-maid\" [[Fulla]] to warn Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was inhospitable with his guests, Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is ''[[List of names of Odin|Gr\u00edmnir]]''. Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r has Gr\u00edmnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Gr\u00edmnir is brought a full [[drinking horn]] by Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r's son, Agnar (so named after Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r's brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}\n\nIn the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', where [[Loki]] accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by [[\u00c6gir]]. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, \"his wife\", Frigg.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=84}}\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\nFrigg is mentioned throughout the ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. Frigg is first mentioned in the ''Prose Edda'' [[Prologue (Prose Edda)]], wherein a [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of [[folk etymology]], the author attempts to associate the name ''Frigg'' with the Latin-influenced form ''Frigida''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}} The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin \"had the gift of prophecy\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}}\n\nIn the next section of the ''Prose Edda'', ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (the king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgynn]] (Old Norse ''Fj\u00f6rgynsd\u00f3ttir'') is married to Odin and that the [[\u00c6sir]] are descended from the couple, and adds that \"the earth [''[[J\u00f6r\u00f0]]in''] was [Odin's] daughter and his wife\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}} According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god [[Thor]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}}\n\n[[File:Frigg and Fulla 1874.jpg|thumb|Frigg reaches into a box presented to her by a handmaid, [[Ludwig Pietsch]], 1865]]\nLater in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Gangleri asks about the ''[[\u00e1synjur]]'', a term for Norse goddesses.

Frigg dwells in [[Fensalir]] \"and it is very splendid\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}} In this section of ''Gylfaginning'', Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other ''\u00e1synjur'': [[Fulla]] carries Frigg's ashen box, \"looks after her footwear and shares her secrets\"; [[Lofn]] is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to \"arrange unions\" among men and women; [[Hl\u00edn]] is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deems worthy of keeping from danger; and [[Gn\u00e1 and H\u00f3fvarpnir|Gn\u00e1]] is sent by Frigg \"into various worlds to carry out her business\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nIn section 49 of ''Gylfaginning'', a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow \u00c6sir about his dreams, the gods met together for a [[thing (assembly)|thing]] and decided that they should \"request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger\". Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the \u00c6sir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, [[Loki]] discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}\n\nThere, Frigg asks this female visitor what the \u00c6sir are up to assembled at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]. The woman says that all of the \u00c6sir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that \"Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; \"there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of [[Valhalla|Val-hall]]. It is called [[mistletoe]]. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} Loki immediately disappears.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}\n\n[[File:Baldr's Death by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|Frigg grips her dead son, Baldr, in an illustration by Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich, 1895]]\nNow armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the \u00c6sir are assembled and tricks the blind [[H\u00f6\u00f0r]], Baldr's brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks \"who there was among the \u00c6sir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to [[Hel (location)|Hel]] and try if he could find Baldr, and offer [[Hel (being)|Hel]] a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=49}}\n\n[[Herm\u00f3\u00f0r]], Baldr's brother, accepts Freyja's request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings&mdash;foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=49\u201350}} Herm\u00f3\u00f0r locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel.

Herm\u00f3\u00f0r rides back to the \u00c6sir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a j\u00f6tunn in a cave named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'), described perhaps Loki in disguise.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nFrigg is mentioned several times in the ''Prose Edda'' section ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]''. The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the [[\u00c6sir]] and \u00c1synjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, [[Asgard]].

Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the \u00c6sir concluded that he was not coming back.

Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.{{sfnp|Jones|Pennick|1995|pp=144\u201345}}\n\n==Scholarly reception and interpretation==\n{{main|Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis}}\nDue to numerous similarities, some scholars have proposed that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and [[Freyja]] descend from a common entity from the [[Proto-Germanic]] period.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}} Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}\n\nUnlike Frigg but like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]], the name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], as opposed to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''[[Frijj\u014d]]''. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which ''Freyja'' descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of evidence outside of the North Germanic record.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}}\n\n==Modern influence==\nFrigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, [[Gustav III of Sweden]], king of Sweden, composed ''Friggja'', a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and [[Hans Friedrich Blunck]]'s ''Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust'' in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (''Frigg, Freyja'', drawing, 1883), [[John Charles Dollman]] (''Frigga Spinning the Clouds'', painting, c. 1900),  [[Emil Doepler]] (''Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster'', painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (''Fricka'', drawing, date not provided).{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=94}}\n\n[[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] appears in [[Marvel Comics]] and in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as the queen of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wife of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], mother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the adoptive mother of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. \n\nThe Finnish folk band [[Frigg (band)|Frigg]] takes its name from the deity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2012/09/finlands-frigg-uk-debut-tour/|title=Finland's 'Frigg' \u2013 UK Debut Tour \u2013 Folk Radio UK|date=27 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frigg.fi |title=Hot Fiddles from Cool Scandinavia |date= |accessdate=20 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412082933/http://www.frigg.fi/ |archivedate=12 April 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bulfinch |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Bulfinch |year=1913 |title=Bulfinch's Mythology |publisher=Thomas Y.

He was the only son of Gerty Wankel (n\u00e9e Heidlauff) and Rudolf Wankel, a forest assessor. His father died in [[World War I]].<ref name=\"a\"/> Thereafter, the family moved to Heidelberg. He went to high schools in [[Donaueschingen]], [[Heidelberg]], and [[Weinheim]], and left school without [[Abitur]] in 1921. He learned the trade of purchaser at the Carl Winter Press in Heidelberg and worked for the publishing house until June 1926. He and some friends had already run an unofficial afterwork machine shop in a backyard shed in Heidelberg since 1924. Wankel now determined to receive unemployment benefits and to focus on the machine shop. One of his friends, who had graduated from university, gave his name and transformed the shop into an official garage for [[DKW]] and [[Cleveland Motorcycle Manufacturing Company|Cleveland motor bikes]] in 1927, where Wankel worked from time to time until his arrest in 1933.<ref>Popplow, pp. 32\u201336, 51 ff.</ref>\n\nWankel was gifted since childhood with an ingenious spatial imagination and became interested in the world of machines, especially  combustion engines. After his mother was widowed, Wankel could not afford  [[university]] education or even an [[apprenticeship]]. He was, however, able to teach himself technical subjects. At age 17 he told friends that he had dreamt of constructing a car with \"a new type of engine, half turbine, half reciprocating. It is my invention!\". True to this prediction, he conceived the Wankel engine in 1924 and won his first patent in 1929.<ref name=\"a\"/>\n\n==Wankel and the NSDAP==\nDuring the early 1920s Wankel was a member of various radical right-wing and [[anti-Semitic]] organizations. In 1921 he joined the Heidelberg branch of the [[Deutschv\u00f6lkischer Schutz und Trutzbund]] and in 1922 he became a member of the [[NSDAP]], the National Socialist German Workers Party (or \"Nazi Party\") , which was banned soon afterwards. Wankel founded and led youth groups associated with a cover-up organization of the NSDAP. With them he conducted paramilitary training, scouting games and night walks.<ref>Popplow, pp. 37\u201341</ref> When his high esteem for technical innovations was not widely shared among the [[German Youth Movement]], he was offered instead the opportunity to talk about the issue of technology and education to [[Adolf Hitler]] and other leading National Socialists in 1928.<ref>Popplow, p. 49</ref>\n\nIn the meantime Wankel's mother had helped founding the local chapter of the NSDAP in his hometown Lahr. Here Wankel not only rejoined the party in 1926, but also met [[Gauleiter]] [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]]. In 1931 Wagner entrusted Wankel with the leadership of the [[Hitler Youth]] in Baden. But both soon fell out with each other, because Wankel tried to put a stronger emphasis on military training, whereas Wagner wished for the Hitler Youth to be a primarily political organization. In a particularly bitter and ugly controversy Wankel publicly accused Wagner of corruption. Wagner paid back by stripping Wankel of his office by early 1932 and managed to have him expelled from the party in October 1932. Wankel, who sympathized with the social-revolutionary wing of the NSDAP among [[Gregor Strasser]] anyway, then founded his own National Socialist splinter group in Lahr and continued his attacks on Wagner. Since the Nazi's seizure of power on 30 January 1933 had strengthened his position, Wagner had Wankel arrested and imprisoned in the Lahr jail in March 1933. Only by intervention of Hitler's economic adviser [[Wilhelm Keppler]] with Hitler himself, Wankel was set free in September 1933.<ref>Popplow, pp. 50\u201354</ref> Keppler had been a friend of Wankel's and an ardent supporter of his technological endeavors since 1927. He now helped Wankel to get state contracts and his own ''Wankels Versuchs Werkst\u00e4tten'' in [[Lindau]]. Wankel tried to rejoin the NSDAP in 1937, but was turned down.<ref name=\"Popplow72\">Popplow, p. 72</ref> By the help of Keppler, however, he was admitted to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1940 in the rank of [[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]].<ref>Popplow, p. 64</ref> Two years later his membership was revoked, though, for reasons yet unknown.<ref name=\"Popplow72\"/>\n\n==Career==\n[[Image:DrehkolbenmotorDKM54.JPG|thumb|[[Wankel engine]], type DKM54 (1957)]]\nDuring [[World War II]], Wankel developed seals and rotary valves for [[Luftwaffe|German air force]] aircraft and [[Kriegsmarine|navy]] torpedoes, for [[BMW]] and [[Daimler-Benz]]. After the war, he was imprisoned by [[France]] for some months in 1945 and his laboratory was closed by French occupation troops. Wankel's work was confiscated and he was prohibited from doing more work.<ref name=\"a\">\"The Rotary Club\", Don Sherman, ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'', February 2008, pp 76\u201379</ref> However, by 1951, he got funding from the Goetze AG company to furnish the new Technical Development Center in his private house in [[Lindau]] on Lake Constance.  He began development of the engine at [[NSU Motorenwerke|NSU Motorenwerke AG]], leading to the first running prototype on 1 February 1957.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/0,1518,459789,00.html Wankel-Jubil\u00e4um: Warten aufs Wunder], ''Der Spiegel'', 21 January 2007.</ref> Unlike modern Wankel engines, this 21 horsepower version had both the rotor and housing rotating. <ref name=\"a\"/> His engine design was first licensed by [[Curtiss-Wright]] in [[New Jersey]], United States.\n\nOn 19 January 1960 the rotary engine was presented for the first time to specialists and the press in a meeting of the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|German Engineers' Union]] at the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich.  In the same year, with the KKM 250, the first practical rotary engine was presented in a converted [[NSU Prinz]]. At this time the \"Wankel engine\" became synonymous with the rotary engine, whereas previously it was called the \"Motor nach System NSU/Wankel\". At the 1963 IAA, the NSU company presented the NSU Wankel-Spider, the first consumer vehicle, which went into production in 1964. Great attention was received by the NSU in August 1967 for the very modern [[NSU Ro 80]], which had a 115-horsepower engine with two rotors.  It was the first German car selected as \"Car of the Year\" in 1968.\n\nIn Japan, the manufacturer [[Mazda]] solved the engine's chatter marks problem. The engine has been successfully used by Mazda in several generations of their RX-series of [[coup\u00e9]]s and sedans, including the [[Mazda Cosmo]], [[Mazda Familia#R100|R100]], the [[Mazda RX-7|RX-7]] and more recently the [[Mazda RX-8|RX-8]]. Mercedes-Benz completed its C111 experimental model in 1969 with 3-rotor Wankel engine. In 1970, the next model had a 4-rotor Wankel engine and could reach top speed 290&nbsp;km/h but never reached serial production.\n\nWankel became a success in business by securing license agreements around the world. By 1958 Wankel and partners had founded the \"Wankel GmbH\" company, providing Wankel with a share of the profits for marketing the engine. Among the licensees were [[Daimler-Benz]] since 1961, [[General Motors]] since 1970, [[Toyota]] since 1971. Royalties for the Wankel GmbH for licensure were 40%, later 36%.  In 1971 Wankel sold his share of the license royalties for 50 million Deutschmarks to the English conglomerate [[Lonmin|Lonrho]]. The following year he got his Technical Development Center back from the Fraunhofer Society.\n\nFrom 1986 the Felix Wankel Institute cooperated with Daimler Benz AG. Daimler Benz provided the operating costs in return for the research rights.  He sold the Institute to Daimler Benz for 100 million Marks.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Felix-wankel grab.JPG|thumb|Wankel's grave in Heidelberg]]\nWankel married Emma \"Mi\" Kirin in 1936. Though married until death, they had no children.\n\nHe never had a driver's license, because he was extremely near-sighted.<ref name=\"a\"/>  He was, however, the owner of an [[NSU Ro 80]] with a Wankel engine, which was chauffeured for him.\n\nIn 1969, Wankel was granted an [[honorary degree|honorary]] Doctorate of Engineering from [[Technical University Munich]].<ref name=\"a\"/> He was known for his championing of [[animal rights]] and opposition to the use of animals in testing.\n\nWankel died in [[Heidelberg]], aged 86. His grave may be found in the Bergfriedhof of Heidelberg.\nAfter his death, the Felix Wankel Foundation sold its real estate property to Volkswagen AG.  The Heidelberg Fire Department showcases his last workshop.  Wankel's papers are archived in the [[Technoseum]] in [[Mannheim]].  Furthermore, there is an exhibition \"[[Museum Autovision|AUTOVISION \u00b7 Tradition & Forum]]\" in [[Altlu\u00dfheim]], a permanent showing of over 80 rotary engines and many cars equipped with Wankel motors.\n\n===Licenses===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#e3e3e3;\"\n!

I designed a 75 twin camshaft, which was then adjusted for the Giro d\u2019Italia (a twin camshaft was a bit too heavy). So it was turned into a single camshaft and was used in the Giro d\u2019Italia on several occasions, in the Milan \u2013 Taranto and lots of other races, under the Ceccato brand. That engine acted as my business card when I was introduced to Count Borselli, on his request. He was looking for a young engineer, with a certain level of experience. I told him that I didn\u2019t have much experience but I showed him the finished engine and said that was what I could do. He said to me: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the engine but I\u2019m interested in you because I work with 125s and up. I can help you to sell it if that\u2019s what you want to do but I\u2019m not interested in it\u201d. And in fact he did help me sell it to Ceccato. He let me go to Ceccato for the tuning and then I worked at Mondial for two years, until 1954, when I joined Ducati.  At Mondial I tuned engines for the Giro d\u2019Italia, 125s and 175s, and then I started work on what was then known as the \u201cBilancerino\u201d, the 125 with exposed springs and a head similar to the one on the Ceccato. Then I produced the twin camshaft, which was the same as the Ceccato twin camshaft, on a Mondial, and then because of staffing problems I left Mondial and went to Ducati, where I still am today.\n}}</ref>  He began by designing Ducati's [[OHC]] [[four-stroke]] [[Ducati Singles|singles]], and in 1963 designed the prototype V4 [[Ducati Apollo]].

While 3GLs like [[COBOL]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[JavaScript]] remain popular for a wide variety of uses, 4GLs as originally defined found narrower uses. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Some advanced 3GLs like [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[Perl]] combine some 4GL abilities within a general-purpose 3GL environment. Also, [[library (computing)|libraries]] with 4GL-like features have been developed as add-ons for most popular 3GLs.  This has blurred the distinction of 4GL and 3GL.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, there were efforts to develop [[fifth-generation programming language]]s (5GL).\n\n==History==\nThough used earlier in papers and discussions, the term 4GL was first used formally by [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]] in his 1981 book ''Applications Development Without Programmers''<ref>[[James Martin (author)|Martin, James]]. ''Application Development Without Programmers.'' Prentice-Hall, 1981. {{ISBN|0-13-038943-9}}.</ref>  to refer to non-procedural, high-level [[specification language]]s. In some primitive way, early 4GLs were included in the [[Sterling Software|Informatics]] [[MARK-IV (Software)|MARK-IV]] (1967) product and [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]]'s [[MAPPER (Software)|MAPPER]] (1969 internal use, 1979 release).\n\nThe motivations for the '4GL' inception and continued interest are several. The term can apply to a large set of software products. It can also apply to an approach that looks for greater [[semantic]] properties and implementation power. Just as the 3GL offered greater power to the programmer, so too did the 4GL open up the development environment to a wider population.\n\nThe early input scheme for the 4GL supported entry of data within the [[Punched card#IBM 80 column punched card format|72-character limit of the punched card]] (8 bytes used for sequencing) where a card's tag would identify the type or function. With judicious use of a few cards, the [[Computer programming in the punch card era|4GL deck]] could offer a wide variety of processing and reporting capability whereas the equivalent functionality coded in a [[Third-generation programming language|3GL]] could subsume, perhaps, a whole box or more of [[Computer programming in the punch card era|cards]].<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/cards.html Columbia University Computing History: IBM Cards]</ref>\n\nThe 72-character metaphor [[Characters per line|continued for a while]] as hardware progressed to larger memory and terminal interfaces. Even with its limitations, this approach supported highly sophisticated applications.\n\nAs interfaces improved and allowed longer statement lengths and grammar-driven input handling, greater power ensued. An example of this is described on the [[Nomad software|Nomad]] page.\n\n::Another example of Nomad's power is illustrated by Nicholas Rawlings in his comments for the Computer History Museum about NCSS (see citation below). He reports that [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]] asked Rawlings for a Nomad solution to a standard problem Martin called the ''Engineer's Problem'': \"give 6% raises to engineers whose job ratings had an average of 7 or better.\" Martin provided a \"dozen pages of COBOL, and then just a page or two of [[MARK-IV (Software)|Mark IV]], from [[Sterling Software|Informatics]].\" Rawlings offered the following single statement, performing a set-at-a-time operation...\n\nThe development of the 4GL was influenced by several factors, with the hardware and operating system constraints having a large weight. When the 4GL was first introduced, a disparate mix of hardware and operating systems mandated custom application development support that was specific to the system in order to ensure sales. One example is the [[MAPPER (Software)|MAPPER]] system developed by [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]]. Though it has roots back to the beginning, the system has proven successful in many applications and has been ported to modern platforms. The latest variant is embedded in the BIS<ref>[[Unisys]].

Cohen at Mathematica, a mathematical software company.  Cohen left Mathematica and founded Information Builders to create a similar reporting-oriented 4GL, called [[FOCUS]].\n\nLater 4GL types are tied to a database system and are far different from the earlier types in their use of techniques and resources that have resulted from the general improvement of computing with time.\n\nAn interesting twist to the 4GL scene is realization that graphical interfaces and the [[End-user computing|related reasoning]] done by the user form a 'language' that is poorly understood.\n\n==Types==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EDev01.png|thumbnail|300px|An example of table-driven algorithm programming in eDeveloper 9.4]] -->\nA number of different types of 4GLs exist:\n* Table-driven (codeless) programming, usually running with a runtime framework and libraries. Instead of using code, the developer defines their logic by selecting an operation in a pre-defined list of memory or data table manipulation commands. In other words, instead of coding, the developer uses table-driven algorithm programming (see also [[control table]]s that can be used for this purpose). A good example of this type of 4GL language is [[PowerBuilder]]. These types of tools can be used for business application development usually consisting in a package allowing for both business data manipulation and reporting, therefore they come with GUI screens and report editors.

Born in Italy and raised in Los Angeles from the age of five, his [[rags-to-riches]] story has led film historians such as [[Ian Freer]] to consider him the \"[[American dream]] personified.\"<ref name=\"Freer\">Freer 2009, pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nCapra became one of America's most influential directors during the 1930s, winning three [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Awards for Best Director]] from six nominations, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations in other categories. Among his leading films were ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1938), and ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939); Capra was nominated as Best Director and as producer for [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] on all three films, winning both awards on the first two. During World War II, Capra served in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] and produced [[propaganda film]]s, such as the ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series.\n\nAfter World War II, Capra's career declined as his later films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), performed poorly when they were first released.<ref>Poague 2004, p. viii.</ref> In ensuing decades, however, ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and other Capra films were revisited favorably by critics. Outside of directing, Capra was active in the [[film industry]], engaging in various political and social issues. He served as President of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], worked alongside the [[Writers Guild of America]], and was head of the [[Directors Guild of America]]. {{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Early life==\nCapra was born '''Francesco Rosario Capra''' in [[Bisacquino]], a village near [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]]. He was the youngest of seven children of Salvatore Capra, a fruit grower, and the former Rosaria \"Serah\" Nicolosi. Capra's family was Roman Catholic.<ref>De Las Carreras, Maria Elena. [http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0154.html \"The Catholic Vision of Frank Capra.\"] ''Crisis, 20'', no. 2, February 2002. Retrieved: May 31, 2011.</ref> The name \"Capra\", notes Capra's biographer Joseph McBride, represents his family's closeness to the land, and means \"goat\".<ref name=McBride>McBride 1992, p. 16.</ref> He notes that the English word \"capricious\" derives from it, \"evoking the animal's skittish temperament\", adding that \"the name neatly expresses two aspects of Frank Capra's personality: emotionalism and obstinacy.\"<ref name=McBride/>\n\nIn 1903, when he was five, Capra emigrated to the United States with his family, who traveled in one of the steerage compartments of the steamship, ''Germania'', which was the cheapest way to book passage. For Capra, the journey, which took 13 days, remained in his mind for the rest of his life as one of his worst experiences:\n\n{{quote|You're all together \u2013 you have no privacy. You have a cot. Very few people have trunks or anything that takes up space. They have just what they can carry in their hands or in a bag. Nobody takes their clothes off. There's no ventilation, and it stinks like hell. They're all miserable. It's the most degrading place you could ever be.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 29.</ref>}}\n\nCapra remembers the ship's arrival in New York Harbor, where he saw \"a [[Statue of Liberty|statue]] of a great lady, taller than a church steeple, holding a torch above the land we were about to enter\". He recalls his father's exclamation at the sight:\n\n{{quote|Ciccio, look! Look at that! That's the greatest light since the star of Bethlehem! That's the light of freedom! Remember that|''Freedom''.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 30.</ref>}}\n\nThe family settled in [[Los Angeles]]'s East Side (today [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]]), which Capra described in his autobiography as an Italian \"ghetto\".<ref name=\"google\">McBride [https://books.google.com/books?id=DMkLpTFBEtUC 1992, p. 34.]</ref> Capra's father worked as a fruit picker and young Capra sold newspapers after school for 10 years, until he graduated from high school. Instead of working after graduating, as his parents wanted, he enrolled in college. He worked through college at the [[California Institute of Technology]], playing banjo at nightclubs and taking odd jobs, which included working at the campus laundry facility, waiting tables, and cleaning engines at a local power plant. He studied [[chemical engineering]] and graduated in the spring of 1918.<ref>[http://alumni.caltech.edu/distinguished_alumni/by_year?year=1966 \"Distinguished Alumni Award: 1966 Recipients.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194527/http://alumni.caltech.edu/distinguished_alumni/by_year?year=1966 |date=2011-07-16 }} ''Caltech Alumni Association''.

In the Army, he taught mathematics to artillerymen at [[Fort Point, San Francisco]]. His father died during the war in an accident (1916). In the Army, Capra contracted [[Spanish flu]] and was medically discharged to return home to live with his mother. He became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] U.S. citizen in 1920, taking the name '''Frank Russell Capra'''.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 96\">Wakeman 1987, p. 96.</ref> Living at home with his siblings and mother, Capra was the only family member with a college education, yet he was the only one who remained chronically unemployed. After a year without work, seeing how his siblings had steady jobs, he felt he was a failure, which led to bouts of depression and abdominal pains, later discovered to have been an undiagnosed burst appendix.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 96\"/>\n\nAfter recovering at home, Capra moved out and spent the next few years living in flophouses in San Francisco and hopping freight trains, wandering the Western United States. To support himself, he took odd jobs on farms, as a movie extra, playing poker, and selling local oil well stocks. In his early twenties, Capra had to undergo a [[circumcision]] due to recurring bouts of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] (the first of which happened after an anonymous encounter with a woman at a party in San Francisco), which caused severe damage to his [[sex life]], an affliction that lasted until his twilight years.<ref name=\"Schnakenberg p.51\">Schnakenberg 2010, p. 51.</ref>\n\nIt was during this time that the 24-year-old Capra directed a 32-minute documentary film entitled ''La Visita Dell'Incrociatore Italiano Libya a San Francisco''. Not only did it document the visit of the Italian naval vessel ''Libya'' to San Francisco, but also the reception given to the crew of the ship by San Francisco's L'Italia Virtus Club, now known as the [[San Francisco Italian Athletic Club]].\n\nAt 25, Capra took a job selling books written and published by American philosopher, [[Elbert Hubbard]].<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 96\"/>  Capra recalled that he \"hated being a peasant, being a scrounging new kid trapped in the Sicilian ghetto of Los Angeles. . . .  All I had was cockiness \u2013 and let me tell you that gets you a long way.\"<ref name=Stevens>Stevens 2006, pp. 74\u201376.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Silent film comedies===\nDuring his book sales efforts{{spaced ndash}}and nearly broke{{spaced ndash}}Capra read a newspaper article about a new movie studio opening in San Francisco. Capra phoned them saying he had moved from Hollywood, and falsely implied that he had experience in the budding film industry. Capra's only prior exposure to films was in 1915 while attending Manual Arts High School. The studio's founder, Walter Montague, was nonetheless impressed by Capra and offered him $75 to direct a one-reel silent film. Capra, with the help of a cameraman, made the film in two days and cast it with amateurs.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 96\"/>\n\nAfter that first serious job in films, Capra began efforts to finding similar openings in the film industry. He took a position with another minor San Francisco studio, and subsequently received an offer to work with producer [[Harry Cohn]] at his new studio in Los Angeles. During this time, he worked as a property man, film cutter, title writer, and assistant director.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 97\">Wakeman 1987, p. 97.</ref>\n\nCapra later became a gag writer for [[Hal Roach]]'s ''[[Our Gang]]'' series. He was twice hired as a writer for [[slapstick comedy]] director, [[Mack Sennett]], in 1918 and 1924.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McBride|first1=Joseph|title=Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success|date=2001|publisher=Univ.

According to Capra, it was he who invented Langdon's character, the innocent fool living in a \"naughty world.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 97\"/>\n\nWhen Langdon eventually left Sennett to make longer, feature-length movies with [[First National Pictures|First National]] Studios, he took Capra along as his personal writer and director. They made three feature films together during 1926 and 1927, all of them successful with critics and the public. The films made Langdon a recognized comedian in the caliber of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]]. Capra and Langdon later had a falling out, and Capra was fired. During the following years, Langdon's films went into decline without Capra's assistance.<ref>Eggert, William D. [http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/langdonarticle.html \"The Mystery of Harry Langdon profile], SilentsareGolden.com; accessed July 28, 2016.</ref> After splitting with Langdon, Capra directed a picture for First National, ''[[For the Love of Mike]]'', (1927). This was a silent comedy about three bickering godfathers, a German, a Jew, and an Irishman, starring a budding actress, [[Claudette Colbert]]. The movie was considered a failure.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 97\"/>\n\n===Columbia Pictures===\n\nCapra returned to Harry Cohn's studio, now named [[Columbia Pictures]], which was then producing short films and two-reel comedies for \"fillers\" to play between main features. Columbia was one of many start-up studios on \"[[Poverty Row]]\" in Los Angeles. Like the others, Columbia was unable to compete with larger studios, which often had their own production facilities, distribution, and theaters. Cohn rehired Capra in 1928 to help his studio produce new, full-length feature films, to compete with the major studios. Capra would eventually direct 20 films for Cohn's studio, including all of his classics.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 97\"/>\n\nBecause of Capra's engineering education, he adapted more easily to the new sound technology than most directors. He welcomed the transition to sound, recalling, \"I wasn't at home in silent films.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 97\"/> Most studios were unwilling to invest in the new sound technology, assuming it was a passing fad. Many in Hollywood considered sound a threat to the industry and hoped it would pass quickly; McBride notes that \"Capra was not one of them.\" When he saw [[Al Jolson]] singing in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' in 1927, considered the first talkie, Capra recalled his reaction:\n\n{{quote|It was an absolute shock to hear this man open his mouth and a song come out of it. It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 200.</ref>}}\n\nFew of the studio heads or crew were aware of Capra's engineering background until he began directing ''[[The Younger Generation]]'' in 1929. The chief cinematographer who worked with Capra on a number of films, was likewise unaware. He describes this early period in sound for film:\n\n{{quote|It wasn't something that came up. You had to bluff to survive. When sound first came in, nobody knew much about it. We were all walking around in the dark. Even the sound man didn't know much about it. Frank lived through it. But he was quite intelligent. He was one of the few directors who knew what the hell they were doing. Most of your directors walked around in a fog \u2013 they didn't know where the door was.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 201.</ref>}}\n\nDuring his first year with Columbia, Capra directed nine films, some of which were successful. After the first few, Harry Cohn said \"it was the beginning of Columbia making a better quality of pictures.\"<ref>McBride 1992, p. 189.</ref> According to Barson, \"Capra became ensconced as Harry Cohn's most trusted director.\"<ref name=Barson/> His films soon established Capra as a \"bankable\" director known throughout the industry, and Cohn raised Capra's initial salary of $1,000 per film to $25,000 per year.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 97\"/> Capra directed a film for MGM during this period, but soon realized he \"had much more freedom under Harry Cohn's benevolent dictatorship\", where Cohn also put Capra's \"name above the title\" of his films, a first for the movie industry.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 197.</ref> Capra wrote of this period and recalled the confidence that Cohn placed in Capra's vision and directing:\n\n{{quote|I owed Cohn a lot \u2013 I owed him my whole career. So I had respect for him, and a certain amount of love. Despite his crudeness and everything else, he gave me my chance. He took a gamble on me.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 199.</ref>}}\n\nCapra directed his first \"real\" sound picture, ''[[The Younger Generation]]'', in 1929. It was a rags-to-riches romantic comedy about a Jewish family's upward mobility in New York City, with their son later trying to deny his Jewish roots to keep his rich, gentile girlfriend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/1045|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref> According to Capra biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]], Capra \"obviously felt a strong identification with the story of a Jewish immigrant who grows up in the ghetto of New York... and feels he has to deny his ethnic origins to rise to success in America.\" Capra, however, denied any connection of the story with his own life.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMkLpTFBEtUC&lpg=PA202&pg=PA202#v=onepage&q=obviously%20felt%20a%20strong%20identification%20with%20the%20story%20of%20a%20Jewish%20immigrant%20who%20grows%20up%20in%20the%20ghetto%20of%20New%20York|title=Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success|last=McBride|first=Joseph|date=2011-06-02|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|year=|isbn=9781604738391|location=|pages=202|language=en}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, McBride insists that ''[[The Younger Generation]]'' abounds with parallels to Capra's own life.\" McBride notes the \"devastatingly painful climactic scene\", where the young social-climbing son, embarrassed when his wealthy new friends first meet his parents, passes his mother and father off as house servants. That scene, notes McBride, \"echoes the shame Capra admitted feeling toward his own family as he rose in social status.\"<ref>McBride 1992, p. 203.</ref>\n\nDuring his years at Columbia, Capra worked often with screenwriter [[Robert Riskin]] (husband of [[Fay Wray]]), and cameraman [[Joseph Walker (cinematographer)|Joseph Walker]]. In many of Capra's films, the wise-cracking and sharp dialogue was often written by Riskin, and he and Capra went on to become Hollywood's \"most admired writer-director team.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 98\">Wakeman 1987, p. 98.</ref>\n\n==Film career (1934\u20131941)==\n\n===''It Happened One Night'' (1934)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Frank Capra with stills - 1938.jpg|thumb|Capra looking over movie stills for ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1938) {{Pufc|1=Frank Capra with stills - 1938.jpg|date=5 November 2014}}]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Capra-Cohn-39.jpg|thumb|Receiving his first Oscar with producer Harry Cohn, 1935]] -->\nCapra's films in the 1930s enjoyed immense success at the [[Academy Awards]].

Written by [[Robert Riskin]], it is one of the first of the ''[[Screwball comedy film|screwball comedies]]'', and with its release in the [[Great Depression]], critics considered it an [[Escapism|escapist]] story and a variation of the ''[[American Dream]]''. The film established the names of Capra, Columbia Pictures, and stars [[Clark Gable]] and [[Claudette Colbert]] in the movie industry. The film has been called \"[[Picaresque novel|picaresque]].\" It was one of the earliest ''[[road movie]]s'' and inspired variations on that theme by other filmmakers.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 99\">Wakeman 1987, p. 99.</ref>\n\nHe followed the film with ''[[Broadway Bill]]'' (1934), a screwball comedy about horse racing. The film was a turning point for Capra, however, as he began to conceive an additional dimension to his movies. He started using his films to convey messages to the public. Capra explains his new thinking:\n{{quote|My films must let every man, woman, and child know that God loves them, that I love them, and that peace and salvation will become a reality only when they all learn to love each other.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 99\"/>}}\n\nThis added goal was inspired after meeting with a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]] friend who told him to view his talents in a different way:\n\n{{quote|The talents you have, Mr. Capra, are not your own, not self-acquired. God gave you those talents; they are his gifts to you, to use for his purpose.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 99\"/>}}\n\nCapra began to embody messages in subsequent films, many of which conveyed \"fantasies of goodwill.\" The first of those was ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936), for which Capra won his second Best Director Oscar. Critic [[Alistair Cooke]] observed that Capra was \"starting to make movies about themes instead of people.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 100\">Wakeman 1987, p. 100.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Capra won his third Director Oscar in five years for ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'', which also won Best Picture. In addition to his three directing wins, Capra received directing nominations for three other films (''[[Lady for a Day]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''). On May 5, 1936, Capra hosted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony.\n\n===''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939)===\nAlthough ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' is his best-known film, Friedman notes that it was ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), which most represented the \"Capra myth.\" That film expressed Capra's patriotism more than any others, and \"presented the individual working within the democratic system to overcome rampant political corruption.\"<ref name=Friedman/>\n\nThe film, however, became Capra's most controversial. In his research before filming, he was able to stand close to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during a press conference after the recent acts of war by Germany in Europe. Capra recalls his fears:\n\n{{quote|And panic hit me. Japan was slicing up the colossus of China piece by piece. Nazi panzers had rolled into Austria and Czechoslovakia; their thunder echoed over Europe. England and France shuddered. The Russian bear growled ominously in the Kremlin. The black cloud of war hung over the chancelleries of the world. Official Washington from the President down, was in the process of making hard, torturing decisions. \"And here was I, in the process of making a satire about government officials; ... Wasn't this the most untimely time for me to make a film about Washington?<ref>Capra 1971, p. 259.</ref>}}\n\nWhen the filming was completed, the studio sent preview copies to Washington. [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], U.S. ambassador to the UK, wrote to Columbia head Harry Cohn, \"Please do not play this picture in Europe.\"<ref name=Friedman/> Politicians were concerned about the potential negative impact the film might have on the morale of the United States' allies, as [[World War II]] had begun. Kennedy wrote to President Roosevelt that, \"In foreign countries this film must inevitably strengthen the mistaken impression that the United States is full of [[Graft (politics)|graft]], corruption and lawlessness.\"<ref name=Beauchamp/> Many studio heads agreed, nor did they want negative feelings about Hollywood instilled in political leaders.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 261.</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Capra's vision of the film's significance was clear:\n\n{{quote|The more uncertain are the people of the world, the more their hard-won freedoms are scattered and lost in the winds of chance, the more they need a ringing statement of America's democratic ideals. The soul of our film would be anchored in [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]. Our Jefferson Smith would be a young Abe Lincoln, tailored to the rail-splitter's simplicity, compassion, ideals, humor, and unswerving moral courage under pressure.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 260.</ref>}}\n\nCapra pleaded with Cohn to allow the film to go into distribution and remembers the intensity of their decision making:\n\n{{quote|Harry Cohn paced the floor, as stunned as [[Abraham]] must have been when the Lord asked him to sacrifice his beloved son [[Isaac]].<ref>Capra 1971, p. 289.</ref>}}\n\nCohn and Capra chose to ignore the negative publicity and demands, and released the film as planned. It was later nominated for 11 Academy Awards, only winning one (for Best Original Story) partly because of the number of major pictures that were [[12th Academy Awards|nominated that year]] was 10, including ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.<ref name=Barson>Barson 1995, pp. 56\u201363.</ref> Hollywood columnist [[Louella Parsons]] called it a \"smash patriotic hit\" and most critics agreed, seeing that audiences left the theaters with \"an enthusiasm for democracy\" and \"in a glow of patriotism.\"<ref name=Beauchamp>Beauchamp 2010, pp. 364\u2013365.</ref>\n\nThe significance of the film's message was established further in France, shortly after World War II began. When the French public were asked to select which film they wanted to see most, having been told by the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] that soon no more American films would be allowed in France, the overwhelming majority chose it over all others. To a France soon to be invaded and occupied by Nazi forces, the film most expressed the \"perseverance of democracy and the [[American way]].\"<ref name=Friedman/>\n\n===''Meet John Doe'' (1941)===\n[[File:Meet John Doe 1941.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Brennan]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Irving Bacon]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], and [[James Gleason]] in ''Meet John Doe'']]\nIn 1941 Capra directed ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' (1941), which some consider Capra's most controversial movie. The film's hero, played by [[Gary Cooper]], is a former baseball player now bumming around, lacking goals. He is selected by a news reporter to represent the \"[[Commoner|common man]],\" to capture the imagination of ordinary Americans. The film was released shortly before America became involved in World War II, and citizens were still in an [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]] mood. According to some historians, the film was made to convey a \"deliberate reaffirmation of American values,\" though ones that seemed uncertain with respect to the future.\n\nFilm author Richard Glazer speculates that the film may have been autobiographical, \"reflecting Capra's own uncertainties.\" Glazer describes how, \"John's accidental transformation from [[Vagrancy (people)|drifter]] to national figure parallels Capra's own early drifting experience and subsequent involvement in movie making ... ''Meet John Doe'', then, was an attempt to work out his own fears and questions.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 101\">Wakeman 1987, p. 101.</ref>\n\n==World War II years (1941\u20131945)==\n\n===Joining the Army after Pearl Harbor===\n[[File:Frank Capra.JPG|thumb|Editing film as Major during World War II]]\nWithin four days after the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Capra quit his successful directing career in Hollywood and received a commission as a [[Major (United States)|major]] in the [[United States Army]]. He also gave up his presidency of the [[Screen Directors Guild]]. Being 44 years of age, he was not asked to enlist, but, notes Friedman, \"Capra had an intense desire to prove his patriotism to his adopted land.\"<ref name=Friedman/>\n\nCapra recalls some personal reasons for enlisting:\n\n{{quote|I had a guilty conscience. In my films I championed the cause of the gentle, the poor, the downtrodden. Yet I had begun to live like the [[Aga Khan]]. The curse of Hollywood is big money. It comes so fast it breeds and imposes its own mores, not of wealth, but of ostentation and phony status.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 314.</ref>}}\n\n===''Why We Fight'' series===\n{{main|Why We Fight}}\nDuring the next four years of [[World War II]], Capra's job was to head a special section on morale to explain to soldiers \"why the hell they're in uniform\", writes Capra, and were not \"propaganda\" films like those created by the Nazis and Japan. Capra directed or co-directed seven documentary war information films.\n\nCapra was assigned to work directly under Chief of Staff [[George C. Marshall]], the most senior officer in command of the Army, who later created the [[Marshall Plan]] and was awarded a [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Marshall chose to bypass the usual documentary film-making department, [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], because he felt they were not capable of producing \"sensitive and objective troop information films.\" One colonel explained the importance of these future films to Capra:\n\n{{quote|You were the answer to the General's prayer ... You see, Frank, this idea about films to explain \"why\" the boys are in uniform is General Marshall's own baby, and he wants the nursery right next to his Chief of Staff's office.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 322.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Capra-Army-45.jpg|thumb|Receiving The [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] from General [[George C. Marshall]], 1945]]\nDuring his first meeting with General Marshall, Capra was told his mission:\n\n{{quote|Now, Capra, I want to nail down with you a plan to make a series of documented, factual-information films \u2013 the first in our history \u2013 that will explain to our boys in the Army ''why'' we are fighting, and the ''principles'' for which we are fighting ... You have an opportunity to contribute enormously to your country and the cause of freedom. Are you aware of that, sir?<ref>Capra 1971, p. 326.</ref>}}\n\nThe films included the seven-episode ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series \u2013 consisting of ''[[Prelude to War]]'' (1942),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/17411/a_prelude_to_war|title=A Prelude to War|last=Kurash|first=John|date=February 25, 2009|website=US Army|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Nazis Strike]]'' (1942),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bobrowen.com/nymas/frank_capra.html|title=The New York Military Affairs Symposium|last=Rowen|first=Robert|date=June 14, 2002|website=Bobrowen.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]'' (1943), ''[[The Battle of Britain]]'' (1943),  ''[[The Battle of Russia]]'' (1943), ''[[The Battle of China]]'' (1944), ''[[War Comes to America]]'' (1945)&nbsp;\u2013 plus ''[[Know Your Enemy: Japan]]'' (1945), ''[[Here Is Germany]]'' (1945), ''[[Tunisian Victory]]'' (1945), and ''[[Two Down and One to Go]]'' (1945) that do not bear the ''[[Why We Fight]]'' banner; as well as the [[African-American]] related film, ''[[The Negro Soldier]]'' (1944).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAfter he completed the first few documentaries, government officials and U.S. Army staff felt they were powerful messages and excellent presentations of why it was necessary for the U.S. to fight in the war. All footage came from military and government sources, whereas during earlier years, many newsreels secretly used footage from enemy sources. Animated charts were created by [[Walt Disney]] and his animators. A number of Hollywood composers wrote the background music, including [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] and Russian-born composer [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]. After the first complete film was viewed by General Marshall along with U.S. Army staff, Marshall approached Capra: \"Colonel Capra, how did you do it? That is a most wonderful thing.\"<ref>Capra 1971, p. 341.</ref>\n\nOfficials made efforts to see that the films were seen in theaters throughout the U.S. They were translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese for use by other countries. [[Winston Churchill]] ordered that ''all'' of them be shown to the British public in theaters.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 336.</ref> They are today often broadcast on television and used as a teaching aid.<ref name=Friedman/>\n\nThe ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series is widely considered a masterpiece of war information documentaries, and won an Academy Award. ''[[Prelude to War]]'' won the 1942 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]. When his career ended, Capra regarded these films as his most important works. As a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], he received the Legion of Merit in 1943 and the Distinguished Service Medal in 1945.\n\n==Post-war career (1946\u20131961)==\n\n===''It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946)===\n[[Image:Guardian angel clarence.jpg|155px|right|thumbnail|[[Henry Travers]] and [[James Stewart]]]]\nAfter the war ended, along with directors [[William Wyler]] and [[George Stevens]], Capra founded [[Liberty Films]]. Their studio became the first independent company of directors since United Artists in 1919 whose goal was to make films without interference by studio bosses. However, the only pictures completed by the studio were ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[State of the Union (film)|State of the Union]]'' (1948).<ref name=Stevens/> It was a box office disappointment, but was nonetheless nominated for five [[Academy Awards]].\n\nWhile the film did not resonate with audiences in 1946, its popularity has grown through the years. In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) named it one of the best films ever made, putting it at 11th on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list of the top American films of all time.  In 2006, the AFI put the film at the top of its [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers]] list, ranking what AFI considers the most inspirational American movies of all time. It would become Capra's last film to win major acclaim&mdash;his successful years were now behind him, although he directed five more films over the next 14 years.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nFor ''State of the Union'' (1948), Capra changed studios, working for the only time for [[MGM Pictures]]. Although the project had an excellent pedigree with stars [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]], the film was not a success, and Capra's statement, \"I think ''State of the Union'' was my most perfect film in handling people and ideas\" has few adherents today.<ref>Poague 2004, p. 180.</ref>\n\n===Representing U.S. at International Film Festival===\nIn January 1952, the U.S. Ambassador to India asked Capra to represent the U.S. film industry at an International Film Festival to be held in India. A State Department friend of Capra asked him and explained why his trip would be important:\n\n{{quote|[Ambassador] Bowles thinks the Festival is a Communist shenanigan of some kind, but he doesn't know what ... Bowles has asked for ''you''. \"I want a free-wheeling guy to take care of our interest on his own. I want Capra. His name is big here, and I've heard he's quick on his feet in an alley fight.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 429.</ref>}}\n\nAfter two weeks in India, Capra discovered that Bowles' fears were warranted, as many film sessions were used by Russian and Chinese representatives to give long political speeches. At a lunch with 15 Indian directors and producers, he stressed that \"they must preserve freedom as artists, and that any government control would hinder that freedom. A [[totalitarian system]] \u2013  and they would become nothing but publicity men for the party in power.\" Capra had a difficult time communicating this, however, as he noted in his diary:\n\n{{quote|They all think some super-government or super-collection of individuals dictates all American pictures. Free enterprise is mystery to them. Somebody ''must'' control, either visible or invisible ... Even intellectuals have no great understanding of liberty and freedom ... Democracy is only a theory to them. They have no idea of service to others, of service to the poor. The poor are despised, in a sense.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 433.</ref>}}\n\nWhen he returned to Washington to give his report, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] gave Capra his commendation for \"virtually single-handedly forestalling a possible Communist take-over of Indian films.\" Ambassador Bowles also conveyed gratitude to Capra for \"one helluva job.\"<ref>Capra 1971, p. 437.</ref>\n\n===Disillusionment period and later years===\nAlthough ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[State of the Union (film)|State of the Union]]'' were successful soon after the war ended, Capra's themes were becoming out of step with changes in the film industry and the public mood. Friedman finds that while Capra's ideas were popular with depression-era and prewar audiences, they became less relevant to a prospering post-war America. Capra had become \"disconnected from an American culture that had changed\" during the previous decade.<ref name=Friedman/> Biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] argues that Capra's disillusionment was more related to the negative effect that the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) had on the film industry in general. The HUAC interrogations in the early 1950s ended many Hollywood careers. Capra himself was not called to testify, although he was a prime target of the committee due to his past associations with many [[Hollywood blacklist]]ed screenwriters.<ref name=Friedman/>\n\nCapra blames his early retirement from films on the rising power of stars, which forced him to continually compromise his artistic vision. He also claims that increasing budgetary and scheduling demands were constraining his creative abilities.<ref name=Friedman/> Film historian [[Michael Medved]] agrees with and understands Capra's impressions, noting that he walked away from the movie business because \"he refused to adjust to the cynicism of the new order.\"<ref name=Medved>Medved 1992, p. 279.</ref> In his autobiography written in 1971, Capra expressed his feelings about the shifting film industry:<ref>Capra 1971, p. 486.</ref>\n\n{{quote|The winds of change blew through the dream factories of make-believe, tore at its crinoline tatters.... The hedonists, the homosexuals, the hemophiliac bleeding hearts, the God-haters, the quick-buck artists who substituted shock for talent, all cried: \"Shake 'em! Rattle 'em! God is dead. Long live pleasure! Nudity? Yea! Wife-swapping? Yea! Liberate the world from prudery. Emancipate our films from morality!\".... Kill for thrill \u2013 shock! Shock! To hell with the good in man, Dredge up his evil \u2013 shock! Shock!<ref name=Medved/>}}\n\nCapra added that in his opinion, \"practically all the Hollywood film-making of today is stooping to cheap salacious pornography in a crazy bastardization of a great art to compete for the 'patronage' of deviates and masturbators.\"<ref>Capra 1971, p. 400.</ref>{{#tag:ref| Medved points out the irony in Capra's expression of disillusionment: Capra's film ''It Happened One Night'' (1934) was the first film to win all five top Oscars, and in 1991, a few months after Capra's death, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' also won all five top Oscars.<ref name=Medved/>|group=Note}}\n\nCapra remained employable in Hollywood during and after the HUAC hearings, but chose nonetheless to demonstrate his loyalty by attempting to re-enlist in the Army at the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], in 1950. He was rejected due to his age.<ref>[http://www.cerescourier.com/section/11/article/6577/ \"LEGENDARY HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER HAD A WONDERFUL LIFE WITH CERES GIRL AS WIFE\"], ''The Ceres Courier'', January 13, 2016.</ref> He was later invited to join the Defense Department's newly formed Think Tank project, VISTA, but was denied the necessary clearance. According to Friedman, \"these two rejections were devastating to the man who had made a career of demonstrating American ideals in film\", along with his directing award-winning documentary films for the Army. By 1952, at the age of 55, Capra effectively retired from Hollywood filmmaking and spent his later years working with [[Caltech]], his alma mater, to produce educational films on science topics.<ref name=Friedman/>\n\n===Later films (1950\u20131961)===\nCapra directed two films at [[Paramount Pictures]] starring [[Bing Crosby]], ''[[Riding High (1950 film)|Riding High]]'' (1950) and ''[[Here Comes the Groom]]'' (1951). From 1952 to 1956, Capra produced four science-related television specials in color for [[The Bell Laboratory Science Series]]: ''[[Our Mr. Sun]]'' (1956), ''[[Hemo the Magnificent]]'' (1957), ''[[The Bell Laboratory Science Series#The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays (1957)|The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays]]'' (1957), and ''[[The Bell Laboratory Science Series#The Unchained Goddess (1958)|Meteora: The Unchained Goddess]]'' (1958). These educational science documentaries were popular favorites for school science classrooms.<ref>Capra 1997, p. 443.</ref> It was eight years before he directed another theatrical film, ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959) with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Edward G. Robinson]], his first feature film in color. His final theatrical film was with [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Bette Davis]], named ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]'' (1961), a remake of his 1933 film ''[[Lady for a Day]]''. In the mid-1960s he worked on pre-production for an adaptation of Martin Caidin's novel ''[[Marooned (novel)|Marooned]],'' but budgetary constraints caused him to eventually shelve it.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=151873&mainArticleId=151863 \"'Marooned'\"], tcm.com; retrieved September 26, 2010.</ref>\n\nCapra's final film, ''[[Rendezvous in Space]]'' (1964), was an industrial film made for the [[Martin Marietta]] Company and shown at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. It was exhibited at the [[New York Hall of Science]] after the Fair ended.\n\n==Directing style==\nCapra's directing style relied on improvisation to a great extent. He was noted for going on the set with no more than the master scenes written. He explained his reasoning:\n\n{{quote|What you need is what the scene is about, who does what to whom, and who cares about whom ... All I want is a master scene and I'll take care of the rest \u2013 how to shoot it, how to keep the machinery out of the way, and how to focus attention on the actors at all times.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 102\"/>}}\n\nAccording to some experts, Capra used great, unobtrusive craftsmanship when directing, and felt it was bad directing to distract the audience with fancy technical gimmicks. Film historian and author William S. Pechter described Capra's style as one \"of almost classical purity.\" He adds that his style relied on editing to help his films sustain a \"sequence of rhythmic motion.\" Pechter describes its effect:\n\n{{quote|Capra's [editing] has the effect of imposing order on images constantly in motion, imposing order on chaos. The end of all this is indeed a kind of beauty, a beauty of controlled motion, more like dancing than painting ... His films move at a breathtaking clip: dynamic, driving, taut, at their extreme even hysterical; the unrelenting, frantic acceleration of pace seems to spring from the release of some tremendous accumulation of pressure.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 102\"/>}}\n\nFilm critic John Raeburn discusses an early Capra film, ''[[American Madness]]'' (1932), as an example of how he had mastered the movie medium and expressed a unique style:\n\n{{quote|The tempo of the film, for example, is perfectly synchronized with the action... as the intensity of the panic increases, Capra reduces the duration of each shot and uses more and more crosscutting and jump shots to emphasize the \"madness\" of what is happening... Capra added to the naturalistic quality of the dialogue by having speakers overlap one another, as they often do in ordinary life; this was an innovation that helped to move the talkies away from the example of the legitimate stage.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 98\"/>}}\n\nAs for Capra's subject matter, film author Richard Griffith tries to summarize Capra's common theme:\n\n{{quote|[A] messianic innocent... pits himself against the forces of entrenched greed. His inexperience defeats him strategically, but his gallant integrity in the face of temptation calls for the goodwill of the \"little people\", and through their combined protest, he triumphs.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 102\">Wakeman 1987, p. 102.</ref>}}\n\nCapra's personality when directing gave him a reputation for \"fierce independence\" when dealing with studio bosses. On the set he was said to be gentle and considerate, \"a director who displays absolutely no exhibitionism.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 103\">Wakeman 1987, p. 103.</ref> As Capra's films often carry a message about basic goodness in human nature, and show the value of unselfishness and hard work, his wholesome, feel-good themes have led some cynics to term his style \"Capra-corn.\" However, those who hold his vision in higher regard prefer the term \"Capraesque\".<ref name=Friedman>Pendergast 2000, pp. 428\u201329.</ref>\n\nCapra's basic themes of championing the common man, as well as his use of spontaneous, fast-paced dialogue and goofy, memorable lead and supporting characters, made him one of the most popular and respected filmmakers of the 20th century.

The performances his actors gave were invariable portrayals of  personalities developed into recognizable images of popular culture, \"their acting has the bold simplicity of an icon...\"  <ref>Dickstein 2010, pp. 479\u201380.</ref>\n\nLike his contemporary, director [[John Ford]], Capra defined and aggrandized the tropes of mythic America where individual courage invariably triumphs over collective evil. Film historian Richard Griffith speaks of Capra's \"...reliance on sentimental conversation and the ultimate benevolence of ordinary America to resolve all deep conflicts.\" <ref name=\"Dickstein 2010, p. 479\">Dickstein  2010, p. 479.</ref> \"Average America\" is visualized  as \"...a tree lined street, undistinguished frame houses surrounded by modest areas of grass, a few automobiles. For certain purposes it assumed that all ''real ''Americans live in towns like this, and so great is the power of myth, even the born city-dweller is likely to believe vaguely that he too lives on this shady street, or comes from it, or is going to.\"  <ref>Dickstein 2010, p. 480.</ref>\n\nNYU professor Leonard Quart writes:\n\n<blockquote>There would be no enduring conflicts \u2013 harmony, no matter how contrived and specious, would ultimately triumph in the last frame...In true Hollywood fashion, no Capra film would ever suggest that social change was a complex, painful act. For Capra, there would be pain and loss, but no enduring sense of tragedy would be allowed to intrude on his fabulist world.<ref name=\"Dickstein 2010, p. 479\"/></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Capra's stature as a director had declined in the 1950s, his films underwent a revival in the 1960s:\n\n{{quote|Ten years later, it was clear that this trend had reversed itself. Post-[[auteur]]ist critics once more acclaimed Capra as a cinematic master, and perhaps more surprisingly, young people packed Capra festivals and revivals all over the United States.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 103\"/>}}\n\nFrench film historian John Raeburn, editor of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', noted that Capra's films were unknown in France, but there too his films underwent a fresh discovery by the public. He believes the reason for his renewed popularity had to do with his themes, which he made credible \"an ideal conception of an American national character\":\n\n{{quote|There is a strong libertarian streak in Capra's films, a distrust of power wherever it occurs and in whomever it is invested. Young people are won over by the fact that his heroes are uninterested in wealth and are characterized by vigorous ... individualism, a zest for experience, and a keen sense of political and social justice. ... Capra's heroes, in short, are ideal types, created in the image of a powerful national myth.<ref name=\"Wakeman p. 103\"/>}}\n\nIn 1982, the [[American Film Institute]] honored Capra by giving him their [[AFI Life Achievement Award]]. The event was used to create the television film, ''The American Film Institute Salute to Frank Capra'', hosted by James Stewart. In 1986, Capra received the [[National Medal of Arts]]. During his acceptance speech for the AFI award, Capra stressed his most important values:\n\n{{quote|The art of Frank Capra is very, very simple: It's the love of people. Add two simple ideals to this love of people: the freedom of each individual, and the equal importance of each individual, and you have the principle upon which I based all my films.}}\n\nCapra expanded on his visions in his 1971 autobiography, ''The Name Above the Title'':\n\n{{quote|Forgotten among the hue-and criers were the hard-working stiffs that came home too tired to shout or demonstrate in streets... and prayed they'd have enough left over to keep their kids in college, despite their knowing that some were pot-smoking, parasitic parent-haters.<br><br> Who would make films about, and for, these uncomplaining, unsqueaky wheels that greased the squeaky? Not me. My \"one man, one film\" Hollywood had ceased to exist. Actors had sliced it up into capital gains. And yet \u2013 mankind needed dramatizations of the truth that man is essentially good, a living atom of divinity; that compassion for others, friend or foe, is the noblest of all virtues. Films must be made to say these things, to counteract the violence and the meanness, to buy time to demobilize the hatreds.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 468.</ref>}}\n\n==Honors==\nThe ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series earned Capra the Legion of Merit in 1943 and the Distinguished Service Medal in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-lt-col-frank-capra-receives-the-legion-of-merit-the-hollywood-movie-78824635.html|title=Stock Photo - Lt.

football]] competition contested by the senior [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] of the members of the ''{{lang|fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association}}'' ([[FIFA]]), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural tournament in 1930]], except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The current champion is [[France national football team|France]], which won its second title at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 tournament]] in Russia.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification phase]], which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Cup Finals''. After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Brazil are\" instead of \"Brazil is\".--> have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]], with four titles each; [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[France national football team|France]] and inaugural winner [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], with two titles each; and [[England national football team|England]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] with one title each.\n\nThe World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the [[Olympic Games]]; the cumulative viewership of all matches of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] was estimated to be 26.29&nbsp;billion with an estimated 715.1&nbsp;million people watching the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]], a ninth of the entire population of the planet.<ref name=\"2006coverage\">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/marketing/news/newsid=111247/index.html |title=2006 FIFA World Cup broadcast wider, longer and farther than ever before |work=FIFA.com |publisher=[[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref><ref>Tom Dunmore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9j1wbp2t1usC&pg=PA235#v=onepage&q&f=false Historical Dictionary of Soccer], page 235, quote \"The World Cup is now the most-watched sporting event in the world on television, above even the Olympic Games.\"</ref><ref>Stephen Dobson and John Goddard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GxyG0XXdvR4C&pg=PA407#v=onepage&q&f=false The Economics of Football], page 407, quote \"The World Cup is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world: the estimated cumulative television audience for the 2006 World Cup in Germany was 26.2 billion, an average of 409 million viewers per match.\u201d</ref><ref>Glenn M.

Planned by [[The Football Association]] (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for [[amateurism|amateur]] players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the [[England national amateur football team]]) won the [[gold medal]]s. They repeated the feat at the [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].\n\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, [[Thomas Lipton|Sir Thomas Lipton]] organised the [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]] tournament in [[Turin]] in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as ''The First World Cup'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/news/thomaslipton.htm |title='The First World Cup'.

Lipton invited [[West Auckland Town F.C.|West Auckland]], an amateur side from [[County Durham]], to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.\n\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]] as a \"world football championship for amateurs\", and took responsibility for managing the event.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/more-associations-follow.html |title=History of FIFA \u2013 More associations follow |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Summer Olympics]], contested by [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] and 13 European teams, and won by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Reyes |first=Macario |date=18 October 1999 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1920f-det.html |title=VII.

Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] to make the trip.

Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] ([[CONCACAF|North, Central America and Caribbean]]) in 1930 and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] ([[Asian Football Confederation|Asia]]) in 2002.

In [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], Germany became the first European team to win in the Americas. Only on five occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent, and currently it is the first time with four champions in a row from the same continental confederation. Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively, while Italy's triumph in 2006 has been followed by wins for Spain in 2010, Germany in 2014 and France in 2018.

He was [[Roman consul|consul]] five times (233, 228, 215, 214, and 209 BC) and was appointed [[Roman Dictator|dictator]] in 221 and 217 BC.  He was [[Roman Censor|censor]] in 230 BC. His [[agnomen]], ''Cunctator'', usually translated as \"the delayer\", refers to [[Fabian strategy|the strategy]] that he employed against [[Hannibal|Hannibal's]] forces during the [[Second Punic War]]. Facing an outstanding commander with superior numbers, he pursued a then novel strategy of targeting the enemy's supply lines, and accepting only smaller engagements on favourable ground, rather than risking his entire army on direct confrontation with Hannibal himself. As a result, he is regarded as the originator of many tactics used in [[guerrilla warfare]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Laqueur|first=Walter|title=Guerrilla Warfare: A Historical & Critical Study|year=1976|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-76-580406-8|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nBorn at Rome ''circa'' 280 BC, Fabius was a descendant of the ancient [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Fabia (gens)|Fabia gens]].  He was the son or grandson{{efn-lr|Livy identifies Verrucosus as the son of Gurges and grandson of Rullianus, but [[Pliny the Elder]] and Plutarch call him the great-grandson of Rullianus.  Modern scholarship supposes that he was ''probably'' the grandson of Gurges, although in this case his father's identity is uncertain.  He was probably the son of either the Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges who was consul in 265 BC, or of the Quintus Fabius who was curule aedile in 267.  Traditionally the Gurges who was consul in 265 has been regarded as the same man who had been consul for the first time in 292, and again in 276, in which case Livy may be correct; but some scholars think that the Gurges who was consul in 265 was the son of the consul of 292 and 276; the aedile of 267 may have been his brother or another kinsman.}} of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 265 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]], three times consul and ''[[princeps senatus]]'', and grandson or great-grandson of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus]], a hero of the [[Samnite Wars]], who like Verrucosus held five consulships, as well as the offices of dictator and censor. Many earlier ancestors had also been consuls. His [[cognomen]], ''Verrucosus'', or \"warty\", used to distinguish him from other members of his family, derived from a wart on his upper lip.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott-Kilvert|first=Ian|title=Plutarch: Makers of Rome|year=1965|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-0-14-044158-1|pages=53}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], Fabius possessed a mild temper and slowness in speaking. As a child, he had difficulties in learning, engaged in sports with other children cautiously and appeared submissive in his interactions with others. All the above were perceived by those who knew him superficially to be signs of inferiority. However, according to Plutarch, these traits proceeded from stability, greatness of mind, and lion-likeness of temper. By the time he reached adulthood and was roused by active life, his virtues exerted themselves; consequently, his lack of energy displayed during his earlier years was revealed as a result of a lack of passion and his slowness was recognised as a sign of prudence and firmness.<ref>(http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Fabius_Maximus*.html)</ref><ref>http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/fabius.html</ref>\n\nWhile still a youth in 265 BC, Fabius was consecrated an [[augur]].<ref>T. R. S. Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', American Philological Association (1951), vol. I, p. 202.</ref> It is unknown whether he participated in the [[First Punic War]], fought between the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] from 264 to 241 BC, or what his role might have been. Fabius' political career began in the years following that war.  He was probably [[quaestor]] in 237 or 236 BC, and curule [[aedile]] about 235.<ref>Broughton, vol. I, pp. 222, 223.</ref>  During his first [[Roman consul|consulship]], in 233 BC, Fabius was awarded a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for his victory over the [[Ligures|Ligurians]], whom he defeated and drove into the [[Alps]].  He was [[Roman Censor|censor]] in 230, then consul a second time in 228.<ref>Broughton, vol. I, pp. 224, 227, 228.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Livy]], in 218 BC Fabius took part in an embassy to Carthage, sent to demand redress for the capture of the supposedly neutral town of [[Saguntum]] in [[Hispania|Spain]].  After the delegation had received the Carthaginians' reply, it was Fabius himself who, addressing the Carthaginian senate, issued a formal declaration of war between Carthage and the Roman Republic.<ref>Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxi. 18.</ref>  However, [[Cassius Dio]], followed by [[Zonaras]], calls the ambassador ''Marcus Fabius'', suggesting that it was his cousin, [[Marcus Fabius Buteo]], who issued the declaration of war against the Carthaginians.<ref>Broughton, vol. I, pp. 239, 241 (note 7).</ref>\n\n==Second Dictatorship==\nWhen the [[Roman Consul|Consul]] [[Gaius Flaminius]] was killed during the disastrous Roman defeat at the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] in 217 BC, panic swept Rome. With Consular armies destroyed in two major battles, and [[Hannibal]] approaching Rome's gates, the Romans feared the imminent destruction of their city. The [[Roman Senate]] decided to appoint a [[Roman dictator|dictator]], and chose Fabius for the role once again, in part due to his advanced age and experience. However, he was not allowed to appoint his own [[Master of the Horse]]; instead, the Romans chose a political enemy, [[Marcus Minucius Rufus (consul 221 BC)|Marcus Minucius]]. Then Fabius quickly sought to calm the Roman people by asserting himself as a strong Dictator at the moment of what was perceived to be the worst crisis in Roman history. He asked the Senate to allow him to ride on horseback, which Dictators were never allowed to do. He then caused himself to be accompanied by the full complement of twenty-four lictors, and ordered the surviving Consul, [[Gnaeus Servilius Geminus]], to dismiss his lictors (in essence, surrendering his office), and to present himself before Fabius as a private citizen.\n\n[[Plutarch]] tells us that Fabius believed that the disaster at Lake Trasimene was due, in part, to the fact that the gods had become neglected. Before that battle, a series of omens had been witnessed, including a series of lightning bolts, which Fabius had believed were warnings from the gods. He had warned Flaminius of this, but Flaminius had ignored the warnings. And so Fabius, as Dictator, next sought to please the gods. He ordered a massive sacrifice of the whole product of the next harvest season throughout Italy, in particular that of cows, goats, swine, and sheep. In addition, he ordered that musical festivities be celebrated, and then told his fellow citizens to each spend a precise sum of 333 [[Sestertius|sestertii]] and 333 [[Denarius|denarii]]. Plutarch isn't sure exactly how Fabius came up with this number, although he believes it was to honor the perfection of the number three, as it is the first of the odd numbers, and one of the first of the [[prime number]]s. It is not known if Fabius truly believed that these actions had won the gods over to the Roman side, although the actions probably did (as intended) convince the average Roman that the gods had finally been won over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/fabius.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive \u2013 Fabius by Plutarch \u2013 3rd paragraph |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref>\n\n===Fabian strategy===\n{{main|Fabian strategy}}\nFabius respected Hannibal's military skill and so refused to meet him in a [[pitched battle]]. Instead, he kept his troops close to Hannibal, hoping to exhaust him in a long [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. Fabius was able to harass the Carthaginian foraging parties, limiting Hannibal's ability to wreak destruction, while conserving his own military force. The delaying tactics involved not directly engaging Hannibal, while also exercising a \"[[scorched earth]]\" practice to prevent Hannibal's forces from obtaining grain and other resources. \n\nThe Romans were unimpressed with this defensive strategy and at first gave Fabius his epithet Cunctator (delayer) as an insult. The strategy was in part ruined because of a lack of unity in the command of the Roman army, since Fabius' Master of the Horse, Minucius, was a political enemy of Fabius. At one point, Fabius was called by the priests to assist with certain sacrifices, and as such, Fabius left the command of the army in the hands of Minucius during his absence. Fabius had told Minucius not to attack Hannibal in his absence, but Minucius disobeyed and attacked anyway. The attack, though of no strategic value, resulted in the retreat of several enemy units, and so the Roman people, desperate for good news, believed Minucius to be a hero. On hearing of this, Fabius became enraged, and, as Dictator, could have ordered Minucius' execution for his disobedience. One of the [[tribune|Plebeian Tribunes]] (chief representatives of the people) for the year, Metilius, was a partisan of Minucius, and as such he sought to use his power to help Minucius. The Plebeian Tribunes were the only magistrates independent of the Dictator, and so with his protection, Minucius was relatively safe. Plutarch states that Metilius \"boldly applied himself to the people in the behalf of Minucius\", and had Minucius granted powers equivalent to those of Fabius. By this, Plutarch probably means that as a Plebeian Tribune, Metilius had the [[Plebeian Council]], a popular assembly which only Tribunes could preside over, grant Minucius quasi-dictatorial powers.\n\n[[Image:Hannibal Slodtz Louvre MR2093.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Hannibal counting the rings of the [[Roman Senate|Roman senators]] killed during the Battle of Cannae, statue by [[S\u00e9bastien Slodtz]], 1704, [[Louvre]]]]\n\nFabius did not attempt to fight the promotion of Minucius, but rather decided to wait until Minucius' rashness caused him to run headlong into some disaster. He realized what would happen when Minucius was defeated in battle by Hannibal. Fabius, we are told, reminded Minucius that it was Hannibal, and not he, who was the enemy. Minucius proposed that they share the joint control of the army, with command rotating between the two every other day. Fabius rejected this, and instead let Minucius command half of the army, while he commanded the other half. Minucius openly claimed that Fabius was cowardly because he failed to confront the Carthaginian forces. Near the present-day town of [[Larino]] in the Molise (then called Larinum), Hannibal had taken up position in a town called Gerione. In the valley between Larino and Gerione, Minucius decided to make a broad frontal attack on Hannibal's troops. Several thousand men were involved on either side. It appeared that the Roman troops were winning, but Hannibal had set a trap. Soon the Roman troops were being slaughtered. Upon seeing the ambush of Minucius' army, Fabius cried \"O Hercules! how much sooner than I expected, though later than he seemed to desire, hath Minucius destroyed himself!\" On ordering his army to join the battle and rescue their fellow Romans, Fabius exclaimed \"We must make haste to rescue Minucius, who is a valiant man, and a lover of his country.\"\n\nFabius rushed to his co-commander's assistance and Hannibal's forces immediately retreated. After the battle, there was some feeling that there would be conflict between Minucius and Fabius; however, the younger soldier marched his men to Fabius' encampment and is reported to have said, \"My father gave me life. Today you saved my life. You are my second father. I recognize your superior abilities as a commander.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} When Fabius' term as Dictator ended, consular government was restored, and [[Gnaeus Servilius Geminus]] and Marcus Atilius Regulus assumed the consulship for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe once looked down upon tactics employed by Fabius came then to be respected. It is said, asserts Plutarch, that even Hannibal acknowledged and feared the Fabian strategy and the Roman inexhaustible manpower. After Fabius lured him away from Apulia into the Bruttian territory and then proceeded to besiege Tarentum by treachery in 209 BC, Hannibal commented, \"It seems that the Romans have found another Hannibal, for we have lost Tarentum in the same way that we took it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Plutarch|title=Makers of Rome|date=1965|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=9780140441581|pages=78|chapter=Fabius Maximus}}</ref>\n\n==After his dictatorship==\nShortly after Fabius had laid down his dictatorship, [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] and Ameilus Paullus were elected as consuls. They rallied the people through the [[Roman assemblies|assemblies]], and won their support for his plan to abandon Fabius' strategy, and engage Hannibal directly. Varro's rashness did not surprise Fabius, but when Fabius learned of the size of the army (eighty-eight thousand soldiers) that Varro had raised, he became quite concerned. Unlike the losses that had been suffered by Minucius, a major loss by Varro had the potential to kill so many soldiers that Rome might have had no further resources with which to continue the war. Fabius had warned the other consul for the year, [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Aemilius Paullus]], to make sure that Varro remained unable to directly engage Hannibal. According to Plutarch, Paullus replied to Fabius that he feared the votes in Rome more than Hannibal's army.\n\nWhen word reached Rome of the disastrous Roman defeat under Varro and Paullus at the [[Battle of Cannae]] in 216 BC, the [[SPQR|Senate and the People of Rome]] turned to Fabius for guidance. They had believed his strategy to be flawed before, but now they thought him to be as wise as the gods. He walked the streets of Rome, assured as to eventual Roman victory, in an attempt to comfort his fellow Romans. Without his support, the senate might have remained too frightened to even meet. He placed guards at the gates of the city to stop the frightened Romans from fleeing, and regulated mourning activities. He set times and places for this mourning, and ordered that each family perform such observances within their own private walls, and that the mourning should be complete within a month; following the completion of these mourning rituals, the entire city was [[Ritual purification|purified]] of its blood-guilt in the deaths.<ref>Livy, The Histories of Rome, 22.55</ref> This decree effectively outlawed competitive outdoor mourning, which could have had a devastating psychological impact on the survivors.\n\n===Honors and death===\n''Cunctator'' became an honorific title, and his delaying tactic was followed in Italy for the rest of the war. Fabius' own military success was small, aside from the reconquest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in 209 BC. For this victory, Plutarch tells us, he was awarded a second triumph that was even more splendid than the first. When Marcus Livius Macatus, the governor of Tarentum, claimed the merit of recovering the town, Fabius rejoined, \"Certainly, had you not lost it, I would have never retaken it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/fabius.html |title=Plutarch, '&#39;Lives'&#39;, life of \"Fabius\", ca. 75 A.D. tr. by John Dryden, ca. 1683 |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Appian of Alexandria |url=http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_hannibal_07.html |title=Appian, '&#39;History of Rome'&#39; or '&#39;Roman History'&#39;, before 165 A.D., \\S 32 on Tarentum, available at |publisher=Livius.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref> After serving as Dictator, he served as a Consul twice more (in 215 BC and 214 BC), and for a fifth time in 209 BC.

Fabius continued to argue that confronting Hannibal directly was too dangerous. Scipio planned to take Roman forces to Carthage itself and force Hannibal to return to Africa to defend the city. Scipio was eventually given limited approval, despite continuous opposition from Fabius, who blocked levies and restricted Scipio's access to troops. Fabius wished to ensure that sufficient forces remained to defend Roman territory if Scipio was defeated. Fabius became gravely ill and died in 203 BC, shortly after Hannibal's army left Italy, and before the eventual Roman victory over Hannibal at the [[Battle of Zama]] won by Scipio.\n\nPart of his eulogy is preserved on a fragment, which praised his delaying strategy in his altercations with Hannibal during the Second Punic War. The inscription reads as follows: \"...[as censor] he conducted the first revision of the senate membership and held committal elections in the consulship of Marcus Junius Pera and Marcus Barbula; he besieged and recaptured Tarentum and the strong-hold of Hannibal, and [obtained enormous booty?]; he won surpassing glory by his military [exploits?].\" <ref>Lewis, Naphtali, and Meyer Reinhold.

Print.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nLater, he became a legendary figure and the model of a tough, courageous Roman, and was bestowed the honorific title, \"The Shield of Rome\" (similar to [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] being named the \"Sword of Rome\"). According to [[Ennius]], ''unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem'' \u2013 \"one man, by delaying, restored the state to us.\" [[Virgil]], in the [[Aeneid]], has [[Aeneas]]' father Anchises mention Fabius Maximus while in [[Hades]] as the greatest of the many great Fabii, quoting the same line. While Hannibal is mentioned in the company of history's greatest generals, military professionals have bestowed Fabius' name on an entire [[military strategy|strategic]] doctrine known as \"[[Fabian strategy]]\", and [[George Washington]] has been called \"the American Fabius.\"\n\nAccording to its own ancient legend, the Roman princely family of [[Massimo (family)|Massimo]] descends from Fabius Maximus.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[Fabian Society]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[socialist]] society founded at the end of the 19th century and still active today.

For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of [[Significant figures|significant digits]] (the [[significand]]) and scaled using an [[Exponentiation|exponent]] in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen. A number that can be represented exactly is of the following form:\n: <math>\\text{significand} \\times \\text{base}^\\text{exponent},</math>\nwhere significand is an integer (i.e., in '''[[Integer|Z]]'''), base is an integer greater than or equal to two, and exponent is also an integer.\nFor example:\n: <math>1.2345 = \\underbrace{12345}_\\text{significand} \\times \\underbrace{10}_\\text{base}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!^{\\overbrace{-4}^\\text{exponent}}.</math>\n\nThe term ''floating point'' refers to the fact that a number's [[radix point]] (''decimal point'', or, more commonly in computers, ''binary point'') can \"float\"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the [[significant digits]] of the number. This position is indicated as the exponent component, and thus the floating-point representation can be thought of as a kind of [[scientific notation]].\n\nA floating-point system can be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of different [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)|orders of magnitude]]: e.g. the [[Astronomical scales|distance between galaxies]] or the [[Subatomic scales|diameter of an atomic nucleus]] can be expressed with the same unit of length. The result of this [[dynamic range]] is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers grows with the chosen scale.<ref name=\"Smith_1997\" />\n\nOver the years, a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers.  However, since the 1990s, the most commonly encountered representation is that defined by the [[IEEE 754]] Standard.\n\nThe speed of floating-point operations, commonly measured in terms of [[FLOPS]], is an important characteristic of a [[computer system]], especially for applications that involve intensive mathematical calculations.\n\nA [[floating-point unit]] (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating-point numbers.\n\n== Overview ==\n=== Floating-point numbers ===\nA [[number representation]] specifies some way of encoding a number, usually as a string of digits.\n\nThere are several mechanisms by which strings of digits can represent numbers. In common mathematical notation, the digit string can be of any length, and the location of the [[radix point]] is indicated by placing an explicit [[Decimal separator|\"point\" character]] (dot or comma) there. If the radix point is not specified, then the string implicitly represents an [[integer]] and the unstated radix point would be off the right-hand end of the string, next to the least significant digit. In [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] systems, a position in the string is specified for the radix point. So a fixed-point scheme might be to use a string of 8 decimal digits with the decimal point in the middle, whereby \"00012345\" would represent 0001.2345.\n\nIn [[scientific notation]], the given number is scaled by a [[exponentiation|power of 10]], so that it lies within a certain range\u2014typically between 1 and 10, with the radix point appearing immediately after the first digit.  The scaling factor, as a power of ten, is then indicated separately at the end of the number.  For example, the orbital period of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] is {{val|152853.5047|fmt=commas}} seconds, a value that would be represented in standard-form scientific notation as {{val|1.528535047|e=5|fmt=commas}} seconds.\n\nFloating-point representation is similar in concept to scientific notation. Logically, a floating-point number consists of:\n* A signed (meaning positive or negative) digit string of a given length in a given [[base (exponentiation)|base]] (or [[radix]]). This digit string is referred to as the [[significand|''significand'', ''mantissa'', or ''coefficient'']]. The length of the significand determines the ''precision'' to which numbers can be represented.  The radix point position is assumed always to be somewhere within the significand\u2014often just after or just before the most significant digit, or to the right of the rightmost (least significant) digit.  This article generally follows the convention that the radix point is set just after the most significant (leftmost) digit.\n* A signed integer [[exponent]] (also referred to as the ''characteristic'', or ''scale''), which modifies the magnitude of the number.\n\nTo derive the value of the floating-point number, the ''significand'' is multiplied by the ''base'' raised to the power of the ''exponent'', equivalent to shifting the radix point from its implied position by a number of places equal to the value of the exponent\u2014to the right if the exponent is positive or to the left if the exponent is negative.\n\nUsing base-10 (the familiar [[Decimal representation|decimal]] notation) as an example, the number {{val|152853.5047|fmt=commas}}, which has ten decimal digits of precision, is represented as the significand {{val|1528535047|fmt=commas}} together with 5 as the exponent.  To determine the actual value, a decimal point is placed after the first digit of the significand and the result is multiplied by {{10^|5}} to give {{val|1.528535047|e=5|fmt=commas}}, or {{val|152853.5047|fmt=commas}}. In storing such a number, the base (10) need not be stored, since it will be the same for the entire range of supported numbers, and can thus be inferred.\n\nSymbolically, this final value is:\n: <math>\\frac{s}{b^{\\,p-1}} \\times b^e,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|s}} is the significand (ignoring any implied decimal point), {{mvar|p}} is the precision (the number of digits in the significand), {{mvar|b}} is the base (in our example, this is the number ''ten''), and {{mvar|e}} is the exponent.\n\nHistorically, several number bases have been used for representing floating-point numbers, with base two ([[Binary numeral system|binary]]) being the most common, followed by base ten ([[decimal floating point]]), and other less common varieties, such as base sixteen ([[hexadecimal floating point]]<ref name=\"Zehendner_2008\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_9\"/>), eight (octal floating point<ref name=\"Muller_2010\"/><ref name=\"Savard_2018\"/><ref name=\"Zehendner_2008\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_8\"/>), base three ([[balanced ternary floating point]])<ref name=\"Muller_2010\"/> and even base {{val|65536|fmt=commas}}.<ref name=\"Lazarus_1956\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_10\"/>\n\nA floating-point number is a [[rational number]], because it can be represented as one integer divided by another; for example {{val|1.45|e=3}} is (145/100)\u00d71000 or {{val|145000|fmt=commas}}/100. The base determines the fractions that can be represented; for instance, 1/5 cannot be represented exactly as a floating-point number using a binary base, but 1/5 can be represented exactly using a decimal base ({{val|0.2}}, or {{val|2|e=-1}}). However, 1/3 cannot be represented exactly by either binary (0.010101...) or decimal (0.333...), but in [[ternary numeral system|base 3]], it is trivial (0.1 or 1\u00d73<sup>\u22121</sup>) . The occasions on which infinite expansions occur [[positional notation#Infinite representations|depend on the base and its prime factors]].\n\n<!-- Note: The following text contains information about how a number can be rounded to nearest. Such information may come too early in this article. Then, it could be more detailed: rounding can yield an increase of the exponent, and a possible overflow. Moreover, in general, one does not necessarily know the first N bits of a number, but just an approximation (this is not equivalent when the Table maker's dilemma occurs). Thus the text below might be misleading. -->\nThe way in which the significand (including its sign) and exponent are stored in a computer is implementation-dependent. The common IEEE formats are described in detail later and elsewhere, but as an example, in the binary single-precision (32-bit) floating-point representation, <math>p = 24</math>, and so the significand is a string of 24 [[bit]]s.  For instance, the number [[Pi|\u03c0]]'s first 33 bits are:\n: <math>11001001\\ 00001111\\ 1101101\\underline{0}\\ 10100010\\ 0</math>.\n\nIn this binary expansion, let us denote the positions from 0 (leftmost bit, or most significant bit) to 32 (rightmost bit). The 24-bit significand will stop at position&nbsp;23, shown as the underlined bit {{val|0}} above. The next bit, at position&nbsp;24, is called the ''round bit'' or ''rounding bit''. It is used to round the 33-bit approximation to the nearest 24-bit number (there are [[rounding#Tie-breaking|specific rules for halfway values]], which is not the case here). This bit, which is {{val|1=1}} in this example, is added to the integer formed by the leftmost 24 bits, yielding:\n: <math>11001001\\ 00001111\\ 1101101\\underline{1}</math>.\n\nWhen this is stored in memory using the IEEE 754 encoding, this becomes the [[significand]] {{mvar|s}}. The significand is assumed to have a binary point to the right of the leftmost bit. So, the binary representation of \u03c0 is calculated from left-to-right as follows:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n            &\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{p-1} \\text{bit}_n \\times 2^{-n}\\right) \\times 2^e \\\\\n        ={} &\\left(1 \\times 2^{-0} + 1 \\times 2^{-1} + 0 \\times 2^{-2} + 0 \\times 2^{-3} + 1 \\times2^{-4} + \\dots + 1 \\times 2^{-23}\\right) \\times 2^1 \\\\\n  \\approx{} &1.5707964 \\times 2 \\\\\n  \\approx{} &3.1415928\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|p}} is the precision ({{val|24}} in this example), {{mvar|n}} is the position of the bit of the significand from the left (starting at {{val|0}} and finishing at {{val|23}} here) and {{mvar|e}} is the exponent ({{val|1=1}} in this example).\n\n{{anchor|Hidden bit}}It can be required that the most significant digit of the significand of a non-zero number be non-zero (except when the corresponding exponent would be smaller than the minimum one). This process is called ''normalization''. For binary formats (which uses only the digits {{val|0}} and {{val|1=1}}), this non-zero digit is necessarily {{val|1}}. Therefore, it does not need to be represented in memory; allowing the format to have one more bit of precision. This rule is variously called the ''leading bit convention'', the ''implicit bit convention'', the ''hidden bit convention'',<ref name=\"Muller_2010\"/> or the ''assumed bit convention''.\n\n=== Alternatives to floating-point numbers ===\nThe floating-point representation is by far the most common way of representing in computers an approximation to real numbers. However, there are alternatives:\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] representation uses integer hardware operations controlled by a software implementation of a specific convention about the location of the binary or decimal point, for example, 6 bits or digits from the right. The hardware to manipulate these representations is less costly than floating point, and it can be used to perform normal integer operations, too. Binary fixed point is usually used in special-purpose applications on embedded processors that can only do integer arithmetic, but decimal fixed point is common in commercial applications.\n* [[Logarithmic number system]]s (LNSs) represent a real number by the logarithm of its absolute value and a sign bit. The value distribution is similar to floating point, but the value-to-representation curve (''i.e.'', the graph of the logarithm function) is smooth (except at 0). Conversely to floating-point arithmetic, in a logarithmic number system multiplication, division and exponentiation are simple to implement, but addition and subtraction are complex. The ([[symmetric level-index arithmetic|symmetric]]) [[level-index arithmetic]] (LI and SLI) of Charles Clenshaw, [[Frank William John Olver|Frank Olver]] and Peter Turner is a scheme based on a [[generalized logarithm]] representation.\n* [[Tapered floating-point representation]], which does not appear to be used in practice.\n* Where greater precision is desired, floating-point arithmetic can be implemented (typically in software) with variable-length significands (and sometimes exponents) that are sized depending on actual need and depending on how the calculation proceeds.  This is called [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary-precision]] floating-point arithmetic.\n* Floating-point expansions are another way to get a greater precision, benefiting from the floating-point hardware: a number is represented as an unevaluated sum of several floating-point numbers. An example is [[Quadruple-precision floating-point format#Double-double arithmetic|double-double arithmetic]], sometimes used for the C type <code>[[long double]]</code>.\n* Some simple rational numbers (''e.g.'', 1/3 and 1/10) cannot be represented exactly in binary floating point, no matter what the precision is. Using a different radix allows one to represent some of them (''e.g.'', 1/10 in decimal floating point), but the possibilities remain limited. Software packages that perform [[fraction (mathematics)|rational arithmetic]] represent numbers as fractions with integral numerator and denominator, and can therefore represent any rational number exactly.  Such packages generally need to use \"[[bignum]]\" arithmetic for the individual integers.\n* [[Interval arithmetic]] allows one to represent numbers as intervals and obtain guaranteed bounds on results. It is generally based on other arithmetics, in particular floating point.\n* [[Computer algebra system]]s such as [[Mathematica]], [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]], and [[Maple (software)|Maple]] can often handle irrational numbers like <math>\\pi</math> or <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> in a completely \"formal\" way, without dealing with a specific encoding of the significand.  Such a program can evaluate expressions like \"<math>\\sin (3\\pi)</math>\" exactly, because it is programmed to process the underlying mathematics directly, instead of using approximate values for each intermediate calculation.\n\n=== History ===\nIn 1914, [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]] designed an [[electro-mechanical]] version of [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[Analytical Engine]], and included floating-point arithmetic.<ref name=\"Randell_1982\" />\nIn 1938, [[Konrad Zuse]] of Berlin completed the [[Z1 (computer)|Z1]], the first binary, programmable [[mechanical computer]];<ref name=\"Rojas_1997\" /> it uses a 24-bit binary floating-point number representation with a 7-bit signed exponent, a 17-bit significand (including one implicit bit), and a sign bit.<ref name=\"Rojas_2014\" /> The more reliable [[relay]]-based [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], completed in 1941, has representations for both positive and negative infinities; in particular, it implements defined operations with infinity, such as <math>^1/_\\infty = 0</math>, and it stops on undefined operations, such as <math>0 \\times \\infty</math>.\n[[File:Konrad Zuse (1992).jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Konrad Zuse]], architect of the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] computer, which uses a 22-bit binary floating-point representation.]]\n\nZuse also proposed, but did not complete, carefully rounded floating-point arithmetic that includes <math>\\pm\\infty</math> and NaN representations, anticipating features of the IEEE Standard by four decades.<ref name=\"Kahan_1997_JVNL\" /> In contrast, [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] recommended against floating-point numbers for the 1951 [[IAS machine]], arguing that fixed-point arithmetic is preferable.<ref name=\"Kahan_1997_JVNL\" />\n\nThe first ''commercial'' computer with floating-point hardware was Zuse's [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]] computer, designed in 1942\u20131945. In 1946, Bell Laboratories introduced the Mark&nbsp;V, which implemented [[decimal floating point|decimal floating-point numbers]].<ref name=\"Randell_1982_2\" />\n\nThe [[Pilot ACE]] has binary floating-point arithmetic, and it became operational in 1950 at [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]]. Thirty-three were later sold commercially as the [[English Electric DEUCE]]. The arithmetic is actually implemented in software, but with a one megahertz clock rate, the speed of floating-point and fixed-point operations in this machine were initially faster than those of many competing computers.\n\nThe mass-produced [[IBM 704]] followed in 1954; it introduced the use of a [[Exponent bias|biased exponent]]. For many decades after that, floating-point hardware was typically an optional feature, and computers that had it were said to be \"scientific computers\", or to have \"[[scientific computation]]\" (SC) capability (see also [[Extensions for Scientific Computation]] (XSC)). It was not until the launch of the Intel i486 in 1989 that ''general-purpose'' personal computers had floating-point capability in hardware as a standard feature.\n\nThe [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series]], introduced in 1962, supported two floating-point representations:\n* ''Single precision'': 36 bits, organized as a 1-bit sign, an 8-bit exponent, and a 27-bit significand.\n* ''Double precision'': 72 bits, organized as a 1-bit sign, an 11-bit exponent, and a 60-bit significand.\n\nThe [[IBM 7094]], also introduced in 1962, supports single-precision and double-precision representations, but with no relation to the UNIVAC's representations. Indeed, in 1964, IBM introduced proprietary [[IBM Floating Point Architecture|hexadecimal floating-point representations]] in its [[System/360]] mainframes; these same representations are still available for use in modern [[z/Architecture]] systems.  However, in 1998, IBM included IEEE-compatible binary floating-point arithmetic to its mainframes; in 2005, IBM also added IEEE-compatible decimal floating-point arithmetic.\n\nInitially, computers used many different representations for floating-point numbers. The lack of standardization at the mainframe level was an ongoing problem by the early 1970s for those writing and maintaining higher-level source code; these manufacturer floating-point standards differed in the word sizes, the representations, and the rounding behavior and general accuracy of operations. Floating-point compatibility across multiple computing systems was in desperate need of standardization by the early 1980s, leading to the creation of the [[IEEE 754]] standard once the 32-bit (or 64-bit) [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] had become commonplace. This standard was significantly based on a proposal from Intel, which was designing the [[Intel 8087|i8087]] numerical coprocessor; Motorola, which was designing the [[68000]] around the same time, gave significant input as well.\n\nIn 1989, mathematician and computer scientist [[William Kahan]] was honored with the [[Turing Award]] for being the primary architect behind this proposal; he was aided by his student (Jerome Coonen) and a visiting professor (Harold Stone).<ref name=\"Severance_1998\" />\n\nAmong the x86 innovations are these:\n* A precisely specified floating-point representation at the bit-string level, so that all compliant computers interpret bit patterns the same way. This makes it possible to accurately and efficiently transfer floating-point numbers from one computer to another (after accounting for [[endianness]]).\n* A precisely specified behavior for the arithmetic operations: A result is required to be produced as if infinitely precise arithmetic were used to yield a value that is then rounded according to specific rules. This means that a compliant computer program would always produce the same result when given a particular input, thus mitigating the almost mystical reputation that floating-point computation had developed for its hitherto seemingly non-deterministic behavior.\n* The ability of exceptional conditions (overflow, divide by zero, etc.) to propagate through a computation in a benign manner and then be handled by the software in a controlled fashion.\n\n== Range of floating-point numbers ==\nA floating-point number consists of two [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] components, whose range depends exclusively on the number of bits or digits in their representation. Whereas components linearly depend on their range, the floating-point range linearly depends on the significand range and exponentially on the range of exponent component, which attaches outstandingly wider range to the number.\n\nOn a typical computer system, a ''double precision'' (64-bit) binary floating-point number has a coefficient of 53 bits (including 1 implied bit), an exponent of 11 bits, and 1 sign bit. Since 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024, the complete range of floating-point numbers in this format is from approximately 2<sup>\u22121023</sup>&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;10<sup>\u2212308</sup> to 2<sup>1023</sup>&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;10<sup>308</sup> (see [[IEEE 754]]).\n\nThe number of normalized floating-point numbers in a system (''B'', ''P'', ''L'', ''U'') where\n\n* ''B'' is the base of the system,\n* ''P'' is the precision of the system to ''P'' numbers,\n* ''L'' is the smallest exponent representable in the system,\n* and ''U'' is the largest exponent used in the system)\n\nis <math>2 \\left(B - 1\\right) \\left(B^{P-1}\\right) \\left(U - L + 1\\right) + 1</math>.\n\nThere is a smallest positive normalized floating-point number,\n: Underflow level = UFL = <math>B^L</math>,\n\nwhich has a 1 as the leading digit and 0 for the remaining digits of the significand, and the smallest possible value for the exponent.\n\nThere is a largest floating-point number,\n: Overflow level = OFL = <math>\\left(1 - B^{-P}\\right)\\left(B^{U + 1}\\right)</math>,\n\nwhich has ''B'' \u2212 1 as the value for each digit of the significand and the largest possible value for the exponent.\n\nIn addition, there are representable values strictly between \u2212UFL and UFL. Namely, [[signed zero|positive and negative zeros]], as well as [[denormal numbers|denormalized numbers]].\n\n== IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers ==\n{{Main|IEEE 754}}\n{{merge to|IEEE 754|date=May 2017|section=TRUE|discuss=Talk:IEEE 754#Merge of IEEE 754-related chapter from \"Floating-point arithmetic\" into here?}}\n{{Floating-point}}\n\nThe [[IEEE]] standardized the computer representation for binary floating-point numbers in [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] (a.k.a. IEC 60559) in 1985. This first standard is followed by almost all modern machines. It was [[IEEE 754 revision|revised in 2008]]. IBM mainframes support [[IBM Floating Point Architecture|IBM's own hexadecimal floating point format]] and [[IEEE 754-2008]] [[decimal floating point]] in addition to the IEEE 754 binary format. The [[Cray T90]] series had an IEEE version, but the [[Cray SV1|SV1]] still uses Cray floating-point format.\n\nThe standard provides for many closely related formats, differing in only a few details.  Five of these formats are called ''basic formats'' and others are termed ''extended formats''; three of these are especially widely used in computer hardware and languages:\n* [[Single precision]], usually used to represent the \"float\" type in the C language family (though this is [[C data types#Basic types|not guaranteed]]). This is a binary format that occupies 32 bits (4 bytes) and its significand has a precision of 24 bits (about 7 decimal digits).\n* [[Double precision]], usually used to represent the \"double\" type in the C language family (though this is [[C data types#Basic types|not guaranteed]]). This is a binary format that occupies 64 bits (8 bytes) and its significand has a precision of 53 bits (about 16 decimal digits).\n* [[Extended precision|Double extended]], also called \"extended precision\" format. This is a binary format that occupies at least 79 bits (80 if the hidden/implicit bit rule is not used) and its significand has a precision of at least 64 bits (about 19 decimal digits). A format satisfying the minimal requirements (64-bit precision, 15-bit exponent, thus fitting on 80 bits) is provided by the [[x86 architecture]].  In general on such processors, this format can be used with \"[[long double]]\" in the C language family (the [[C99]] and [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]] standards \"IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic extension- Annex F\" recommend the 80-bit extended format to be provided as \"long double\" when available).  On other processors, \"long double\" may be a synonym for \"double\" if any form of extended precision is not available, or may stand for a larger format, such as quadruple precision.\n\nIncreasing the precision of the floating point representation generally reduces the amount of accumulated [[round-off error]] caused by intermediate calculations.<ref name=\"Kahan_2004\" />\nLess common IEEE formats include:\n* [[Quadruple precision]] (binary128). This is a binary format that occupies 128 bits (16 bytes) and its significand has a precision of 113 bits (about 34 decimal digits).\n* [[Decimal64 floating-point format|Double precision]] (decimal64) and [[Decimal128 floating-point format|quadruple precision]] (decimal128) decimal floating-point formats. These formats, along with the [[Decimal32 floating-point format|single precision]]  (decimal32) format, are intended for performing decimal rounding correctly.\n* [[Half precision|Half]], also called binary16, a 16-bit floating-point value. It is being used in the NVIDIA [[Cg (programming language)|Cg]] graphics language, and in the openEXR standard.<ref name=\"OpenEXR\" />\n\n<!--In addition, some platforms use the non-IEEE \"double-double\" format, where the number is represented as unevaluated sum of two double precision numbers. It can have some strange properties unlike other formats. http://aggregate.org/NPAR/iccs2006.pdf-->\nAny integer with absolute value less than 2<sup>24</sup> can be exactly represented in the single precision format, and any integer with absolute value less than 2<sup>53</sup> can be exactly represented in the double precision format. Furthermore, a wide range of powers of 2 times such a number can be represented. These properties are sometimes used for purely integer data, to get 53-bit integers on platforms that have double precision floats but only 32-bit integers.\n\nThe standard specifies some special values, and their representation: positive [[infinity]] (+\u221e), negative infinity (\u2212\u221e), a [[negative zero]] (\u22120) distinct from ordinary (\"positive\") zero, and \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s).\n\nComparison of floating-point numbers, as defined by the IEEE standard, is a bit different from usual integer comparison. Negative and positive zero compare equal, and every NaN compares unequal to every value, including itself. All values except NaN are strictly smaller than +\u221e and strictly greater than \u2212\u221e. Finite floating-point numbers are ordered in the same way as their values (in the set of real numbers).\n\n=== Internal representation ===\nFloating-point numbers are typically packed into a computer datum as the sign bit, the exponent field, and the significand or mantissa, from left to right.  For the IEEE 754 binary formats (basic and extended) which have extant hardware implementations, they are apportioned as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!Type\n!Sign\n!Exponent\n!Significand field\n!Total bits\n!\n!Exponent bias\n!Bits precision\n!Number of decimal digits\n|-\n|[[Half precision|Half]] ([[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754-2008]])\n|1\n|5\n|10\n|16\n|\n|15\n|11\n|~3.3\n|-\n|[[Single precision|Single]]\n|1\n|8\n|23\n|32\n|\n|127\n|24\n|~7.2\n|-\n|[[Double precision|Double]]\n|1\n|11\n|52\n|64\n|\n|1023\n|53\n|~15.9\n|-\n|[[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|x86 extended precision]]\n|1\n|15\n|64\n|80\n|\n|16383\n|64\n|~19.2\n|-\n|[[Quad precision|Quad]]\n|1\n|15\n|112\n|128\n|\n|16383\n|113\n|~34.0\n|}\n\nWhile the exponent can be positive or negative, in binary formats it is stored as an unsigned number that has a fixed \"bias\" added to it. Values of all 0s in this field are reserved for the zeros and [[subnormal numbers]]; values of all 1s are reserved for the infinities and NaNs. The  exponent range for normalized numbers is [\u2212126, 127] for single precision, [\u22121022, 1023] for double, or [\u221216382, 16383] for quad. Normalized numbers exclude subnormal values, zeros, infinities, and NaNs.\n\nIn the IEEE binary interchange formats the leading 1 bit of a normalized significand is not actually stored in the computer datum.  It is called the \"hidden\" or \"implicit\" bit.  Because of this, single precision format actually has a significand with 24 bits of precision, double precision format has 53, and quad has 113.\n\nFor example, it was shown above that \u03c0, rounded to 24 bits of precision, has:\n* sign = 0 ; ''e'' = 1 ; ''s'' = 110010010000111111011011 (including the hidden bit)\nThe sum of the exponent bias (127) and the exponent (1) is 128, so this is represented in single precision format as\n* 0 10000000 10010010000111111011011 (excluding the hidden bit) = 40490FDB<ref name=\"Babbage\" /> as a [[hexadecimal]] number.\n\n==== Piecewise linear approximation to exponential and logarithm ====\n[[File:Log by aliasing to int.svg|thumb|right|Integers reinterpreted as floating-point numbers (in blue, piecewise linear), compared to a scaled and shifted logarithm (in gray, smooth).]]\n{{See also|Fast inverse square root#Aliasing to an integer as an approximate logarithm}}\nIf one graphs the floating-point value of a bit pattern (''x''-axis is bit pattern, considered as integers, ''y''-axis the value of the floating-point number; assume positive), one obtains a piecewise linear approximation of a shifted and scaled exponential function with base 2, <math>2^y</math> (hence actually <math>k2^{y-l}</math>). Conversely, given a real number, if one takes the floating-point representation and considers it as an integer, one gets a piecewise linear approximation of a shifted and scaled base 2 logarithm, <math>\\log_2(x)</math> (hence actually <math>c \\log_2(x + d)</math>), as shown at right.\n\nThis interpretation is useful for visualizing how the values of floating-point numbers vary with the representation, and allow for certain efficient approximations of floating-point operations by integer operations and bit shifts. For example, reinterpreting a float as an integer, taking the negative (or rather subtracting from a fixed number, due to bias and implicit 1), then reinterpreting as a float yields the reciprocal. Explicitly, ignoring significand, taking the reciprocal is just taking the additive inverse of the (unbiased) exponent, since the exponent of the reciprocal is the negative of the original exponent. (Hence actually subtracting the exponent from twice the bias, which corresponds to unbiasing, taking negative, and then biasing.) For the significand, near 1 the reciprocal is approximately linear: <math>1/x \\approx 1 - x</math> (since the derivative is <math>-1</math>; this is the first term of the [[Taylor series]]), and thus for the significand as well, taking the negative (or rather subtracting from a fixed number to handle the implicit 1) is approximately taking the reciprocal.\n\nMore significantly, bit shifting allows one to compute the square (shift left by 1) or take the square root (shift right by 1). This leads to [[Methods of computing square roots#Approximations that depend on the floating-point representation|approximate computations of the square root]]; combined with the previous technique for taking the inverse, this allows the [[fast inverse square root]] computation, which was important in graphics processing in the late 1980s and 1990s. This can be exploited in some other applications, such as volume ramping in digital sound processing.{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\nConcretely, each time the exponent increments, the value doubles (hence grows exponentially), while each time the significand increments (for a given exponent), the value increases by <math>2^{(e-b)}</math> (hence grows linearly, with slope equal to the actual (unbiased) value of the exponent). This holds even for the last step from a given exponent, where the significand overflows into the exponent: with the implicit 1, the number after 1.11...1 is 2.0 (regardless of the exponent), i.e., an increment of the exponent:\n:(0...001)0...0 through (0...001)1...1, (0...010)0...0 are equal steps (linear)\nThus as a graph it is linear pieces (as the significand grows for a given exponent) connecting the evenly spaced powers of two (when the significand is 0), with each linear piece having twice the slope of the previous: it is approximately a scaled and shifted exponential <math>2^x</math>. Each piece takes the same horizontal space, but twice the vertical space of the last. Because the exponent is convex up, the value is always ''greater'' than or equal to the actual (shifted and scaled) exponential curve through the points with significand 0; by a slightly different shift one can more closely approximate an exponential, sometimes overestimating, sometimes underestimating. Conversely, interpreting a floating-point number as an integer gives an approximate shifted and scaled logarithm, with each piece having half the slope of the last, taking the same vertical space but twice the horizontal space. Since the logarithm is convex down, the approximation is always ''less'' than the corresponding logarithmic curve; again, a different choice of scale and shift (as at above right) yields a closer approximation.\n\n=== Special values ===\n\n==== Signed zero ====\n{{Main|Signed zero}}\nIn the IEEE 754 standard, zero is signed, meaning that there exist both a \"positive zero\" (+0) and a \"negative zero\" (\u22120).  In most [[run-time environment]]s, positive zero is usually printed as \"0\" and the negative zero as \"-0\".  The two values behave as equal in numerical comparisons, but some operations return different results for +0 and \u22120. For instance, 1/(\u22120) returns negative infinity, while 1/+0 returns positive infinity (so that the identity 1/(1/\u00b1\u221e) = \u00b1\u221e is maintained). Other common [[discontinuous function|functions with a discontinuity]] at ''x''=0 which might treat +0 and \u22120 differently include [[Logarithm|log]](''x''), [[Signum function|signum]](''x''), and the [[Square root#Principal square root of a complex number|principal square root]] of {{nowrap|''y'' + ''xi''}} for any negative number ''y''. As with any approximation scheme, operations involving \"negative zero\" can occasionally cause confusion. For example, in IEEE 754, {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = ''y''{{nowrap end}} does not always imply {{nowrap begin}}1/''x'' = 1/''y''{{nowrap end}}, as {{nowrap begin}}0 = \u22120{{nowrap end}} but {{nowrap begin}}1/0 \u2260 1/\u22120{{nowrap end}}.<ref name=\"Goldberg_1991\" />\n\n==== Subnormal numbers ====\n{{Main|Subnormal numbers}}\nSubnormal values fill the [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]] gap with values\nwhere the absolute distance between them is the same as for\nadjacent values just outside the underflow gap.\nThis is an improvement over the older practice to just have zero in the underflow gap,\nand where underflowing results were replaced by zero (flush to zero).\n\nModern floating-point hardware usually handles subnormal values (as well as normal values),\nand does not require software emulation for subnormals.\n\n==== Infinities ====\n{{details|topic=the concept of infinite|Infinity}}\nThe infinities of the [[extended real number line]] can be represented in IEEE floating-point datatypes,\njust like ordinary floating-point values like 1, 1.5, etc.\nThey are not error values in any way, though they are often (but not always, as it depends on the rounding) used as\nreplacement values when there is an [[arithmetic overflow|overflow]]. Upon a divide-by-zero exception,\na positive or negative infinity is returned as an exact result. An infinity can also be introduced as\na numeral (like C's \"INFINITY\" macro, or \"\u221e\" if the programming language allows that syntax).\n\nIEEE 754 requires infinities to be handled in a reasonable way, such as\n* (+\u221e) + (+7) = (+\u221e)\n* (+\u221e) \u00d7 (\u22122) = (\u2212\u221e)\n* (+\u221e) \u00d7 0 = NaN \u2013 there is no meaningful thing to do\n\n==== NaNs ====\n{{Main|NaN}}\nIEEE 754 specifies a special value called \"Not a Number\" (NaN) to be returned as the result of certain \"invalid\" operations, such as 0/0, \u221e\u00d70, or sqrt(\u22121).  In general, NaNs will be propagated i.e. most operations involving a NaN will result in a NaN, although functions that would give some defined result for any given floating-point value will do so for NaNs as well, e.g. NaN ^ 0 = 1. There are two kinds of NaNs: the default ''quiet'' NaNs and, optionally, ''signaling'' NaNs. A signaling NaN in any arithmetic operation (including numerical comparisons) will cause an \"invalid\" [[exception (computing)|exception]] to be signaled.\n\nThe representation of NaNs specified by the standard has some unspecified bits that could be used to encode the type or source of error; but there is no standard for that encoding.  In theory, signaling NaNs could be used by a [[runtime system]] to flag uninitialized variables, or extend the floating-point numbers with other special values without slowing down the computations with ordinary values, although such extensions are not common.\n\n==== IEEE 754 design rationale ====\n[[File:William Kahan.jpg|thumb|500p|right|[[William Kahan]]. A primary architect of the Intel [[80x87]] floating-point coprocessor and [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard.]]\n\nIt is a common misconception that the more esoteric features of the IEEE 754 standard discussed here, such as extended formats, NaN, infinities, subnormals etc., are only of interest to [[numerical analysis|numerical analysts]], or for advanced numerical applications; in fact the opposite is true: these features are designed to give safe robust defaults for numerically unsophisticated programmers, in addition to supporting sophisticated numerical libraries by experts. The key designer of IEEE 754, [[William Kahan]] notes that it is incorrect to \"...  [deem] features of IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic that ...[are] not appreciated to be features usable by none but numerical experts. The facts are quite the opposite. In 1977 those features were designed into the Intel 8087 to serve the widest possible market... Error-analysis tells us how to design floating-point arithmetic, like IEEE Standard 754, moderately tolerant of well-meaning ignorance among programmers\".<ref name=\"Kahan_2001_JavaHurt\" />\n* The special values such as infinity and NaN ensure that the floating-point arithmetic is algebraically completed, such that every floating-point operation produces a well-defined result and will not\u2014by default\u2014throw a machine interrupt or trap. Moreover, the choices of special values returned in exceptional cases were designed to give the correct answer in many cases, e.g. continued fractions such as R(z) := 7 \u2212 3/[z \u2212 2 \u2212 1/(z \u2212 7 + 10/[z \u2212 2 \u2212 2/(z \u2212 3)])] will give the correct answer in all inputs under IEEE 754 arithmetic as the potential divide by zero in e.g. R(3) = 4.6 is correctly handled as +infinity and so can be safely ignored.<ref name=\"Kahan_1981_WhyIEEE\" /> As noted by Kahan, the unhandled trap consecutive to a floating-point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow that caused the [[cluster (spacecraft)|loss of an Ariane 5]] rocket would not have happened under the default IEEE 754 floating-point policy.<ref name=\"Kahan_2001_JavaHurt\" />\n* Subnormal numbers ensure that for ''finite'' floating-point numbers x and y, x \u2212 y = 0 if and only if x = y, as expected, but which did not hold under earlier floating-point representations.<ref name=\"Severance_1998\" />\n* On the design rationale of the x87 [[extended precision|80-bit format]], Kahan notes: \"This Extended format is designed to be used, with negligible loss of speed, for all but the simplest arithmetic with float and double operands. For example, it should be used for scratch variables in loops that implement recurrences like polynomial evaluation, scalar products, partial and continued fractions. It often averts premature Over/Underflow or severe local cancellation that can spoil simple algorithms\".<ref name=\"Kahan_1996_Baleful\" /> Computing intermediate results in an extended format with high precision and extended exponent has precedents in the historical practice of scientific [[significant figures#Arithmetic|calculation]] and in the design of [[scientific calculator]]s e.g. [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[financial calculator]]s performed arithmetic and financial functions to three more significant decimals than they stored or displayed.<ref name=\"Kahan_1996_Baleful\" /> The implementation of extended precision enabled standard elementary function libraries to be readily developed that normally gave double precision results within one [[unit in the last place]] (ULP) at high speed.\n* Correct rounding of values to the nearest representable value avoids systematic biases in calculations and slows the growth of errors. Rounding ties to even removes the statistical bias that can occur in adding similar figures.\n* Directed rounding was intended as an aid with checking error bounds, for instance in interval arithmetic. It is also used in the implementation of some functions.\n* The mathematical basis of the operations enabled high precision multiword arithmetic subroutines to be built relatively easily.\n* The single and double precision formats were designed to be easy to sort without using floating-point hardware. Their bits as a [[two's-complement]] integer already sort the positives correctly, and the negatives reversed. If that integer is negative, [[exclusive or|xor]] with its maximum positive, and the floats are sorted as integers.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}<!-- It may be true, but was it a design rationale? Regardless, we need a source. -->\n\n== Representable numbers, conversion and rounding ==\nBy their nature, all numbers expressed in floating-point format are [[rational number]]s with a terminating expansion in the relevant base (for example, a terminating decimal expansion in base-10, or a terminating binary expansion in base-2). Irrational numbers, such as [[Pi|\u03c0]] or \u221a2, or non-terminating rational numbers, must be approximated. The number of digits (or bits) of precision also limits the set of rational numbers that can be represented exactly. For example, the number 123456789 cannot be exactly represented if only eight decimal digits of precision are available.\n\nWhen a number is represented in some format (such as a character string) which is not a native floating-point representation supported in a computer implementation, then it will require a conversion before it can be used in that implementation. If the number can be represented exactly in the floating-point format then the conversion is exact. If there is not an exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the original value. The representation chosen will have a different value from the original, and the value thus adjusted is called the ''rounded value''.\n\nWhether or not a rational number has a terminating expansion depends on the base. For example, in base-10 the number 1/2 has a terminating expansion (0.5) while the number 1/3 does not (0.333...). In base-2 only rationals with denominators that are powers of 2 (such as 1/2 or 3/16) are terminating. Any rational with a denominator that has a prime factor other than 2 will have an infinite binary expansion. This means that numbers which appear to be short and exact when written in decimal format may need to be approximated when converted to binary floating-point. For example, the decimal number 0.1 is not representable in binary floating-point of any finite precision;  the exact binary representation would have a \"1100\" sequence continuing endlessly:\n: ''e'' = \u22124; ''s'' = 1100110011001100110011001100110011...,\nwhere, as previously, ''s'' is the significand and ''e'' is the exponent.\n\nWhen rounded to 24 bits this becomes\n: ''e'' = \u22124; ''s'' = 110011001100110011001101,\nwhich is actually 0.100000001490116119384765625 in decimal.\n<!-- Edit/rearrange this if you want, but please leave the 0.1 example in. (My previous reference to pi being more \"sophisticated\" than 0.1 was admittedly not artful.) I have known professional software engineers (who should have known better!) who believed that numbers with short decimal representations could always be represented exactly. Putting the many f.p. fallacies/superstitions to rest is important. -->\n\nAs a further example, the real number [[Pi|\u03c0]], represented in binary as an infinite sequence of bits is\n: 11.0010010000111111011010101000100010000101101000110000100011010011...\nbut is\n: 11.0010010000111111011011\nwhen approximated by [[rounding]] to a precision of 24 bits.\n\nIn binary single-precision floating-point, this is represented as ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.10010010000111111011011 with ''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\nThis has a decimal value of\n: '''3.141592'''7410125732421875,\nwhereas a more accurate approximation of the true value of \u03c0 is\n: '''3.14159265358979323846264338327950'''...\n<!-- Before changing the above numbers, please discuss on talk page. Giving the actual value 10 more digits than the single-precision floating-point value is plenty \u2013 more digits do not help the reader -->\nThe result of rounding differs from the true value by about 0.03 parts per million, and matches the decimal representation of \u03c0 in the first 7 digits. The difference is the [[discretization error]] and is limited by the [[machine epsilon]].\n\nThe arithmetical difference between two consecutive representable floating-point numbers which have the same exponent is called a [[unit in the last place]] (ULP). For example, if there is no representable number lying between the representable numbers 1.45a70c22<sub>hex</sub> and 1.45a70c24<sub>hex</sub>, the ULP is 2\u00d716<sup>\u22128</sup>, or 2<sup>\u221231</sup>. For numbers with a base-2 exponent part of 0, i.e. numbers with an absolute value higher than or equal to 1 but lower than 2, an ULP is exactly 2<sup>\u221223</sup> or about 10<sup>\u22127</sup> in single precision, and exactly 2<sup>\u221253</sup> or about 10<sup>\u221216</sup> in double precision. The mandated behavior of IEEE-compliant hardware is that the result be within one-half of a ULP.\n\n=== Rounding modes ===\nRounding is used when the exact result of a floating-point operation (or a conversion to floating-point format) would need more digits than there are digits in the significand. IEEE 754 requires ''correct rounding'': that is, the rounded result is as if infinitely precise arithmetic was used to compute the value and then rounded (although in implementation only three extra bits are needed to ensure this). There are several different [[rounding]] schemes (or ''rounding modes''). Historically, [[truncation]] was the typical approach. Since the introduction of IEEE 754, the default method (''[[rounding|round to nearest, ties to even]]'', sometimes called Banker's Rounding) is more commonly used. This method rounds the ideal (infinitely precise) result of an arithmetic operation to the nearest representable value, and gives that representation as the result.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_1\" /> In the case of a tie, the value that would make the significand end in an even digit is chosen. The IEEE 754 standard requires the same rounding to be applied to all fundamental algebraic operations, including square root and conversions, when there is a numeric (non-NaN) result. It means that the results of IEEE 754 operations are completely determined in all bits of the result, except for the representation of NaNs. (\"Library\" functions such as cosine and log are not mandated.)\n\nAlternative rounding options are also available. IEEE 754 specifies the following rounding modes:\n* round to nearest, where ties round to the nearest even digit in the required position (the default and by far the most common mode)\n* round to nearest, where ties round away from zero (optional for binary floating-point and commonly used in decimal)\n* round up (toward +\u221e; negative results thus round toward zero)\n* round down (toward \u2212\u221e; negative results thus round away from zero)\n* round toward zero (truncation; it is similar to the common behavior of float-to-integer conversions, which convert \u22123.9 to \u22123 and 3.9 to 3)\n\nAlternative modes are useful when the amount of error being introduced must be bounded. Applications that require a bounded error are multi-precision floating-point, and [[interval arithmetic]].\nThe alternative rounding modes are also useful in diagnosing numerical instability: if the results of a subroutine vary substantially between rounding to + and \u2212 infinity then it is likely numerically unstable and affected by round-off error.<ref name=\"Kahan_2006_Mindless\" />\n\n== Floating-point arithmetic operations ==\nFor ease of presentation and understanding, decimal [[radix]] with 7 digit precision will be used in the examples, as in the IEEE 754 ''decimal32'' format.  The fundamental principles are the same in any [[radix]] or precision, except that normalization is optional (it does not affect the numerical value of the result).  Here, ''s'' denotes the significand and ''e'' denotes the exponent.\n\n=== Addition and subtraction ===\nA simple method to add floating-point numbers is to first represent them with the same exponent. In the example below, the second number is shifted right by three digits, and one then proceeds with the usual addition method:\n\n   123456.7 = 1.234567 \u00d7 10^5\n   101.7654 = 1.017654 \u00d7 10^2 = 0.001017654 \u00d7 10^5\n\n   Hence:\n   123456.7 + 101.7654 = (1.234567 \u00d7 10^5) + (1.017654 \u00d7 10^2)\n                       = (1.234567 \u00d7 10^5) + (0.001017654 \u00d7 10^5)\n                       = (1.234567 + 0.001017654) \u00d7 10^5\n                       =  1.235584654 \u00d7 10^5\n\nIn detail:\n\n   e=5;  s=1.234567     (123456.7)\n + e=2;  s=1.017654     (101.7654)\n\n   e=5;  s=1.234567\n + e=5;  s=0.001017654  (after shifting)\n --------------------\n   e=5;  s=1.235584654  (true sum: 123558.4654)\n\nThis is the true result, the exact sum of the operands. It will be rounded to seven digits and then normalized if necessary. The final result is\n   e=5;  s=1.235585    (final sum: 123558.5)\n\nNote that the lowest three digits of the second operand (654) are essentially lost. This is [[round-off error]]. In extreme cases, the sum of two non-zero numbers may be equal to one of them:\n\n   e=5;  s=1.234567\n + e=\u22123; s=9.876543\n\n   e=5;  s=1.234567\n + e=5;  s=0.00000009876543 (after shifting)\n ----------------------\n   e=5;  s=1.23456709876543 (true sum)\n   e=5;  s=1.234567         (after rounding and normalization)\n\nIn the above conceptual examples it would appear that a large number of extra digits would need to be provided by the adder to ensure correct rounding; however, for binary addition or subtraction using careful implementation techniques only two extra ''guard'' bits and one extra ''sticky'' bit need to be carried beyond the precision of the operands.<ref name=\"Goldberg_1991\" />\n\nAnother problem of loss of significance occurs when two nearly equal numbers are subtracted. In the following example ''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5; ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.234571 and ''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5; ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.234567 are representations of the rationals 123457.1467 and 123456.659.\n\n   e=5;  s=1.234571\n \u2212 e=5;  s=1.234567\n ----------------\n   e=5;  s=0.000004\n   e=\u22121; s=4.000000 (after rounding and normalization)\n\nThe best representation of this difference is ''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121; ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.877000, which differs more than 20% from ''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121; ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.000000. In extreme cases, all significant digits of precision can be lost (although gradual underflow ensures that the result will not be zero unless the two operands were equal). This ''[[loss of significance|cancellation]]'' illustrates the danger in assuming that all of the digits of a computed result are meaningful. Dealing with the consequences of these errors is a topic in [[numerical analysis]]; see also [[#Accuracy problems|Accuracy problems]].\n\n=== Multiplication and division ===\nTo multiply, the significands are multiplied while the exponents are added, and the result is rounded and normalized.\n\n   e=3;  s=4.734612\n \u00d7 e=5;  s=5.417242\n -----------------------\n   e=8;  s=25.648538980104 (true product)\n   e=8;  s=25.64854        (after rounding)\n   e=9;  s=2.564854        (after normalization)\n\nSimilarly, division is accomplished by subtracting the divisor's exponent from the dividend's exponent, and dividing the dividend's significand by the divisor's significand.\n\nThere are no cancellation or absorption problems with multiplication or division, though small errors may accumulate as operations are performed in succession.<ref name=\"Goldberg_1991\" /> In practice, the way these operations are carried out in digital logic can be quite complex (see [[Booth's multiplication algorithm]] and [[Division algorithm]]).<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_2\" />\nFor a fast, simple method, see the [[Horner scheme#Floating point multiplication and division|Horner method]].\n\n==Dealing with exceptional cases {{anchor|Floating point exception}}== <!-- linked from a couple of places within the article -->\nFloating-point computation in a computer can run into three kinds of problems:\n* An operation can be mathematically undefined, such as \u221e/\u221e, or [[division by zero]].\n* An operation can be legal in principle, but not supported by the specific format, for example, calculating the [[square root]] of \u22121 or the inverse sine of 2 (both of which result in [[complex number]]s).\n* An operation can be legal in principle, but the result can be impossible to represent in the specified format, because the exponent is too large or too small to encode in the exponent field. Such an event is called an [[arithmetic overflow|overflow]] (exponent too large), [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]] (exponent too small) or [[Denormal number|denormalization]] (precision loss).\n\nPrior to the IEEE standard, such conditions usually caused the program to terminate, or triggered some kind\nof [[trap (computing)|trap]] that the programmer might be able to catch. How this worked was system-dependent,\nmeaning that floating-point programs were not [[porting|portable]]. (Note that the term \"exception\" as used in IEEE 754 is a general term meaning an exceptional condition, which is not necessarily an error, and is a different usage to that typically defined in programming languages such as a C++ or Java, in which an \"[[Exception handling|exception]]\" is an alternative flow of control, closer to what is termed a \"trap\" in IEEE 754 terminology).\n\nHere, the required default method of handling exceptions according to IEEE 754 is discussed (the IEEE 754 optional trapping and other \"alternate exception handling\" modes are not discussed). Arithmetic exceptions are (by default) required to be recorded in \"sticky\" status flag bits. That they are \"sticky\" means that they are not reset by the next (arithmetic) operation, but stay set until explicitly reset. The use of \"sticky\" flags thus allows for testing of exceptional conditions to be delayed until after a full floating-point expression or subroutine: without them exceptional conditions that could not be otherwise ignored would require explicit testing immediately after every floating-point operation. By default, an operation always returns a result according to specification without interrupting computation. For instance, 1/0 returns +\u221e, while also setting the divide-by-zero flag bit (this default of \u221e is designed so as to often return a finite result when used in subsequent operations and so be safely ignored).\n\nThe original IEEE 754 standard, however, failed to recommend operations to handle such sets of arithmetic exception flag bits. So while these were implemented in hardware, initially programming language implementations typically did not provide a means to access them (apart from assembler). Over time some programming language standards (e.g., [[C99]]/C11 and Fortran) have been updated to specify methods to access and change status flag bits. The 2008 version of the IEEE 754 standard now specifies a few operations for accessing and handling the arithmetic flag bits. The programming model is based on a single thread of execution and use of them by multiple threads has to be handled by a [[Concurrency (computer science)|means]] outside of the standard (e.g. [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]] specifies that the flags have [[thread-local storage]]).\n\nIEEE 754 specifies five arithmetic exceptions that are to be recorded in the status flags (\"sticky bits\"):\n* '''inexact''', set if the rounded (and returned) value is different from the mathematically exact result of the operation.\n* '''underflow''', set if the rounded value is tiny (as specified in IEEE 754) ''and'' inexact (or maybe limited to if it has denormalization loss, as per the 1984 version of IEEE 754), returning a subnormal value including the zeros.\n* '''overflow''', set if the absolute value of the rounded value is too large to be represented. An infinity or maximal finite value is returned, depending on which rounding is used.\n* '''divide-by-zero''', set if the result is infinite given finite operands, returning an infinity, either +\u221e or \u2212\u221e.\n* '''invalid''', set if a real-valued result cannot be returned e.g. sqrt(\u22121) or 0/0, returning a quiet NaN.\n[[File:Resistors in Parallel.svg|thumb|left|200px|Fig. 1: resistances in parallel, with total resistance <math>R_{tot}</math>]]The default return value for each of the exceptions is designed to give the correct result in the majority of cases such that the exceptions can be ignored in the majority of codes. ''inexact'' returns a correctly rounded result, and ''underflow'' returns a denormalized small value and so can almost always be ignored.<ref name=\"Kahan_1997_Status\" /> ''divide-by-zero'' returns infinity exactly, which will typically then divide a finite number and so give zero, or else will give an ''invalid'' exception subsequently if not, and so can also typically be ignored. For example, the effective resistance of n resistors in parallel (see fig. 1) is given by <math>R_{tot}=1/(1/R_1+1/R_2+...+1/R_n)</math>. If a short-circuit develops with <math>R_1</math> set to 0, <math>1/R_1</math> will return +infinity which will give a final <math>R_{tot}</math> of 0, as expected<ref name=\"Intel\" /> (see the continued fraction example of [[Floating point#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|IEEE 754 design rationale]] for another example).\n''Overflow'' and ''invalid'' exceptions can typically not be ignored, but do not necessarily represent errors: for example, a [[Zero of a function|root-finding]] routine, as part of its normal operation, may evaluate a passed-in function at values outside of its domain, returning NaN and an ''invalid'' exception flag to be ignored until finding a useful start point.<ref name=\"Kahan_1997_Status\" />\n\n== Accuracy problems ==\n<!-- internally linked -->\nThe fact that floating-point numbers cannot precisely represent all real numbers, and that floating-point operations cannot precisely represent true arithmetic operations, leads to many surprising situations.  This is related to the finite [[Precision (computer science)|precision]] with which computers generally represent numbers.\n\nFor example, the non-representability of 0.1 and 0.01 (in binary) means that the result of attempting to square 0.1 is neither 0.01 nor the representable number closest to it.  In 24-bit (single precision) representation, 0.1 (decimal) was given previously as ''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22124; ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;110011001100110011001101, which is\n:0.100000001490116119384765625 exactly.\nSquaring this number gives\n:0.010000000298023226097399174250313080847263336181640625 exactly.\nSquaring it with single-precision floating-point hardware (with rounding) gives\n:0.010000000707805156707763671875 exactly.\nBut the representable number closest to 0.01 is\n:0.009999999776482582092285156250 exactly.\n\nAlso, the non-representability of \u03c0 (and \u03c0/2) means that an attempted computation of tan(\u03c0/2) will not yield a result of infinity, nor will it even overflow.  It is simply not possible for standard floating-point hardware to attempt to compute tan(\u03c0/2), because \u03c0/2 cannot be represented exactly.  This computation in C:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n/* Enough digits to be sure we get the correct approximation. */\ndouble pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;\ndouble z = tan(pi/2.0);\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwill give a result of 16331239353195370.0.  In single precision (using the tanf function), the result will be \u221222877332.0.\n\nBy the same token, an attempted computation of sin(\u03c0) will not yield zero.

That is,  (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' is not necessarily equal to ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'').  Using 7-digit significand decimal arithmetic:\n  a = 1234.567, b = 45.67834, c = 0.0004\n\n  (a + b) + c:\n      1234.567   (a)\n    +   45.67834 (b)\n    ____________\n      1280.24534   rounds to   1280.245\n\n     1280.245  (a + b)\n    +   0.0004 (c)\n    ____________\n     1280.2454   rounds to   '''1280.245'''  <--- (a + b) + c\n\n  a + (b + c):\n    45.67834 (b)\n  +  0.0004  (c)\n  ____________\n    45.67874\n\n    1234.567   (a)\n  +   45.67874   (b + c)\n  ____________\n    1280.24574   rounds to   '''1280.246''' <--- a + (b + c)\n\nThey are also not necessarily [[distributive property|distributive]].

For example, when determining a [[derivative]] of a function the following formula is used:\n: <math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n: Intuitively one would want an ''h'' very close to zero, however when using floating-point operations, the smallest number won't give the best approximation of a derivative. As ''h'' grows smaller the difference between f (a + h) and f(a) grows smaller, cancelling out the most significant and least erroneous digits and making the most erroneous digits more important. As a result the smallest number of ''h'' possible will give a more erroneous approximation of a derivative than a somewhat larger number. This is perhaps the most common and serious accuracy problem.\n* Conversions to integer are not intuitive: converting (63.0/9.0) to integer yields 7, but converting (0.63/0.09) may yield 6.  This is because conversions generally truncate rather than round. [[Floor and ceiling functions]] may produce answers which are off by one from the intuitively expected value.\n* Limited exponent range: results might overflow yielding infinity, or underflow yielding a [[subnormal number]] or zero. In these cases precision will be lost.\n* Testing for [[Division by zero#Computer arithmetic|safe division]] is problematic: Checking that the divisor is not zero does not guarantee that a division will not overflow.\n* Testing for equality is problematic. Two computational sequences that are mathematically equal may well produce different floating-point values.<ref>Christopher Barker: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0485/ ''PEP 485 -- A Function for testing approximate equality'']</ref>\n\n=== Incidents ===\n* On February 25, 1991, a [[loss of significance]] in a [[MIM-104 Patriot]] missile battery [[MIM-104 Patriot#Failure at Dhahran|prevented it from intercepting]] an incoming [[Al Hussein (missile)|Scud]] missile in [[Dhahran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], contributing to the death of 28 soldiers from the U.S. Army's [[14th Quartermaster Detachment]].<ref name=\"GAO report IMTEC 92-26\" />\n\n=== Machine precision and backward error analysis ===\n''Machine precision'' is a quantity that characterizes the accuracy of a floating-point system, and is used in [[error analysis (mathematics)#Error analysis in numerical modeling|backward error analysis]] of floating-point algorithms.  It is also known as unit roundoff or ''[[machine epsilon]]''.  Usually denoted \u0395<sub>mach</sub>, its value depends on the particular rounding being used.\n\nWith rounding to zero,\n: <math>\\Epsilon_\\text{mach} = B^{1-P},\\,</math>\nwhereas rounding to nearest,\n: <math>\\Epsilon_\\text{mach} = \\tfrac{1}{2} B^{1-P}.</math>\n\nThis is important since it bounds the ''[[relative error]]'' in representing any non-zero real number x within the normalized range of a floating-point system:\n: <math>\\left| \\frac{fl(x) - x}{x} \\right| \\le \\Epsilon_\\text{mach}.</math>\n\nBackward error analysis, the theory of which was developed and popularized by [[James H. Wilkinson]], can be used to establish that an algorithm implementing a numerical function is numerically stable.<ref name=\"RalstonReilly2003\" /> The basic approach is to show that although the calculated result, due to roundoff errors, will not be exactly correct, it is the exact solution to a nearby problem with slightly perturbed input data. If the perturbation required is small, on the order of the uncertainty in the input data, then the results are in some sense as accurate as the data \"deserves\". The algorithm is then defined as ''[[numerical stability#Forward, backward, and mixed stability|backward stable]]''. Stability is a measure of the sensitivity to rounding errors of a given numerical procedure;  by contrast, the [[condition number]] of a function for a given problem indicates the inherent sensitivity of the function to small perturbations in its input and is independent of the implementation used to solve the problem.<ref name=\"Einarsson_2005\" />\n\nAs a trivial example, consider a simple expression giving the inner product of (length two) vectors <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, then\n: <math>fl(x \\cdot y)=fl(fl(x_1*y_1)+fl(x_2*y_2))</math> where <math>fl()</math> indicates correctly rounded floating-point arithmetic\n::: <math>= fl((x_1*y_1)(1+\\delta_1)+(x_2*y_2)(1+\\delta_2))</math> where <math>\\delta_n \\leq \\Epsilon_\\text{mach}</math>, from above\n::: <math>= ((x_1*y_1)(1+\\delta_1)+(x_2*y_2)(1+\\delta_2))(1+\\delta_3)</math>\n::: <math>= (x_1*y_1)(1+\\delta_1)(1+\\delta_3)+(x_2*y_2)(1+\\delta_2)(1+\\delta_3)</math>\nand so\n: <math>fl(x \\cdot y)=\\hat{x} \\cdot \\hat{y}</math> where\n: <math>\\hat{x}_1 = x_1(1+\\delta_1)</math>; <math>\\hat{x}_2=x_2(1+\\delta_2)</math>;\n: <math>\\hat{y}_1 = y_1(1+\\delta_3)</math>; <math>\\hat{y}_2 = y_2(1+\\delta_3)</math>\n: where <math>\\delta_n \\leq \\Epsilon_\\text{mach}</math>, by definition\nwhich is the sum of two slightly perturbed (on the order of \u0395<sub>mach</sub>) input data, and so is backward stable. For more realistic examples in [[numerical linear algebra]] see Higham 2002<ref name=\"Higham_2002\" /> and other references below.\n\n=== Minimizing the effect of accuracy problems ===\nAlthough, as noted previously, individual arithmetic operations of IEEE 754 are guaranteed accurate to within half a ULP, more complicated formulae can suffer from larger errors due to round-off. The loss of accuracy can be substantial if a problem or its data are [[Condition number|ill-conditioned]], meaning that the correct result is hypersensitive to tiny perturbations in its data. However, even functions that are well-conditioned can suffer from large loss of accuracy if an algorithm [[Numerical stability|numerically unstable]] for that data is used: apparently equivalent formulations of expressions in a programming language can differ markedly in their numerical stability. One approach to remove the risk of such loss of accuracy is the design   and analysis of numerically stable algorithms, which is an aim of the branch of mathematics known as  [[numerical analysis]]. Another approach that can protect against the risk of numerical instabilities is the computation of intermediate (scratch) values in an algorithm at a higher precision than the final result requires,<ref name=\"OliveiraStewart_2006\" /> which can remove, or reduce by orders of magnitude,<ref name=\"Kahan_2005_ARITH17\" /> such risk: [[Quadruple-precision floating-point format|IEEE 754 quadruple precision]] and [[extended precision]] are designed for this purpose when computing at double precision.<ref name=\"Kahan_2011_Debug\" /><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_4\" />\n\nFor example, the following algorithm is a direct implementation to compute the function A(x) = (x\u22121) / (exp(x\u22121) \u2212 1) which is well-conditioned at 1.0,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_5\" /> however it can be shown to be numerically unstable and lose up to half the significant digits carried by the arithmetic when computed near 1.0.<ref name=\"Kahan_2001_JavaHurt\" />\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\" line highlight=\"3,6\">\ndouble A(double X)\n{\n        double  Y, Z;  // [1]\n        Y = X - 1.0;\n        Z = exp(Y);\n        if (Z != 1.0) Z = Y/(Z - 1.0); // [2]\n        return(Z);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIf, however, intermediate computations are all performed in extended precision (e.g. by setting line [1] to [[C99]] long double), then up to full precision in the final double result can be maintained.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_6\" /> Alternatively, a numerical analysis of the algorithm reveals that if the following non-obvious change to line [2] is made:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n if (Z != 1.0) Z = log(Z)/(Z - 1.0);\n</syntaxhighlight>\nthen the algorithm becomes numerically stable and can compute to full double precision.\n\nTo maintain the properties of such carefully constructed numerically stable programs, careful handling by the [[compiler]] is required. Certain \"optimizations\" that compilers might make (for example, reordering operations) can work against the goals of well-behaved software. There is some controversy about the failings of compilers and language designs in this area: C99 is an example of a language where such optimizations are carefully specified so as to maintain numerical precision. See the external references at the bottom of this article.\n\nA detailed treatment of the techniques for writing high-quality floating-point software is beyond the scope of this article, and the reader is referred to,<ref name=\"Higham_2002\" /><ref name=\"Kahan_2000_Marketing\" /> and the other references at the bottom of this article. Kahan suggests several rules of thumb that can substantially decrease by orders of magnitude<ref name=\"Kahan_2000_Marketing\" /> the risk of numerical anomalies, in addition to, or in lieu of, a more careful numerical analysis. These include: as noted above, computing all expressions and intermediate results in the highest precision supported in hardware (a common rule of thumb is to carry twice the precision of the desired result i.e. compute in double precision for a final single precision result, or in double extended or quad precision for up to double precision results<ref name=\"Kahan_1981_WhyIEEE\" />); and rounding input data and results to only the precision required and supported by the input data (carrying excess precision in the final result beyond that required and supported by the input data can be misleading, increases storage cost and decreases speed, and the excess bits can affect convergence of numerical procedures:<ref name=\"Kahan_2001_LN\" /> notably, the first form of the iterative example given below converges correctly when using this rule of thumb).  Brief descriptions of several additional issues and techniques follow.\n\nAs decimal fractions can often not be exactly represented in binary floating-point, such arithmetic is at its best when it is simply being used to measure real-world quantities over a wide range of scales (such as the orbital period of a moon around Saturn or the mass of a [[proton]]), and at its worst when it is expected to model the interactions of quantities expressed as decimal strings that are expected to be exact.<ref name=\"Kahan_2005_ARITH17\" /><ref name=\"Kahan_2000_Marketing\" /> An example of the latter case is financial calculations. For this reason, financial software tends not to use a binary floating-point number representation.<ref name=\"Speleotrove_2012\" /> The \"decimal\" data type of the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming languages, and the decimal formats of the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard, are designed to avoid the problems of binary floating-point representations when applied to human-entered exact decimal values, and make the arithmetic always behave as expected when numbers are printed in decimal.\n\nExpectations from mathematics may not be realized in the field of floating-point computation. For example, it is known that <math>(x+y)(x-y) = x^2-y^2\\,</math>, and that <math>\\sin^2{\\theta}+\\cos^2{\\theta} = 1\\,</math>, however these facts cannot be relied on when the quantities involved are the result of floating-point computation.\n\nThe use of the equality test (<code>if (x==y) ...</code>) requires care when dealing with floating-point numbers. Even simple expressions like <code>0.6/0.2-3==0</code> will, on most computers, fail to be true<ref name=\"Christiansen_Perl\" /> (in IEEE 754 double precision, for example, <code>0.6/0.2-3</code> is approximately equal to -4.44089209850063e-16). Consequently, such tests are sometimes replaced with \"fuzzy\" comparisons (<code>if (abs(x-y) < epsilon) ...</code>, where epsilon is sufficiently small and tailored to the application, such as 1.0E\u221213). The wisdom of doing this varies greatly, and can require numerical analysis to bound epsilon.<ref name=\"Higham_2002\" /> Values derived from the primary data representation and their comparisons should be performed in a wider, extended, precision to minimize the risk of such inconsistencies due to round-off errors.<ref name=\"Kahan_2000_Marketing\" /> It is often better to organize the code in such a way that such tests are unnecessary. For example, in [[computational geometry]], exact tests of whether a point lies off or on a line or plane defined by other points can be performed using adaptive precision or exact arithmetic methods.<ref name=\"Shewchuk\" />\n\nSmall errors in floating-point arithmetic can grow when mathematical algorithms perform operations an enormous number of times. A few examples are [[matrix inversion]], [[eigenvector]] computation, and differential equation solving. These algorithms must be very carefully designed, using numerical approaches such as [[Iterative refinement]], if they are to work well.<ref name=\"Kahan_1997_Cantilever\" />\n\nSummation of a vector of floating-point values is a basic algorithm in [[Computational science|scientific computing]], and so an awareness of when loss of significance can occur is essential. For example, if one is adding a very large number of numbers, the individual addends are very small compared with the sum. This can lead to loss of significance. A typical addition would then be something like\n 3253.671\n +  3.141276\n -----------\n 3256.812\nThe low 3 digits of the addends are effectively lost. Suppose, for example, that one needs to add many numbers, all approximately equal to 3. After 1000 of them have been added, the running sum is about 3000; the lost digits are not regained. The [[Kahan summation algorithm]] may be used to reduce the errors.<ref name=\"Higham_2002\" />\n\nRound-off error can affect the convergence and accuracy of iterative numerical procedures. As an example, [[Archimedes]] approximated \u03c0 by calculating the perimeters of polygons inscribing and circumscribing a circle, starting with hexagons, and successively doubling the number of sides. As noted above, computations may be rearranged in a way that is mathematically equivalent but less prone to error ([[numerical analysis]]).\nTwo forms of the recurrence formula for the circumscribed polygon are{{citation needed|reason=Not obvious formulas|date=June 2016}}:\n: <math>t_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}</math>\n:* First form: <math>t_{i+1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{t_i^2+1}-1}{t_i}</math>\n:* second form: <math>t_{i+1} = \\frac{t_i}{\\sqrt{t_i^2+1}+1}</math>\n: <math>\\pi \\sim 6 \\times 2^i \\times t_i</math>, converging as <math>i \\rightarrow \\infty</math>\n\nHere is a computation using IEEE \"double\" (a significand with 53 bits of precision) arithmetic:\n\n  i   6 \u00d7 2<sup>i</sup> \u00d7 t<sub>i</sub>, first form    6 \u00d7 2<sup>i</sup> \u00d7 t<sub>i</sub>, second form\n ---------------------------------------------------------\n  0   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3}}'''.4641016151377543863      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3}}'''.4641016151377543863\n  1   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3}}'''.2153903091734710173      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3}}'''.2153903091734723496\n  2   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1}}'''596599420974940120      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1}}'''596599420975006733\n  3   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14}}'''60862151314012979      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14}}'''60862151314352708\n  4   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14}}'''27145996453136334      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14}}'''27145996453689225\n  5   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141}}'''8730499801259536      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141}}'''8730499798241950\n  6   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141}}'''6627470548084133      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141}}'''6627470568494473\n  7   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141}}'''6101765997805905      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141}}'''6101766046906629\n  8   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159}}'''70343230776862      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159}}'''70343215275928\n  9   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159}}'''37488171150615      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159}}'''37487713536668\n 10   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592}}'''9278733740748      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592}}'''9273850979885\n 11   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592}}'''7256228504127      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592}}'''7220386148377\n 12   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926}}'''717412858693      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926}}'''707019992125\n 13   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926}}'''189011456060      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265}}'''78678454728\n 14   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926}}'''717412858693      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265}}'''46593073709\n 15   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159}}'''19358822321783      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592653}}'''8571730119\n 16   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926}}'''717412858693      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592653}}'''6566394222\n 17   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415}}'''810075796233302      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592653}}'''6065061913\n 18   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926}}'''717412858693      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926535}}'''939728836\n 19   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141}}'''4061547378810956      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926535}}'''908393901\n 20   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14}}'''05434924008406305      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1415926535}}'''900560168\n 21   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14}}'''00068646912273617      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592653589}}'''8608396\n 22   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.1}}'''349453756585929919      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.141592653589}}'''8122118\n 23   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14}}'''00068646912273617      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265358979}}'''95552\n 24   '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3}}'''.2245152435345525443      '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265358979}}'''68907\n 25                              '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265358979}}'''62246\n 26                              '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265358979}}'''62246\n 27                              '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265358979}}'''62246\n 28                              '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265358979}}'''62246\n               The true value is '''{{Fontcolor|purple|3.14159265358979323846264338327...}}'''\n\nWhile the two forms of the recurrence formula are clearly mathematically equivalent,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_7\" /> the first subtracts 1 from a number extremely close to 1, leading to an increasingly problematic loss of [[significant digit]]s.

Lastly, the verses come into conflict with 11:5 where [[Women in the New Testament|women]] are described as praying and prophesying.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first= [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] |editor1-last= [[John Muddiman]] |title= The Oxford Bible Commentary |year= 2001 |publisher= Oxford University Press Inc. |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-875500-5 |page= 1130 |quote=  }}</ref> As well, 10:1\u201322 is sometimes regarded as another letter fragment, interpolation, or inserted midrash because, among other things, this section virtually seems to equate the consumption of idol meat with idolatry, but Paul seems more lenient regarding its consumption in 8:1\u201313 and 10:23\u201311:1.<ref>Walter Schmithals, ''Gnosticism in Corinth'' (Nashville: Abingdon, 1971), 14, 92\u201395; Lamar Cope, \"First Corinthians 8\u201310: Continuity or Contradiction?\" ''Anglican Theological Review: Supplementary Series II.''

From there he traveled to Caesarea, and Antioch. Paul returned to Ephesus on his third missionary journey and spent approximately three years there (Acts 19:8, 19:10, 20:31). It was while staying in Ephesus that he received disconcerting news of the community in Corinth regarding jealousies, rivalry, and immoral behavior.<ref name=usccb>[http://www.usccb.org/bible/1corinthians/0 \"1 Corinthians \u2013 Introduction\", USCCB]</ref> It also appears that based on a letter the Corinthians sent Paul (e.g. 7:1), the congregation was  requesting clarification on a number of matters, such as marriage and the consumption of meat previously offered to idols.\n\nBy comparing [[Acts of the Apostles]] 18:1\u201317 and mentions of Ephesus in the Corinthian correspondence, scholars suggest that the letter was written during Paul's stay in Ephesus, which is usually dated as being in the range of AD 53\u201357.<ref>[http://www.studylight.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T2324 Corinthians, First Epistle to the], \"The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia\", Ed.

Illumination from [[Commentary on the Apocalypse|Beatus de Facundus]], 1047.]] Some time before 2 Corinthians was written, Paul paid them a second visit (2 Cor. 12: 14; 2 Cor. 13: 1) to check some rising disorder (2 Cor. 2: 1; 2 Cor. 13: 2), and wrote them a letter, now lost (1 Cor. 5: 9). They had also been visited by Apollos (Acts 18: 27), perhaps by Peter (1 Cor. 1: 12), and by some [[Jewish Christians]] who brought with them letters of commendation from [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] (1 Cor. 1: 12; 2 Cor. 3: 1; 2 Cor. 5: 16; 2 Cor. 11: 23).\n\nPaul wrote this letter to correct what he saw as erroneous views in the Corinthian church. Several sources informed Paul of conflicts within the church at Corinth: [[Apollos]] (Acts 19:1), a letter from the Corinthians, the \"household of Chloe\", and finally Stephanas and his two friends who had visited Paul (1:11; 16:17). Paul then wrote this letter to the Corinthians, urging uniformity of belief (\"that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you\", 1:10) and expounding [[Christian]] doctrine. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter to the church at Corinth ([[2 Corinthians]] 2:13; 8:6, 16\u201318).\n\nIn general, divisions within the church at Corinth seem to be a problem, and Paul makes it a point to mention these conflicts in the beginning. Specifically, [[Paganism|pagan]] roots still hold sway within their community. Paul wants to bring them back to what he sees as correct doctrine, stating that God has given him the opportunity to be a \"skilled master builder\" to lay the foundation and let others build upon it (1 Cor 3:10).\n\nLater, Paul wrote about immorality in Corinth by discussing an immoral brother, how to resolve personal disputes, and sexual purity. Regarding marriage, Paul states that it is better for Christians to remain unmarried, but that if they lacked self-control, it is better to marry than \"burn\" (\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9) which Christians have traditionally thought meant to burn with sinful desires.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2014}} The Epistle may include marriage as an apostolic practice in 1 Corinthians 9:5, \"Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] and the [[Desposyni|brothers of the Lord]] and [[Saint Peter|Cephas]] (Peter)?\" (In the last case, the letter concurs with [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 8:14, which mentions Peter having a mother-in-law and thus, by interpolation, a wife.) However, the Greek word for \"wife\" is the same word for \"woman\". The Early Church Fathers including [[Tertullian]], [[Jerome]], and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] state the Greek word is ambiguous and the women in 1 Corinthians 9:5 were women ministering to the Apostles as women ministered to Christ (cf Matthew 27:55, Luke 8:1\u20133), and were not wives,<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0406.htm Tertullian, On Monogamy] \"For have we not the power of eating and drinking?\" he does not demonstrate that \"wives\" were led about by the apostles, whom even such as have not still have the power of eating and drinking; but simply \"women\", who used to minister to them in the stone way (as they did) when accompanying the Lord.\"</ref> and assert they left their \"offices of marriage\" to follow Christ.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/30091.htm Jerome, Against Jovinianus, Book I] \"In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage.\"</ref>\n\nPaul also argues that married people must please their spouses, just as every Christian must please [[God]]. The letter is also notable for mentioning the [[Paul the Apostle and women|role of women in churches]], that for instance they must remain silent (1 Cor. 14:34\u201335), and yet they have a role of prophecy and apparently [[glossolalia|speaking tongues]] in churches (11:2\u201316). If 14:34\u201335 is not an interpolation, certain scholars resolve the tension between these texts by positing that wives were either contesting their husband's inspired speeches at church, or the wives/women were chatting and asking questions in a disorderly manner when others were giving inspired utterances. Their silence was unique to the particular situation in the Corinthian gatherings at that time, and on this reading, Paul did not intend his words to be universalized for all women of all churches of all eras.<ref> B. J. Oropeza, ''1 Corinthians.'' New Covenant Commentary (Eugene: Cascade, 2017), 187\u201394; Philip B. Payne, ''Man and Woman: One in Christ'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2009); Ben Witherington, ''Women in the Earliest Churches'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988); </ref> After discussing his views on [[Idolatry|worshipping idols]], Paul finally ends with his views on [[resurrection]]. He states that [[Christ]] died for our sins, and was buried, and rose on the third day according to the scriptures (1 Cor. 15:3). Paul then asks: \"Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no [[resurrection of the dead]]?\" (1 Cor. 15:12) and addresses the question of resurrection.\n\nThroughout the letter, Paul presents issues that are troubling the community in Corinth and offers ways to fix them. Paul states that this letter is to \"admonish\" them as beloved children. They are expected to become [[Imitation of Christ|imitators of Jesus]] and follow the ways in Christ as he, Paul, teaches in all his churches (1 Cor. 4:14\u201316).\n\n==See also==\n* [[1 Corinthians 10]]\n* [[1 Corinthians 11]] \u2013 on church order\n* [[1 Corinthians 13]] \u2013 the ''tongues of men and angels'' verse\n* [[1 Corinthians 15]] \u2013 on the Resurrection\n* [[Christian headcovering]]\n* [[Pauline privilege]]\n* [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#First Epistle to the Corinthians|Textual variants in the First Epistle to the Corinthians]]\n* [[Third Epistle to the Corinthians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Blenkinsopp, Joseph, ''The Corinthian Mirror: a Study of Contemporary Themes in a Pauline Epistle'' [i.e. in First Corinthians], Sheed and Ward, London, 1964.\n* Conzelmann, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=GjhAozR6NusC&pg=PA&lpg=#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Der erste Brief an die Korinther''], KEK V, G\u00f6ttingen 1969.\n* Robertson, A. and A.
