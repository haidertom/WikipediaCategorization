These can range from [[authentication]] schemes to supporting [[server-side]] programming languages such as <!-- ATTENTION AUTO-EDITORS, THESE UNDERSCORES ARE INTENTIONAL -->[[mod perl|Perl]], [[mod python|Python]], [[Tcl]] and [[PHP]]. Popular authentication modules include mod_access, mod_auth, mod_digest, and mod_auth_digest, the successor to mod_digest. A sample of other features include [[Secure Sockets Layer]] and [[Transport Layer Security]] support ([[mod_ssl]]), a [[proxy server|proxy]] module ([[mod_proxy]]), a [[URL rewriting]] module (mod_rewrite), custom log files (mod_log_config), and filtering support (mod_include and mod_ext_filter).\n\nPopular compression methods on Apache include the external extension module, mod_gzip<!-- redirects to here -->, implemented to help with reduction of the size (weight) of Web pages served over [[HTTP]]. [[ModSecurity]] is an open source intrusion detection and prevention engine for Web applications. Apache logs can be analyzed through a Web browser using free scripts, such as [[AWStats]]/[[W3Perl]] or Visitors.\n\n[[Virtual hosting]] allows one Apache installation to serve many different Web sites. For example, one computer with one Apache installation could simultaneously serve www.example.com, www.example.org, test47.test-server.example.edu, etc.\n\nApache features configurable error messages, [[Database management system|DBMS]]-based authentication databases, [[content negotiation]] and supports several [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs).\n\nIt supports password authentication and [[digital certificate]] authentication. Because the source code is freely available, anyone can adapt the server for specific needs, and there is a large public library of Apache add-ons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/Apache_Web_server.html|title=What is Apache Web Server?

Choice of MPM and configuration is therefore important. Where compromises in performance must be made, Apache is designed to reduce [[Latency (engineering)#Computer_hardware_and_operating_system_latency|latency]] and increase [[throughput]] relative to simply handling more requests, thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time-frames.{{clarify |date=August 2018 |reason=It isn't clear to a non-specialist like me why increasing throughput is different from handling more requests or why reducing latency (which sounds like increasing speed) wouldn't enable you to handle more requests. It also isn't clear how either of these represent a compromise in performance. Also, is Apache doing something that decreases latency and increases throughput _relative_ to what you would get by handling more requests, or is it decreasing latency and increasing throughput _rather_ than handling more requests? If the latter, \"rather than\" should replace \"relative to\" in that sentence.}}\n\nFor delivering static pages, Apache 2.2 series was considered significantly slower than [[nginx]] and [[Varnish (software)|varnish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbonvin.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/apache-vs-nginx-vs-varnish-vs-gwan/|title=Serving static files: a comparison between Apache, Nginx, Varnish and G-WAN|work=Spoot!}}</ref> To address this issue, the Apache developers created the Event MPM, which mixes the use of several processes and several threads per process in an [[Asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous]] [[Event loop|event-based loop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/worker.html|title=worker - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2|work=apache.org}}</ref>{{clarify |date=August 2018 |reason=Mixes the use of xyz with what?

The Abbey is cared for by [[Historic Scotland]] and is open to the public throughout the year (entrance charge).  The distinctive red [[sandstone]] ruins stand at the top of the High Street in Arbroath.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Arbroath Abbey Seal 01.jpg|thumb|Abbey [[Seal (device)|seal]], depicting murder of St Thomas.]]\nKing William gave the Abbey independence from its [[mother church]] and endowed it generously, including income from 24 parishes, land in every royal burgh and more.  The Abbey's monks were allowed to run a market and build a harbour.  King [[John of England]] gave the Abbey permission to buy and sell goods anywhere in [[England]] (except [[London]]) toll-free.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe Abbey, which was the richest in [[Scotland]], is most famous for its association with the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath|Declaration of Scottish Independence]] believed to have been drafted by Abbot [[Bernard of Kilwinning|Bernard]], who was the Chancellor of Scotland under King [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]].\n\nThe Abbey fell into ruin after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].  From 1590 onward, its stones were raided for buildings in the town of [[Arbroath]].  This continued until 1815 when steps were taken to preserve the remaining ruins.\n\nOn [[Christmas]] Day 1950, the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] was stolen from [[Westminster Abbey]]. On April 11, 1951, the missing stone was found lying on the site of the Abbey's altar.\n\nSince 1947, a [[major historical re-enactment]] commemorating the Declaration's signing has been held within the roofless remains of the Abbey church.  The celebration is run by the local [[Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society]], and tells the story of the events which led up to the signing.  This is not an annual event (most recent performance 2005; next August 2009). However, a special event to mark the signing is held every year on the 6th of April and involves a street procession and short piece of street theatre.\n\nIn 2005 The Arbroath Abbey campaign was launched.<ref>[http://www.rampantscotland.com/let051119.htm] Rampant Scotland Newsletter, 19 November 2005</ref> The campaign seeks to gain World Heritage Status for the iconinc Angus landmark that was the birthplace of one of Scotland's most significant document, The Declaration of Arbroath.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/arbabbey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Mh6OWXuH?url=http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/arbabbey.htm |archivedate=2014-01-17 |df= }}Angus Council Website, Arbroath Abbey article (1998-2008)</ref> Campaigners believe that the Abbey's historical pronouncement makes it a prime candidate to achieve World Heritage Status.

The [[triforium]] (open arcade) above the door is unique in Scottish medieval architecture.  It is flanked by twin towers decorated with blind arcading.  The [[cruciform]] church measured {{convert|276|ft|m}} long by {{convert|160|ft|m}} wide.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  What remains of it today are the [[sacristy]], added by Abbot Paniter in the 15th century, the southern [[transept]], which features Scotland's largest [[lancet window]]s, part of the [[choir]] and [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]], the southern half of the [[nave]], parts of the western towers and the western doorway.\nThe church originally had a central tower and (probably) a spire.  These would once have been visible for many miles over the surrounding countryside, and no doubt once acted as a sea-mark for ships.  The soft sandstone of the walls was originally protected by plaster internally and render externally.  These coatings are long gone and much of the architectural detail is sadly eroded, though detached fragments found in the ruins during consolidation give an impression of the original refined, rather austere, architectural effect.\n\nThe distinctive round window high in the south transept was originally lit up at night as a [[beacon]] for mariners.  It is known locally as the 'Round O', and from this tradition inhabitants of [[Arbroath]] are colloquially known as 'Reid Lichties' (Scots reid = red).\n\nLittle remains of the claustral buildings of the Abbey except for the impressive gatehouse, which stretches between the south-west corner of the church and a defensive tower on the High Street, and the still complete Abbot's House, a building of the 13th, 15th and 16th centuries, which is the best-preserved of its type in [[Scotland]].\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a new visitors' centre was opened to the public beside the Abbey's west front.  This red sandstone-clad building, with its distinctive 'wave-shaped' organic roof, planted with sedum, houses displays on the history of the Abbey and some of the best surviving stonework and other relics.  The upper storey features a scale model of the Abbey complex, a computer-generated 'fly-through' reconstruction of the church as it was when complete, and a viewing gallery with excellent views of the ruins.  The centre won the 2002 Angus Design Award.  An archaeological investigation of the site of the visitors' centre before building started revealed the foundations of the medieval precinct wall, with a gateway, and stonework discarded during manufacture, showing that the area was the site of the masons' yard while the Abbey was being built.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abbot of Arbroath]], for a list of abbots and commendators\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{historic-Scotland-link|013}}\n* [http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/arbroath/arbroathabbey/ ''Undiscovered Scotland's'' detailed history]\n* https://www.webcitation.org/6Mh6OWXuH?url=http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/arbabbey.htm\n* http://www.arbroathabbeypageant.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120716201840/http://www.angus.gov.uk/new/releases-archive/2003/2003-02-07a.html 2002 Angus Design Award]\n\n{{coord|56|33|45|N|2|34|56|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:1178 establishments]]\n[[Category:12th century in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Angus]]\n[[Category:Christian monasteries in Scotland]]\n[[Category:History of Angus]]\n[[Category:Tironensian monasteries]]\n[[Category:Category A listed buildings in Angus]]\n[[Category:Listed monasteries in Scotland]]", "sha1": "f4kw82lgrvybxt4mi2lr951bx9xzxpc"}}, {"title": "Accounting", "ns": "0", "id": "2593", "revision": {"id": "865843062", "parentid": "865842487", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T14:54:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bruce1ee", "id": "211905"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 pending edit by [[Special:Contributions/117.0.99.233|117.0.99.233]] to revision 865385907 by INeedSupport", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Accounting |expanded=}}\n{{Business administration}}\n{{ Redirect | Accountancy | the [[constituency]] in Hong Kong | Accountancy (constituency) | the game | Accounting (video game)}}\n\n'''Accounting''' or '''accountancy''' is the [[measurement]], processing, and [[communication]] of financial information about [[economic entity|economic entities]]<ref name = \"NP 2013\">{{cite book |last1=Needles |first1=Belverd E. |last2=Powers |first2=Marian |year=2013 |title=Principles of [[Financial]] Accounting |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=12 |series=Financial Accounting Series}}</ref><ref>{{Cite report |date=November 1940 |title=Accounting Research Bulletins No. 7 Reports of Committee on Terminology |url=http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/deloitte/id/9342 |publisher=Committee on Accounting Procedure, American Institute of Accountants |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref> such as [[business]]es and [[corporation]]s.

Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases, such as [[carbon dioxide]], pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called [[spiracle]]s. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube along the top of the body (called the \"dorsal aorta\") that functions like a heart, and pumps [[haemolymph]] toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The [[nervous system]] consists of a [[ventral nerve cord]] that runs the length of the body, with several [[ganglia]] and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.<ref name=\"insectmorph\">Borror, Triplehorn & Delong (1989), pp. 24\u201371</ref>\n\n[[Image:Scheme ant worker anatomy-en.svg|thumb|450px|left|Diagram of a worker ant (''Pachycondyla verenae'')]]\n\n===Head===\nAn ant's head contains many sensory organs.

Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] in their [[spermatheca]]e.<ref name=\"HolldoblerWilsonAnts2\">H\u00f6lldobler & Wilson (1990), pp. 143\u2013179</ref>\n\nMated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics,<ref name=\"SuddFranks2013\">{{cite book | vauthors = Sudd JH, Franks NR |title=The Behavioural Ecology of Ants|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9789400931237|page=41}}</ref> and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately.

Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Goss S, Aron S, Deneubourg JL, Pasteels JM |year=1989|title=Self-organized shortcuts in the Argentine ant|journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=76 |pages=579\u2013581 |doi=10.1007/BF00462870 |issue=12|url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/use/publications/JLD/56.pdf|bibcode = 1989NW.....76..579G }}</ref>\n\nAnts use pheromones for more than just making trails.

Specifically, [[arbitration]] is an alternative to [[litigation]] through which the parties to a dispute agree to submit their respective positions (through agreement or hearing) to a neutral third party (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution. In practice arbitration is generally used as a substitute for litigation, particularly when the judicial process is perceived as too slow, expensive or biased. In some context, an arbitrator may be described as an '''umpire'''.<ref>See, e.g., {{usc|9|5}}, Appointment of arbitrators or umpire</ref>\n\n==History==\nAgreements to arbitrate were not enforceable at common law, traced back to dictum by Lord Coke in ''Vynor\u2019s Case'', 8 Co. Rep. 81b, 77 Eng. Rep. 597 (1609), that agreements to arbitrate were revocable by either party.\n\nDuring the [[Industrial Revolution]], large [[corporations]] became increasingly opposed to this policy. They argued that too many valuable [[business]] relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive adversarial [[litigation]], in courts whose rules differed significantly from the informal norms and [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s of businesspeople (the private law of [[commerce]], or ''jus merchant''). Arbitration was promoted as being faster, less adversarial, and cheaper.\n\nThe result was the [[New York Arbitration Act]] of 1920, followed by the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 (now known as the [[Federal Arbitration Act]]). Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or unconscionability or some other ground for rescission which undermined the validity of the entire contract). Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of [[interstate commerce]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state [[legislature]]s to protect their [[consumer]]s against powerful corporations.\n\n==Types of Arbitration==\n\n===Commercial and other forms of contract arbitration===\n\nSince commercial arbitration is based upon either contract law or the [[law of treaties]], the agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration is a legally binding [[contract]]. All arbitral decisions are considered to be \"final and binding.\" This does not, however, void the requirements of law. Any dispute not excluded from arbitration by virtue of law (for example, criminal proceedings) may be submitted to arbitration.\n\nFurthermore, arbitration agreements can only bind parties who have agreed, expressly or impliedly to arbitrate. Arbitration cannot bind nonsignatories to an arbitration contract, even if those nonsignatories later become involved with a signatory to a contract by accident (usually through the commission of a [[tort]]).<ref>''County of Contra Costa v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/47CA4t237.htm 47 Cal. App. 4th 237] (1996). [[Kaiser Permanente]] argued in this case unsuccessfully that third parties who injure Kaiser members should be forced to arbitrate cross-claims against Kaiser.</ref>\n\n===Labor arbitration===\nArbitration may be used as a means of resolving labor disputes, an alternative to strikes and [[Lockout (industry)|lockouts]] . Labor arbitration comes in two varieties:\n#'''interest arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes about the terms to be included in a new contract when the parties are unable to agree, and\n#'''grievance arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes over the interpretation and application of a [[collective bargaining agreement]].\n\nArbitration has also been used as a means of resolving labor disputes for more than a century. Labor organizations in the [[United States]], such as the [[National Labor Union]], called for arbitration as early as 1866 as an alternative to strikes to resolve disputes over the wages, benefits and other rights that workers would enjoy.\n\n====Interest arbitration====\nGovernments have relied on arbitration to resolve particularly large labor disputes, such as the [[Coal Strike of 1902]]. This type of arbitration, wherein a neutral arbitrator decides the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, is commonly known as interest arbitration. The [[United Steelworkers of America]] adopted an elaborate form of interest arbitration, known as the Experimental Negotiating Agreement, in the 1970s as a means of avoiding the long and costly strikes that had made the industry vulnerable to foreign competition. [[Major League Baseball]] uses a variant of interest arbitration, in which an arbitrator chooses between the two sides' final offers, to set the terms for contracts for players who are not eligible for free agency. Interest arbitration is now most frequently used by public employees who have no right to strike (for example, law enforcement and firefighters).\n\n====Grievance arbitration====\nUnions and employers have also employed arbitration to resolve employee and union grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] made arbitration a central element of the ''Protocol of Peace'' it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second decade of the twentieth century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during [[World War II]], when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|War Labor Board]], which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy in three cases which came to be known as the Steelworkers' Trilogy. The Court held that grievance arbitration was a preferred dispute resolution technique and that courts could not overturn arbitrators' awards unless the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. State and federal statutes may allow vacating an award on narrow grounds (''e.g.'', fraud). These protections for arbitrator awards are premised on the union-management system, which provides both parties with due process. Due process in this context means that both parties have experienced representation throughout the process, and that the arbitrators practice only as neutrals. ''See'' [[National Academy of Arbitrators]].\n\n===Securities arbitration===\nIn the United States securities industry, arbitration has long been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Resolving Investment Disputes by Arbitration|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/securities_law/securities_arbitration.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=22 March 2018|date=17 January 2015}}</ref> The arbitration process operates under its own rules, as defined by contract. Securities arbitrations are held primarily by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]].\n\nThe securities industry uses pre-dispute arbitration agreements, through which the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms, other than Securities class action claims,<ref name=\"complinet\">{{cite web|url=http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&record_id=1901&element_id=1660|publisher=finra.complinet.com|title=FINRA Manual - Notices - 1992 - 92-65 SEC Approval of Amendments Concerning the Exclusion of Class-Action Matters From Arbitration Proceedings and Requiring That Predispute Arbitration Agreements Include a Notice That Class-Action Matters May Not Be Arbitrated|accessdate=2017-01-06}}</ref> are resolved in arbitration.\n\nThe SEC has come under fire from members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] for not fulfilling statutory duty to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues.<ref name=\"Morgenson2007\">{{cite news|last1=Morgenson|first1=Gretchen|title=Dear S.E.C., Reconsider Arbitration - The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/business/yourmoney/06gret.html|accessdate=22 March 2018|agency=New York Times|date=6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Judicial arbitration===\nSome state court systems have promulgated court-ordered arbitration; family law (particularly child custody) is the most prominent example. Judicial arbitration is often merely advisory dispute resolution technique, serving as the first step toward resolution, but not binding either side and allowing for trial de novo. Litigation attorneys present their side of the case to an independent tertiary lawyer, who issues an opinion on settlement. Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.\n\n==Validity of arbitration clauses==\n\nAlthough properly drafted arbitration clauses are generally valid, they are subject to challenge in court for compliance with laws and public policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guide to Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=2012-05-10}}</ref> Arbitration clauses may potentially be challenged as unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-reid/unconscionable-employment_b_4234686.html|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|title=Unconscionable Employment Arbitration Agreement Held Unenforceable &#124; The Huffington Post|accessdate=2017-01-06}}</ref>\n\nTypically, the validity of an arbitration clause is decided by a court rather than an arbitrator. However, if the validity of the entire arbitration agreement is in dispute, then the issue may remain subject to arbitration. For example, in ''Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that \"under the [[Federal Arbitration Act|FAA]], where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the challenge is for the arbitrator.\"<ref name=SCOTUSRenter-A-Center>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-497.pdf Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson]. Supreme Court of the United States.</ref>\n\nIn other words, the law typically allows federal courts to decide these types of \"gateway\" or validity questions, but the Supreme Court ruled that since Jackson targeted the entire contract rather than a specific clause, the arbitrator decided the validity.<ref>[http://www.law360.com/articles/176273 High Court Favors Arbitrator In Rent-A-Center Case].

An example of exceeding arbitral authority might be awarding one party to a dispute the personal automobile of the other party when the dispute concerns the specific performance of a business-related contract.\n\nIt is open to the parties to restrict the possible awards that the arbitrator can make. If this restriction requires a straight choice between the position of one party or the position of the other, then it is known as ''[[pendulum arbitration]]'' or ''final offer arbitration''. It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it more likely they receive a favorable decision.\n\nNo definitive statement can be made concerning the credentials or experience levels of arbitrators, although some jurisdictions have elected to establish standards for arbitrators in certain fields. Some independent organizations, such as the [[American Arbitration Association]] offer arbitrator training programs, and arbitrators may cite their completion of that training as a credential. Generally speaking, however, the credibility of an arbitrator rests upon reputation, experience level in arbitrating particular issues, or expertise/experience in a particular field. Arbitrators are generally not required to be members of the legal profession.\n\nTo ensure effective arbitration and to increase the general credibility of the arbitral process, arbitrators will sometimes sit as a panel, usually consisting of three arbitrators. Often the three consist of an expert in the legal area within which the dispute falls (such as contract law in the case of a dispute over the terms and conditions of a contract), an expert in the industry within which the dispute falls (such as the construction industry, in the case of a dispute between a homeowner and his general contractor), and an experienced arbitrator.\n\n==Arbitration on television==\nThe \"[[Court show|judge shows]]\" that have become popular in many countries, especially the [[United States]], are actually binding arbitration.

P. Putnam's Sons]], 1977): 21.</ref> in which some litigants, notably women, were allowed a champion to represent them. The use of the [[jury]] in the common law system seems to have fostered the adversarial system and provides the opportunity for both sides to argue their point of view.\n\n==Basic features==\nAs an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a [[crime|criminal]] adversarial proceeding, they may not be questioned by a prosecutor or judge unless they choose to do so. However, should they decide to testify, they are subject to [[cross-examination]] and could be found guilty of [[perjury]]. As the election to maintain an accused person's [[right to silence]] prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth. Certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.\n\nBy contrast, while [[defendant]]s in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor and not given under oath. This allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition. However, this is mainly because it is not the prosecutor but the judges who question the defendant. The concept of \"cross\"-examination is entirely due to adversarial structure of the common law.\n\nJudges in an adversarial system are impartial in ensuring the fair play of [[due process]], or [[fundamental justice]]. Such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. At worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision, rendering obsolete the judicial process in question&mdash;[[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.\n\nThe [[rules of evidence]] are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. In a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.\n\nAll evidence must be relevant and not [[hearsay]] evidence.\n\nPeter Murphy in his ''Practical Guide to Evidence'' recounts an instructive example. A frustrated judge in an English (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'Am I never to hear the truth?' 'No, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.\n\nThe name \"adversarial system\" may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. This is not the case, and both modern adversarial and inquisitorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. Indeed, the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] in Article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.\n\nThe [[right to counsel]] in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. It was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, it was only in 1836 that England gave suspects of felonies the formal right to have legal counsel (the [[Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836]]), although in practice English courts routinely allowed defendants to be represented by counsel from the mid-18th century. During the second half of the 18th century advocates like [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]] and [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine]] helped usher in the adversarial court system used in most common law countries today. In the United States, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and in state cases at least since the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. Appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36 |title=CRS/LII Annotated Constitution Sixth Amendment |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref> It was not until 1963 that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal Sixth Amendment, in state courts. See ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}.\n\nOne of the most significant differences between the adversarial system and the inquisitorial system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. In an adversarial system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocution]] of her or his crime; an obviously false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. By contrast, in an inquisitorial system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. This allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversarial systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the United States are handled without trial through such plea bargains.\n\nIn some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make [[inference]]s on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question. This obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defense. In England the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in England and Wales (it was already possible in Scotland under the [[rule of criminative circumstances]]). This change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. The criticism reflects the idea that if the accused can be inferred to be guilty by exercising their right to silence, it no longer confers the protection intended by such a right. In the United States, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.\n\nLord Devlin in ''The Judge'' said: \"It can also be argued that two prejudiced searchers starting from opposite ends of the field will between them be less likely to miss anything than the impartial searcher starting at the middle.\"<ref>P Devlin, ''The Judge'' (Oxford University Press, 1970) 60-1</ref>\n\n==Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach==\nThere are many differences in the way cases are reviewed. It is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show whether or not these systems would come to the same results. However, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.\n\nProponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. It also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.\n\nIn addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. The common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in the courtroom. Most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. The lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges.\n\nProponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They point out that many cases in adversarial systems, and most cases in the United States, are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] or [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. Plea bargain as a system does not exist in an inquisitorial system. Many legal cases in adversarial systems, and most in the United States, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Law}}\n* [[Exclusionary rule]]\n* [[Parallel thinking]] - described as a systemic alternative\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|author=Kagan, Robert A. |title=Adversarial Legalism: The American Way of Law| isbn=9780674012417|date=September 2003|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674012417|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}\n\n{{Criminal procedure}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adversarial System}}\n[[Category:Judiciaries]]\n[[Category:Legal systems]]", "sha1": "dgc93x5nzp3lh71lyyjovfh1203rl3c"}}, {"title": "Aa", "ns": "0", "id": "2599", "redirect": {"title": "AA"}, "revision": {"id": "783846571", "parentid": "418219338", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T01:20:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[AA]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative capitalization}}\n}}", "sha1": "mmdvoj6n14y8j1ki7dl5f666f2ukmq0"}}, {"title": "Aarons rod", "ns": "0", "id": "2600", "redirect": {"title": "Aaron's rod"}, "revision": {"id": "769623011", "parentid": "599534167", "timestamp": "2017-03-10T17:52:30Z", "contributor": {"username": "Christian75", "id": "1306352"}, "comment": "/* top */{{redr}} is deprecated - converting to {{Redirect category shell|}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Aaron's rod]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|\n{{R from move}}\n{{R from misspelling}}\n}}", "sha1": "0b829bq68aqitsc2n1cps8pqwvwvvvu"}}, {"title": "Abandonment in marine insurance", "ns": "0", "id": "2601", "redirect": {"title": "Abandon"}, "revision": {"id": "597428697", "parentid": "15900998", "timestamp": "2014-02-27T21:20:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "Xqbot", "id": "8066546"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot: Fixing double redirect to [[Abandon]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Abandon]]", "sha1": "su27bgql36k9qb3u9ds8qo1oik2tdfb"}}, {"title": "Abano Terme", "ns": "0", "id": "2602", "revision": {"id": "861981108", "parentid": "853383924", "timestamp": "2018-10-01T11:42:29Z", "contributor": {"ip": "151.18.112.180"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{more footnotes|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox Italian comune\n| name                    = Abano Terme\n| official_name           = Comune di Abano Terme\n| native_name             = \n| image_skyline           = AbanoCampanile.jpg\n| imagesize               = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = Tower of Monteortone church\n| image_shield            = Abano Terme-Stemma.png\n| shield_alt              = \n| image_map               = \n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = \n| pushpin_label_position  = \n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| coordinates             = {{coord|45|21|37|N|11|47|24|E|region:IT_type:city(19062)|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes   = \n| region                  = [[Veneto]]\n| province                = [[Province of Padua|Padua]] (PD)\n| frazioni                = Feriole, Giarre, Monterosso, Monteortone\n| mayor_party             = \n| mayor                   = Federico Barbierato\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_total_km2          = 21\n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_total        = 19062\n| population_as_of        = 2006\n| pop_density_footnotes   = \n| population_demonym      = Aponensi or Abanesi\n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = 14\n| twin1                   = \n| twin1_country           = \n| saint                   = St. Lawrence\n| day                     = August 10\n| postal_code             = 35031\n| area_code               = 049\n| website                 = {{URL|http://www.abanoterme.net}}\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n\n'''Abano Terme''' (known as ''Abano Bagni'' until 1924) is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Padua]], in the [[Veneto]] region, [[Italy]], on the eastern slope of the [[Colli Euganei]]; it is {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} southwest by rail from [[Padua]].

The trees are usually interlaced or tied with [[wire]]. Abatis are used alone or in combination with [[wire entanglement]]s and other obstacles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abatis.jpg|thumb|Abatis improvised by Japanese troops during [[World War II]]]]\n\nThere is evidence it was used as early as the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] period, and as recently as the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete, Ch. XXII</ref>\n\nA classic use of an abatis was at the [[Battle of Carillon]] during the Seven Years' War. The 3,600 French troops defeated a massive army of 16,000 British and Colonial troops by fronting their defensive positions with an extremely dense abatis. The British found the defences almost impossible to breach and were forced to withdraw with some 2,600 casualties. Other uses of an abatis can be found at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay]], 26 October 1813, when approximately 1,300 [[Canadian Voltigeurs|Canadian voltigeurs]], under the command of Charles-Michel de Salaberry, defeated an American corps of approximately 4,000 men, or at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]].\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:Giant abatis.jpg|thumb|upright|Giant abatis, made from entire trees, can make an effective anti-vehicle obstacle. This formation can be achieved by use of explosives\u2014note the splintered stumps]]\n\nAn important weakness of abatis, in contrast to [[barbed wire]], is that it can be destroyed by [[fire]]. Also, if laced together with [[rope]] instead of [[wire]], the rope can be very quickly destroyed by such fires, after which the abatis can be quickly pulled apart by [[grappling hook]]s thrown from a safe distance.\n\nAn important advantage is that an improvised abatis can be quickly formed in forested areas. This can be done by simply cutting down a row of trees so that they fall with their tops toward the enemy. An alternative is to place explosives so as to blow the trees down.\n\n== Modern use ==\n[[File:The boys of '61; or, Four years of fighting. Personal observation with the army and navy, from the first battle of Bull run to the fall of Richmond (1884) (14753099266).jpg|left|thumb|Depiction of an abatis during the [[American Civil War]]]]\n[[File:Abatis Map Symbol.svg|thumb|left|United States military symbol for an abatis]]\n\nAbatis are rarely seen nowadays, having been largely replaced by [[wire obstacle]]s. However, it may be used as a replacement or supplement when [[barbed wire]] is in short supply. A form of giant abatis, using whole trees instead of branches, can be used as an improvised anti-[[tank]] obstacle.\n\nThough rarely used by modern conventional military units, abatises are still officially maintained in [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] training.  Current US training instructs engineers or other constructors of such obstacles to fell trees, leaving a {{convert|1|or|2|yard||1}} stump, in such a manner as the trees fall interlocked pointing at a 45-degree angle towards the direction of approach of the enemy.  Furthermore, it is recommended that the trees remain connected to the stumps and the length of roadway covered be at least {{convert|80|yard|round=5}}. US military maps record an abatis by use of an inverted \"V\" with a short line extending from it to the right.<ref>[[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]], ''FM 101-5-1/MCRP 5-2A Operational Terms and Graphics'', 30 September 1997</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Zasechnaya cherta]] (\"Great Abatis Line\")\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Abatis|volume=1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.pamplinpark.org Pamplin Historical Park & The National Museum of the Civil War Soldier] includes large and authentic reproduction of abatis used in the U.S. Civil War.\n\n{{Fortifications}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Fortifications by type]]\n[[Category:Medieval defences]]", "sha1": "8m34xk0w4oyp72a4wqykkfxn4yw7hjv"}}, {"title": "Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie", "ns": "0", "id": "2607", "revision": {"id": "846105915", "parentid": "845866758", "timestamp": "2018-06-16T10:12:22Z", "contributor": {"ip": "83.220.238.163"}, "comment": "Birth / maternal nation.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Infobox scientist\n| name          = Antoine Thomson d&#39;Abbadie\n| image         = Antoine d'Abbadie.gif\n| image_size    = 150px\n| caption       = Antoine Thomson d&#39;Abbadie\n| birth_date    = {{birth-date|3 January 1810}}\n| birth_place   = [[Dublin]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Ireland]]\n| death_date    = {{death-date and age|19 March 1897|3 January 1810}}\n| death_place   = Paris, France\n| residence     =\n| citizenship   = France\n| nationality   = Irish, French, Basque\n| alma_mater    =\n| doctoral_advisor =\n| doctoral_students =\n| known_for     =\n| author_abbrev_bot =\n| author_abbrev_zoo =\n| signature     =\n| footnotes     =\n| ethnicity     =\n| field         = [[Geographer]]\n| work_institutions =\n| prizes        =\n}}\n\n'''Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie d'Arrast''' (3 January 1810{{snd}}19 March 1897)<ref name=EB /> was an Irish-born French explorer, [[geographer]], [[ethnologist]], [[linguist]] and [[astronomer]] notable for his travels in [[Ethiopia]]<ref group=nb>Although referred to as Ethiopia here, the region that they traveled is more accurately defined as [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] or in today's geography northern Ethiopia and [[Eritrea]].</ref> during the first half of the 19th century. He was the older brother of [[Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie]], with whom he travelled.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Thorne|1984|p=1}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nd'Arrast was born a British subject, in [[Dublin]], Ireland, from a partially [[Basque people|Basque]] noble family of the [[Provinces of France|French province]] of [[Soule]]. His father, Michel Abbadie, was born in [[Arrast-Larrebieu]] and his mother was Irish. His grandfather Jean-Pierre was an [[abbot]] and a [[Notary public|notary]] in Soule. The family moved to France in 1818 where the brothers received a careful scientific education.<ref name=EB />{{refn|group=nb|The date of the move to France by the family is given as 1820 by some.<ref name=ww />}} In 1827, Antoine received a bachelier (bachelor) degree in [[Toulouse]].<ref name=ww>{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=400}}</ref> Starting in 1829, he began his education in Paris, where he studied law.<ref name=ww />\n\nHe married Virginie Vincent de Saint-Bonnet on 21 February 1859,<ref name=ww /> and settled in [[Hendaye]] where he purchased 250[[Hectare|ha]] to build a castle, and became the mayor of the city from 1871 to 1875.\n\nAbbadie was a knight of the [[L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur|Legion of Honour]], which he received on 27 September 1850,<ref name=ww /><ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref> and a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He died in 1897, and bequeathed the Abbadi domain and castle in Hendaye, yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences.{{sfn|Keltie|1911}}\n\n== Science and explorations ==\nIn 1835 the [[French Academy]] sent Antoine on a scientific mission to Brazil, the results being published at a later date (1873)<ref name=EB />{{refn|group=nb|The date of the trip to Brazil is stated as 1836 by some sources.<ref name=ww />}} under the title of ''Observations relatives \u00e0 la physique du globe faites au Br\u00e9sil et en \u00c9thiopie''. In 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at [[Massawa]] in February 1838.<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=8}}</ref> They journeyed throughout Ethiopia, travelling as far south as the [[Kingdom of Kaffa]], sometimes together and sometimes separately. In addition to his studies in the sciences, he delved into the political fray exerting influence in favour of France and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionaries.<ref name=ce>{{harvnb|Shahan|1907}}</ref> While in Ethiopia they returned to France in 1848 with notes on the geography, geology, archaeology, and natural history of the region.{{sfn|Keltie|1911}}\n\nAntoine became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues. He was especially attacked by [[Charles Tilstone Beke]], who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to [[Kana, Ethiopia|Kana]]. But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention\u2014hotly contested by Beke\u2014that the [[Blue Nile]] was the main stream. The topographical results of his explorations were published in Paris between 1860 and 1873<ref name=EB /> in ''G\u00e9od\u00e9sie d'\u00c9thiopie'', full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps. Of the ''G\u00e9ographie de l'\u00c9thiopie'' (Paris, 1890)<ref name=EB /> only one volume was published. In ''Un Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de manuscrits \u00e9thiopiens'' (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian [[manuscript]]s collected by Antoine.<ref name=EB /> He also compiled various vocabularies, including a ''Dictionnaire de [[Amharic language|la langue amari\u00f1\u00f1a]]'' (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'', with the Latin version, in 1860. He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions. Under the title of ''Reconnaissances magn\u00e9tiques'' he published in 1890 an account of the [[magnetic]] observations <ref name=\"Delpech\" />made by him in the course of several journeys to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Levant]]. The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the title of ''Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie''.{{sfn|Keltie|1911}}\n\nAntoine was responsible for streamlining techniques towards [[geodesy]], along with inventing a new [[theodolite]] for measuring angles.\n\n==Abbadie, a Basque and bascophile==\nBasque through his father, Abbadie developed a particular interest about the [[Basque Language]] after meeting the Prince [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] in London. He started his academic work on Basque in 1852.\n\nA speaker of both [[Souletin]] and [[Lapurdian]], a resident of [[Lapurdi]], Abbadie considered himself a [[Basque people|Basque]] from [[Soule]]. The popularity of the [[motto]] [[Zazpiak Bat]] is attributed to Abbadie, coined in the framework of the ''[[Jocs Florals|Lore Jokoak]]'' Basque festivals, fostered by himself.\n\n==The castle or ch\u00e2teau==\n[[File:Chateau d Abbadie.jpg|thumb|400px|Domaine d'Abbadia in [[Hendaye]], designed by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]]]\nAbbadie gave his castle home the name ''Abbadia'', which is the name still used in Basque. However, in French it is usually referred to as ''[[Ch\u00e2teau d'Abbadie|Chateau d'Abbadie]]'' or ''Domaine d'Abbadia'', and locally it is not unusual for it to be called ''le Chateau d'Antoine d'Abbadie''.\n\nThe ch\u00e2teau was built between 1864 and 1879 on a cliff by the Atlantic Ocean, and was designed by [[Viollet Le Duc]] in the [[Neo Gothic]] style, and is considered one of the most important examples of French Gothic Revival Architecture.<ref name=Delpech>{{harvnb|Delpech|2014|p=1}}</ref> It is divided in three parts : the observatory and library, the chapel, and the living quarters.\n\nNowadays the ch\u00e2teau still belongs to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des sciences|Academy of Science]] to which it was bequeathed in 1895 on condition of its producing a catalogue of half-a-million [[star]]s within fifty years' time,<ref name=ce /> with the work to be carried out by members of religious orders.<ref name=ce/>\n\nThe ch\u00e2teau was classified as a protected historical monument by France in 1984.

He is also known as '''Yarhi''' from his birthplace ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Yerah'', i.e. [[moon]], lune), and he further took the name '''Astruc''', '''Don Astruc''' or '''En Astruc of Lunel'''<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Abba Mari |volume=1 |page=9 |inline=1}}</ref> from the word \"astruc\" meaning lucky (see [[Astruc]]).\n\nThe descendant of men learned in [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] lore, Abba Mari devoted himself to the study of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], and made himself acquainted with the writings of [[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]] as well as with the ''[[Talmud]]''.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn Montpellier, where he lived from 1303 to 1306, he was much distressed by the prevalence of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[rationalism]], which in his opinion, through the medium of the works of Maimonides, threatened the authority of the [[Old Testament]], obedience to the law, and the belief in [[miracle]]s and [[revelation]]. He therefore, in a series of letters (afterwards collected under the title ''Minhat Kenaot'', i.e., \"Jealousy Offering\") called upon the famous rabbi [[Solomon ben Aderet]] of [[Barcelona]] to come to the aid of orthodoxy. Ben Adret, with the approval of other prominent Spanish rabbis, sent a letter to the community at Montpellier proposing to forbid the study of philosophy to those who were less than twenty-five years of age, and, in spite of keen opposition from the liberal section, a decree in this sense was issued by Ben Adret in 1305.  The result was a great schism among the [[Jew]]s of [[Spain]] and southern [[France]], and a new impulse was given to the study of philosophy by the unauthorized interference of the Spanish rabbis.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nOn the expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] in 1306, Abba Mari settled at [[Perpignan]], where he published the letters connected with the controversy. His subsequent history is unknown.  Beside the letters, he was the author of liturgical poetry and works on civil law.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Defender of Law and Tradition==\n(Graetz and others have, incorrectly, En Duran): Leader of the opposition to the [[rationalism]] of the Maimonists in the Montpellier controversy of 1303-1306; born at Lunel\u2014hence his name, Yar\u1e25i (from Yera\u1e25 = Moon = Lune). He was a descendant of [[Meshullam ben Jacob]] of Lunel, one of whose five sons was Joseph, the grandfather of Abba Mari, who, like his son Moses, the father of Abba Mari, was highly respected for both his rabbinical learning and his general erudition. Abba Mari moved to Montpellier, where, to his chagrin, he found the study of rabbinical lore greatly neglected by the young, who devoted all of their time and zeal to [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The rationalistic method pursued by the new school of Maimonists (including [[Levi ben Abraham ben Chayyim]] of [[Villefranche-de-Conflent|Villefranche]], near the town of [[Perpignan]], and [[Jacob Anatolio]]) especially provoked his indignation; for the sermons preached and the works published by them seemed to resolve the entire [[Scripture]]s into [[allegory]] and threatened to undermine the Jewish faith and the observance of the Law and tradition. He was not without some philosophical training. He mentions even with reverence the name of Maimonides, whose work he possessed and studied; but he was more inclined toward the mysticism of Nachmanides. Above all, he was a thorough believer in [[revelation]] and in a [[divine providence]], and was a sincere, law-observing follower of rabbinical Judaism. He would not allow Aristotle, \"the searcher after God among the heathen,\" to be ranked with Moses.<ref name=JewishEncyclopedia>{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&artid=152|article=Abba Mari ben Moses ben Joseph Don Astruc of Lunel|inline=1}}</ref>\n\n==Opponent of Rationalism==\nAbba Mari possessed considerable Talmudic knowledge and some poetical talent; but his zeal for the Law made him an agitator and a persecutor of all the advocates of liberal thought. Being himself without sufficient authority, he appealed in a number of letters, afterward published under the title of ''Min\u1e25at \u1e32enaot'' (''Jealousy Offering''), to [[Solomon ben Adret]] of [[Barcelona]], the most influential rabbi of the time, to use his powerful authority to check the source of evil by hurling his [[anathema]] against both the study of philosophy and the allegorical interpretations of the Bible, which did away with all belief in miracles. Ben Adret, while reluctant to interfere in the affairs of other congregations, was in perfect accord with Abba Mari as to the danger of the new rationalistic systems, and advised him to organize the conservative forces in defense of the Law. Abba Mari, through Ben Adret's aid, obtained allies eager to take up his cause, among whom were Don [[Bonafoux Vidal]] of Barcelona and his brother, Don [[Crescas Vidal]], then in Perpignan. The proposition of the latter to prohibit, under penalty of [[excommunication]], the study of philosophy and any of the sciences except [[medicine]], by one under thirty years of age, met with the approval of Ben Adret. Accordingly, Ben Adret addressed to the congregation of Montpellier a letter, signed by fifteen other rabbis, proposing to issue a decree pronouncing the anathema against all those who should pursue the study of philosophy and science before due maturity in age and in rabbinical knowledge. On a Sabbath in September, 1304, the letter was to be read before the congregation, when [[Jacob Machir Don Profiat Tibbon]], the renowned astronomical and mathematical writer, entered his protest against such unlawful interference by the Barcelona rabbis, and a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] ensued. Twenty-eight members signed Abba Mari's letter of approval; the others, under Tibbon's leadership, addressed another letter to Ben Adret, rebuking him and his colleagues for condemning a whole community without knowledge of the local conditions. Finally, the agitation for and against the liberal ideas brought about a schism in the entire Jewish population in southern [[France]] and [[Spain]].<ref name=JewishEncyclopedia/>\n\nEncouraged, however, by letters signed by the rabbis of [[Argenti\u00e8re]] and Lunel, and particularly by the support of [[Kalonymus ben Todros]], the ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]'' of [[Narbonne]], and of the eminent Talmudist [[Asheri of Toledo]], Ben Adret issued a decree, signed by thirty-three rabbis of Barcelona, excommunicating those who should, within the next fifty years, study [[physics]] or [[metaphysics]] before their thirtieth year of age (basing his action on the principle laid down by Maimonides, ''Guide for the Perplexed'' part one chapter 34), and had the order promulgated in the synagogue on Sabbath, July 26, 1305. When this [[heresy]]-decree, to be made effective, was forwarded to other congregations for approval, the friends of liberal thought, under the leadership of the Tibbonites, issued a counter-ban, and the conflict threatened to assume a serious character, as blind party zeal (this time on the liberal side) did not shrink from asking the civil powers to intervene. But an unlooked-for calamity brought the warfare to an end. The expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (\"the Fair\"), in, caused the Jews of Montpellier to take refuge, partly in [[Provence]], partly in Perpignan and partly in [[Majorca]]. Consequently, Abba Mari removed first to [[Arles]], and, within the same year, to Perpignan, where he finally settled and disappeared from public view. There he published his correspondence with Ben Adret and his colleagues.<ref name=JewishEncyclopedia/>\n\n==His Works==\nAbba Mari collected the correspondence and added to each letter a few explanatory notes. Of this collection, called ''Min\u1e25at \u1e32enaot,'' there are several manuscript copies extant; namely, at [[Oxford]] (Neubauer, ''Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.,'' Nos. 2182 and 2221); [[Paris]], Bibl. Nat. No. 976; G\u00fcnzburg Libr., [[Saint Petersburg]]; [[Parma]]; [[Ramsgate]] [[Montefiore College]] Library (formerly Halberstam, No. 192); and [[Turin]]. Some of these (Oxford, No. 2221, and Paris, Bibl. Nat.) are mere fragments. The printed edition (Presburg, 1838), prepared by M. L. Bislichis, contains: (1) Preface; (2) a treatise of eighteen chapters on the [[incorporeality]] of [[God]]; (3) correspondence; (4) a treatise, called ''Sefer ha-Yar\u1e25i,'' included also in letter 58; (5) a defense of ''The Guide'' and its author by [[Shem-Tob Palquera]] (Gr\u00e4tz, ''Gesch. d. Juden,'' vii. 173). As the three cardinal doctrines of Judaism, Abba Mari accentuates: (1) That of the recognition of God's existence and of His absolute sovereignty, eternity, unity, and incorporeality, as taught in revelation, especially in the ''[[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]''; (2) that of the world's creation by Him out of nothing, as evidenced particularly by the Sabbath; (3) that of the special [[Divine providence|providence]] of God, as manifested in the Biblical [[miracle]]s. In the preface, Abba Mari explains his object in collecting the correspondence; and in the treatise which follows he shows that the study of philosophy, useful in itself as a help toward the acquisition of the knowledge of God, requires great caution, lest we be misled by the Aristotelian philosophy or its false interpretation, as regards the principles of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and divine individual providence. The manuscripts include twelve letters which are not included in the printed edition of ''Min\u1e25at \u1e32enaot.''<ref name=JewishEncyclopedia/>\n\n==Contents of the ''Min\u1e25at \u1e32enaot''==\nThe correspondence refers mainly to the proposed restriction of the study of the Aristotelian philosophy. Casually, other theological questions are discussed. For example, letters 1, 5, and 8 contain a discussion on the question, whether the use of a piece of metal with the figure of a lion, as a [[amulet|talisman]], is permitted by Jewish law for medicinal purposes, or is prohibited as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. In letter 131, Abba Mari mourns the death of Ben Adret, and in letter 132 he sends words of sympathy to the congregation of Perpignan, on the death of Don Vidal Shlomo (the [[Meiri]]) and Rabbi Meshullam. Letter 33 contains the statement of Abba Mari that two letters which he desired to insert could not be discovered by him. MS. Ramsgate, No. 52, has the same statement, but also the two letters missing in the printed copies. In the ''Sefer ha-Yar\u1e25i'', Abba Mari refers to the great caution shown by the rabbis of old as regards the teaching of the mysteries of philosophy, and recommended by men like the [[Hai Gaon]], Maimonides, and [[David Kimhi]]. A response of Abba Mari on a ritual question is contained in MS. Ramsgate, No. 136; and Zunz (''Literaturgeschichte der Synagogalen Poesie,'' p.&nbsp;498), mentions a ''\u1e33inah'' composed by Abba Mari.<ref name=JewishEncyclopedia/>\n\nThe ''Min\u1e25at \u1e32enaot'' is instructive reading for the historian because it throws much light upon the deeper problems which agitated Judaism, the question of the relation of religion to the philosophy of the age, which neither the zeal of the fanatic nor the bold attitude of the liberal-minded could solve in any fixed dogmatic form or by any anathema, as the independent spirit of the congregations refused to accord to the rabbis the power possessed by the Church of dictating to the people what they should believe or respect. At the close of the work are added several eulogies written by Abba Mari on Ben Adret (who died in 1310), and on Don Vidal, [[Solomon of Perpignan]], and Don [[Bonet Crescas]] of Lunel.<ref name=JewishEncyclopedia/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mari, Abba}}\n[[Category:13th-century births]]\n[[Category:14th-century deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Lunel]]\n[[Category:14th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Proven\u00e7al Jews]]\n[[Category:French Orthodox rabbis]]\n[[Category:14th-century French people]]\n[[Category:Jewish refugees]]\n[[Category:Rishonim]]", "sha1": "56x2mhqm6qc0p942bjge5oi4tksfd4i"}}, {"title": "Abbas II of Egypt", "ns": "0", "id": "2609", "revision": {"id": "854424258", "parentid": "854424094", "timestamp": "2018-08-11T07:26:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Silas Maxfield", "id": "5953771"}, "comment": "/* Reign */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox monarch\n|name            =Abbas II Helmy\n|succession      =[[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]<br>[[File:Coat of arms of the Egyptian Kingdom 2.png|40px]]\n|image           = Abbas Helmi II (military).JPG\n|caption         = Portrait of Abbas Helmy II\n|reign           = 8 January 1892&nbsp;\u2013 19(20)(21) December 1914\n|predecessor     =[[Tewfik Pasha]]\n|successor       =[[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] ([[Sultan of Egypt]])<br>[[Khedivate of Egypt|Khedivate]] Abolished\n|spouse          =[[Ikbal Hanem]]<br/>[[Marianna T\u00f6r\u00f6k]]\n|issue           =Princess Emine Helmy<br/>Princess Atiye Helmy<br/>Princess Fethiye Helmy<br/>[[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim]]<br/>Princess Lutfiya Shavkat<br/>Prince Muhammed Abdel Kader\n|dynasty         =[[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Muhammad Ali]]\n|father          =[[Tewfik Pasha]]\n|mother          =[[Emina Ilhamy]]\n|birth_date      ={{birth-date|14 July 1874}}\n|birth_place     =[[Alexandria]], [[Khedivate of Egypt]]<ref>{{harvnb|Rockwood|2007|p=2}}</ref>\n|death_date      ={{Death date and age|1944|12|19|1874|7|14|df=y}}\n|death_place     =[[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]\n|burial_place    =[[Qubbat Afandina]], [[Cairo]]\n|}}\n\n'''Abbas II Helmy Bey''' (also known as ''\u2018Abb\u0101s \u1e24ilm\u012b [[Pasha]]'', {{lang-ar|<big>\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u062d\u0644\u0645\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627</big>}}) (14 July 1874&nbsp;\u2013 19 December 1944) was the last [[Khedive]] ([[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] viceroy) of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]], ruling from 8 January 1892 to 19 December 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Thorne|1984|p=1}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|name=death|Sources give different dates for the deposition of Abbas.

He gave his formal approval for the establishment of a sound system of justice for Egyptian nationals, a great reduction in taxation, increased affordable and sound education, the inauguration of the substantial irrigation works such as the [[Aswan Low Dam]] and the [[Assiut Barrage]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1896-99|reconquest of Sudan]].<ref name=Colliers/> He displayed more interest in [[agriculture]] than in statecraft.

He married the Princess [[Ikbal Hanem]] and had several children.

He developed a reputation as a military commander during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813]] and the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828]] with neighbouring [[Imperial Russia]], as well as through the [[Ottoman-Persian War (1821-1823)|Ottoman-Persian War of 1821-1823]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He is furthermore noted as an early modernizer of [[Persia]]'s armed forces and institutions, and for his death before his father, [[Fath Ali Shah]]. Abbas was an intelligent prince, possessed some literary taste, and is noteworthy on account of the comparative simplicity of his life.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abbas Mirza|volume=1|page=10}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, with Abbas Mirza as the military commander of the Persian forces, Iran lost all of its territories in the [[Caucasus]] comprising [[Transcaucasia]] and parts of the [[North Caucasus]] ([[Dagestan]]) to Russia in conformity with the 1813 [[Treaty of Gulistan]] and the 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], following the outcomes of the 1804\u20131813 and 1826\u20131828 wars.\n\n==Biography==\nAbbas Mirza was born on August 20, 1789 in Nava, [[Mazandaran]]. He was a younger son of [[Fath Ali Shah]], but on account of his mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed him.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Considered the favorite son by his father,<ref name=mag>{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990|p=2}}</ref> he was named governor (''beglarbeg'') of the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] region of [[Persia]], in approximately 1798, when he was 10 years old.<ref name=EB/>{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} In 1801, three years after [[Agha Mohammad Khan]]'s death, the Russians capitalized on the moment, and annexed [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti|Kartli-Kakheti]]. As (Eastern) Georgia had been under intermittent Iranian suzerainty since the early 16th century, this act by the Russians was seen as intrusion into Iranian territory. In 1804, eager to take the rest of Iran's territories, the Russian army led by general [[Pavel Tsitsianov]], [[Battle of Ganja (1804)|besieged, captured and sacked]] the city of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], thereby initiating the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u201313)]]. Fath-Ali Shah appointed Abbas Mirza as commander of the expeditionary force of 30,000 men.<ref name=EB/>{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} His aid was eagerly solicited by both England and [[Napoleon]], anxious to checkmate one another in the East,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> especially as Persia bordered a common rival, namely Imperial Russia. Preferring the friendship of France, Abbas Mirza continued the war against Russia's young [[General Kotlyarevsky]], aged only twenty-nine but his new ally could give him very little assistance.<ref>Hopkirk, pp.60-3</ref>\n\nThe early stages of the war following Fath Ali Shah's orders to invade and regain Georgia and the northern parts of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic ended up in years of relatively territorial stale warfare. However, as Prof. [[Alexander Mikaberidze]] adds, Abbas Mirza led the army in an overall disastrous campaign against the Russians, suffering defeats at [[Gyumri]], [[Kalagiri]], the [[Zagam River]] (1805), [[Karakapet]] (1806), [[Qarababa, Nakhchivan|Karababa]] (1808), [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] (1809), [[Meghri]], the [[Aras River]], and [[Akhalkalaki]] (1810).{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} The tide started to decisively turn as Russia was sending more and more advanced weaponry and increasing numbers of soldiers.  Commanding the southernmost Russian divisions during the long war, Kotlyarevsky defeated the numerically superior Persian army in the [[Battle of Aslanduz]] (1812) and in early 1813 [[Storming of Lankaran|stormed and took Lankaran]].  The Russians were encamped on the opposite bank of River Aras when his two British advisers Capt Christie and Lt Pottinger told him to post sentry pickets in short order, but Mirza ignored the warnings.  Christie and other British officers tried to rally an army retreating in panic; for days the Russians launched fierce assaults, but at last Christie fell, and Mirza ordered a full retreat.  Complacency cost 10,000 Persian lives; Mirza believing wrongly in the weight of superior numbers.  In spite of the absence of leadership, The Persians at Lenkoran held out for weeks, until breaking through the Russians slaughtered the garrison of 4,000 officers and men.\n\nIn October 1813, with Abbas Mirza still commander-in-chief, Persia was compelled to make a severely disadvantageous peace known as the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], irrevocably ceding swaths of its territory in the [[Caucasus]], comprising present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], and most of what most recently became the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].<ref>Timothy C.

Tabriz also saw a gunpowder factory and a munitions depot. The training continued with constant drilling by British advisers, with a focus on the infantry and artillery.<ref name=EB/>\n\nHe received his opportunity to test his newly reformed military when the [[Ottoman\u2013Persian War (1821\u20131823)]] began, and they proved themselves adept with several victories. This resulted in a peace treaty signed in 1823 after the [[Battle of Erzurum (1821)|Battle of Erzurum]]. The war was a victory for Persia, especially considering they were outnumbered, and this gave much needed confidence to his forces. His [[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828|second war with Russia]], which began in 1826, started off on a good note as he won back most of the territory lost in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u201313)]]; however it ended in a string of costly defeats after which Persia was forced to cede the last of its Caucasian territories, comprising all of what is modern day [[Armenia]], [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchivan]], the rest of the remainder of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic that was still in Iranian hands, and [[Igdir Province]], all conform the 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]].<ref>Timothy C.

As archbishop, he defended the [[apostolic succession]] of the Anglican archbishops and bishops and the validity of the Church's priesthood in 1614. In consequence of the [[Nag's Head Fable]], the archbishop invited certain Roman Catholics to inspect the register in the presence of six of his own episcopal colleagues, the details of which inspection were preserved. It was agreed by all parties that:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The register agrees in every particular with what we know of the history of the times, and there exists not the semblance of a reason for pronouncing it a forgery.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | author=John Wordsworth, D.D., Bishop of Salisbury | title=A Letter on the Succession of Bishops in the Church of England | url=http://anglicanhistory.org/england/jwords/heykamp.html | date=13 May 1890 | accessdate=5 October 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn spite of his defence of the catholic nature of the priesthood, his [[Puritan]] instincts frequently led him not only into harsh treatment of Roman Catholics, but also into courageous resistance to the royal will, such as when he opposed the scandalous divorce suit of the Lady [[Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset|Frances Howard]] against the [[Earl of Essex]], and again in 1618 when, at [[Croydon]], he forbade the reading of the [[Declaration of Sports]] listing the permitted Sunday recreations.\nHe was naturally, therefore, a promoter of the match between the king's daughter, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]], and [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], and a firm opponent of the projected marriage of the new Prince of Wales (later [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) and the Spanish Infanta, [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]].

His refusal to license the [[assize sermon]] preached by Dr [[Robert Sibthorp]] at [[Northampton]] on 22 February 1627, in which cheerful obedience was urged to the king's demand for a general loan, and the duty proclaimed of absolute non-resistance even to the most arbitrary royal commands, led Charles to deprive him of his functions as [[primate (bishop)|primate]], putting them in commission. The need of summoning parliament, however, soon brought about a nominal restoration of the Archbishop's powers. His presence being unwelcome at court, he lived from that time in retirement, leaving Laud and his party in undisputed ascendancy.\nHe died at Croydon on 5 August 1633, and was buried at Guildford, his native place, where he had endowed a hospital with lands to the value of \u00a3300 a year.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:g abbot.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Abbot statue at [[Guildford]]]]\n\nAbbot was a conscientious [[prelate]], though narrow in view and often harsh towards both separatists and Roman Catholics.

The software may generate two types of revenue: one is for the display of the advertisement and another on a \"[[pay-per-click]]\" basis, if the user clicks on the advertisement. The software may implement advertisements in a variety of ways, including a static box display, a banner display, full screen, a [[video]], [[pop-up ad]] or in some other form.\n\nSome software developers offer their software free of charge, and rely on revenue from advertising to recoup their expenses and generate income. Some also offer a version of the software at a fee without advertising.\n\nThe software's functions may be designed to analyze the user's location and which Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there.

[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] captured it in 89 BC by setting on fire the wooden breastwork by which it was defended, and sacked it. It quickly recovered, new fortifications were erected, and it became a ''[[municipium]]''. [[Hadrian]], who repaired the Via Appia from Beneventum to this point, made it a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]''. With the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasion of Italy it was annexed to the [[Duchy of Benevento]], but was captured and destroyed by [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Constans II]] in 663 and never recovered, being reduced to a small hamlet known as Quintodecimo, a name that referred to its distance of 15 miles from Benevento.<ref name=Princeton/><ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Bishopric ==\nAeclanum became a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[episcopal see]], whose best known [[bishop]] was [[Julian of Eclanum]], who was consecrated by [[Pope Innocent I]] in about 417. He refused to sign the condemnation of [[Pelagianism]] issued by Pope Innocent's successor, [[Pope Zosimus]], and carried on a war of writings against [[Augustine of Hippo]]. It has been thought that the diocese was united to that of [[Frigento|Frequentium]] as early as the 5th century, but there is mention of Quintodecimo as a [[suffragan]] see of Benevento in 969 and 1058. From 1059 it was definitively united with Frequentium.<ref>Giuseppe Cappelletti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JdUCAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA180 ''Le Chiese d'Italia dalla loro origine sino ai nostri giorni''], Venezia 1864, vol.

The word ''aedicula'' is the [[diminutive]] of the [[Latin]] ''[[aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', a temple building.\n\nMany aediculae were household [[shrine]]s that held small [[altar]]s or [[statue]]s of the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]].<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aedicula|volume=1|page=244}}</ref> The Lares were [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] protecting the house and the family household gods. The Penates were originally [[patron gods]] (really [[genius (mythology)|genii]]) of the storeroom, later becoming household gods guarding the entire house.\n\nOther aediculae were small shrines within larger [[temple]]s, usually set on a base, surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns. In Roman architecture the aedicula has this representative function in the society. They are installed in public buildings like the [[Triumphal arch]], [[City gate]], or [[Therm]]es. The [[Celsus]] Library in [[Ephesus]] (2. c. AD) is a good example. From the 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire onwards such shrines, or the framework enclosing them, are often called by the Biblical term [[tabernacle]], which becomes extended to any elaborated framework for a niche, window or picture.\n\n==Gothic aediculae==\nAs in [[Classical architecture]], in [[Gothic architecture]], too, an aedicule or  tabernacle frame is a structural framing device that gives importance to its contents, whether an inscribed plaque, a [[cult object]], a bust or the like, by assuming the tectonic vocabulary of a little building that sets it apart from the wall against which it is placed. A tabernacle frame on a wall serves similar hieratic functions as a free-standing, three-dimensional architectural [[baldaquin]] or a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over an [[altar]].\n\nIn Late Gothic settings, [[altarpiece]]s and [[devotional image]]s were customarily crowned with [[gable]]s and canopies supported by clustered-column piers, echoing in small the architecture of Gothic churches.  Painted \u00e6dicules frame figures from sacred history in initial letters of [[illuminated manuscript]]s.\n\n==Renaissance aediculae==\n[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi finestre inginocchiate.JPG|thumb|Two \"tabernacle windows\" in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence.  These are of the type known as \"inginocchiata\", \"kneeling\" on two brackets.]] \nClassicizing architectonic structure and decor ''all'antica'', in the \"ancient [Roman] mode\", became a fashionable way to frame a painted or bas-relief portrait, or protect an expensive and precious mirror<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fram/ho_1975.1.1638.htm Metropolitan Museum: tabernacle frame, Florence, ca 1510]</ref> during the [[High Renaissance]]; Italian precedents were imitated in France, then in Spain, England and Germany during the later 16th century.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/tabernacleinfo.shtm National Gallery of Art: Tabernacle frames from the Samuel H. Kress collection]</ref>\n\n==Post-Renaissance classicism==\nAedicular door surrounds that are architecturally treated, with pilasters or columns flanking the doorway and an [[entablature]] even with a [[pediment]] over it came into use with the 16th century.

The Aedui, like other powerful tribes in the region (the [[Arverni]], the [[Sequani]], and the [[Helvetii]]), had replaced their monarchy with a council of magistrates called grand-judges.  The grand-judges were under the authority of the senate.  The senate was made up of the descendants of ancient royal families. Free men in the tribes were [[vassals]] to the heads of these families in exchange for military, financial and political interests.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malleson|first1=G.B.|title=Vercingetorix|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|date=1889|volume=4|pages=1\u201340|doi=10.2307/3678158}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Livy]] (v. 34), they took part in the expedition of [[Bellovesus]] into Italy in the 6th century BC.\n\nBefore [[Julius Caesar]]'s time, they had attached themselves to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people.<ref>{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 33}}.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Sequani]], their hereditary rivals, with the assistance of a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] chieftain named [[Ariovistus]], defeated and massacred the Aedui at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]], the Aedui sent [[Diviciacus (Aedui)|Diviciacus]], the [[Druidry|druid]], to Rome to appeal to the [[Roman Senate|senate]] for help, but his mission was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn his arrival in [[Gaul]] (58 BC), Caesar restored their independence. In spite of this, the Aedui joined the Gallic coalition against Caesar (''B. G.'' vii. 42), but after the surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] at the [[Battle of Alesia]], were glad to return to their allegiance. [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] dismantled{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} their native capital [[Bibracte]] on [[Mont Beuvray]] and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name, Augustodunum (modern [[Autun]]).\n\nIn 21, during the reign of [[Tiberius]], they revolted under [[Julius Sacrovir]], and seized [[Augustodunum]], but they were soon put down by Gaius Silius ([[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' iii. 43-46). The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor [[Claudius]] the distinction of ''[[jus honorum]]'', thus being the first Gauls permitted to become senators.<ref name=\"test\">Peoples, Nations and Cultures. General Editor Prof John Mackenzie. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. 2005.</ref>\n\nThe oration of [[Eumenius]], in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected. The chief magistrate of the Aedui in Caesar's time was called [[Vergobret]]us (according to [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], \"judgment-worker\"), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier. Certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the Aedui.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIt is possible that the Aedui adopted many of the governmental practices of the Romans, such as electing magistrates and other officials or perhaps it was a natural development in their political system. It is thought that other Celtic tribes, such as the Remi and the Baiocasses, also elected their leaders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of peoples of Gaul]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* \n* {{cite book |first=Julius |last=Caesar |authorlink=Julius Caesar |title=[[De Bello Gallico]] |ref=CITEREFCaesarBG}}\n* {{cite book |author=Strabo |authorlink=Strabo |title=Geography |ref=CITEREFStraboGeography}}\n*A.

There are three distinct but communicating and interacting geographic regions covered by this term: [[Crete]], the [[Cyclades]] and the Greek mainland. Crete is associated with the [[Minoan civilization]] from the Early Bronze Age. The Cyclades converge with the mainland during the [[Early Helladic]] (\"[[Minyans|Minyan]]\") period and with Crete in the Middle Minoan period. From ca. 1450 BC (Late Helladic, Late Minoan), the Greek [[Mycenaean civilization]] spreads to Crete.\n\n==Periodization==\n\n===Mainland===\n{{Main|Helladic period}}\n* Early Helladic (EH): 3200/3100\u20132050/2001 BC\n* Middle Helladic (MH): 2000/1900\u20131550 BC\n* Late Helladic (LH): 1550\u20131050 BC\n\n===Crete===\n{{Main|Minoan civilization}}\n*Early Minoan (EM): 3650\u20132160 BC\n*Middle Minoan (MM): 2160\u20131600 BC\n*Late Minoan (LM): 1600\u20131170 BC\n\n===Cyclades===\n{{Main|Cycladic civilization}}\n*Early Cycladic (EC): 3300\u20132000 BC\n*Kastri (EH II\u2013EH III): ca. 2500\u20132100 BC\n*Convergence with MM from ca. 2000 BC\n\n==Commerce==\nCommerce was practiced to some extent in very early times, as is proved by the distribution of [[Melos|Melian]] [[obsidian]] over all the Aegean area. We find Cretan vessels exported to [[Melos]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Greece|Greek]] mainland. Melian vases came in their turn to Crete. After 1600 BC there is very close commerce with Egypt, and Aegean things find their way to all coasts of the Mediterranean. No traces of [[currency]] have come to light, unless certain axeheads, too slight for practical use, had that character. Standard weights have been found, as well as representations of ingots. The Aegean written documents have not yet proved (by being found outside the area) to be [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] (letter writing) correspondence with other countries. Representations of ships are not common, but several have been observed on Aegean gems, gem-sealings, [[frying pans]] and vases. They are vessels of low free-board, with [[mast (sailing)|masts]] and [[oar]]s. Familiarity with the sea is proved by the free use of marine motifs in decoration.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=247}} The most detailed illustrations are to be found on the 'ship fresco' at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of Thera (Santorini) preserved by the ash fall from the volcanic eruption which destroyed the town there.\n\nDiscoveries, later in the 20th century, of sunken trading vessels such as those at [[Uluburun]] and [[Cape Gelidonya]] off the south coast of Turkey have brought forth an enormous amount of new information about that culture.\n\n==Evidence==\nFor details of monumental evidence the articles on [[Crete]], [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]], [[Troad]], [[Cyprus]], etc., must be consulted. The most representative site explored up to now is [[Knossos]] (see [[Crete]]) which has yielded not only the most various but the most continuous evidence from the [[Neolithic age]] to the twilight of classical civilization.

There are also possible [[linguistics|linguistic]] and even physical survivals to be considered.\n[[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] are the two principal sites on which evidence of a prehistoric civilization was remarked long ago by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}\n\n==Discovery==\nThe curtain-wall and towers of the Mycenaean [[citadel]], its [[Lion Gate|gate with heraldic lions]], and the great \"[[Treasury of Atreus]]\" had borne silent witness for ages before [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s time; but they were supposed only to speak to the [[Homer]]ic, or, at farthest, a rude Heroic beginning of purely [[History of Greece|Hellenic]] civilization. It was not until Schliemann exposed the contents of the graves which lay just inside the gate, that scholars recognized the advanced stage of [[art]] which prehistoric dwellers in the Mycenaean citadel had attained.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}\n\nThere had been, however, a good deal of other evidence available before 1876, which, had it been collated and seriously studied, might have discounted the sensation that the discovery of the citadel graves eventually made. Although it was recognized that certain tributaries, represented for example, in the XVIIIth Dynasty tomb of Rekhmara at [[Egypt]]ian [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as bearing vases of peculiar forms, were of some [[Mediterranean]] race, neither their precise habitat nor the degree of their civilization could be determined while so few actual prehistoric remains were known in the [[Mediterranean]] lands. Nor did the Aegean objects which were lying obscurely in museums in 1870, or thereabouts, provide a sufficient test of the real basis underlying the Hellenic myths of the [[Argos|Argolid]], the [[Troad]] and [[Crete]], to cause these to be taken seriously. Aegean vases have been exhibited both at [[S\u00e8vres]] and [[Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuchatel]] since about 1840, the provenance (i.e. source or origin) being in the one case Phylakope in [[Milos|Melos]], in the other [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}\n\nLudwig Ross, the [[Germany|German]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] appointed Curator of the Antiquities of [[History of Athens|Athens]] at the time of the establishment of the Kingdom of [[Greece]], by his explorations in the Greek islands from 1835 onwards, called attention to certain early [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]]s, since known as Inselsteine; but it was not until 1878 that C. T. Newton demonstrated these to be no strayed [[Phoenicia]]n products. In 1866 primitive structures were discovered on the island of Therasia by quarrymen extracting pozzolana, a [[Silicon dioxide|siliceous]] [[volcanic ash]], for the [[Suez Canal]] works. When this discovery was followed up in 1870, on the neighbouring [[Santorini|Santorini (Thera)]], by representatives of the French School at [[Athens]], much pottery of a class now known immediately to precede the typical late Aegean ware, and many stone and metal objects, were found. These were dated by the [[geologist]] Ferdinand A. Fouqu\u00e9, somewhat arbitrarily, to 2000 BC, by consideration of the superincumbent eruptive stratum.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}\n\nMeanwhile, in 1868, tombs at [[Ialysus]] in [[Rhodes]] had yielded to [[Alfred Biliotti]] many fine painted vases of styles which were called later the third and fourth \"Mycenaean\"; but these, bought by [[John Ruskin]], and presented to the [[British Museum]], excited less attention than they deserved, being supposed to be of some local Asiatic fabric of uncertain date. Nor was a connection immediately detected between them and the objects found four years later in a tomb at Menidi in [[Attica]] and a rock-cut \"bee-hive\" grave near the Argive Heraeum.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}\n\nEven Schliemann's first [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s at Hissarlik in the [[Troad]] did not excite surprise. But the \"Burnt City\" of his second stratum, revealed in 1873, with its fortifications and vases, and a hoard of [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[bronze]] objects, which the discoverer connected with it, began to arouse a curiosity which was destined presently to spread far outside the narrow circle of scholars. As soon as Schliemann came on the Mycenae graves three years later, light poured from all sides on the prehistoric period of [[Greece]]. It was recognized that the character of both the fabric and the decoration of the Mycenaean objects was not that of any well-known art. A wide range in space was proved by the identification of the Inselsteine and the Ialysus vases with the new style, and a wide range in time by collation of the earlier Theraean and Hissarlik discoveries. A relationship between objects of art described by [[Homer]] and the Mycenaean treasure was generally allowed, and a correct opinion prevailed that, while certainly posterior, the civilization of the [[Iliad]] was reminiscent of the Mycenaean.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}\n\nSchliemann got to work again at Hissarlik in 1878, and greatly increased our knowledge of the lower strata, but did not recognize the Aegean remains in his \"Lydian\" city of the sixth stratum. These were not to be fully revealed until Dr. Wilhelm Dorpfeld, who had become Schliemann's assistant in 1879, resumed the work at Hissarlik in 1892 after the first explorer's death. But by laying bare in 1884 the upper stratum of remains on the rock of [[Tiryns]], Schliemann made a contribution to our knowledge of prehistoric domestic life which was amplified two years later by Christos Tsountas's discovery of the palace at Mycenae. Schliemann's work at Tiryns was not resumed till 1905, when it was proved, as had long been suspected, that an earlier palace underlies the one he had exposed.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}\n\nFrom 1886 dates the finding of Mycenaean [[sepulchre]]s outside the Argolid, from which, and from the continuation of Tsountas's exploration of the buildings and lesser graves at Mycenae, a large treasure, independent of Schliemann's princely gift, has been gathered into the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens|National Museum]] at Athens. In that year tholos-tombs, most already pillaged but retaining some of their furniture, were excavated at Arkina and [[Eleusis]] in Attica, at [[Dimini]] near [[Volos]] in [[Thessaly]], at Kampos on the west of Mount [[Taygetus]], and at Maskarata in [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]]. The richest grave of all was explored at [[Vaphio]] in [[Laconia]] in 1889, and yielded, besides many gems and miscellaneous goldsmiths' work, two golden goblets chased with scenes of bull-hunting, and certain broken vases painted in a large bold style which remained an enigma until the excavation of [[Knossos]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}\n\nIn 1890 and 1893, Staes cleared out certain less rich tholos-tombs at Thoricus in [[Attica]]; and other graves, either rock-cut \"bee-hives\" or chambers, were found at Spata and Aphidna in Attica, in [[Aegina]] and [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], at the [[Heraion of Argos|Argive Heraeum]] and [[Nafplion|Nauplia]] in the Argolid, near [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Delphi]], and not far from the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[Larissa]]. During the [[Acropolis]] excavations in Athens, which terminated in 1888, many potsherds of the Mycenaean style were found; but Olympia had yielded either none, or such as had not been recognized before being thrown away, and the temple site at [[Delphi]] produced nothing distinctively Aegean (in dating). The [[United States|American]] explorations of the Argive Heraeum, concluded in 1895, also failed to prove that site to have been important in the prehistoric time, though, as was to be expected from its neighbourhood to Mycenae itself, there were traces of occupation in the later Aegean periods.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|pp=245-246}}\n\nPrehistoric research had now begun to extend beyond the Greek mainland. Certain central Aegean islands, [[Antiparos]], [[Ios Island|Ios]], [[Amorgos]], [[Syros]] and [[Siphnos]], were all found to be singularly rich in evidence of the Middle-Aegean period. The series of Syran-built graves, containing crouching corpses, is the best and most representative that is known in the Aegean. Melos, long marked as a source of early objects but not systematically excavated until taken in hand by the [[British School at Athens]] in 1896, yielded at Phylakope remains of all the Aegean periods, except the [[Neolithic]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}\n\nA map of [[Cyprus]] in the later [[Bronze Age]] (such as is given by J. L. Myres and M. O. Richter in Catalogue of the [[Cyprus]] Museum) shows more than 25 settlements in and about the Mesaorea district alone, of which one, that at [[Enkomi]], near the site of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], has yielded the richest Aegean treasure in precious metal found outside Mycenae. E. Chantre in 1894 picked up lustreless ware, like that of Hissariik, in central Phtygia and at Pteria, and the [[England|English]] archaeological expeditions, sent subsequently into north-western [[Anatolia]], have never failed to bring back ceramic specimens of Aegean appearance from the valleys of the Rhyndncus, Sangarius and Halys.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}\n\nIn [[Egypt]] in 1887, [[Flinders Petrie]] found painted sherds of Cretan style at [[El-Lahun|Kahun]] in the [[Al Fayyum|Fayum]], and farther up the [[Nile]], at [[Amarna|Tell el-Amarna]], chanced on bits of no fewer than 800 Aegean vases in 1889. There have now been recognized in the collections at [[Cairo]], [[Florence]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Bologna]] several Egyptian imitations of the Aegean style which can be set off against the many debts which the centres of Aegean culture owed to Egypt. Two Aegean vases were found at [[Sidon]] in 1885, and many fragments of Aegean and especially Cypriot pottery have been found during recent excavations of sites in [[Philistines|Philistia]] by the Palestine Fund.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}\n\n[[Sicily]], ever since P. Orsi excavated the Sicel cemetery near Lentini in 1877, has proved a mine of early remains, among which appear in regular succession Aegean fabrics and motives of decoration from the period of the second stratum at Hissarlik. Sardinia has Aegean sites, for example, at Abini near Teti; and [[Spain]] has yielded objects recognized as Aegean from tombs near [[C\u00e1diz|Cadiz]] and from [[Zaragoza, Spain|Saragossa]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}\n\nOne land, however, has eclipsed all others in the Aegean by the wealth of its remains of all the prehistoric ages&mdash; Crete; and so much so that, for the present, we must regard it as the fountainhead of Aegean civilization, and probably for long its political and social centre. The island first attracted the notice of archaeologists by the remarkable archaic Greek bronzes found in a cave on [[Mount Ida]] in 1885, as well as by [[epigraph (archeology)|epigraph]]ic [[monument]]s such as the famous law of Gortyna (also called [[Gortyn]]). But the first undoubted Aegean remains reported from it were a few objects extracted from Cnossus by Minos Kalokhairinos of Candia in 1878. These were followed by certain discoveries made in the S. plain Messara by F. Halbherr. Unsuccessful attempts at Cnossus were made by both W. J. Stillman and H. Schliemann, and A. J. Evans, coming on the scene in 1893, travelled in succeeding years about the island picking up trifles of unconsidered evidence, which gradually convinced him that greater things would eventually be found. He obtained enough to enable him to forecast the discovery of written characters, till then not suspected in Aegean civilization. The revolution of 1897\u20131898 opened the door to wider knowledge, and much exploration has ensued, for which see [[Crete]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}\n\nThus the \"Aegean Area\" has now come to mean the [[Archipelago]] with Crete and [[Cyprus]], the Hellenic peninsula with the [[Ionian islands]], and Western [[Anatolia]]. Evidence is still wanting for the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] and [[Thrace|Thracian]] coasts. Offshoots are found in the western [[Mediterranean]] area, in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Spain]], and in the eastern Mediterranean area in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. Regarding the [[Cyrenaica]], we are still insufficiently informed.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}\n\n==Fall==\nAbout 1000 BC there happened a final catastrophe. The palace at Knossus was once more destroyed, and never rebuilt or re-inhabited. Iron took the place of Bronze, and Aegean art, as a living thing, ceased on the Greek mainland and in the Aegean isles including Crete, together with Aegean writing. In Cyprus, and perhaps on the south-west Anatolian coasts, there is some reason to think that the cataclysm was less complete, and Aegean art continued to languish, cut off from its fountain-head. Such artistic faculty as survived elsewhere issued in the lifeless geometric style which is reminiscent of the later Aegean, but wholly unworthy of it. Cremation took the place of burial of the dead. This great disaster, which cleared the ground for a new growth of local art, was probably due to yet another incursion of northern tribes, possessed of superior iron weapons{{mdash}}those tribes which later Greek tradition and Homer knew as the [[Dorians]]. They crushed a civilization already hard hit; and it took two or three centuries for the artistic spirit, instinct in the Aegean area, and probably preserved in suspended animation by the survival of Aegean racial elements, to blossom anew. On this conquest seems to have ensued a long period of unrest and popular movements, known to Greek tradition as the Ionian Migration and the Aeolic and Dorian \"colonizations\", and when once more we see the Aegean area clearly, it is dominated by [[Greeks|Hellenes]], though it has not lost all memory of its earlier culture.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=251}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mycenaean Greece]]\n* [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Aegean Civilization|volume=1|pages=245\u2013251|first=David George|last= Hogarth|authorlink=David George Hogarth}} This includes many illustrations, and a more intensive history of the civilizations, as understood in the early 20th century.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090101104332/http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/index.html Jeremy B.

They divided the government in four and Aegeus became king.\nAegeus' first wife was Meta,<ref>Compare [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]].</ref> and his second wife was [[Chalciope]]. Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the [[Pythia|oracle]] at [[Delphi]] for advice.

Before leaving, he buried his sandal, shield, and sword under a huge rock and told her that, when their son grew up, he should move the rock and bring the weapons to his father, who would acknowledge him. Upon his return to Athens, Aegeus married [[Medea]], who had fled from [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and the wrath of [[Jason]]. Aegeus and Medea had one son named [[Medus]].\n\n===Conflict with Crete===\nWhile visiting in Athens, King [[Minos]]' son, [[Androgeus (son of Minos)|Androgeus]] managed to defeat Aegeus in every contest during the [[Panathenaic Games]].

The identification of the festival as the [[Panathenaia]] is an interpolated anachronism.</ref> Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace, however, under the condition that Athens would send [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur|seven young men and seven young women]] every nine years to [[Crete]] to be fed to the [[Minotaur]], a vicious monster. This continued until [[Theseus]] killed the [[Minotaur]] with the help of [[Ariadne]], Minos' daughter.[[Image:Krater Warrior BM F158.jpg|thumb|249x249px|''Arrival or departure of a young warrior or hero, maybe [[Theseus]] arriving at [[Athens]] and being recognized because of his sword by Aegeus''.

He managed to move the rock and took his father's weapons. His mother then told him the identity of his father and that he should take the weapons back to him at Athens and be acknowledged. Theseus decided to go to Athens and had the choice of going by sea, which was the safe way, or by land, following a dangerous path with thieves and bandits all the way. Young, brave and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land.\n\nWhen Theseus arrived, he did not reveal his true identity. He was welcomed by Aegeus, who was suspicious about the stranger who came to Athens. Medea tried to have Theseus killed by encouraging Aegeus to ask him to capture the [[Marathonian Bull]], but Theseus succeeded. She tried to poison him, but at the last second, Aegeus recognized his son and knocked the poisoned cup out of Theseus' hand. Father and son were thus reunited, and Medea was sent away to [[Asia]].<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, Epitome of the ''[[Bibliotheke]]'', 1.5\u20137; [[First Vatican Mythographer]], 48.</ref>\n\nTheseus departed for Crete.  Upon his departure, Aegeus told him to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the Minotaur. However, when Theseus returned, he forgot these instructions.

The fact that the Aeginetic standard of weights and measures (developed during the mid-7th century) was one of the two standards in general use in the Greek world (the other being the Euboic-Attic) is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The Aeginetic weight standard of about 12.3 grams was widely adopted in the Greek world during the 7th century BC. The Aeginetic stater was divided into three drachmae of 4.1 grams of silver. Staters depicting a sea-turtle were struck up to the end of the 5th century BC. Following the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]], 404&nbsp;BC, it was replaced by the land [[tortoise]].\n\nDuring the naval expansion of Aegina during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]], Kydonia was an ideal maritime stop for Aegina's fleet on its way to other [[Mediterranean]] ports controlled by the emerging sea-power Aegina.<ref>[http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes C. Michael Hogan, ''Cydonia'', Modern Antiquarian, January 23, 2008]</ref> During the next century Aegina was one of the three principal states trading at the [[Marketplace|emporium]] of [[Naucratis]] in Egypt, and it was the only Greek state near Europe that had a share in this factory.<ref>Herodotus ii. 178</ref> At the beginning of the 5th century BC it seems to have been an entrep\u00f4t of the [[Black Sea|Pontic]] grain trade, which, at a later date, became an Athenian monopoly.<ref>Herodotus vii. 147</ref>\n\nUnlike the other commercial states of the 7th and 6th centuries BC, such as [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Chalcis]], [[Eretria]] and [[Miletus]], Aegina did not found any colonies. The settlements to which Strabo refers (viii. 376) cannot be regarded as any real exceptions to this statement.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Rivalry with Athens (5th century BC)===\nThe known history of Aegina is almost exclusively a history of its relations with the neighbouring state of Athens, which began to compete with the [[thalassocracy]] (sea power) of Aegina about the beginning of the 6th century BC. [[Solon]] passed laws limiting Aeginetan commerce in Attica. The legendary history of these relations, as recorded by Herodotus (v. 79\u201389; vi. 49\u201351, 73, 85\u201394), involves critical problems of some difficulty and interest. He traces the hostility of the two states back to a dispute about the images of the goddesses [[Damia (goddess)|Damia]] and [[Auxesia]], which the Aeginetes had carried off from [[Epidaurus|Epidauros]], their parent state.\n\nThe Epidaurians had been accustomed to make annual offerings to the Athenian deities [[Athena]] and [[Erechtheus]] in payment for the Athenian olive-wood of which the statues were made. Upon the refusal of the Aeginetes to continue these offerings, the [[Athenians]] endeavoured to carry away the images. Their design was frustrated miraculously \u2013 according to the Aeginetan version, the statues fell upon their knees \u2013 and only a single survivor returned to Athens. There he became victim to the fury of his comrades' widows who pierced him with their brooch-pins. No date is assigned by Herodotus for this \"old feud\"; recent writers, such as [[J. B. Bury]] and R. W. Macan, suggest the period between Solon and Peisistratus, {{circa|570 BC}}. It is possible that the whole episode is mythical. A critical analysis of the narrative seems to reveal little else than a series of aetiological traditions (explanatory of cults and customs), such as of the kneeling posture of the images of Damia and Auxesia, of the use of native ware instead of Athenian in their worship, and of the change in women's dress at Athens from the Dorian to the [[Ionia]]n style.\n\n[[File:Blouet Tr\u00e9zel Egine.JPG|thumb|Colour depiction of the [[Temple of Aphaea]], sacred to a mother goddess, particularly worshiped on Aegina.]]\n[[File:Temple of Aphaia in February 2005 14.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Aphaea.]]\n\nThe account which Herodotus gives of the hostilities between the two states during the early years of the 5th century BC is to the following effect. The [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebans]], after the defeat by Athens about 507&nbsp;BC, appealed to Aegina for assistance. The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the [[Aeacidae]], the [[tutelary deity|tutelary heroes]] of their island. Subsequently, however, they contracted an alliance, and ravaged the seaboard of Attica. The Athenians were preparing to make reprisals, in spite of the advice of the [[Delphic oracle]] that they should desist from attacking Aegina for thirty years, and content themselves meanwhile with dedicating a precinct to [[Aeacus]], when their projects were interrupted by the [[Sparta]]n intrigues for the restoration of [[Hippias]].\n\nIn 491&nbsp;BC Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (\"earth and water\") to [[Achaemenid Persia]]. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of [[medism]], and [[Cleomenes I]], one of the Spartan kings, crossed over to the island, to arrest those who were responsible for it. His attempt was at first unsuccessful; but, after the deposition of [[Demaratus]], he visited the island a second time, accompanied by his new colleague [[Leotychides]], seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.\n\nAfter the death of Cleomenes and the refusal of the Athenians to restore the hostages to Leotychides, the Aeginetes retaliated by seizing a number of Athenians at a festival at [[Sunium]]. Thereupon the Athenians concerted a plot with [[Nicodromus]], the leader of the democratic party in the island, for the betrayal of Aegina. He was to seize the old city, and they were to come to his aid on the same day with seventy vessels. The plot failed owing to the late arrival of the Athenian force, when Nicodromus had already fled the island. An engagement followed in which the Aeginetes were defeated. Subsequently, however, they succeeded in winning a victory over the Athenian fleet.\n\nAll the incidents subsequent to the appeal of Athens to Sparta are referred expressly by Herodotus to the interval between the sending of the heralds in 491&nbsp;BC and the invasion of [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes]] in 490&nbsp;BC (cf. Herod. vi. 49 with 94).\n\nThere are difficulties with this story, of which the following are the principal elements:\n* Herodotus nowhere states or implies that peace was concluded between the two states before 481&nbsp;BC, nor does he distinguish between different wars during this period. Hence it would follow that the war lasted from soon after 507&nbsp;BC until the congress at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in 481&nbsp;BC\n* It is only for two years (491 and 490&nbsp;BC) out of the twenty-five that any details are given. It is the more remarkable that no incidents are recorded in the period between the battles of [[battle of Marathon|Marathon]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], since at the time of the Isthmian Congress the war was described as the most important one then being waged in Greece,<ref>Herod. vii. 145</ref>\n* It is improbable that Athens would have sent twenty vessels to the aid of the Ionians in 499&nbsp;BC if at the time it was at war with Aegina.\n* There is an incidental indication of time, which indicates the period after Marathon as the true date for the events which are referred by Herodotus to the year before Marathon, viz. the thirty years that were to elapse between the dedication of the precinct to Aeacus and the final victory of Athens.<ref>Herod. v. 89</ref>\n[[File:Temple of Apollo Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the Temple of Apollo.]]\n\nAs the final victory of Athens over Aegina was in 458&nbsp;BC, the thirty years of the oracle would carry us back to the year 488&nbsp;BC as the date of the dedication of the precinct and the beginning of hostilities. This inference is supported by the date of the building of the 200 triremes \"for the war against Aegina\" on the advice of [[Themistocles]], which is given in the ''Constitution of Athens'' as 483\u2013482&nbsp;BC.<ref>Herod. vii. 144; [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Ath. Pol.]] r2. 7</ref> It is probable, therefore, that Herodotus is in error both in tracing back the beginning of hostilities to an alliance between Thebes and Aegina ({{circa|507 BC}}) and in claiming the episode of Nicodromus occurred prior to the battle of Marathon.\n\nOvertures were unquestionably made by Thebes for an alliance with Aegina {{circa|507 BC}}, but they came to nothing. The refusal of Aegina was in the diplomatic guise of \"sending the Aeacidae.\" The real occasion of the beginning of the war was the refusal of Athens to restore the hostages some twenty years later. There was but one war, and it lasted from 488 to 481&nbsp;BC. That Athens had the worst of it in this war is certain. Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.\n\nIt may be noted, in confirmation of this opinion, that the naval supremacy of Aegina is assigned by the ancient writers on chronology to precisely this period, i.e. the years 490\u2013480&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''Houston Chronicle''. Can. p.&nbsp;337</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nIn the repulse of [[Xerxes I]] it is possible that the Aeginetes played a larger part than is conceded to them by Herodotus. The Athenian tradition, which he follows in the main, would naturally seek to obscure their services. It was to Aegina rather than Athens that the prize of valour at Salamis was awarded, and the destruction of the Persian fleet appears to have been as much the work of the Aeginetan contingent as of the Athenian (Herod. viii. 91). There are other indications, too, of the importance of the Aeginetan fleet in the Greek scheme of defence. In view of these considerations it becomes difficult to credit the number of the vessels that is assigned to them by Herodotus (30 as against 180 Athenian vessels, cf. [[Greek History]], sect. Authorities). During the next twenty years the Philo-Laconian policy of [[Cimon]] secured Aegina, as a member of the Spartan league, from attack. The change in Athenian foreign policy, which was consequent upon the ostracism of Cimon in 461&nbsp;BC, resulted in what is sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, during which most of the fighting was experienced by Corinth and Aegina. The latter state was forced to surrender to Athens after a siege, and to accept the position of a subject-ally ({{circa|456 BC}}). The tribute was fixed at 30 talents.\n\nBy the terms of the [[Thirty Years' Peace]] (445&nbsp;BC) Athens promised to restore to Aegina her autonomy, but the clause remained ineffective. During the first winter of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431&nbsp;BC) Athens expelled the Aeginetans and established a [[cleruchy]] in their island. The exiles were settled by Sparta in [[Thyreatis]], on the frontiers of Laconia and Argolis. Even in their new home they were not safe from Athenian rancour. A force commanded by [[Nicias]] landed in 424&nbsp;BC, and killed most of them. At the end of the Peloponnesian War [[Lysander]] restored the scattered remnants of the old inhabitants to the island, <ref name=Xenophon229>Xenophon. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D9 ''Hellenica'', 2.2.9]: \"Meantime Lysander, upon reaching Aegina, restored the state to the Aeginetans, gathering together as many of them as he could, and he did the same thing for the Melians also and for all the others who had been deprived of their native states.\"</ref><ref name=Plutarch144>Plutarch. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0048%3Achapter%3D14%3Asection%3D3 ''Life of Lysander'', 14.3]: \"But there were other measures of Lysander upon which all the Greeks looked with pleasure, when, for instance, the Aeginetans, after a long time, received back their own city, and when the Melians and Scionaeans were restored to their homes by him, after the Athenians had been driven out and had delivered back the cities.\"</ref> which was used by the Spartans as a base for operations against Athens during the [[Corinthian War]]. Its greatness, however, was at an end. The part which it plays henceforward is insignificant.\n\nIt would be a mistake to attribute the demise of Aegina solely to the development of the [[Athenian navy]]. It is probable that the power of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Salamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively to that of Athens. Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which seems to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with Persia. Aegina's medism in 491 is to be explained by its commercial relations with the Persian Empire. It was forced into patriotism in spite of itself, and the glory won by the [[battle of Salamis]] was paid for by the loss of its trade and the decay of its marine. The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state is explained by the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which was based on slave labour. It is impossible, indeed, to accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been much greater than that of the free inhabitants. In this respect the history of Aegina does but anticipate the history of Greece as a whole.\n\nThe constitutional history of Aegina is unusually simple. So long as the island retained its independence the government was an [[oligarchy]]. There is no trace of heroic monarchy and no tradition of a ''[[tyranny|tyrannis]]''. The story of Nicodromus, while it proves the existence of a democratic party, suggests, at the same time, that it could count upon little support.\n\n===Hellenistic period and Roman rule===\nAegina with the rest of Greece became dominated successively by the [[Macedon]]ians (322\u2013229 BC), the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]] (229\u2013211&nbsp;BC), [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]] (211\u2013210&nbsp; BC), [[Attalus I|Attalus of Pergamum]] (210\u2013133&nbsp;BC) and the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] (after 133&nbsp;BC).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> A sign at the Archaeological Museum of Aegina is reported to say that a [[Jew]]ish community is believed to have been established in Aegina \"at the end of the second and during the 3rd century AD\" by Jews fleeing the [[barbarian invasions]] of the time in Greece.<ref>{{Cite sign|title=Mosaic floor of a Jewish synagogue|medium=Sign |publisher=[[Archaeological Museum of Aegina]]|location=Aegina, Greece}}</ref> However, the first phases of those invasions began in the 4th century. Local Christian tradition has it that a Christian community was established there in the 1st century, having as its bishop Crispus, the ruler of the [[Corinth]]ian synagogue, who became a Christian,<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts of the Apostles|18:8|ESV}}</ref> and was baptised by [[Paul the Apostle]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|1:14|ESV}}</ref> There are written records of participation by later bishops of Aegina, Gabriel and Thomas, in the [[Council of Constantinople (869)|Councils of Constantinople in 869]] and [[Council of Constantinople (879)|879]].

It remained Eastern Roman during the period of crisis of the 7th\u20138th centuries, when most of the [[Balkans]] and the Greek mainland were overrun by [[Slavs|Slavic]] invasions. Indeed, according to the ''[[Chronicle of Monemvasia]]'', the island served as a refuge for the Corinthians fleeing these incursions.<ref name=\"ODB40\">Kazhdan (1991), p. 40</ref> The island flourished during the early 9th century, as evidenced by church construction activity, but suffered greatly from Arab raids originating from [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]]. Various [[hagiography|hagiographies]] record a large-scale raid {{circa|830}}, that resulted in the flight of much of the population to the Greek mainland. During that time, some of the population sought refuge in the island's hinterland, establishing the settlement of Palaia Chora.<ref name=\"ODB40\"/><ref>Christides (1981), pp. 87\u201389</ref>\n\nAccording to the 12th-century bishop of Athens, [[Michael Choniates]], by his time the island had become a base for pirates.<ref name=\"ODB40\"/> This is corroborated by [[Benedict of Peterborough]]'s graphic account of Greece, as it was in 1191; he states that many of the islands were uninhabited for fear of pirates and that Aegina, along with Salamis and [[Makronisos]], were their strongholds.\n\n===Frankish rule after 1204===\n{{Further|Frankokratia}}\nAfter the dissolution and partition of the Byzantine Empire by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, Aegina was accorded to the [[Republic of Venice]]. In the event, it became controlled by the [[Duchy of Athens]]. The [[Catalan Company]] seized control of Athens, and with it Aegina, in 1317, and in 1425 the island became controlled by the Venetians,<ref>Kazhdan (1991), pp. 40\u201341</ref> when Alioto Caopena, at that time ruler of Aegina, placed himself by treaty under the Republic's protection to escape the danger of a Turkish raid. The island must then have been fruitful, for one of the conditions by which Venice accorded him protection was that he should supply grain to Venetian colonies. He agreed to surrender the island to Venice if his family became extinct. [[Antonio II Acciaioli]] opposed the treaty for one of his adopted daughters had married the future lord of Aegina, Antonello Caopena.\n\n===Venetians in Aegina (1451\u20131537)===\n[[File:Markellos tower Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|The Venetian era Markellos tower]]\n\nIn 1451, Aegina became Venetian. The islanders welcomed Venetian rule; the claims of Antonello's uncle Arn\u00e0, who had lands in [[Argolis]], were satisfied by a pension. A Venetian governor (''rettore'') was appointed, who was dependent on the authorities of Nauplia. After Arn\u00e0's death, his son Alioto renewed his claim to the island but was told that the republic was resolved to keep it. He and his family were pensioned and one of them aided in the defence of Aegina against the Turks in 1537, was captured with his family, and died in a Turkish dungeon.\n\nIn 1463 the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u20131479)|Turco-Venetian war]] began, which was destined to cost the Venetians [[Euboea|Negroponte]] (Euboea), the island of Lemnos, most of the [[Cyclades]] islands, [[Shkodra|Scudra]] and their colonies in the [[Morea]]. Peace was concluded in 1479. Venice still retained Aegina, [[Naupactus|Lepanto]] (Naupactus), [[Nauplio|Nauplia]], [[Monemvasia]], [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], [[Koroni|Coron]], and the islands [[Crete]], [[Mykonos]] and [[Tinos]]. Aegina remained subject to Nauplia.\n\n====Administration====\nAegina obtained money for its defences by reluctantly sacrificing its cherished relic, the head of St. George, which had been carried there from Livadia by the Catalans. In 1462, the Venetian Senate ordered the relic to be removed to St. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice and on 12 November, it was transported from Aegina by Vettore Cappello, the famous Venetian commander. In return, the Senate gave the Aeginetes 100 [[ducat]]s apiece towards fortifying the island.\n\nIn 1519, the government was reformed. The system of having two rectors was found to result in frequent quarrels and the republic thenceforth sent out a single official styled Bailie and Captain, assisted by two [[councillor]]s, who performed the duties of [[camerlengo]] by turns. The Bailie's authority extended over the rector of Aegina, whereas [[Kastri, Cythera|Kastri]] (opposite the island [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]]) was granted to two families, the [[Palaiologoi]] and the [[Alberti (surname)|Alberti]].\n\nSociety at Nauplia was divided into three classes: nobles, citizens and plebeians, and it was customary for nobles alone to possess the much-coveted local offices, such as the judge of the inferior court and inspector of weights and measures. The populace now demanded its share and the home government ordered that at least one of the three inspectors should be a non-noble.\n\nAegina had always been exposed to the raids of [[Privateer|corsairs]] and had oppressive governors during these last 30&nbsp;years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not willing to go to this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. To spare the economy of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a [[bakshish]] to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the [[voivode]] who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.\n\n====16th century====\n[[File:Aegina - view 05.jpg|thumb|The ruins of Palaiochora. Walls, houses, and castle have been destroyed, only the chapels were restored.]]\nAfter the end of the Duchy of Athens and the [[principality of Achaia]], the only Latin possessions left on the mainland of Greece were the papal city of Monemvasia, the fortress of [[Vonitsa]], the Messenian stations Coron and Modon, Lepanto, Pteleon, Navarino, and the castles of Argos and Nauplia, to which the island of Aegina was subordinate.\n\nIn 1502\u201303, the new peace treaty left Venice with nothing but Cephalonia, Monemvasia and Nauplia, with their appurtenances in the Morea. And against the sack of Megara, it had to endure the temporary capture of the castle of Aegina by [[Kemal Reis]] and the abduction of 2000 inhabitants. This treaty was renewed in 1513 and 1521. All supplies of grain from Nauplia and Monemvasia had to be imported from Turkish possessions, while corsairs rendered dangerous all traffic by sea.\n\nIn 1537, sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] declared war upon Venice and his admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] devastated much of the [[Ionian Islands]], and in October invaded the island of Aegina. On the fourth day Palaiochora was captured, but the Latin church of St George was spared. Hayreddin Barbarossa had the adult male population massacred and took away 6,000 surviving women and children as slaves. Then Barbarossa sailed to Naxos, whence he carried off an immense booty, compelling the Duke of Naxos to purchase his further independence by paying a tribute of 5000 ducats.\n\nWith the peace of 1540, Venice ceded Nauplia and Monemvasia. For nearly 150&nbsp;years afterwards, Venice ruled no part of the mainland of Greece except Parga and Butrinto (subordinate politically to the Ionian Islands), but it still retained its insular dominions [[Cyprus]], Crete, [[Tenos]] and six Ionian islands.\n\n===First Ottoman period (1540\u20131687)===\nThe island was attacked and left desolate by [[Francesco Morosini]] during the [[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)|Cretan War]] (1654).\n\n===Second Venetian period (1687\u20131715)===\n[[File:Rottmann - Landschaft auf der Insel Aegina - 1845.jpeg|thumb|300px|Aegina in 1845, by [[Carl Rottmann]].]]\n\nIn 1684, the beginning of the [[Morean War]] between Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] resulted in the temporary reconquest of a large part of the country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6,000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3,000 inhabitants, two thirds of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to poverty to pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic began in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to send him a request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.\n\nIn 1699, thanks to English mediation, the war ended with the [[peace of Karlowitz]] by which Venice retained possession of the 7 Ionian islands as well as Butrinto and [[Parga]], the Morea, [[Spinalonga]] and [[Suda]], Tenos, [[Santa Maura]] and Aegina and ceased to pay a tribute for [[Zante]], but which restored Lepanto to the [[Ottoman sultan]]. [[Cerigo]] and Aegina were united administratively since the peace with Morea, which not only paid all the expenses of administration but furnished a substantial balance for the naval defence of Venice, in which it was directly interested.\n\n===Second Ottoman period (1715\u20131821)===\nDuring the early part of the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War of 1714\u20131718]] the Ottoman Fleet commanded by Canum Hoca captured Aegina. Ottomans rule in Aegina and the Morea was resumed and confirmed by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], and they retained control of the island with the exception of a brief Russian occupation [[Orlov Revolt]] (early 1770s), until the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821.\n\n===Greek Revolution===\nDuring the Greek War of Independence, Aegina became an administrative centre for the Greek revolutionary authorities.

She bore at least two children: [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]] by [[Actor (mythology)|Actor]], and [[Aeacus]] by the god [[Zeus]]. When Zeus abducted Aegina, he took her to [[Oenone]], an island close to [[Attica]]. Here, Aegina gave birth to Aeacus, who would later become king of Oenone; thenceforth, the island's name was Aegina.\n\nAegina was the gathering place of Myrmidons; in Aegina they gathered and trained. Zeus needed an elite army and at first thought that Aegina, which at the time did not have any villagers, was a good place. So he changed some ants ({{lang-grc|\u039c\u03c5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1}}, Myrmigia) into warriors who had six hands and wore black armour.

It had been interpreted as an animal skin or a [[shield]], sometimes bearing the head of a [[Gorgon]]. There may be a connection with a deity named [[Aex]] ''or Aix'', a daughter of [[Helios]] and a nurse of Zeus or alternatively a mistress of Zeus ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Astronomica'' 2. 13). The aegis of Athena is referred to in several places in the ''Iliad''. \"It produced a sound as from a [[myriad]] roaring dragons (''Iliad'', 4.17) and was borne by Athena in battle ... and among them went bright-eyed Athene, holding the precious aegis which is ageless and immortal: a hundred tassels of pure gold hang fluttering from it, tight-woven each of them, and each the worth of a hundred oxen.\"<ref>{{cite book|translator=Martin Hammond |date=1987 |orig-year= 1st pub. c. 735 B.C. |author= Homer |title=[[The Iliad]]|volume=2 |pages=446\u20139|publisher= Penguin Classics |isbn= 978-0-14044-444-5}}</ref>\n\nThe modern concept of doing something \"under someone's ''aegis''\" means doing something under the protection of a powerful, knowledgeable, or benevolent source.  The word ''aegis'' is identified with protection by a strong force with its roots in [[Greek mythology]] and adopted by the Romans; there are parallels in [[Norse mythology]] and in [[Egyptian mythology]] as well,{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for Norse and Egyptian mythology|date=December 2016}} where the Greek word ''aegis'' is applied by extension.\n\n==In Greek mythology==\nVirgil imagines the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] in Hephaestus' forge, who \"busily burnished the aegis Athena wears in her angry moods\u2014a fearsome thing with a surface of gold like scaly snake-skin, and the linked serpents and the [[Gorgon]] herself upon the goddess's breast\u2014a severed head rolling its eyes\",<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.435\u20138, (Day-Lewie's translation).</ref> furnished with golden tassels and bearing the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' ([[Medusa]]'s head) in the central boss. Some of the [[Attica|Attic]] vase-painters retained an archaic tradition that the tassels had originally been [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] in their representations of the aegis. When the Olympian deities overtook the older deities of Greece and she was born of [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] (inside [[Zeus]] who had swallowed the goddess) and \"re-born\" through the head of Zeus fully clothed, Athena already wore her typical garments.\n\nWhen the Olympian shakes the aegis, [[Mount Ida]] is wrapped in clouds, the thunder rolls and men are struck down with fear.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  \"Aegis-bearing Zeus\", as he is in the ''Iliad'', sometimes lends the fearsome aegis to [[Athena]]. In the ''Iliad'' when Zeus sends [[Apollo]] to revive the wounded [[Hector]], Apollo, holding the aegis, charges the Achaeans, pushing them back to their ships drawn up on the shore. According to [[Edith Hamilton]]'s ''Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes'',<ref>Part I, section I (Warner Books' United States Paperback Edition)</ref> the Aegis is the [[breastplate]] of [[Zeus]], and was \"awful to behold\". However, Zeus is normally portrayed in classical sculpture holding a thunderbolt or lightning, bearing neither a shield nor a breastplate.\n\n==In classical poetry and art==\n\n[[File:Douriscup 83d40m Athene aegisWingedLionessOwl pythonVomitsJason fleeceInTree Vatican.jpg|thumb|Athena's aegis, bearing the Gorgon, here resembles closely the skin of the great serpent who guards the golden fleece (regurgitating Jason); cup by Douris, Classical Greece, early fifth century BC\u2014[[Vatican Museums]]]]\n\n[[Classical Greece]] interpreted the Homeric aegis usually as a cover of some kind borne by Athena. It was supposed by [[Euripides]] (''Ion'', 995) that the aegis borne by Athena was the skin of the slain [[Gorgon]],<ref>Noted by Graves 1960, 9.a; [[K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951, p 50.</ref> yet the usual understanding<ref>As in Kerenyi 1951:50</ref>  is that the ''Gorgoneion'' was ''added'' to the aegis, a [[votive offering]] from a grateful [[Perseus]].\n\nIn a similar interpretation, Aex, a daughter of [[Helios]], represented as a great fire-breathing [[chthonic]] serpent similar to the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], was slain and flayed by [[Athena]], who afterwards wore its skin, the aegis, as a [[cuirass]] ([[Diodorus Siculus]] iii. 70),<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> or as a [[chlamys]]. The [[Douris (vase painter)|Douris cup]] shows that the aegis was represented exactly as the skin of the great serpent, with its scales clearly delineated.\n\n[[John Tzetzes]] says<ref>[[John Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron'', 355.</ref> that aegis was the skin of the monstrous giant [[Pallas (Giant)|Pallas]] whom Athena overcame and whose name she attached to her own.\n\nIn a late rendering by [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (''Poetical Astronomy'' ii. 13), Zeus is said to have used the skin of a pet [[goat]] owned by his nurse [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] (''aigis'' \"goat-skin\") which suckled him in [[Crete]], as a shield when he went forth to do battle against the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Image:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|left| First century BC [[mosaic]] of Alexander the Great wearing the aegis on the [[Alexander Mosaic]], [[Pompeii]] ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum]])]]\nThe aegis appears in works of art sometimes as an animal's skin thrown over Athena's shoulders and arms, occasionally with a border of snakes, usually also bearing the Gorgon head, the ''gorgoneion''. In some pottery it appears as a tasselled cover over Athena's dress.

Aegisthus murdered Atreus in order to restore his father to power, ruling jointly with him until only to be driven from power by Atreus' son [[Agamemnon]].\n\nWhile Agamemnon [[Trojan war|lay siege to Troy]], his estranged queen [[Clytemnestra]] took Aegisthus as a lover. The couple killed Agamemnon upon the king's return, making Aegisthus king of Mycenae once more.  Aegisthus ruled for seven more years before his death at the hands of Agamemnon's son [[Orestes]].\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Early life===\nThyestes felt he had been deprived of the [[Mycenae|Mycenean]] throne unfairly by his brother, [[Atreus]].  The two battled back and forth several times.  In addition, Thyestes had an affair with Atreus' wife, [[Aerope]]. In revenge, Atreus killed Thyestes' sons and served them to him unknowingly.  After realizing he had eaten his own sons' corpses, Thyestes asked an [[oracle]] how best to gain revenge.  The advice was to father a son with his own daughter, Pelopia, and that son would kill Atreus.\n\nThyestes raped Pelopia after she performed a sacrifice, hiding his identity from her. When Aegisthus was born, his mother [[Child abandonment|abandoned]] him, ashamed of his origin, and he was raised by shepherds and suckled by a goat, hence his name Aegisthus (from {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f34\u03be}}, male goat).<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 87, 88;</ref><ref>[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[Claudius Aelianus#Varia Historia (\u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03bb\u03b7 \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1)|Varia Historia]]'' xii. 42</ref>  Atreus, not knowing the baby's origin, took Aegisthus in and raised him as his own son.\n\n===Death of Atreus===\nIn the night in which Pelopia had been raped by her father, she had taken from him his [[sword]] which she afterwards gave to Aegisthus. When she discovered that the sword belonged to her own father, she realised that her son was the product of  [[incest]]uous intercourse. In despair, she [[suicide|killed herself]]. Atreus in his enmity towards his brother sent Aegisthus to kill him; but the sword which Aegisthus carried was the cause of the recognition between Thyestes and his son, and the latter returned and slew his uncle Atreus, while he was offering a sacrifice on the seacoast.  Aegisthus and his father now took possession of their lawful inheritance from which they had been expelled by Atreus.<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''l.c.'' and 252.</ref>\n\n===Power struggle over Mycenae===\nAegisthus and Thyestes thereafter ruled over [[Mycenae]] jointly, exiling Atreus' sons [[Agamemnon]] and [[Menelaus]] to [[Sparta]], where King [[Tyndareus]] gave the pair his daughters, [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], to take as wives. Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had four children: one son, [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], and three daughters, [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]] and [[Chrysothemis]].\n\nAfter the death of Tyndareus, Meneleaus became king of Sparta. He used the Spartan army to drive out Aegisthus and Thyestes from Mycenae and place Agamemnon on the throne. Agamemnon extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful ruler in Greece.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After Helen's abduction to Troy, Agamemnon was forced to sacrifice his own daughter Iphigenia in order to appease the gods before setting off for Ilium. While Agamemnon was away fighting in the Trojan War, Clytemnestra turned against her husband and took Aegisthus as a lover. Upon Agamemnon's return to Mycenae, Aegisthus and Clytemnestra worked together to kill Agamemnon with certain accounts recording Aegisthus committing the murder while others record Clytemnestra herself exacting revenge on Agamemnon his murder of Iphigenia.\n\nFollowing Agamemnon's death, Aegisthus reigned over Mycenae for seven years. He and Clytemnestra had a son, [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], and two daughters, [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]] and Helen. In the eighth year of his reign [[Orestes]], the son of Agamemnon, returned to Mycenae and avenged the death of his father by killing Aegisthus and Clytemnestra.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' i. 28, &c.</ref><ref>{{Citation|last = Schmitz| first = Leonhard| author-link = | contribution = Aegisthus| editor-last = Smith| editor-first = William| title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]| volume = 1 |pages=26\u201327| publisher = | place = Boston| year = 1867| contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0035.html }}</ref> The impiety of matricide was such that Orestes was forced to flee from Mycenae, pursued by the [[Furies]].

In the first play, ''Agamemnon'', he appears at the end to claim the throne, after Clytemnestra herself has killed Agamemnon and [[Cassandra]]. Clytemnestra wields the axe she has used to quell dissent. In ''The Libation Bearers'' he is killed quickly by Orestes, who then struggles over having to kill his mother. Aegisthus is referred to as a \"weak lion\", plotting the murders but having his lover commit the deeds. According to Johanna Leah Braff, he \"takes the traditional female role, as one who devises but is passive and does not act.\"<ref>Johanna Leah Braff, ''Animal Similes and Gender in the \"Odyssey\" and \"Oresteia\"'', University of Maryland, MA Thesis, 2008, p.64.</ref> Christopher Collard describes him as the foil to Clytemnestra, his brief speech in ''Agamemnon'' revealing him to be \"cowardly, sly, weak, full of noisy threats - a typical 'tyrant figure' in embryo.\"<ref>Christopher Collard (ed), ''Oresteia: Aeschylus'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p.xxvii.</ref>\n\nAeschylus's portrayal of Aegisthus as a weak, implicitly feminised figure, influenced later writers and artists who often depict him as an effeminate or decadent individual, either manipulating or dominated by the more powerful Clytemnestra. He appears in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''Agamemnon'', enticing her to murder.  In [[Richard Strauss]]'s and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]'s opera, ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' his voice is \"a decidedly high-pitched tenor, punctuated by irrational upward leaps, that rises to high pitched squeals during his death colloquy with Elektra.\" In the first production he was depicted as \"an epicene...with long curly locks and rouged lips, half-cringing, half-posturing seductively.\"<ref>Lawrence Kramer, ''Opera and Modern Culture: Wagner and Strauss'', University of California Press, 2004, pp.207-8.</ref>\n\nAn ancient tomb in Mycenae is fancifully known as the 'Tomb of Aigisthus'.

The detachment at Jerusalem, which apparently encamped all over the city's western hill, was responsible for preventing Jews from returning to the city. Roman enforcement of this prohibition continued through the 4th century.\n\nThe urban plan of Aelia Capitolina was that of a typical Roman town wherein main thoroughfares crisscrossed the [[Urban planning|urban grid]] lengthwise and widthwise.<ref>[http://jeru.huji.ac.il/ed22.htm The Cardo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217114200/http://jeru.huji.ac.il/ed22.htm |date=December 17, 2008 }} Hebrew University</ref> The urban grid was based on the usual central north-south road (''[[cardo]]'') and central east-west route (''[[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]''). However, as the main cardo ran up the western hill, and the [[Temple Mount]] blocked the eastward route of the main decumanus, a second pair of main roads was added; the secondary cardo ran down the [[Tyropoeon Valley]], and the secondary decumanus ran just to the north of the Temple Mount. The main Hadrianic cardo terminated not far beyond its junction with the decumanus, where it reached the Roman garrison's encampment, but in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era it was extended over the former camp to reach the southern walls of the city.\n\nThe two cardines converged near the ''[[Damascus Gate]]'', and a semicircular [[piazza]] covered the remaining space; in the piazza a columnar monument was constructed, hence the Arabic name for the gate - ''Bab el-Amud'' (''Gate of the Column'').  [[Tetrapylon]]es were constructed at the other junctions between the main roads.\n\nThis street pattern has been preserved in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]] to the present. The original thoroughfare, flanked by rows of columns and shops, was about 73 feet (22 meters) wide, but buildings have extended onto the streets over the centuries, and the modern lanes replacing the ancient grid are now quite narrow. The substantial remains of the western cardo have now been exposed to view near the junction with Suq el-Bazaar, and remnants of one of the tetrapylones are preserved in the 19th century [[Franciscan]] chapel at the junction of the Via Dolorosa and Suq Khan ez-Zeit.\n\nAs was standard for new Roman cities, Hadrian placed the city's main [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]] at the junction of the main cardo and decumanus, now the location for the (smaller) [[Muristan]]. Adjacent to the Forum, at the junction of the same cardo, and the other decumanus, Hadrian built a large temple to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], which later became the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]; despite 11th century destruction, which resulted in the modern Church having a much smaller footprint, several boundary walls of Hadrian's temple have been found among the archaeological remains beneath the Church.<ref>[[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]], ''The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem'' (1981)</ref> The ''[[Struthion Pool]]'' lay in the path of the northern decumanus, so Hadrian placed [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] over it, added a large pavement on top, and turned it into a secondary Forum;<ref name=\"benoit\">[[Pierre Benoit (archaeologist)|Pierre Benoit]], ''The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress'', in ''Jerusalem Revealed'' (edited by [[Yigael Yadin]]), (1976)</ref> the pavement can still be seen under the [[Convent of the Sisters of Zion]].<ref name=\"benoit\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History|Roman Empire|Judaism}}\n*[[Names of Jerusalem]]\n*[[Caesarea Maritima]]\n*[[Alexander of Jerusalem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jesusneverexisted.com/aelia.htm Detailed description (including map) of the city of Aelia Capitolina]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090907043901/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSsptemp.html Pictures of the cave where it is believed by Christians that Jesus was buried and from which it is believed he resurrected and a picture of the remains of the walls of the Temple of Venus previously constructed on that site by the Emperor Hadrian]\n* [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/archaeologists-bringing-jerusalem-s-ancient-roman-city-back-to-life-1.413874 \"Archaeologists bringing Jerusalem's ancient Roman city back to life\"  by Nir Hasson, Ha'aretz, February 21, 2012]\n\n{{coord|31.775689|N|35.231040|E|display=title}}\n\n{{Roman colonies in ancient Levant}}\n\n[[Category:Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Classical sites in Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Southwest Asia]]\n[[Category:Ancient history of Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Judea (Roman province)]]\n[[Category:Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in the 2nd century]]\n[[Category:131 establishments]]\n[[Category:130s establishments in the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:320s disestablishments in the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Roman towns and cities in Israel]]\n[[Category:Coloniae (Roman)]]\n[[Category:State of Palestine in the Roman era]]", "sha1": "1t4llx013nt1l6xjbymaxtu0wzlosn0"}}, {"title": "Aelian", "ns": "0", "id": "2633", "revision": {"id": "552178423", "parentid": "539178937", "timestamp": "2013-04-25T21:13:15Z", "contributor": {"username": "Paul August", "id": "87355"}, "comment": "add \"writer\" for Claudius Aelianus", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Aelian''' or '''Aelianus''' may refer to:\n\n* [[Aelianus Tacticus]], Greek military writer of the 2nd century, who lived in Rome\n* [[Casperius Aelianus]], Praetorian Prefect, executed by Trajan\n* [[Claudius Aelianus]], Roman writer, teacher and historian of the 3rd century, who wrote in Greek\n* [[Lucius Aelianus]], one of the thirty tyrants under the Roman empire\n* [[Aelianus Meccius]], ancient Greek physician, tutor of Galen\n* [[Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus]], adopted nephew of Plautia Urgulanilla, first wife of Claudius;

The author claims to have consulted all the best authorities, the most important of which was a lost treatise on the subject by [[Polybius]].

The letter is influential in supporting the thesis of the early-modern [[Military Revolution]]. In the letter William Louis discusses the use of ranks by soldiers of Imperial Rome as discussed in Aelian's Tactica. Aelian was discussing the use of the counter march in the context of the Roman sword [[gladius]] and spear [[pilum]].

Agarose is most commonly used as the medium for analytical scale [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]].  Gels made from purified agarose have a relatively large pore size, making them useful for separation of large molecules, such as proteins and protein complexes >200 kilodaltons, as well as DNA fragments >100 basepairs.

Agarose gels have lower resolving power for DNA than acrylamide gels, but they have greater range of separation, and are therefore usually used for DNA fragments with lengths of 50-20,000 bp ([[base pair]]s), although resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE).<ref name=\"maniatis1\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Tom Maniatis |author2=E.

The lower the concentration of the gel, the larger the pore size, and the larger the DNA that can be sieved.  However low-concentration gels (0.1 - 0.2%) are fragile and therefore hard to handle, and the electrophoresis of large DNA molecules can take several days.  The limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb.<ref name=\"maniatis1\" />  This limit can be overcome by PFGE, where alternating orthogonal electric fields are applied to the gel.  The DNA fragments reorientate themselves when the applied field switches direction, but larger molecules of DNA take longer to realign themselves when the electric field is altered, while for smaller ones it is quicker, and the DNA can therefore be fractionated according to size.\n\nAgarose gels are cast in a mold, and when set, usually run horizontally submerged in a buffer solution. [[TAE buffer|Tris-acetate-EDTA]] and [[TBE buffer|Tris-Borate-EDTA]] buffers are commonly used, but other buffers such as Tris-phosphate,  barbituric acid-sodium barbiturate or Tris-[[Barbital|barbiturate]] buffers may be used in other applications.<ref name=\"jeppson\"/> The DNA is normally visualized by staining with [[ethidium bromide]] and then viewed under a [[UV light]], but other methods of staining are available, such as [[SYBR Green I|SYBR Green]], [[GelRed]], [[methylene blue]], and [[crystal violet]].

Because agarose forms a non-cytotoxic [[hydrogel]]s, it can be utilized to reproduce the natural environment of cells in the human body, the [[extracellular matrix]]. However, agarose forms a stiff inert [[hydrogel]] that do not carry any biological information, thus the human and animal cells can not adhere to the [[polysaccharide]]. Because of these specifics properties, agarose [[hydrogel]] mimics the natural environment of [[cartilage]] cells and have been shown to be support the differentiation of [[chondrocyte]]s into [[cartilage]]. In order to modify the [[mechanical properties]] of agarose to reproduce the natural environment of other human cells, agarose can be chemically modified through the precise oxidation of the primary alcohol of the D-[[galactose]] into [[carboxylic acid]]. This chemical modification provides a novel class of materials named carboxylated agarose. Through the control over the number of carboxylated D-galactose on the [[polysaccharide]] backbone, the mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogel can be precisely controlled. These carboxylated agarose hydrogels can be then covalently bond to [[peptide]]s to form hydrogel on which cells can adhere. These carboxylated agarose hydrogels have been shown to direct the organization of human endothelial cells into polarized lumens.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1073/pnas.1222880110 |author1 = A.

Motile species will be able to migrate, albeit slowly, throughout the porous gel and infiltration rates can then be visualized.  The gel's porosity is directly related to the concentration of agar or agarose in the medium, so different concentration gels may be used to assess a cell's [[Flagellar motility|swimming]], [[Swarming motility|swarming]], [[gliding motility|gliding]] and twitching motility. Under-agarose cell migration assay may be used to measure chemotaxis and chemokinesis.  A layer of agarose gel is placed between a cell population and a [[chemoattractant]]. As a concentration gradient develops from the [[diffusion]] of the chemoattractant into the gel, various cell populations requiring different stimulation levels to migrate can then be visualized over time using microphotography as they tunnel upward through the gel against gravity along the gradient.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agar]]\n*[[SDD-AGE]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Polysaccharides]]", "sha1": "1on91fc7rxlz6rtd57e09z1131y070q"}}, {"title": "Accounting and Bookkeeping", "ns": "0", "id": "2636", "redirect": {"title": "Accounting"}, "revision": {"id": "590913881", "parentid": "528965816", "timestamp": "2014-01-16T02:52:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "Fuhghettaboutit", "id": "665998"}, "minor": "", "comment": "fix double redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Accounting]]", "sha1": "eoov7oo4vcvkc2lvd4l4ei7s5bnsfeu"}}, {"title": "Atomic absorption spectroscopy", "ns": "0", "id": "2637", "revision": {"id": "866577994", "parentid": "861920405", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T05:59:56Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2409:4072:F:327:D026:E179:A64A:105E"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:FlammenAAS.jpg|thumb|300px|Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy instrument]]\n\n'''Atomic absorption spectroscopy''' ('''AAS''') is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements using the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state.Atomic absorption spectroscopy is based on absorption of light by free metallic ions. \n\nIn analytical chemistry the technique is used for determining the concentration of a particular element (the analyte) in a sample to be analyzed.

It requires standards with known analyte content to establish the relation between the measured absorbance and the analyte concentration and relies therefore on the [[Beer-Lambert Law]].\n\nIn short, the electrons of the atoms in the atomizer can be promoted to higher orbitals (excited state) for a short period of time (nanoseconds) by absorbing a defined quantity of energy (radiation of a given [[wavelength]]). This amount of energy, i.e., wavelength, is specific to a particular electron transition in a particular element. In general, each wavelength corresponds to only one element, and the width of an absorption line is only of the order of a few picometers (pm), which gives the technique its elemental selectivity.\nThe [[radiation flux]] without a sample and with a sample in the atomizer is measured using a detector, and the ratio between the two values (the absorbance) is converted to analyte concentration or mass using the Beer-Lambert Law.\n\n== Instrumentation ==\n[[File:AASBLOCK.JPG|thumb|250px|Atomic absorption spectrometer block diagram]]\nIn order to analyze a sample for its atomic constituents, it has to be atomized.  The atomizers most commonly used nowadays are flames and electrothermal ([[graphite]] tube) atomizers. The atoms should then be irradiated by optical radiation, and the radiation source could be an element-specific line radiation source or a continuum radiation source. The radiation then passes through a [[monochromator]] in order to separate the element-specific radiation from any other radiation emitted by the radiation source, which is finally measured by a detector.\n\n=== Atomizers ===\nThe atomizers most commonly used nowadays are (spectroscopic) flames and electrothermal (graphite tube) atomizers. Other atomizers, such as glow-discharge atomization, hydride atomization, or cold-vapor atomization might be used for special purposes.\n\n==== Flame atomizers ====\nThe oldest and most commonly used atomizers in AAS are flames, principally the air-acetylene flame with a temperature of about 2300&nbsp;\u00b0C and the nitrous oxide<ref name=\"Koirtyohann1991\" /> system (N<sub>2</sub>O)-acetylene flame with a temperature of about 2700&nbsp;\u00b0C. The latter flame, in addition, offers a more reducing environment, being ideally suited for analytes with high affinity to oxygen.[[File:FP8800GM.jpg|thumb|A laboratory flame photometer that uses a propane operated flame atomizer]]\n\nLiquid or dissolved samples are typically used with flame atomizers. The sample solution is aspirated by a pneumatic [[analytical nebulizer]], transformed into an [[aerosol]], which is introduced into a spray chamber, where it is mixed with the flame gases and conditioned in a way that only the finest aerosol droplets (< 10&nbsp;\u03bcm) enter the flame. This conditioning process is responsible that only about 5% of the aspirated sample solution reaches the flame, but it also guarantees a relatively high freedom from interference.\n\nOn top of the spray chamber is a burner head that produces a flame that is laterally long (usually 5\u201310&nbsp;cm) and only a few mm deep. The radiation beam passes through this flame at its longest axis, and the flame gas flow-rates may be adjusted to produce the highest concentration of free atoms. The burner height may also be adjusted, so that the radiation beam passes through the zone of highest atom cloud density in the flame, resulting in the highest sensitivity.\n\nThe processes in a flame include the stages of desolvation (drying) in which the solvent is evaporated and the dry sample nano-particles remain, [[vaporization]] (transfer to the gaseous phase) in which the solid particles are converted into gaseous molecule, atomization in which the molecules are dissociated into free atoms, and  [[ionization]] where (depending on the ionization potential of the analyte atoms and the energy available in a particular flame) atoms may be in part converted to gaseous ions.\n\nEach of these stages includes the risk of interference in case the degree of phase transfer is different for the analyte in the calibration standard and in the sample. Ionization is generally undesirable, as it reduces the number of atoms that are available for measurement, i.e., the sensitivity.\n\nIn flame AAS a steady-state signal is generated during the time period when the sample is aspirated. This technique is typically used for determinations in the mg L<sup>\u22121</sup> range, and may be extended down to a few \u03bcg L<sup>\u22121</sup> for some elements.\n\n==== Electrothermal atomizers ====\n[[File:GFAA method development-courtesy jball-Analytik Jena USA.JPG|thumb|right |400 px|GFAA method development]]\n[[File:Lvov furnace 2.JPG|thumb|right|Graphite tube]] \n[[Graphite furnace atomic absorption|Electrothermal AAS]] (ET AAS) using graphite tube atomizers was pioneered by Boris V.

Tubes may be heated transversely or longitudinally, where the former ones have the advantage of a more homogeneous temperature distribution over their length. The so-called stabilized temperature platform furnace (STPF) concept, proposed by Walter Slavin, based on research of Boris L\u2019vov, makes ET AAS essentially free from interference.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The major components of this concept are atomization of the sample from a graphite platform inserted into the graphite tube (L\u2019vov platform) instead of from the tube wall in order to delay atomization until the gas phase in the atomizer has reached a stable temperature; use of a chemical modifier in order to stabilize the analyte to a pyrolysis temperature that is sufficient to remove the majority of the matrix components; and integration of the absorbance over the time of the transient absorption signal instead of using peak height absorbance for quantification.\n\nIn ET AAS a transient signal is generated, the area of which is directly proportional to the mass of analyte (not its concentration) introduced into the graphite tube. This technique has the advantage that any kind of sample, solid, liquid or gaseous, can be analyzed directly. Its sensitivity is 2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than that of flame AAS, so that determinations in the low \u03bcg L<sup>\u22121</sup> range (for a typical sample volume of 20&nbsp;\u00b5L) and ng g<sup>\u22121</sup> range (for a typical sample mass of 1&nbsp;mg) can be carried out. It shows a very high degree of freedom from interferences, so that ET AAS might be considered the most robust technique available nowadays for the determination of trace elements in complex matrices.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n====Specialized atomization techniques====\nWhile flame and electrothermal vaporizers are the most common atomization techniques, several other atomization methods are utilized for specialized use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Textbook_Maps/Analytical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Map%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.0_(Harvey)/10_Spectroscopic_Methods/10.4%3A_Atomic_Absorption_Spectroscopy|title=Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy|last=Harvey|first=David|date=2016-05-25|website=chem.libretexts.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.maryville.edu/aas/atomization-source/|title=Sample Atomization \u2013 Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy Learning Module|website=blogs.maryville.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=====Glow-discharge atomization=====\nA glow-discharge device (GD) serves as a versatile source, as it can simultaneously introduce and atomize the sample. The [[glow discharge]] occurs in a low-pressure argon gas atmosphere between 1 and 10 torr. In this atmosphere lies a pair of electrodes applying a [[Direct Current|DC]] voltage of 250 to 1000 V to break down the argon gas into positively charged ions and electrons. These ions, under the influence of the electric field, are accelerated into the cathode surface containing the sample, bombarding the sample and causing neutral sample atom ejection through the process known as [[sputtering]]. The atomic vapor produced by this discharge is composed of ions, ground state atoms, and fraction of excited atoms. When the excited atoms relax back into their ground state, a low-intensity glow is emitted, giving the technique its name.\n\nThe requirement for samples of glow discharge atomizers is that they are electrical conductors. Consequently, atomizers are most commonly used in the analysis of metals and other conducting samples. However, with proper modifications, it can be utilized to analyze liquid samples as well as nonconducting materials by mixing them with a conductor (e.g. graphite).\n\n=====Hydride atomization=====\nHydride generation techniques are specialized in solutions of specific elements. The technique provides a means of introducing samples containing arsenic, antimony, selenium, bismuth, and lead into an atomizer in the gas phase. With these elements, hydride atomization enhances detection limits by a factor of 10 to 100 compared to alternative methods. Hydride generation occurs by adding an acidified aqueous solution of the sample to a 1% aqueous solution of sodium borohydride, all of which is contained in a glass vessel. The volatile hydride generated by the reaction that occurs is swept into the atomization chamber by an inert gas, where it undergoes decomposition. This process forms an atomized form of the analyte, which can then be measured by absorption or emission spectrometry.\n\n=====Cold-vapor atomization=====\nThe cold-vapor technique is an atomization method limited to only the determination of mercury, due to it being the only metallic element to have a large enough vapor pressure at ambient temperature.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Because of this, it has an important use in determining organic mercury compounds in samples and their distribution in the environment. The method initiates by converting mercury into Hg<sup>2+</sup> by oxidation from nitric and sulfuric acids, followed by a reduction of Hg<sup>2+</sup> with [[SnCl2|tin(II) chloride]]. The mercury, is then swept into a long-pass absorption tube by bubbling a stream of inert gas through the reaction mixture. The concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance of this gas at 253.7&nbsp;nm. Detection limits for this technique are in the parts-per-billion range making it an excellent mercury detection atomization method.\n\n=== Radiation sources ===\nWe have to distinguish between line source AAS (LS AAS) and continuum source AAS (CS AAS). In classical LS AAS, as it has been proposed by Alan Walsh,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walsh|first1=Alan|last2=Becker-Ross|first2=Helmut|last3=Florek|first3=Stefan|last4=Heitmann|first4=Uwe|title=High-Resolution Continuum Source AAS|date=19 January 2006|publisher=Wiley\u2010VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA|location=Weinheim|isbn=9783527307364|page=2}}</ref> the high spectral resolution required for AAS measurements is provided by the radiation source itself that emits the spectrum of the analyte in the form of lines that are narrower than the absorption lines. Continuum sources, such as deuterium lamps, are only used for background correction purposes. The advantage of this technique is that only a medium-resolution monochromator is necessary for measuring AAS; however, it has the disadvantage that usually a separate lamp is required for each element that has to be determined. In CS AAS, in contrast, a single lamp, emitting a continuum spectrum over the entire spectral range of interest is used for all elements. Obviously, a high-resolution monochromator is required for this technique, as will be discussed later.\n\n[[File:Das Bild zeigt eine Mehrelement-Hohlkathodenlampe f\u00fcr bessere UV-Lichtdurchl\u00e4ssigkeit mit eingelassenem Quarzfenster.jpg|thumb|250px|Hollow cathode lamp (HCL)]]\n\n==== Hollow cathode lamps ====\n[[Hollow cathode lamps]] (HCL) are the most common radiation source in LS AAS.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Inside the sealed lamp, filled with argon or neon gas at low pressure, is a cylindrical metal cathode containing the element of interest and an anode. A high voltage is applied across the anode and cathode, resulting in an ionization of the fill gas. The gas ions are accelerated towards the cathode and, upon impact on the cathode, sputter cathode material that is excited in the glow discharge to emit the radiation of the sputtered material, i.e., the element of interest.  In the majority of cases single element lamps are used, where the cathode is pressed out of predominantly compounds of the target element. Multi-element lamps are available with combinations of compounds of the target elements pressed in the cathode. Multi element lamps produce slightly less sensitivity than single element lamps and the combinations of elements have to be selected carefully to avoid spectral interferences. Most multi-element lamps combine a handful of elements, eg: 2 - 8.  Atomic Absorption Spectrometers can feature as few as 1-2 hollow cathode lamp positions or in automated multi-element spectrometers, a 8-12 lamp positions may be typically available.\n\n==== Electrodeless discharge lamps ====\n[[Electrodeless lamp|Electrodeless discharge lamps]] (EDL) contain a small quantity of the analyte as a metal or a salt in a quartz bulb together with an inert gas, typically argon gas, at low pressure. The bulb is inserted into a coil that is generating an electromagnetic radio frequency field, resulting in a low-pressure inductively coupled discharge in the lamp. The emission from an EDL is higher than that from an HCL, and the line width is generally narrower, but EDLs need a separate power supply and might need a longer time to stabilize.\n\n==== Deuterium lamps ====\n[[Deuterium arc lamp|Deuterium HCL]] or even hydrogen HCL and deuterium discharge lamps are used in LS AAS for background correction purposes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rakshit|first1=Amitava|title=Basics of Laboratory Safety: Common laboratory rules and regulations|url=http://www.intecol.net/pages/002_personal.php?table=blog&tb_kind=Research&id=Amitava&vvt=aa&bidx=134710|website=The International Association for Ecology|publisher=Intecol|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> The radiation intensity emitted by these lamps decreases significantly with increasing wavelength, so that they can be only used in the wavelength range between 190 and about 320&nbsp;nm.\n\n[[File:Continuous radiation source.jpg|thumb|250px|Xenon lamp as a continuous radiation source]]\n\n==== Continuum sources ====\nWhen a continuum radiation source is used for AAS, it is necessary to use a high-resolution monochromator, as will be discussed later. In addition, it is necessary that the lamp emits radiation of intensity at least an order of magnitude above that of a typical HCL over the entire wavelength range from 190&nbsp;nm to 900&nbsp;nm. A special [[Xenon arc lamp|high-pressure xenon short arc lamp]], operating in a hot-spot mode has been developed to fulfill these requirements.\n\n=== Spectrometer ===\nAs already pointed out above, there is a difference between medium-resolution spectrometers that are used for LS AAS and high-resolution spectrometers that are designed for CS AAS. The spectrometer includes the spectral sorting device (monochromator) and the detector.\n\n==== Spectrometers for LS AAS ====\nIn LS AAS the high resolution that is required for the measurement of atomic absorption is provided by the narrow line emission of the radiation source, and the monochromator simply has to resolve the analytical line from other radiation emitted by the lamp.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This can usually be accomplished with a band pass between 0.2 and 2&nbsp;nm, i.e., a medium-resolution monochromator. Another feature to make LS AAS element-specific is modulation of the primary radiation and the use of a selective amplifier that is tuned to the same modulation frequency, as already postulated by Alan Walsh. This way any (unmodulated) radiation emitted for example by the atomizer can be excluded, which is imperative for LS AAS. Simple monochromators of the Littrow or (better) the Czerny-Turner design are typically used for LS AAS. Photomultiplier tubes are the most frequently used detectors in LS AAS, although solid state detectors might be preferred because of their better [[signal-to-noise ratio]].\n\n==== Spectrometers for CS AAS ====\nWhen a continuum radiation source is used for AAS measurement it is indispensable to work with a high-resolution monochromator. The resolution has to be equal to or better than the half width of an atomic absorption line (about 2 pm) in order to avoid losses of sensitivity and linearity of the calibration graph. The research with high-resolution (HR) CS AAS was pioneered by the groups of O\u2019Haver and Harnly in the USA, who also developed the (up until now) only simultaneous multi-element spectrometer for this technique. The break-through, however, came when the group of Becker-Ross in Berlin, Germany, built a spectrometer entirely designed for HR-CS AAS. The first commercial equipment for HR-CS AAS was introduced by [[Analytik Jena]] (Jena, Germany) at the beginning of the 21st century, based on the design proposed by Becker-Ross and Florek. These spectrometers use a compact double monochromator with a prism pre-monochromator and an echelle grating monochromator for high resolution. A linear charge coupled device (CCD) array with 200 pixels is used as the detector. The second monochromator does not have an exit slit; hence the spectral environment at both sides of the analytical line becomes visible at high resolution. As typically only 3\u20135 pixels are used to measure the atomic absorption, the other pixels are available for correction purposes. One of these corrections is that for lamp flicker noise, which is independent of wavelength, resulting in measurements with very low noise level; other corrections are those for background absorption, as will be discussed later.\n\n== Background absorption and background correction ==\nThe relatively small number of atomic absorption lines (compared to atomic emission lines) and their narrow width (a few pm) make spectral overlap rare; there are only few examples known that an absorption line from one element will overlap with another.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Molecular absorption, in contrast, is much broader, so that it is more likely that some molecular absorption band will overlap with an atomic line. This kind of absorption might be caused by un-dissociated molecules of concomitant elements of the sample or by flame gases. We have to distinguish between the spectra of di-atomic molecules, which exhibit a pronounced fine structure, and those of larger (usually tri-atomic) molecules that don\u2019t show such fine structure. Another source of background absorption, particularly in ET AAS, is scattering of the primary radiation at particles that are generated in the atomization stage, when the matrix could not be removed sufficiently in the pyrolysis stage.\n\nAll these phenomena, molecular absorption and radiation scattering, can result in artificially high absorption and an improperly high (erroneous) calculation for the concentration or mass of the analyte in the sample. There are several techniques available to correct for background absorption, and they are significantly different for LS AAS and HR-CS AAS.\n\n=== Background correction techniques in LS AAS ===\nIn LS AAS background absorption can only be corrected using instrumental techniques, and all of them are based on two sequential measurements,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} firstly, total absorption (atomic plus background), secondly, background absorption only, and the difference of the two measurements gives the net atomic absorption. Because of this, and because of the use of additional devices in the spectrometer, the signal-to-noise ratio of background-corrected signals is always significantly inferior compared to uncorrected signals. It should also be pointed out that in LS AAS there is no way to correct for (the rare case of) a direct overlap of two atomic lines. In essence there are three techniques used for background correction in LS AAS:\n\n==== Deuterium background correction ====\nThis is the oldest and still most commonly used technique, particularly for flame AAS. In this case, a separate source (a deuterium lamp) with broad emission is used to measure the background absorption over the entire width of the exit slit of the spectrometer. The use of a separate lamp makes this technique the least accurate one, as it cannot correct for any structured background. It also cannot be used at wavelengths above about 320&nbsp;nm, as the emission intensity of the deuterium lamp becomes very weak. The use of deuterium HCL is preferable compared to an arc lamp due to the better fit of the image of the former lamp with that of the analyte HCL.\n\n==== Smith-Hieftje background correction ====\nThis technique (named after their inventors) is based on the line-broadening and self-reversal of emission lines from HCL when high current is applied. Total absorption is measured with normal lamp current, i.e., with a narrow emission line, and background absorption after application of a high-current pulse with the profile of the self-reversed line, which has little emission at the original wavelength, but strong emission on both sides of the analytical line. The advantage of this technique is that only one radiation source is used; among the disadvantages are that the high-current pulses reduce lamp lifetime, and that the technique can only be used for relatively volatile elements, as only those exhibit sufficient self-reversal to avoid dramatic loss of sensitivity. Another problem is that background is not measured at the same wavelength as total absorption, making the technique unsuitable for correcting structured background.\n\n==== Zeeman-effect background correction ====\n{{main|Zeeman Effect}}\nAn alternating magnetic field is applied at the atomizer (graphite furnace) to split the absorption line into three components, the \u03c0 component, which remains at the same position as the original absorption line, and two \u03c3 components, which are moved to higher and lower wavelengths, respectively.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Total absorption is measured without magnetic field and background absorption with the magnetic field on. The \u03c0 component has to be removed in this case, e.g. using a polarizer, and the \u03c3 components do not overlap with the emission profile of the lamp, so that only the background absorption is measured. The advantages of this technique are that total and background absorption are measured with the same emission profile of the same lamp, so that any kind of background, including background with fine structure can be corrected accurately, unless the molecule responsible for the background is also affected by the magnetic field and using a chopper as a polariser reduces the signal to noise ratio. While the disadvantages are the increased complexity of the spectrometer and power supply needed for running the powerful magnet needed to split the absorption line.\n\n=== Background correction techniques in HR-CS AAS ===\nIn HR-CS AAS background correction is carried out mathematically in the software using information from detector pixels that are not used for measuring atomic absorption; hence, in contrast to LS AAS, no additional components are required for background correction.\n\n==== Background correction using correction pixels ====\nIt has already been mentioned that in HR-CS AAS lamp flicker noise is eliminated using correction pixels. In fact, any increase or decrease in radiation intensity that is observed to the same extent at all pixels chosen for correction is eliminated by the correction algorithm.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This obviously also includes a reduction of the measured intensity due to radiation scattering or molecular absorption, which is corrected in the same way. As measurement of total and background absorption, and correction for the latter, are strictly simultaneous (in contrast to LS AAS), even the fastest changes of background absorption, as they may be observed in ET AAS, do not cause any problem. In addition, as the same algorithm is used for background correction and elimination of lamp noise, the background corrected signals show a much better signal-to-noise ratio compared to the uncorrected signals, which is also in contrast to LS AAS.\n\n==== Background correction using a least-squares algorithm ====\nThe above technique can obviously not correct for a background with fine structure, as in this case the absorbance will be different at each of the correction pixels. In this case HR-CS AAS is offering the possibility to measure correction spectra of the molecule(s) that is (are) responsible for the background and store them in the computer. These spectra are then multiplied with a factor to match the intensity of the sample spectrum and subtracted pixel by pixel and spectrum by spectrum from the sample spectrum using a least-squares algorithm. This might sound complex, but first of all the number of di-atomic molecules that can exist at the temperatures of the atomizers used in AAS is relatively small, and second, the correction is performed by the computer within a few seconds. The same algorithm can actually also be used to correct for direct line overlap of two atomic absorption lines, making HR-CS AAS the only AAS technique that can correct for this kind of spectral interference.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Absorption spectroscopy]]\n*[[Beer-Lambert law]]\n*[[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]]\n*[[Laser absorption spectrometry]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*B.

Born in Thurso, Scotland, he served in the [[British Army]] during the [[French and Indian War]] before settling in [[Pennsylvania]], where he held local office. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], he rose to the rank of major general in the [[Continental Army]], but lost his command after a controversial retreat from [[Fort Ticonderoga]].\n\nAfter the war, he served as [[President of the Continental Congress]], which during his term passed the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. He was then made governor of the [[Northwest Territory]] in 1788, and then the portion that would become [[Ohio]] in 1800. In 1791, St. Clair commanded the American forces in what was the United States's worst ever defeat against the American Indians. Politically out-of-step with the Jefferson administration, he was replaced as governor in 1802.\n\n==Early life and career==\nSt. Clair was born in [[Thurso]], [[Caithness]], Scotland. Little is known of his early life. Early biographers estimated his year of birth as 1734,<ref>Smith, ''St. Clair Papers'', 1:2.</ref> but subsequent historians uncovered a birth date of March 23, 1736, which in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|modern calendar system]] means that he was born in 1737. <!-- I don't know if the March 23 part is Julian or Gregorian. --> His parents, unknown to early biographers, were probably William Sinclair, a merchant, and Elizabeth Balfour.<ref name=\"ANB\">Gregory Evans Dowd. \"St. Clair, Arthur\", ''[[American National Biography Online]]'', February 2000.</ref> He reportedly attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] before being apprenticed to the renowned physician [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]].<ref name=\"ANB\" />\n\nIn 1757, St. Clair purchased a commission in the [[British Army]], [[Royal American Regiment]], and came to America with Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]]'s fleet for the [[French and Indian War]]. He served under General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] at the capture of [[Fortress Louisbourg|Louisburg, Nova Scotia]] on July 26, 1758. On April 17, 1759, he received a lieutenant's commission and was assigned under the command of General [[James Wolfe]], under whom he served at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] which resulted in the capture of [[Quebec City]].\n\n==Settler in America==\nOn April 16, 1762, he resigned his commission, and, in 1764, he settled in [[Ligonier Valley, Pennsylvania]], where he purchased land and erected mills. He was the largest landowner in [[Western Pennsylvania]].\n\nIn 1770, St. Clair became a justice of the court, of quarter sessions and of common pleas, a member of the proprietary council, a justice, recorder, and clerk of the orphans' court, and [[prothonotary]] of [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] counties.\n\nIn 1774, the [[colony of Virginia]] took claim of the area around [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and some residents of Western Pennsylvania took up arms to eject them. St. Clair issued an order for the arrest of the officer leading the Virginia troops. [[Lord Dunmore's War]] eventually settled the boundary dispute.\n\n==Revolutionary War==\nBy the mid-1770s, St. Clair considered himself more of an American than a British subject. In January 1776, he accepted a commission in the [[Continental Army]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the [[3rd Pennsylvania Regiment]]. He first saw service in the later days of the [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|Quebec invasion]], where he saw action in the [[Battle of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]]. He was appointed a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in August 1776, and was sent by Gen. [[George Washington]] to help organize the [[New Jersey]] militia. He took part in [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River]] on the night of December 25\u201326, 1776, before the [[Battle of Trenton]] on the morning of December 26. Many biographers credit St. Clair with the strategy that led to Washington's [[Battle of Princeton|capture of Princeton, New Jersey]] on January 3, 1777.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|authorlink=David Hackett Fischer|title=[[Washington's Crossing (book)|Washington's Crossing]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-19-518159-X|pages=313\u201314}}</ref> St. Clair was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in February 1777.\n\nIn April 1777, St. Clair was sent to defend [[Fort Ticonderoga]].

St. Clair was forced to retreat at the [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|Siege of Fort Ticonderoga]] on July 5, 1777. He withdrew his forces and played no further part in the campaign.

He still saw action, however, as an [[aide-de-camp]] to General Washington, who retained a high opinion of him. St. Clair was at [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] when [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] surrendered his army.\n\n==\"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\"==\nSt. Clair was a member of the Pennsylvania Council of Censors in 1783, and was elected a delegate to the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]], serving from November 2, 1785, until November 28, 1787. Chaos ruled the day in early 1787 with [[Shays's Rebellion]] in full force and the states refusing to settle land disputes or contribute to the now six-year-old federal government. On February 2, 1787, the delegates finally gathered into a quorum and elected St. Clair to a one-year term as [[President of the Continental Congress]]. Congress enacted its most important piece of legislation, the [[Northwest Ordinance]], during St. Clair's tenure as president. Time was running out for the Confederation Congress, however: during St. Clair's presidency, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] was drafting a new [[United States Constitution]], which would abolish the old Congress.\n\n==Northwest Territory==\n{{main|Northwest Territory}}\n[[File:St Clair Narrative 1812.jpg|thumb|''A Narrative'' printed by [[Jane Aitken]]]]\nUnder the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which created the [[Northwest Territory]], General St. Clair was appointed governor of what is now [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], along with parts of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]]. He named [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], after the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and it was there that he established his home. When the territory was divided in 1800, he served as governor of the [[Ohio Territory]].\n\nAs Governor, he formulated [[Maxwell's Code]] (named after its printer, [[William Maxwell (engraver)|William Maxwell]]), the first written laws of the territory. He also sought to end Native American claims to Ohio land and clear the way for white settlement. In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations, or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Indian's claims, the treaty provoked them to further resistance in what is also sometimes known as the \"[[Northwest Indian War]]\" (or \"Little Turtle's War\"). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General [[Josiah Harmar]], whose 1,500 militiamen were defeated by the Indians in October 1790.\n\nIn March 1791, St. Clair succeeded Harmar as commander of the [[United States Army]] and was commissioned as a [[Major general (United States)|major general]]. He personally led a [[punitive expedition]] involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign, [[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)]] was built under the direction of General Arthur St. Clair. Located in present-day [[Darke County]] in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit.\n\nOne month later, near modern-day [[Fort Recovery]], his force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the [[Wabash River]], but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Chief [[Little Turtle]] and Shawnee chief [[Blue Jacket]] They were aided by British collaborators [[Alexander McKee]] and [[Simon Girty]]. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, which has since borne the name \"[[St. Clair's Defeat]]\", also known as the \"Battle of the Wabash\", the \"Columbia Massacre,\" or the \"Battle of a Thousand Slain\". It remains the greatest defeat of a US Army by Native Americans in history, with about 623 American soldiers killed in action and about 50 Native Americans killed. The wounded were many, including St. Clair and Capt. [[Robert Benham (politician)|Robert Benham]].\n\nAlthough an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but he continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.<ref>Leroy V.

However, he was opposed by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for what were perceived as his partisanship, high-handedness, and arrogance in office. In 1802, St. Clair remarked the U.S. Congress had no power to interfere in the affairs of those in the Ohio Territory. He also stated the people of the territory \"are no more bound by an act of Congress than we would be bound by an edict of the first consul of France.\" This led President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to remove him from office as territorial governor.<ref>Dumas Malone,''Jefferson The President: First Term, 1801-1805'', Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1970, pp. 243-44.</ref> He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803.\n\nThe first [[Ohio Constitution]] provided for a weak governor and a strong [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]], in part as a reaction to St. Clair's method of governance.\n\n==Family life==\nSt. Clair met Phoebe Bayard, a member of one of the most prominent families in Boston, and they were married in 1760. Miss Bayard's mother's maiden name was Bowdoin and she was the sister of [[James Bowdoin]], colonial governor of Massachusetts.\n\n==Death==\nIn retirement St. Clair lived with his daughter, Louisa St. Clair Robb, and her family on the ridge between Ligonier and Greensburg.\n\nGeneral St. Clair died in poverty in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]], on August 31, 1818 at the age of 81.  His remains are buried under a Masonic monument in St. Clair Park in downtown [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]].<ref>http://www.post-gazette.com/local/westmoreland/2009/11/22/Buried-in-Greensburg-Arthur-St-Clair-a-forgotten-Revolutionary/stories/200911220269</ref> St Clair had been a petitioner for a Charter for Nova Caesarea\nLodge #10 in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1791.<ref>http://www.mastermason.com/Millennium382/Papers/st%20clair.pdf</ref> This Lodge exists today, as Nova Caesarea Harmony #2.<ref>http://ncharmony.com/about/</ref> His wife Phoebe died shortly after and is buried beside him.\n\n==Legacy==\nA portion of the Hermitage, St. Clair's home in [[Oak Grove, Pennsylvania]] (north of Ligoner), was later moved to [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania]], where it is now preserved, along with St. Clair artifacts and memorabilia at the [[Fort Ligonier]] Museum.\n\nAn [[American Civil War]] steamer was named [[USS St. Clair (1862)|USS ''St. Clair'']].\n\nPlaces named in honor of Arthur St. Clair include:\n\nIn [[Pennsylvania]]:\n* [[Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[St. Clairsville, Pennsylvania]]\n* St. Clair [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania]] See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Clair,_Pennsylvania\n* St. Clair Township, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]]\n* East St. Clair Township, [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]]\n* West St. Clair Township, [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]]\n* The [[St. Clair (Pittsburgh)|St. Clair neighborhood]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]\n* St. Clair Hospital, [[Mt.

After the [[Corsican Republic]] was declared in 1755 the Genoese continued to hold several citadels, including Ajaccio, until the [[French conquest of Corsica|French]] took control of the island.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Ajacciens'' or ''Ajacciennes''.<ref>[http://www.habitants.fr/habitants_departement_corse-du-sud_2A.html Inhabitants of Corse-du-Sud] {{Fr icon}}</ref> The most famous of these is [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who was born in Ajaccio in 1769, and whose ancestral home, the [[Maison Bonaparte]], is now a museum.

The harbour lies to the east of the original citadel below a hill overlooking a peninsula which protects the harbour in the south where the Quai de la Citadelle and the Jett\u00e9e de la Citadelle are. The modern city not only encloses the entire harbour but takes up the better part of the Gulf of Ajaccio and in suburban form extends for some miles up the valley of the [[Gravona River]]. The flow from that river is nearly entirely consumed as the city's water supply.

Therefore, the [[urban area]] of Ajaccio is located in the east of the commune on a narrow coastal strip forming a densely populated arc. The rest of the territory is natural with habitation of little importance and spread thinly. Suburbanization occurs north and east of the main urban area.\n\nThe original urban core, close to the old marshy plain of ''Cannes'' was abandoned in favour of the current city which was built near the ''Punta della Lechia''. It has undergone various improvements, particularly under Napoleon, who originated the two current major structural arteries (the ''Cours Napoleon'' oriented north-south and the ''Cours Grandval'' oriented east-west).\n\nAjaccio experienced a demographic boom in the 1960s, which explains why 85% of dwellings are post-1949.<ref>''The Cities of France'', by Fabri\u00e8s-Verfaillie et Stragiotti, 2000 {{fr icon}}</ref> This is reflected in the layout of the city which is marked by very large areas of low-rise buildings and concrete towers, especially on the heights (''Jardins de l'Empereur'') and in the north of the city - e.g. the waterfront, ''Les Cannes'', and ''Les Salines''. A dichotomy appears in the landscape between the old city and the imposing modern buildings. Ajaccio gives the image of a city built on two different levels.\n\n===Climate===\nThe city has a [[Mediterranean climate]] which is ''Csa'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The average annual sunshine is 2726 hours.\n\nThere are important local climatic variations, especially with wind exposure and total precipitation, between the city centre, the airport, and the  ''\u00eeles Sanguinaires''. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|645.6|mm|1|abbr=on}} at the ''Campo dell'Oro'' weather station (as per the chart) and {{convert|523.9|mm|1|abbr=on}} at the ''Parata'': the third-driest place in metropolitan France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meteofrance.com|title=PREVISIONS METEO FRANCE - Site Officiel de M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France - Pr\u00e9visions gratuites \u00e0 15 jours sur la France et \u00e0 10 jours sur le monde|first=Meteo|last=France|website=www.meteofrance.com|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref> The heat and dryness of summer are somewhat tempered by the proximity of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] except when the [[sirocco]] is blowing.

Among these, the most prestigious suggests that the city was founded by the Greek legendary hero  ''[[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]]'' and named after him. Other more realistic explanations are, for example, that the name could be related to the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] ''agghiacciu'' meaning \"sheep pens\". Another explanation, supported by [[Byzantine]] sources from around the year 600AD called the city ''Agiation'' which suggests a possible Greek origin for the word,<ref>Manuscript variants are ''Agration'' and ''Agiagium'' but the use of a Greek ending does not necessarily indicate anything at all about ethnicity. At this late date geographers used either Greek or Latin forms at will. The word is no more decipherable in Greek than it is in Latin; attempts to connect two or three letters with [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] roots amount to speculation.</ref> ''agath\u00e8'' could mean \"good luck\" or \"good mooring\" (this was also the root of the name of the city of [[Agde]]).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ajaccio Bon Pl JPG.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Statue of Napoleon in the Place Foch]]\n[[File:Ajaccio Grand H\u00f4tel Continental.jpg|Ex Grand H\u00f4tel Continental (now office of the ''Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Corse'')|thumb|250px|right]]\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe city was not mentioned by the Greek geographer [[Ptolemy of Alexandria]] in the 2nd century AD despite the presence of a place called ''Ourkinion'' in the ''Cinarca'' area. It is likely that the city of Ajaccio had its first development at this time. The 2nd century was a period of prosperity in the Mediterranean basin (the [[Pax Romana]]) and there was a need for a proper port at the head of the several valleys that lead to the Gulf able to accommodate large ships. Some important underwater archaeological discoveries recently made of Roman ships tend to confirm this. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFurther excavations conducted recently led to the discovery of important early Christian remains likely to significantly a reevaluation upwards of the size of Ajaccio city in [[Late Antiquity]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]]. The city was in any case already significant enough to be the seat of a [[diocese]], mentioned by [[Pope Gregory the Great]] in 591. The city was then further north than the location chosen later by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] - in the location of the existing quarters of ''Castel Vecchio'' and ''Sainte-Lucie''.\n\nThe earliest certain written record of a settlement at Ajaccio with a name ancestral to its name was the exhortation in Epistle 77 written in 601AD by [[Gregory the great]] to the Defensor Boniface, one of two known rectors of the early Corsican church,<ref>{{cite book|pages=318|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages, 476\u2013752|first=Jeffrey|last=Richards|year=1979|ISBN=0-7100-0098-7|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London}}</ref> to tell him not to leave [[Al\u00e9ria]] and Adjacium without bishops. There is no earlier use of the term and Adjacium is not an attested [[Latin]] word, which probably means that it is a Latinization of a word in some other language. The [[Ravenna Cosmography]] of about 700 AD cites Agiation,<ref>{{cite book|title=Ravennatis Anonymi Cosmographia et Guidonis Geographica|pages=413|author=Anonymous of Ravenna|author2=Guido|author3= Gustav Parthey|author4= Moritz Pinder|year=1860|location=Berolini|publisher=in aedibvs Friderici Nicolai}} {{Link language|la}}. Downloadable Google Books.</ref> which sometimes is taken as evidence of a prior Greek city, as -ion appears to be a Greek ending. There is, however, no evidence at all of a Greek presence on the west coast and the [[Ionians]] at [[Al\u00e9ria]] on the east coast had been expelled by the Etruscans long before Roman domination.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n[[Ptolemy]], who must come the closest to representing indigenous names, lists the Lochra River just south of a feature he calls the \"sandy shore\" on the southwest coast. If the shore is the Campo dell'Oro (Place of Gold) the Lochra would seem to be the combined mouth of the Gravona and Prunelli Rivers, neither one of which sounds like Lochra.\n\nNorth of there was a Roman city, Ourchinion. The western coastline was so distorted, however, that it is impossible to say where Adjacium was; certainly, he would have known its name and location if he had had any first-hand knowledge of the island and if in fact it was there. Ptolemy's Ourchinion is further north than Ajaccio and does not have the same name. It could be [[Torra di Sagone|Sagone]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Pierre |last=Massimi |author2=Jose Tomazi |title=A corsica in la carta geografica di Ptolomey |work=InterRomania |publisher=Centru Culturale, Universita di Corsica |year=2002 |format=pdf |accessdate=18 May 2008 |url=http://www.interromania.com/media/pdf/benigni/ptolomeu.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529095833/http://www.interromania.com/media/pdf/benigni/ptolomeu.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2008 |df= }} {{Link language|co}}.</ref> The lack of correspondence between Ptolemaic and historical names known to be ancient has no defense except in the case of the two Roman colonies, Aleria and Mariana. In any case the population of the region must belong to Ptolemy's Tarabeni or Titiani people, neither of which are ever heard about again. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Archaeological evidence===\nThe population of the city throughout the centuries maintained an oral tradition that it had originally been [[Roman Empire|Roman]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}Travellers of the 19th century could point to the Hill of San Giovanni on the northwest shore of the Gulf of Ajaccio, which still had a cathedral said to have been the 6th-century seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ajaccio|Bishop of Ajaccio]]. The Castello Vecchio (\"old castle\"), a ruined citadel, was believed to be Roman but turned out to have Gothic features. The hill was planted with vines. The farmers kept turning up artifacts and terracotta funerary urns that seemed to be Roman.\n\nIn the 20th century the hill was covered over with buildings and became a part of downtown Ajaccio. In 2005 construction plans for a lot on the hill offered the opportunity to the Institut national de recherches arch\u00e9ologiques preventatives (Inrap) to excavate. They found the [[baptistry]] of a 6th-century cathedral and large amounts of pottery dated to the 6th and 7th centuries AD; in other words, an early Christian town. A cemetery had been placed over the old church. In it was a single Roman grave covered over with roof tiles bearing short indecipherable inscriptions. The finds of the previous century had included Roman coins. This is the only evidence so far of a Roman city continuous with the early Christian one.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discovery of an Early Christian Baptistery in Ajaccio |url=http://www.inrap.fr/preventive-archaeology/In_the_News/Press_release/p-1346-Discovery_of_an_Early_Christian_Baptistery_in_Ajac.htm |publisher=Inrap |date=9 June 2005 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001014/http://www.inrap.fr/preventive-archaeology/In_the_News/Press_release/p-1346-Discovery_of_an_Early_Christian_Baptistery_in_Ajac.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===The medieval Genoese period===\nIt has been established that after the 8th century the city, like most other Corsican coastal communities, strongly declined and disappeared almost completely. Nevertheless, a castle and a cathedral were still in place in 1492 which last was not demolished until 1748. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] were eager to assert their dominance in the south of the island and decided to rebuild the city of Ajaccio. Several sites were considered: the ''Pointe de la Parata'' (not chosen because it was too exposed to the wind), the ancient city (finally considered unsafe because of the proximity of the salt ponds), and finally the ''Punta della Lechia'' which was finally selected.\n\nWork began on the town on 21 April 1492 south of the Christian village by the [[Bank of Saint George]] at [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], who sent Cristoforo of Gandini, an architect, to build it. He began with a castle on Capo di Bolo, around which he constructed residences for several hundred people.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the city of Ajaccio|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.ajaccio.fr/Histoire-de-la-ville-d-Ajaccio_a12.html&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=4&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dadjacium%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26as_qdr%3Dall%26pwst%3D1|accessdate=16 May 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:Tour sanguinaires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Genoese Tower.]]\n\nThe new city was essentially a colony of Genoa. The Corsicans were restricted from the city for some years.\n\nNevertheless, the town grew rapidly and became the administrative capital of the province of ''Au Del\u00e0 Des Monts'' (more or less the current ''[[Corse-du-Sud]]''). [[Bastia]] remained the capital of the entire island.\n\nAlthough at first populated exclusively by the Genoese, the city slowly opened to the Corsicans while the Ajaccians, almost to the French conquest, were legally citizens of the [[Republic of Genoa]] and were happy to distinguish themselves from the insular ''paesani'' who lived mainly in ''Borgu'', a suburb outside the city walls (the current ''rue Fesch'' was the main street).\n\n===The attachment to France===\nAjaccio was occupied from 1553 to 1559 by the French but it again fell to the Genoese after the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Treaty of Cateau Cambresis]] in the latter year.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ajaccio|volume=1|page=451}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the [[Republic of Genoa]] was strong enough to keep Corsica until 1755, the year [[Pasquale Paoli]] proclaimed the [[Corsican Republic]]. Paoli took most of the island for the republic but he was unable to force Genoese troops out of the citadels of [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]], [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], Ajaccio, [[Bastia]] and [[Algajola]]. Leaving them there, he went on to build the nation, while the Republic of Genoa was left to ponder prospects and solutions. Their ultimate solution was to [[French conquest of Corsica|sell Corsica to France]] in 1768 and French troops of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] replaced Genoese ones in the citadels, including Ajaccio's.\n\nCorsica was formally annexed to France in 1780.\n\n===Napoleon I===\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (born as Nabulione Buonaparte) was born at Ajaccio in the same year as the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]], 1769. The Bonapartes at the time had a modest four-story home in town (now a museum known as [[Maison Bonaparte]]) and a rarely used country home in the hills north of the city (now site of the [[Arboretum des Milelli]]). The father of the family, attorney Charles-Marie Buonaparte, was secretary to [[Pasquale Paoli]] during the [[Corsican Republic]].\n[[File:2016 Ajaccio - Napoleondenkmal.jpg|thumb|left|Ajaccio, Place De Gaulle - monument Napol\u00e9on]]\n\nAfter the defeat of Paoli, the [[Charles Louis de Marbeuf|Comte de Marbeuf]] began to meet with some leading Corsicans to outline the shape of the future and enlist their assistance. The Comte was among a delegation from Ajaccio in 1769, offered his loyalty and was appointed assessor.\n\nMarbeuf also offered Charles-Marie Buonaparte an appointment for one of his sons to the [[Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau|Military College of Brienne]], but the child had to be under 10. There is a dispute concerning Napoleon's age because of this requirement; the emperor is known to have altered the civic records at Ajaccio concerning himself and it is possible that he was born in [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] in 1768 when his father was there on business. In any case Napoleon went to Brienne from 1779\u20131784.<ref>{{cite book|pages=Chapter 1|title=The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte|first=Sabine|last=Baring-Gould|year=2006|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|isbn=0-543-95815-9|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nAt Brienne Napoleon concentrated on studies. He wrote a boyish history of Corsica. He did not share his father's views but held [[Pasquale Paoli]] in high esteem and was at heart a Corsican nationalist. The top students were encouraged to go into the artillery. After graduation and a brief sojourn at the [[\u00c9cole Militaire|Military School of Paris]] Napoleon applied for a second-lieutenancy in the [[R\u00e9giment de La F\u00e8re (1765)|artillery regiment of La F\u00e8re]] at [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]] and after a time was given the position. Meanwhile, his father died and his mother was cast into poverty in Corsica, still having four children to support. Her only income was Napoleon's meagre salary. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe regiment was in [[Auxonne]] when the revolution broke out in the summer of 1789. Napoleon returned on leave to Ajaccio in October, became a [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] and began to work for the revolution. The [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in Paris united Corsica to France and pardoned its exiles. Paoli returned in 1790 after 21 years and kissed the soil on which he stood. He and Napoleon met and toured the battlefield of Paoli's defeat. A national assembly at Orezza created the department of Corsica and Paoli was subsequently elected president. He commanded the national guard raised by Napoleon. After a brief return to his regiment Napoleon was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]] and came home again on leave in 1791. The death of a rich uncle relieved the family's poverty. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Ajaccio citadelle echauguette.jpg|thumbnail|View of the citadel of Ajaccio]]\nAll officers were recalled from leave in 1792, intervention threatened and war with Austria ([[Marie-Antoinette]]'s homeland) began. Napoleon returned to Paris for review, was exonerated, then promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] and given leave to escort his sister, a schoolgirl, back to Corsica at state expense. His family was prospering; his estate increased.\n\nNapoleon became a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the Corsican National Guard. Paoli sent him off on an expedition to [[Sardinia]], ordered by France, under Paolis's nephew but the nephew had secret orders from Paoli to make sure the expedition failed.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Maddalena, 22/25&nbsp;February 1793|first=Maurizio|last=Cinti|work=Military Subjects: Battles & Campaigns|publisher=The Napoleon Series|date=20 April 1995|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_maddalena.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> Paoli was now a conservative, opposing the execution of the king and supporting an alliance with Great Britain. Returning from Sardinia Napoleon with his family and all his supporters were instrumental in getting Paoli denounced at the [[National Convention]] in Paris in 1793. Napoleon earned the hatred of the Paolists by pretending to support Paoli and then turning against him (payment, one supposes, for Sardinia).\n\nPaoli was [[Trial in absentia|convicted in absentia]], a warrant was issued for his arrest (which could not be served) and Napoleon was dispatched to Corsica as [[Inspector General]] of Artillery to take the citadel of Ajaccio from the royalists who had held it since 1789. The Paolists combining with the royalists defeated the French in two pitched battles and Napoleon and his family went on the run, hiding by day, while the Paolists burned their estate. Napoleon and his mother, Laetitia, were taken out by ship in June 1793, by friends while two of the girls found refuge with other friends. They landed in [[Toulon]] with only Napoleon's pay for their support.\n[[File:2016 Napoleon Totenmaske.jpg|thumb|left|[[Death mask]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]]]\nThe Bonapartes moved to [[Marseille]] but in August Toulon offered itself to the British and received the protection of a fleet under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Hood]]. The [[Siege of Toulon]] began in September under revolutionary officers mainly untrained in the art of war. Napoleon happened to present socially one evening and during a casual conversation over a misplaced 24-pounder explained the value of artillery. Taken seriously he was allowed to bring up over 100 guns from coastal emplacements but his plan for the taking of Toulon was set aside as one incompetent officer superseded another. By December they decided to try his plan and made him a Colonel. Placing the guns at close range he used them to keep the British fleet away while he battered down the walls of Toulon. As soon as the [[Committee of Public Safety]] heard of the victory Napoleon became a [[Brigadier General]], the start of his meteoric rise to power.\n\nThe Bonapartes were back in Ajaccio in 1797 under the protection of General Napoleon. Soon after Napoleon became First Consul and then emperor, using his office to spread revolution throughout Europe. In 1811 he made Ajaccio the capital of the new Department of Corsica. Despite his subsequent defeat by the Prussians, Russians, and British, his exile and his death, no victorious power reversed that decision or tried to remove Corsica from France. Among the natives, though Corsican nationalism is strong, and feeling often runs high in favour of a union with [[Italy]]; loyalty to France, however, as evidenced by elections, remains stronger.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nIn the 19th century Ajaccio became a popular winter resort of the high society of the time, especially for the English, in the same way as [[Monaco]], [[Cannes]], and [[Nice]]. An [[Holy Trinity Church, Ajaccio|Anglican Church]] was even built.\n\nThe first prison in France for children was built in Ajaccio in 1855: the Horticultural colony of Saint Anthony. It was a correctional colony for juvenile delinquents (from 8 to 20 years old), established under Article 10 of the Act of 5 August 1850. Nearly 1,200 children from all over France stayed there until 1866, when it was closed. Sixty percent of them perished, the victims of poor sanitation and malaria which infested the unhealthy areas that they were responsible to clean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://site.voila.fr/bagne-enfant-ajaccio|title=Cr\u00e9er un site web gratuit - pages perso Orange|website=site.voila.fr|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary history===\n{{Main article|Italian occupation of Corsica}}\n[[File:Mairie Ajaccio.jpg|thumb|Ajaccio: the first French town liberated]]\n\nOn 9 September 1943, the people of Ajaccio rose up against the Nazi occupiers<ref>[http://www.corse.pref.gouv.fr/scripts/display.asp?P=COhist_liberation Pr\u00e9fecture of Corsica: ''The Liberation of Corsica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624175934/http://www.corse.pref.gouv.fr/scripts/display.asp?P=COhist_liberation |date=24 June 2008 }} {{fr icon}}</ref> and became the first French town to be liberated from the domination of the Germans.

Its urban area of nearly 90,000 inhabitants is spread over a large part of the [[Corse-du-Sud]], on either side of the Gulf of Ajaccio and up the valley of the Gravona. Its business is primarily oriented towards the services sector.\n\nThe services sector is by far the main source of employment in the city. Ajaccio is an administrative centre comprising communal, intercommunal, departmental, regional, and prefectural services.\n\nIt is also a shopping centre with the commercial streets of the city centre and the areas of peripheral activities such as that of ''Mezzavia'' (hypermarket ''G\u00e9ant Casino'') and along the ring road (hypermarket Carrefour and E. Leclerc).\n\nTourism is one of the most vital aspects of the economy, split between the seaside tourism of summer, cultural tourism, and fishing. A number of hotels, varying from one star to five star, are present across the commune.\n\nAjaccio is the seat of the ''Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ajaccio and Corsica South''. It manages the ports of Ajaccio, [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]], [[Porto-Vecchio]], [[Propriano]] and the Tino Rossi marina. It also manages [[Ajaccio airport]]<ref>[http://www.ajaccio.aeroport.fr/aeroports/ajaccio2.php CCI of Ajaccio: Airport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126065821/http://www.ajaccio.aeroport.fr/aeroports/ajaccio2.php |date=26 January 2010 }} {{fr icon}}</ref> and [[Figari Sud-Corse Airport|Figari airport]] as well as the convention centre and the ''Centre of Ricanto''.\n\nSecondary industry is underdeveloped, apart from the aeronautical company ''Corsica Aerospace Composites CCA'', the largest company on the island with 135 employees at two sites.<ref>[http://www.cca.fr Corses Composites A\u00e9ronautiques] {{fr icon}}</ref> The storage sites of [[GDF Suez]] (formerly [[Gaz de France]]) and [[Antar (company)|Antargaz]] in the district of ''Vazzio'' are classified as high risk.\n\n===Energy===\nThe ''Centrale EDF du Vazzio'', a heavy oil power station, provides the south of the island with electricity.

Only the ''Cours Napoleon'' and the ''Boulevard du Roi Jerome'' cross the city.\n\nAlong with the high [[urban density]], this explains the major traffic and parking problems especially during peak hours and during the summer tourist season. A bypass through several neighbourhoods is nearing completion.\n\n===Communal bus services===\nThe ''Transports en commun d'Ajaccio'' (TCA) provide services on 21 urban routes, one \"city\" route for local links and 20 suburban lines.

Usually an arrondissement includes cantons and a canton includes one to several communes including the chef-lieu, \"chief place\", from which the canton takes its name. The city of Ajaccio is one commune, but it contains four cantons, Cantons 1\u20134, and a fraction of Canton 5. The latter contains three other communes: [[Bastelicaccia]], [[Alata, Corse-du-Sud|Alata]] and [[Villanova, Corse-du-Sud|Villanova]], making a total of four communes for the five cantons of Ajaccio.<ref name=decret>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028658302|title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2014-229 du 24 f\u00e9vrier 2014 portant d\u00e9limitation des cantons dans le d\u00e9partement de la Corse-du-Sud|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nEach canton contains a certain number of quartiers, \"quarters\". Cantons 1, 2, 3, 4 are located along the Gulf of Ajaccio from west to east, while 5 is a little further up the valleys of the Gravona and the Prunelli Rivers. These political divisions subdivide the population of Ajaccio into units that can be more democratically served but they do not give a true picture of the size of Ajaccio. In general language, \"greater Ajaccio\" includes about 100,000 people with all the medical, educational, utility and transportational facilities of a big city. Up until World War II it was still possible to regard the city as being a settlement of narrow streets localized to a part of the harbour or the Gulf of Ajaccio: such bucolic descriptions do not fit the city of today, and travellogues intended for mountain or coastal recreational areas do not generally apply to Corsica's few big cities.\n\nThe arrondissement contains other cantons that extend generally up the two rivers into central Corsica.\n\n===Twinning===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in France}}\nAjaccio has [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] associations with:<ref>[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/cncdext/dyn/public/atlas/rechercheAtlasFrance.html National Commission for Decentralised cooperation] {{Fr icon}}</ref>\n\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Jena]], Germany, since 2003 \n*{{flagicon|CYP}} [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], since 1989 \n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Palma de Mallorca]], Spain, since 1980\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Dana Point, California]], United States, since 1990\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[La Maddalena]], Italy, since 1991 \n*{{flagicon|MAR}} [[Marrakech]], Morocco, since 2005\n\n==Demography==\nThe demographic development of Ajaccio occurred mainly between 1945 and 1975 with a doubling of the population of the city in that period. This is explicable in the 1950s by the rural exodus. From the 1960s, the city saw the coming of \"[[Pied-Noir]]s\" (French Algerians) including immigrants from the [[Maghreb]] and French from mainland France.\n\nIn 2010, the commune had 65,542 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses conducted in the town since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger towns that have a sample survey every year.<ref group=Note>At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20130514005038/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100&fastPos=1&fastReqId=2036940488&categorieLien=cid&oldAction=rechTexte ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306074946/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100 |date=6 March 2016 }}, the so-called \"law of local democracy\" and in particular Title V \"census operations\" which allow, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts.

Ajaigarh was founded in 1765 by Guman Singh, a [[bundela]] [[Rajput]] who was the nephew of Raja Pahar Singh of Jaitpur. After Ajaigarh was captured by the British in 1809, it became a princely state in the [[Bundelkhand Agency]] of the [[Central India Agency]]. It had an area of {{convert|771|sqmi}}, and a population of 78,236 in 1901. The rulers bore the title of ''sawai maharaja''. He commanded an estimated annual revenue of about \u00a315,000/-, and paid a tribute of \u00a3460/-.  The chief resided at the town of [[Nowgong, Chhatarpur|Nowgong]], at the foot of the hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, from which the state took its name. This fort, situated on a steep hill, towers more than 800&nbsp;ft (244 m) above the eponymous township, and contains the ruins of several temples adorned with elaborately carved sculptures. The town was often afflicted by [[malaria]], and suffered severely from famine in 1868\u20131869 and 1896\u20131897.\n\nThe state acceded to the [[Government of India]] on 1 January 1950; the ruling chief was granted a privy purse of Rs. 74,700/-, and the courtesy use of his styles and titles. All of these were revoked by the government of [[India]] in 1971, at the time when these privileges were revoked from all erstwhile princes. The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to [[Chhatarpur District]]. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]] on 1 November 1956.\n{{ wide image|Panoramic view of Ajaygarh Palace.jpg|700px|Panoramic view of Ajaygarh Palace}}\n[[File:Ajaygarh Palace.JPG|thumb|Entrance gate of Ajaigarh Palace]]\n[[File:Inside of Ajaigarh Palace.JPG|thumb|Inside of Ajaigarh Palace]]\n\n===Rulers Of Ajaygarh===\n\n                   [[Maharaja Chhatrasal|Maharajadhiraja Chhatrasal]]    : 1649\u20131731\n                (founder ruler of many kingdoms)\n     ___________________________|______________________________\n Hirdeshah                   Jagatraj                   Bhartichandra\n  (Panna)                    (Jaitpur)                     (Jaso)\n    ____________________________|______________________________\n Vir Singh                   Kirat Singh                  Pahar Singh (1758\u20131765)\n    ____________________________|______________________________\n Khuman Singh           Guman Singh (1765\u20131792)             Durg Singh\n (Charkari)               (Banda)(No issues)                   |\n                                |__________________Son of______|\n                            Bhakhat Singh         :b. 1792-d. 1837\n                      (Founder ruler of Ajaigarh)\n   _____________________________|_______________________________\n                         Madho Singh (r. 1837-1849)   Mahipat Singh (r. 1849\u20131853)\n                           (No male issue)                     |\n                                                               |\n                         Ranjore Singh (K.C.I.E)__________Vijay Singh (R. 1853\u20131855)\n                           (born 1844; died 1919)         (died early, fell from horse)\n                                |                                                                                             \n                       Punyapratap Singh: born 1884; died 1958    \n|                                                                         \nDevendra Vijay Singh    :born 1913-died 1984\n (Privy Purses, titles abolished)\n\n== Ajaigarh Fort ==\nAjaigarh or Ajaygarh Fort is listed among the top attractions of the region.

Since he stood on a five-foot high pile of rubble collected over the years, the inscription is well above the eye-level gaze of an adult today.<ref>Spink (2006), 139 and 3 (quoted): \"Going down into the ravine where the caves were cut, he scratched his inscription (John Smith, 28th Cavalry, 28th April, 1819) across the innocent chest of a painted Buddha image on the thirteenth pillar on the right in Cave 10...\"</ref> A paper on the caves by [[William Erskine (historian)|William Erskine]] was read to the Bombay Literary Society in 1822.<ref>Upadhya, 3</ref>\n\n[[File:Name inscribed by john smith on the pillar in cave no 10 on 28 April 1819.jpg|thumb|Name and date inscribed by John Smith after he found Cave 10 in 1819.]]\nWithin a few decades, the caves became famous for their \"exotic\" setting, impressive architecture, and above all their exceptional and unique paintings. A number of large projects to copy the paintings were made in the century after rediscovery.  In 1848, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] established the \"Bombay Cave Temple Commission\" to clear, tidy and record the most important rock-cut sites in the [[Bombay Presidency]], with [[John Wilson (missionary)|John Wilson]] as president.  In 1861 this became the nucleus of the new Archaeological Survey of India.<ref>Gordon, 231\u2013234</ref>\n\nDuring the colonial era, the Ajanta site was in the territory of the [[princely state]] of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Hyderabad]] and not [[British India]].<ref name=cohenp57 /> In the early 1920s, the Nizam of Hyderabad appointed people to restore the artwork, converted the site into a museum and built a road to bring tourists to the site for a fee. These efforts resulted in early mismanagement, states Richard Cohen, and hastened the deterioration of the site. Post-independence, the state government of Maharashtra built arrival, transport, facilities and better site management.

The rock is layered horizontally, and somewhat variable in quality.<ref>\"horizontally bedded alternate flows of massive and [[Amygdule|amygdular]] lava\" is a technical description quoted by Cohen (2006), 37</ref> This variation within the rock layers required the artists to amend their carving methods and plans in places.

Excavation began by cutting a narrow tunnel at roof level, which was expanded downwards and outwards; as evidenced by some of the incomplete caves such as the partially-built ''vihara'' caves 21 through 24 and the abandoned incomplete cave 28.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThe sculpture artists likely worked at both excavating the rocks and making the intricate carvings of pillars, roof and idols; further, the sculpture and painting work inside a cave were an integrated parallel tasks.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|p= 28}} A grand gateway to the site was carved, at the apex of the gorge's horseshoe between caves 15 and 16, as approached from the river, and it is decorated with elephants on either side and a [[n\u0101ga]], or protective Naga (snake) deity.<ref>Spink, 10; Michell 340</ref> Similar methods and application of artist talent is observed in other cave temples of India, such as those from Hinduism and Jainism. These include the Ellora caves, Ghototkacha caves, [[Elephanta Caves]], [[Bagh Caves]], [[Badami Caves]], [[Aurangabad Caves]]{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=21\u201324, 38, 74\u201376, 115, 151\u2013153, 280}} and [[Shivleni Caves]].\n\nThe caves from the first period seem to have been paid for by a number of different patrons to gain [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]], with several inscriptions recording the donation of particular portions of a single cave. The later caves were each commissioned as a complete unit by a single patron from the local rulers or their court elites, again for merit in Buddhist [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Buddhism)|afterlife beliefs]] as evidenced by inscriptions such as those in Cave 17.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=5, 15, 32\u201333, 80, 249}} After the death of Harisena, smaller donors motivated by getting merit added small \"shrinelets\" between the caves or add statues to existing caves, and some two hundred of these \"intrusive\" additions were made in sculpture, with a further number of intrusive paintings, up to three hundred in cave 10 alone.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=5, 15, 32\u201333, 80, 126\u2013130, 249\u2013259}}\n\n=== Monasteries ===\n[[File:061 Cave 4, Side View (34280359075).jpg|thumb|A monastery, or [[vihara]], with its square hall surrounded by monks' cells.

To each vihara hall are attached smaller square dormitory cells cut into the walls.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=73\u201385, 100\u2013104, 182}} A vast majority of the caves were carved in the second period, wherein a shrine or sanctuary is appended at the rear of the cave, centred on a large statue of the Buddha, along with exuberantly detailed reliefs and deities near him as well as on the pillars and walls, all carved out of the natural rock.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=18, 37, 45\u201346}} This change reflects the shift from Hinayana to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. These caves are often called monasteries.\n\nThe central square space of the interior of the viharas is defined by square columns forming a more-or-less square open area. Outside this are long rectangular aisles on each side, forming a kind of [[cloister]]. Along the side and rear walls are a number of small cells entered by a narrow doorway; these are roughly square, and have small niches on their back walls. Originally they had wooden doors.<ref>Spink (2006), 148</ref> The centre of the rear wall has a larger shrine-room behind, containing a large Buddha statue.\n\nThe viharas of the earlier period are much simpler, and lack shrines.<ref name=\"Harle, 118\u2013122; Michell 335\u2013343\">Harle, 118\u2013122; Michell 335\u2013343</ref> Spink places the change to a design with a shrine to the middle of the second period, with many caves being adapted to add a shrine in mid-excavation, or after the original phase.<ref>Spink (2006), 142</ref>\n\nThe plan of Cave 1 shows one of the largest viharas, but is fairly typical of the later group. Many others, such as Cave 16, lack the vestibule to the shrine, which leads straight off the main hall.

The latter group were thought to be a century or more later than the others, but the revised chronology proposed by Spink would place them in the 5th century as well, perhaps contemporary with it in a more progressive style, or one reflecting a team from a different region.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|pp= 355\u2013361}} The Ajanta frescos are classical paintings and the work of confident artists, without cliches, rich and full. They are luxurious, sensuous and celebrate physical beauty, aspects that early Western observers felt were shockingly out of place in these caves presumed to be meant for religious worship and ascetic monastic life.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p=359}}\n\nThe paintings are in \"dry [[fresco]]\", painted on top of a dry plaster surface rather than into wet plaster.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p= 361}} All the paintings appear to be the work of painters supported by discriminating connoisseurship and sophisticated patrons from an urban atmosphere. We know from literary sources that painting was widely practised and appreciated in the Gupta period. Unlike much Indian mural painting, compositions are not laid out in horizontal bands like a frieze, but show large scenes spreading in all directions from a single figure or group at the centre.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p=359}} The ceilings are also painted with sophisticated and elaborate decorative motifs, many derived from sculpture.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|pp= 355\u2013361}} The paintings in cave 1, which according to Spink was commissioned by [[Harishena|Harisena]] himself, concentrate on those Jataka tales which show previous lives of the Buddha as a king, rather than as deer or elephant or another Jataka animal.

Spink has over recent decades developed a very precise and circumstantial chronology for the second period of work on the site, which unlike earlier scholars, he places entirely in the 5th century. This is based on evidence such as the inscriptions and artistic style, dating of nearby cave temple sites, comparative chronology of the dynasties, combined with the many uncompleted elements of the caves.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=1\u201316}} He believes the earlier group of caves, which like other scholars he dates only approximately, to the period \"between 100 BCE \u2013 100 CE\", were at some later point completely abandoned and remained so \"for over three centuries\". This changed during the Hindu emperor [[Harishena]] of the [[Vakataka Dynasty]],<ref name=cohen83 /> who reigned from 460 to his death in 477, who sponsored numerous new caves during his reign. Harisena's rule extended the Central Indian Vakataka Empire to include a stretch of the east coast of India; the [[Gupta Empire]] ruled northern India at the same period, and the [[Pallava dynasty]] much of the south.<ref name=\"Spink 2006, 4\" />\n\n[[File:Ajanta Cave 26 Dagoba with praying monks.jpg|thumb|upright|Buddhist monks praying in front of the Dagoba of Chaitya Cave 26.]]\nAccording to Spink, Harisena encouraged a group of associates, including his prime minister Varahadeva and Upendragupta, the sub-king in whose territory Ajanta was, to dig out new caves, which were individually commissioned, some containing inscriptions recording the donation. This activity began in many caves simultaneously about 462. This activity was mostly suspended in 468 because of threats from the neighbouring Asmaka kings. Thereafter work continued on only Caves 1, Harisena's own commission, and 17\u201320, commissioned by Upendragupta. In 472 the situation was such that work was suspended completely, in a period that Spink calls \"the Hiatus\", which lasted until about 475, by which time the Asmakas had replaced Upendragupta as the local rulers.<ref>Spink (2006), 4\u20135</ref>\n\nWork was then resumed, but again disrupted by Harisena's death in 477, soon after which major excavation ceased, except at cave 26, which the Asmakas were sponsoring themselves. The Asmakas launched a revolt against Harisena's son, which brought about the end of the Vakataka Dynasty. In the years 478\u2013480 CE major excavation by important patrons was replaced by a rash of \"intrusions\" \u2013 statues added to existing caves, and small shrines dotted about where there was space between them. These were commissioned by less powerful individuals, some monks, who had not previously been able to make additions to the large excavations of the rulers and courtiers. They were added to the facades, the return sides of the entrances, and to walls inside the caves.<ref>Spink (2006), 5\u20136</ref> According to Spink, \"After 480, not a single image was ever made again at the site\".<ref>Spink (2006), 6</ref> However, there exists a Rashtrakuta inscription outside of cave 26 dateable to end of seventh or early 8th century, suggesting the caves were not abandoned until then.\n\nSpink does not use \"circa\" in his dates, but says that \"one should allow a margin of error of one year or perhaps even two in all cases\".<ref>Spink (2009), xx (quoted); Spink (2006), 15\u201316</ref>\n\n=== Hindu and Buddhist builders ===\nThe Ajanta Caves were built in a period when both the Buddha and the Hindu gods were simultaneously revered in Indian culture. According to Spink and other scholars, not only the Ajanta Caves but other nearby cave temples were sponsored and built by Hindus.<ref name=cohen83 />{{Sfn|Spink|2006|p=180}} This is evidenced by inscriptions wherein the role as well as the Hindu heritage of the donor is proudly proclaimed. According to Spink,\n\n{{Quote|\nThat one could worship both the Buddha and the Hindu gods may well account for Varahadeva's participation here, just as it can explain why the emperor Harisena himself could sponsor the remarkable Cave 1, even though most scholars agree that he was certainly a Hindu, like earlier Vakataka kings.\n|Walter Spink|''Ajanta: History and Development, Cave by Cave'',{{Sfn|Spink|2006|p=180}}}}\n\nThe role of Hindu artisans is confirmed by archaeological excavations across the river from the Ajanta caves. The caves must have employed a large workforce of artisans who likely lived for extended period of time nearby, across from the river near the site. Excavations have uncovered extensive brick structures for workers and visiting elite sponsors, along with Shaiva and Shakta Hindu deities such as a red sandstone image of [[Durga]] Mahishasuramardini. According to Yuko Yokoschi and Walter Spink, these excavated artifacts of the 5th century near the site suggest that the Ajanta caves deployed a huge number of builders.{{sfn|Spink|2009|p=14 with footnote 3}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Yuko Yokochi|editor=Hans Bakker|title=The V\u0101k\u0101\u1e6daka Heritage: Indian Culture at the Crossroads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CFuAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Egbert Forsten|isbn=978-90-6980-148-3|pages=172, context: 167\u2013178}}</ref>\n\n== Cave-by-cave ==\n[[File:Ajanta caves full panorama with cave numbers.jpg|center|thumb|800px|Ajanta caves panorama with cave numbers.

This cave, when first made, would have been a less prominent position, right at the end of the row. According to Spink, it is one of the last caves to have been excavated, when the best sites had been taken, and was never fully inaugurated for worship by the dedication of the Buddha image in the central shrine. This is shown by the absence of sooty deposits from butter lamps on the base of the shrine image, and the lack of damage to the paintings that would have happened if the garland-hooks around the shrine had been in use for any period of time. Spink states that the V\u0101k\u0101\u0163aka Emperor [[Harishena]] was the benefactor of the work, and this is reflected in the emphasis on imagery of royalty in the cave, with those Jataka tales being selected that tell of those previous lives of the Buddha in which he was royal.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 17, 31}}\n\nThe cliff has a more steep slope here than at other caves, so to achieve a tall grand facade it was necessary to cut far back into the slope, giving a large courtyard in front of the facade. There was originally a columned portico in front of the present facade, which can be seen \"half-intact in the 1880s\" in pictures of the site, but this fell down completely and the remains, despite containing fine carvings, were carelessly thrown down the slope into the river, from where they have been lost.<ref>Spink (2006), 17; [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00462000.html 1869 photo by Robert Gill at the [[British Library]], showing the porch already rather less than \"half-intact\"]</ref>\n\n[[File:008 Cave 1, In the Forest (34239644366).jpg|thumb|The frieze over Cave 1 front shows elephants, horses, bulls, lions, apsaras and meditating monks.]]\nThis cave (35.7 m x 27.6 m)<ref name=asicave1to29/> has one of the most elaborate carved fa\u00e7ades, with relief sculptures on entablature and ridges, and most surfaces embellished with decorative carving.

The cave has a front court with cells fronted by pillared vestibules on either side. These have a high plinth level. The cave has a porch with simple cells on both ends. The absence of pillared vestibules on the ends suggests that the porch was not excavated in the latest phase of Ajanta when pillared vestibules had become customary. Most areas of the porch were once covered with murals, of which many fragments remain, especially on the ceiling. There are three doorways: a central doorway and two side doorways. Two square windows were carved between the doorways to brighten the interiors.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 17\u201321}}\n\nEach wall of the hall inside is nearly {{convert|40|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|ft|m}} high.

It is placed at a significantly higher level, possibly because the artists realized that the rock quality at the lower and same level of other caves was poor and they had a better chance of a major vihara at an upper location.

These were commissioned by individuals.<ref>Spink (2006), 9; 140\u2013141</ref> Cave 9 arch has remnant profile that suggests that it likely had wooden fittings.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=131-132}}\n\nThe cave has a distinct apsidal shape, nave, aisle and an apse with an icon, an architecture and plan that reminds one of cathedrals built in Europe many centuries later. The aisle has a row of 23 pillars. The ceiling is vaulted. The stupa is at the center of the apse, with a circumambulation path around it. The stupa sits on a high cylindrical base.

Some of the panels and reliefs inside as well as outside Cave 10 do not make narrative sense, but are related to Buddhist legends.

It includes Yaksha dvarapala (guardian) images on the side of its ''vatayana'' (arches), flying couples, sitting Buddha, standing Buddhas and evidence that its ceiling was once painted.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=101-102}}\n\nThe Cave 19 drew upon on the plan and experimentation in Cave 9.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=26-27, 47-48}} It made a major departure from the earlier Hinayana tradition, by carving a Buddha into the stupa, a decision that states Spink must have come from \"the highest levels\" in the 5th-century Mahayana Buddhist establishment because the king and dynasty that built this cave was from the Shaivism Hindu tradition. Cave 19 excavation and stupa was likely in place by 467 CE, and its finishing and artistic work continued into the early 470s, but it too was an incomplete cave when it was dedicated in 471 CE.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=26-27, 34-35, 47-48, 56}}\n\nThe entrance facade of the Cave 19 worship hall is ornate. Two round pillars with fluted floral patterns and carved garlands support a porch. Its capital is an inverted lotus connecting to an amalaka.

Textile probably was one of the major exports to foreign lands, along with gems. These were exported first through the [[Red Sea]], and later through the [[Persian Gulf]], thereby bringing a period of economic and cultural exchange between the Indians, the Sasanian Empire and the Persian merchants before Islam was founded in the Arabian peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Brancaccio|first1=Pia|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|year= 2010|publisher= BRILL|isbn= 9004185259|pages= 83\u201387 with footnotes|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ajanta Cave 17, antechamber to the shrine, Adoration of the Buddha (color illustration).jpg|thumb|left|Many foreigners are included as devotees attending the Buddha's descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven, Cave 17.<ref name=\"Brancaccio 81\"/>{{refn|group=note|Actual photograph are available on Google.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&pg=PA305 here], or [https://goo.gl/maps/zvhsnX2JaZ32 full view]</ref>}}]]\nWhile scholars generally agree that these murals confirm trade and cultural connections between India and Sassanian west, their specific significance and interpretation varies.<ref name=\"Brancaccio 81\"/><ref name=\"Spink 27\"/> Brancaccio, for example, suggests that the ship and jars in them probably reflect foreign ships carrying wine imported to India.

In another painting in Cave 17, relating to the conversion of [[Nanda (Buddhism)|Nanda]], a man possibly from northeast Africa appears as a servant.<ref name=\"Brancaccio 81\"/> These representations show, states Brancaccio, that the artists were familiar with people of [[Sogdia]], [[Central Asia]], [[Persia]] and possibly [[East Africa]].<ref name=\"Brancaccio 81\"/>{{refn|group=note|The expansion of Buddhism into Gandhara and Central Asia began during the 1st millennium BCE.

The territory was ceded to the British by [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]] by a treaty on 25 June 1818. \nIt was under the [[Bengal Presidency]] until 1936 when it became part of the [[North-Western Provinces]]  comissionat el 1842.<ref>''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931</ref> Finally on 1 April 1871 it became a separate province as Ajmer-Merwara-Kekri. \nIt became a part of [[independent India]] on 15 August 1947 when the British left India.<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_BrProvinces.htm Provinces of British India]</ref>\n\nThe province consisted of the [[district]]s of [[Ajmer district|Ajmer]] and [[Mewar|Merwar]], which were physically separated from the rest of British India forming an [[enclave]] amidst the many [[princely state]]s of [[Rajputana]]. Unlike these states, which were ruled by local nobles who acknowledged British [[suzerainty]], Ajmer-Merwara was administered directly by the British.\n\nIn 1842 the two districts were under a single commissioner, then they were separated in 1856 and were administered by the [[East India Company]]. Finally, after 1858, by a chief commissioner who was subordinate to the [[Governor-General of India]]'s agent for the [[Rajputana Agency]].\n\n==Extent and geography==\nThe area of the province was {{convert|2710|sqmi|km2}}. The plateau, on whose centre stands the town of Ajmer, may be considered as the highest point in the plains of [[North India]]; from the circle of hills which hem it in, the country slopes away on every side - towards river valleys on the east, south, west and towards the [[Thar Desert]] region on the north. The [[Aravalli Range]] is the distinguishing feature of the district. The range of hills which runs between Ajmer and [[Nasirabad, Ajmer|Nasirabad]] marks the watershed of the continent of [[India]]. The rain which falls on the southeastern slopes drains into the [[Chambal River|Chambal]], and so into the [[Bay of Bengal]]; that which falls on the northwest side into the [[Luni River]], which discharges itself into the [[Rann of Kutch]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ajmere-Merwara|volume=1|page=453}}</ref>\n\nThe province is on the border of what may be called the [[arid zone]]; it is the debatable land between the north-eastern and south-western [[monsoon]]s, and beyond the influence of either. The south-west monsoon sweeps up the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] valley from [[Bombay]] and crossing the tableland at [[Neemuch]] gives copious supplies to [[Malwa]], [[Jhalawar]] and [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] and the countries which lie in the course of the Chambal River.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe clouds which strike [[Kathiawar]] and [[Kutch]] are deprived of a great deal of their moisture by the hills in those countries (now the majority of this region is in [[Gujarat]] state within independent [[India]]), and the greater part of the remainder is deposited on [[Mount Abu]] and the higher slopes of the Aravalli Range, leaving but little for Merwara, where the hills are lower, and still less for Ajmer. It is only when the monsoon is in considerable force that Merwara gets a plentiful supply from it. The north-eastern monsoon sweeps up the valley of the [[Ganges]] from the Bay of Bengal and waters the northern part of Rajasthan, but hardly penetrates farther west than the longitude of Ajmer. The rainfall of the district depends on the varying strength of these two monsoons. The agriculturist of Ajmer-Merwara could never rely upon two good harvests in succession.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn ancient times, the Mair Gurjars were the dominant inhabitants. They were defeated by the Chauhan Kings Rao Anoop and Rao Anhal, whose descendents the Rawat-Thakurs and Cheeta-Kathat were the dominant group here. These castes continue to have influence on the politics of the region.\n\nBefore the arrival of the British, [[Rajput]]s, Jats, the Kathats, Cheetas and Rawat Rajputs were land-holders, as well as cultivators. \"Thakur\" was the title of the Rajputs and Rawat-Rajputs, 11 prominent Rajput chieftains were Bhinai, Pisangan, Kharwa, Masuda, Bandanwara, Para, Kairot, Junia, Baghera, Tanoti, and Bagsuri.These were  prominent Rajput Thikanas of the Mertia/Jodha  clan. Prominent chieftains of the Mehrawats\\Kathats were the lords of Athoon, Chaang, Shyamgarh, Borwa etc. \"Khan\" was the title of Merat Rajputs, such as the Khan of Athun, a major Thikana of the Kathat clan, The two major thikanas of Rawat Rajputs are Bhim ruled by the sujawat clan and Diver, ruled by the Varaat clan .Thakur is the title used by the Rawat Rajputs and many Mehrats who refer each other as Thaakar in general conversation.\n\n===British rule===\nPart of the [[Ajmer region]], the territory of the future province was ceded to the British by [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]] of [[Gwalior State]] as part of a treaty dated 25 June 1818. Then in May 1823 the Merwara (Mewar) part was ceded to Britain by [[Udaipur State]]. Thereafter Ajmer-Merwara was administered directly by the British [[East India Company]]. After the Indian Mutiny of 1857, in 1858 the powers of the Company were transferred to the British Crown and the [[Governor-General of India]]. His administration of Ajmer-Merwara was controlled by a chief commissioner who was subordinate to the British agent for the [[Rajputana Agency]].<ref>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_145.gif Ajmer Merwara] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], 1909, v. 5, p.&nbsp;137-146.</ref>\n\n====Superintendents for Ajmer ====\n* 9 Jul 1818{{snd}}17 Jul 1818  Nixon\n*18 Jul 1818{{snd}}15 Dec 1824  Francis Boyle Shannon Wilder       (1785\u20131849) \n*16 Dec 1824{{snd}}21 Apr 1825  Richard Moore (1st time)\n*22 Apr 1825{{snd}}23 Oct 1827  Henry Middleton\n*24 Oct 1827{{snd}}28 Nov 1831  Richard Cavendish\n*29 Nov 1831{{snd}}1 Jul 1832  Richard Moore (2nd time)\n* 2 Jul 1832{{snd}}16 Apr 1834  Alexander Speirs\n*17 Apr 1834{{snd}}30 Jun 1836  George Frederick Edmonstone        (1813\u20131864)\n* 1 Jul 1836{{snd}}25 Jul 1837  Charles E.

In 1950 it became [[Ajmer State]], which on 1 November 1956, was merged into the state of [[Rajasthan]].\n\nThe Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952 was the landmark in the legal history of land reforms in Rajasthan which was followed by Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 that became applicable to the whole of Rajasthan. The overriding effect of this Act provided relief to the existing tenants and the rights accrued to tenants accordingly. Now the Jats are major land holders in the region.\n\n==See also==\n*Rawat Rajputs\n*The [[Mers]] are a [[Hindu caste]] from the Gujarat and Central India who emigrated hundred of years ago from

"{{Unreferenced|date=September 2010}}\n{{Wiktionary|abatement}}\n{{Wills, trusts, estates}}\n\n'''Abatement of debts and legacies''' is a [[common law]] doctrine of [[will (law)|wills]] that holds that when the equitable [[asset]]s of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately, and they must accept a [[dividend]].<ref>{{cite

sufficient to pay them in full, the legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given specially to any particular legacy. Annuities are also subject to the same rule as general legacies.\n\nThe order of abatement is usually:\n# Intestate property\n# The residuary of the estate\n# General Devises\u2014''i.e.'', cash gifts\n# Demonstrative Devises\u2014''i.e.'', cash gifts from a specific account, stocks, bonds, securities, etc.\n# Specific Devises\u2014''i.e.'', specified items of personal property, real property, etc.\nNon-probate property\u2014''i.e.'', life insurance policies\u2014do not abate.\n\n==Definitions==\nA '''specific devise''', is a specific gift in a will to a specific person other than an amount of money. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving his $500,000 yacht to his brother Mike, the yacht would be a specific devise.\n\nA '''general devise''', is a monetary gift to a specific person to be satisfied out of the overall estate. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving $500,000 to his son Sam then the money would be a general devise.\n\nA '''demonstrative devise''', is money given from a particular account.  For example, \"$10,000 to be paid from the sale of my GM stock.\"\n\nA '''residual devise''' is one left to a devisee after all specific and general devices have been made.  For example, James's will might say: \"I give all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate to my daughter Lilly.\" Lilly would be the residual devisee and entitled to James's [[residuary estate]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abatement Of Debts And Legacies}}\n[[Category:Common law]]\n[[Category:Wills and trusts]]\n[[Category:Articles lacking sources from June 2009]]\n[[Category:All articles lacking sources]]", "sha1": "6yomsb57c2yk6zllaauwj3l40eer95x"}}, {"title": "Abatement in litigation", "ns": "0", "id": "2655", "redirect": {"title": "Abatement"}, "revision": {"id": "528472860", "parentid": "15901050", "timestamp": "2012-12-17T13:52:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Abatement]]", "sha1": "he0g1qrp6axxv3r1y00czf80pyczjjx"}}, {"title": "Abatement of false lights", "ns": "0", "id": "2656", "redirect": {"title": "Abatement"}, "revision": {"id": "528472863", "parentid": "15901051", "timestamp": "2012-12-17T13:52:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Abatement]]", "sha1": "he0g1qrp6axxv3r1y00czf80pyczjjx"}}, {"title": "Abatement in commerce", "ns": "0", "id": "2657", "redirect": {"title": "Abatement"}, "revision": {"id": "528472866", "parentid": "15901052", "timestamp": "2012-12-17T13:52:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Abatement]]", "sha1": "he0g1qrp6axxv3r1y00czf80pyczjjx"}}, {"title": "Abatement in heraldry", "ns": "0", "id": "2658", "redirect": {"title": "Abatement (heraldry)"}, "revision": {"id": "15901053", "parentid": "3307140", "timestamp": "2004-04-23T12:52:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "Pcb21", "id": "7320"}, "comment": "typo", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Abatement (heraldry)]]", "sha1": "3mlf0hlrqnwzinsjaqvymyzonifehz9"}}, {"title": "American war of independence", "ns": "0", "id": "2659", "redirect": {"title": "American Revolutionary War"}, "revision": {"id": "783846623", "parentid": "290580273", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T01:20:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[American Revolutionary War]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative name}}\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "30y8rodlzn4lt368gv7dxjxiuyrk69h"}}, {"title": "Affection", "ns": "0", "id": "2661", "revision": {"id": "866455601", "parentid": "862978040", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T13:02:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Praxy2018", "id": "34992285"}, "comment": "spellings and grammatical errors", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Public Affection|the band formerly known as Public Affection|Live (band)}}\n\n{{other uses}}\n\n{{Emotion}}\n\n'''Affection,''' '''attraction''', '''infatuation''', or '''fondness''' is a \"[[disposition]] or state of mind or body\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/affection|title=Affection - Define Affection at Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref> that is often associated with a [[feeling]] or type of [[love]].

The following description, for the most part, was written in the early 20th century, and it should be understood as a historical document.\n\n== Affiliation procedures in England ==\nIn England a number of [[statute]]s on the subject have been passed, the chief being the Bastardy Act of the Parliament of 1845, and the Bastardy Laws Amendment Acts of 1872 and 1873.\nThe mother of a [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastard]] may summon the putative father to petty sessions within 12 months of the [[Childbirth|birth]] (or at any later time if he is proved to have contributed to the child's support within 12 months after the birth), and the justices, after hearing evidence on both sides, may, if the mother's evidence be corroborated in some material particular, adjudge the man to be the putative father of the child, and order him to pay a sum not exceeding five shillings a week for its maintenance, together with a sum for expenses incidental to the birth, or the [[funeral]] expenses, if it has died before the date of order, and the costs of the proceedings. An order ceases to be valid after the child reaches the age of 13, but the justices (also referred to as Gold writers under these circumstances){{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} may in the order direct the payments to be continued until the child is 16 years of age.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Affiliation|volume=1|pages=300-301}}</ref> \n\nAn appeal to quarter sessions is open to the defendant, and a further appeal on questions of law to the [[King's Bench]] by rule ''nisi or certiorari''. Should the child afterwards become chargeable to the [[parish]], the sum due by the father may be received by the parish officer. When a bastard child, whose mother has not obtained an order, becomes chargeable to the parish, the guardians may proceed against the putative father for a contribution.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAny woman who is single, a widow, or a married woman living apart from her husband, may make an application for a summons, and it is immaterial where the child is begotten, provided it is born in England. An application for a summons may be made before the birth of the child, but in this case, the statement of the mother must be in the form of a sworn deposition. The defendant must be over 14 years of age. No agreement on the part of the woman to take a sum down in a discharge of the liability of the father is a bar to the making of an affiliation order. In the case of twins, it is usual to make separate applications and obtain separate summonses.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe Summary [[Jurisdiction]] Act (1879) makes due provision for the enforcement of an order of affiliation. In the case of [[soldier]]s an affiliation order cannot be enforced in the usual way, but by the [[Army]] Act (1881), if an order has been made against a soldier of the regular forces, and a copy of such order be sent to the secretary of state, he may order a portion of the soldier's pay to be retained. There is no such special legislation with regard to [[sailor]]s in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n== Affiliation procedures in other countries ==\n\nIn the [[British colonies]], and in the states of the United States (with the exception of California, Idaho, Missouri, Oregon, Texas and Utah), there is some procedure (usually termed ''filiation'') akin to that described above, by means of which a mother can obtain a contribution to the support of her illegitimate child from the putative father. The amount ordered to be paid may subsequently be increased or diminished (1905; 94 N.Y. Supplt. 372).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn the continent of Europe, however, the [[legislation]] of the various countries differs rather widely. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Serbia and the [[canton of Geneva]] provide no means of inquiry into the paternity of an illegitimate child, and consequently all support of the child falls upon the mother; on the other hand, Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the majority of the [[Swiss cantons]] provide for an inquiry into the paternity of illegitimate children, and the law casts a certain amount of responsibility upon the father.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAffiliation, in France, is a term applied to a species of adoption by which the person adopted succeeds equally with other heirs to the acquired, but not to the inherited, property of the deceased.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn India, affiliation cases are decided by section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). According to this section - among other things - if a person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his illegitimate child, a magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of such child.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adoption]]\n* [[Illegitimacy]]\n* [[Paternity (law)]]\n* [[Poor Laws]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{wiktionary-inline|affiliation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Affiliation (Family Law)}}\n[[Category:Family law]]\n[[Category:Wills and trusts]]", "sha1": "5rtxso61ys1omrvzbepx9a4zjbb2981"}}, {"title": "Affinity", "ns": "0", "id": "2663", "revision": {"id": "854897371", "parentid": "821881124", "timestamp": "2018-08-14T15:06:51Z", "contributor": {"username": "Namangwari", "id": "577285"}, "comment": "/* Commerce, finance and law */ distinguished between canadian and US Affinity credit unions", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wiktionary|affinity}}\n\n'''Affinity''' may refer to:\n\n{{TOC right}}\n== Commerce, finance and law ==\n* [[Affinity (law)]], kinship by marriage\n* [[Affinity analysis]], a market research and business management technique \n* [[Affinity fraud]], a type of scam targeting a specific demographic\n* [[Affinity marketing]], a method of extending market reach by forming partnerships and cross-selling relationships\n\n* [[Affinity Equity Partners]], an Asian private equity firm\n* [[Affinity Credit Union]], a Saskatchewan-based credit union\n* Affinity Federal Credit Union, a New Jersey-based [[credit union]] chartered in 1935 ([https://www.affinityfcu.com/about-us/history.aspx source])\n\n== Religion and belief ==\n* [[Affinity (canon law)]], a kinship arising from the sexual intercourse of a man and a woman\n* [[Affinity (Christian organisation)]], formerly known as the British Evangelical Council\n* [[Affinity group]], a private, non-commercial and non-governmental organisation formed around a shared interest or goal\n\n== Science and technology ==\n* ''Affinity'', the UK's first road-legal solar car, built by [[Cambridge University Eco Racing]]\n* [[Affinity (mathematics)]], an affine transformation preserving collinearity\n* [[Affinity (pharmacology)]], a characterisation of protein-ligand binding strength\n* [[Affinity (sociology)]], a shared interest and commitment between persons in groups and/or willingness to associate\n* [[Affinity (taxonomy)]], a suggestion of common descent or type\n* [[Affinity chromatography]]\n* [[Affinity electrophoresis]]\n* [[Affinity laws]], laws used in hydraulics to express relationships between variables involved in fan or pump performance\n* [[Affine transformation]], a type of transformation applied to a geometry\n* [[Chemical affinity]], used to describe or characterise elements' or compounds' readiness to form bonds\n* [[Electron affinity]]\n* [[Processor affinity]], a computing term for the assignment of a task to a given core of a multicore CPU\n* [[Serif Europe]]'s Affinty series of programs\n** [[Affinity Photo]], a raster graphics editor\n** [[Affinity Designer]], a vector illustration editor\n\n== Media-related ==\n\n===Music===\n* [[Affinity (band)]], a jazz/rock band active in the late 60s and early 70s\n** [[Affinity (Affinity album)|''Affinity'' (Affinity album)]], their eponymous d\u00e9but album\n* [[Affinity (Bill Evans album)|''Affinity'' (Bill Evans album)]], an album by jazz pianist Bill Evans\n* [[Affinity (Haken album)|''Affinity'' (Haken album)]], an album by the progressive metal band Haken\n* [[Affinity (Oscar Peterson album)|''Affinity'' (Oscar Peterson album)]], an album by jazz pianist Oscar Peterson\n* [[Johnny Alegre Affinity]], a jazz collective based in Manila\n\n===Other media===\n* [[Affinity (novel)|''Affinity'' (novel)]], a 1999 novel by Sarah Waters\n*: [[Affinity (film)|''Affinity'' (film)]], a 2008 feature film based on this novel\n<!--Redirects to [[Fire Emblem]], but not mentioned there;

The whole territory, from the junction of the [[Kokcha]] river with the [[Amu Darya]] on the north-east to the province of [[Herat province|Herat]] on the south-west, was some {{convert|500|mi|km}} in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the [[Hindu Kush]] of 114 miles (183&nbsp;km). It thus comprised about {{convert|57,000|sqmi|km2}} or roughly two-ninths of the former [[Kingdom of Afghanistan]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the [[Karakum Desert]].\n\nThe province included the khanates of [[Kunduz]], [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Tashkurgan]], [[Balkh]], and [[Akcha]] in the east and the four khanates or ''Chahar Vidayet'' (\"four domains\") of [[Saripul]], [[Shibarghan]], [[Andkhoy]], and [[Maymana]] in the west.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Afghan_Turkestan Afghan Turkestan, 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']</ref>\n\n== Population ==\nThe bulk of the people are [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] with large concentrations of [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Tajik people|Tajik]] and [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]].<ref>[[USA Today]] - [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/05/13/pashtuns.htm Pashtuns say they're being brutalized], May 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAncient Balkh or [[Bactria]] was an integral part of [[Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex]], and was occupied by [[Indo-Iranians]]. In the 5th century BCE, it became a province of the [[Achaemenian Empire]] and later became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. About 250 BC [[Diodotus of Bactria|Diodotus (Theodotus)]], governor of [[Bactria]] under the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucidae]], declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to [[Parthia]]n and nomadic movements about 126 BC. After this came a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.  The district was devastated by [[Genghis Khan]], and has never since fully recovered its prosperity. For about a century it belonged to the [[Delhi]] empire, and then fell into [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] hands.  In the 18th century it formed part of the dominion of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], and so remained under his son Timur.  But under the fratricidal wars of Timur's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs.  At the beginning of the 19th century they belonged to Bukhara; but under the [[emir]] Dost Mahommed the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in 1850, Akcha and the four western khanates in 1855, and Kunduz in 1859.  The sovereignty over [[Andkhoy]], [[Shibarghan]], [[Saripul]], and [[Maymana]] was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim.  Under the strong rule of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]] these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of [[Habibullah Khan|Habibullah]] the bonds once more relaxed. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, many ethnic Pashtuns either [[Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan|voluntarily or involuntarily settled in Afghan Turkestan]].\n\nIn 1890, the [[district of Qataghan and Badakhshan]] was divided from Afghan Turkestan and made into the [[Qataghan-Badakhshan Province]]. Administration of the province was assigned to the [[Northern Bureau]] in [[Kabul]].<ref name=mcchesiraj> Fayz Mu\u1e25ammad Katib. Siraj al-tawar\u0131kh. V. III.

Older spellings include '''Karahisar-i Sahip''', '''Afium-Kara-hissar''' and '''Afyon Karahisar'''. The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the [[Turkish Parliament]] in 2004.\n\n==History==\n[[File:15th century map of Turkey region.jpg|thumb|Photo of a 15th-century map showing region containing Nicopolis.]]\n\nThe top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time. It was known to the [[Hittites]] as '''Hapanuwa''', and was later occupied by [[Phrygians]], [[Lydians]] and [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] until it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander the city (now known as  '''Akroin\u03bfn''' (\u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03ca\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd) or '''Nikopolis''' (\u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in [[Ancient Greek]]), was ruled by the [[Seleucids]] and the kings of [[Pergamon]], then [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] after his [[Battle of Akroinon|victory]] over [[Arab]] besiegers in 740 renamed the city '''Nicopolis''' (Greek for \"city of victory\"). The [[Seljuq Turks]] then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to '''Kara Hissar''' (\"black castle\") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201&nbsp;meters above the town. Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the [[S\u00e2hib Ata]] and then the [[Germiyanids]].\n\nThe castle was much fought over during the [[Crusades]] and was finally conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid I]] in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of [[Timur Lenk]] in 1402. It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.\n\nThe area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city. In 1902, a fire burning for 32 hours destroyed parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - Turkish town burnt |day_of_week=Monday |date=1 September 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36861| }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock. During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] campaign (part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]])  Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by Greek forces. However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region. After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nThe region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name ''Afyon'') until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.  Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.  They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the [[poppy straw]] method of extraction.<ref>https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_adidu_licitcultivation{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAfyon was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927-1938.<ref>[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=2009-06-03 }}.

There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey. However [[Afyon Kocatepe University]] opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.\nNowadays Afyon is known for its [[marble]] (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its ''[[sucuk]]'' (spiced sausages), its ''[[kaymak]]'' (meaning either ''cream'' or a white [[Turkish Delight]]) and various handmade weavings. There is also a large cement factory.\n\nThis is a natural crossroads, the routes from [[Ankara]] to [[\u0130zmir]] and from [[Istanbul]] to [[Antalya]] intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys. There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine. Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities. There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight.\n\n===Transport===\nAfyon is also an important rail junction between \u0130zmir, [[Konya]], Ankara and Istanbul. Afyon is on the route of the planned high-speed rail line between Ankara and Izmir.\n\nSee also: [[Afyon Ali \u00c7etinkaya railway station]], [[Afyon City railway station]]\n\n===Cuisine ===\n\n==== Courses ====\n** ''sucuk'' - the famed local speciality, a spicy beef sausage, eaten fried or grilled.

With him began the long period of ascendancy of the great academies of Babylonia {{Harv|Oesterley|Box|1920}}, around the year 220. He is commonly known simply as '''Rav''' (or '''Rab''', {{lang-he-n|\u05e8\u05d1}}).\n\n==Overview==\nHis surname, '''Arikha''' (English, \"Long\"\u2014that is, \"Tall\"; it occurs only once\u2014''Hullin'' 137b), he owed to his height, which, according to a reliable record, exceeded that of his contemporaries. Others, reading '''Arekha,''' consider it an honorary title, \"Lecturer\" (Weiss, ''Dor,'' iii. 147; Jastrow, ''Dictionary'' under the word). In the traditional literature he is referred to almost exclusively as '''Rav''', \"the Master\", (both his contemporaries and posterity recognizing in him a master), just as his teacher, [[Judah HaNasi|Judah I]], was known simply as Rabbi. He is called Rabbi Abba only in the ''[[tannaitic]]'' literature (for instance, ''Tosefta'', ''Beitzah '' 1:7), where a number of his sayings are preserved. He occupies a middle position between the ''Tannaim'' and the ''Amoraim'', and is accorded the right, rarely conceded to one who is only an '' 'amora'', of disputing the opinion of a ''tanna'' (''Bava Batra '' 42a and elsewhere).\n\nRav was a descendant of a distinguished Babylonian family which claimed to trace its origin to [[Shimei]], brother of [[King David]] (''Sanhedrin'' 5a; ''Ketubot '' 62b). His father, Aibo, was a brother of [[Hiyya bar Abba|Chiyya]], who lived in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and was a highly esteemed scholar in the collegiate circle of the patriarch Judah I. From his associations in the house of his uncle, and later as his uncle's disciple and as a member of the academy at [[Sepphoris]], Rav acquired such an extraordinary knowledge of traditional lore as to make him its foremost exponent in his native land. While Judah I was still living, Rav, having been duly ordained as teacher\u2014though not without certain restrictions (''Sanhedrin'' 5a)\u2014returned to [[Babylonia]], where he at once began a career that was destined to mark an epoch in the development of Babylonian Judaism.\n\nThe [[Aleinu]] prayer first appeared in the manuscript of the [[Rosh Hashana]] liturgy by Rav. He included it in the Rosh Hashana [[mussaf]] service as a prologue to the Kingship portion of the [[Amidah]]. For that reason some attribute to Rav the authorship, or at least the revising, of Aleinu.<ref>Jacobson, B.S., ''The Weekday Siddur: An Exposition and Analysis of its Structure, Contents, Language and Ideas'' (2nd ed, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) page 307; Nulman, Macy, ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) page 24.</ref>\n\n==Beginning of the Talmudic Age==\nIn the annals of the Babylonian schools the year of his arrival is recorded as the starting-point in the chronology of the Talmudic age. It was the 530th year of the [[Seleucid]]an and the 219th year of the [[common era]]. As the scene of his activity, Rav first chose [[Nehardea]], where the [[exilarch]] appointed him ''[[agoranomos]]'', or market-master, and [[Rav Shela|Rabbi Shela]] made him lecturer (''amora'') of his college (''[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Bava Batra'' v. 15a; ''Yoma,'' 20b). Then he removed to [[Sura (city)|Sura]], on the [[Euphrates]], where he established a school of his own, which soon became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. As a renowned teacher of the Law and with hosts of disciples, who came from all sections of the Jewish world, Rav lived and worked in Sura until his death. [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]], another disciple of Judah I, at the same time brought to the academy at Nehardea a high degree of prosperity; in fact, it was at the school of Rav that Jewish learning in Babylonia found its permanent home and center. Rav's activity made Babylonia independent of Palestine, and gave it that predominant position which it was destined to occupy for several centuries.\n\n==Rav as teacher==\nThe method of treatment of the traditional material to which the Talmud owes its origin was established in Babylonia by Rav. That method takes the ''Mishnah'' of Judah ha-Nasi as a text or foundation, adding to it the other ''tannaitic'' traditions, and deriving from all of them the theoretical explanations and practical applications of the religious Law. The legal and ritual opinions recorded in Rav's name and his disputes with Samuel constitute the main body of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. His numerous disciples\u2014some of whom were very influential and who, for the most part, were also disciples of Samuel\u2014amplified and, in their capacity as instructors and by their discussions, continued the work of Rav. In the Babylonian schools, Rav was rightly referred to as \"our great master.\" Rav also exercised a great influence for good upon the moral and religious conditions of his native land, not only indirectly through his disciples, but directly by reason of the strictness with which he repressed abuses in matters of marriage and divorce, and denounced ignorance and negligence in matters of ritual observance.\n\n==Ethical teaching==\nRav, says tradition, found an open, neglected field and fenced it in (''Hullin'' 110a). Special attention was given by him to the [[liturgy]] of the [[synagogue]]. He is reputed to be the author of one of the finest compositions in the [[Siddur|Jewish prayerbook]], the ''[[Mussaf]]'' service of the [[Rosh Hashanah|New Year]]. In this noble prayer are evinced profound religious feeling and exalted thought, as well as ability to use the [[Hebrew language]] in a natural, expressive, and classical manner (''Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah'' i. 57a). The many [[homiletic]] and [[ethical]] (haggadistic) sayings recorded of him show similar ability. As a haggadist, Rav is surpassed by none of the Babylonian ''[[Amoraim]]''. He is the only one of the Babylonian teachers whose haggadistic utterances approach in number and contents those of the Palestinian haggadists. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] has preserved a large number of his [[halakha|halakic]] and [[Aggadah|aggadistic]] utterances; and the Palestinian ''[[Midrashim]]'' also contain many of his ''aggadot''. Rav delivered homiletic discourses, both in the [[Beth midrash]] (college) and in the synagogues. He especially loved to treat in his homilies of the events and personages of Biblical history; and many beautiful and genuinely poetic embellishments of the Biblical record, which have become common possession of the [[aggadah]], are his creations. His ''aggadah'' is particularly rich in thoughts concerning the moral life and the relations of human beings to one another. A few of these utterances may be quoted here: (''Shabbat'' 10b)\n* \"The commandments of the [[Torah]] were only given to purify men's morals\" (''Genesis Raba'' 44).\n* \"Whatever may not properly be done in public is forbidden even in the most secret chamber\" (''Shabbat'' 64b).\n* \"It is well that people busy themselves with the study of the Law and the performance of charitable deeds, even when not entirely disinterested; for the habit of right-doing will finally make the intention pure\" (''Pesahim'' 50b).\n* \"Man will be called to account for having deprived himself of the good things which the world offered\" (''Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin'' end).\n* \"Whosoever hath not pity upon his fellow man is no child of [[Abraham]]\" (''Beitzah'' 32b).\n* \"It is better to cast oneself into a fiery furnace than publicly to put to shame one's fellow creature\" (''Bava Metzia'' 59a).\n* \"One should never betroth himself to a woman without having seen her; one might subsequently discover in her a blemish because of which one might loathe her and thus transgress the commandment: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself'\" (''Kiddushin'' 41a).\n* \"A father should never prefer one child above another; the example of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] shows what evil results may follow therefrom\".\n\n==Rav reproves extreme asceticism==\nRav loved the ''Book of Ecclesiasticus'' ([[Sirach]]), and warned his disciple [[Hamnuna]] against unjustifiable asceticism by quoting advice contained therein\u2014that, considering the transitoriness of human life (''Eruvin'' 54a), one should not despise the good things of this world. To the celestial joys of the future he was accustomed to refer in the following poetic words: (''Berakhot'' 17a)\n\n:\"There is naught on earth to compare with the future life. In the world to come there shall be neither eating nor drinking, neither trading nor toil, neither hatred nor envy; but the righteous shall sit with crowns upon their heads, and rejoice in the radiance of the Divine Presence\".\n\nRav also devoted much attention to [[Mysticism|mystical]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] speculations which the rabbis connect with the Biblical account of creation (''Genesis'' 1, ''Ma'aseh Bereshit''), the vision of the mysterious chariot of God (''Ezekiel'' 1, ''Ma'aseh Merkabah''), and the [[Divine name|Divine Name]]. Many of his important utterances testify to his tendency in this direction (''Hagigah'' 12a, ''Kiddushin'' 71a).\n\n==Status in life==\nConcerning the social position and the personal history of Rav we were not informed. That he was rich seems probable; for he appears to have occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture (''Hullin'' 105a). He is referred to as the son of noblemen (Shabbat 29a) but it is not clear if this is an affectionate term or a true description of his status. [[Rashi]] does tell us that he is being described as the son of great men. That he was highly respected by the [[Gentile]]s as well as by the Jews of Babylonia is proved by the friendship which existed between him and the last [[Parthia]]n king, [[Artabanus V (of Parthia)|Artaban]] (''Avodah Zarah'' 10b). He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of [[Ardashir I|Ardeshir]], founder of the [[Sassanian]] dynasty, although [[Samuel of Nehardea]] probably did so. Rav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, [[Mar Ukba]] and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the ''Talmud'', the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. The latter did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple [[Rav Huna]]. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of [[exilarch]] (''resh galuta'') (''Hullin'' 92a).\n\nRav died at an advanced age, deeply mourned by numerous disciples and the entire Babylonian Jewry, which he had raised from comparative insignificance to the leading position in Judaism (''Shabbat'' 110a, ''Mo'ed Katan'' 24a).\n\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|'Abba 'Arika}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&artid=127|article=Abba Arika}}\n* {{citation|surname1=Oesterley|given1=W.

He had, however, anticipated the rabbis' request, and wrote them that he had appeased the informers but not the accuser. The witty enigmatic letter describing this incident, preserved in the Talmud,<ref>''Yer. [[Meg.]]'' chapter III, 74a</ref> is in the main pure Hebrew, and even includes Hebrew translations of Greek proper names, to avoid the danger of possible exposure should the letter have fallen into the hands of enemies and informers (compare ''[[Eruvin (tractate)|Eruvin]]'' 53b).<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n\nAfter his ordination he declined a teacher's position, recommending in his stead a more needy friend, [[R.

J.'' ii. 14, \u00a7 5; [[Marcus Jastrow|Jastrow]], ''Dict.'' p.&nbsp;838</ref> from which some of the most prominent teachers of the next generation issued. He did not, however, confine his activity to Caesarea, where he originated several ritualistic rules,<ref>''Yer.

Shabbat'' chapter VIII, 11a; ''Yer. [[Yevamot]]'' chapter I, 2d</ref> In the course of these travels he made a point of complying with all local enactments, even where such compliance laid him open to the charge of inconsistency.<ref>''Yer. Berakhot'' chapter VIII, 12a; ''Yer. [[Beitzah]]'' chapter I, 60d</ref> On the other hand, where circumstances required it, he did not spare even the princes of his people.<ref>''Yer. [[Avodah Zarah]]'' chapter I, 39b</ref> Where, however, the rigorous exposition of laws worked hardship on the masses, he did not scruple to modify the decisions of his colleagues for the benefit of the community.<ref>''Shabbat'' 134b; ''Yer. Shabbat'' chapter XVII, 16b; ''Yer. [[Mo'ed Katan]]'' chapter I, 80b</ref> As for himself, he was very strict in the observance of the laws. On one occasion he ordered some [[Samaritan]] wine, but subsequently learning that there were no longer any strict observers of the dietary laws among the Samaritans, with the assistance of his colleagues, [[\u1e24iyya b. Abba]], Rabbi Ammi, and Rabbi Assi, he investigated the report, and, ascertaining it to be well founded, did not hesitate to declare the Samaritans, for all ritualistic purposes, [[Gentiles]].<ref>''Yer. Avodah Zarah'' chapter V, 44d; ''[[Hullin]]'' 6a</ref><ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n\n==Abbahu and \u1e24iyya b. Abba==\nR. Abbahu's chief characteristic seems to have been modesty. While lecturing in different towns, he met [[R. \u1e24iyya b. Abba]], who was lecturing on intricate ''[[halakic]]'' themes. As Abbahu delivered popular sermons, the masses naturally crowded to hear him, and deserted the halakist. At this apparent slight, R. \u1e24iyya manifested chagrin, and R. Abbahu hastened to comfort him by comparing himself to the pedler of glittering fineries that always attracted the eyes of the masses, while his rival was a trader in precious stones, the virtues and values of which were appreciated only by the connoisseur. This speech not having the desired effect, R. Abbahu showed special respect for his slighted colleague by following him for the remainder of that day. \"What,\" said Abbahu, \"is my modesty as compared with that of R. [[Abba of Acre]] (Acco), who does not even remonstrate with his interpreter for interpolating his own comments in the lecturer's expositions.\" When his wife reported to him that his interpreter's wife had boasted of her own husband's greatness, R. Abbahu simply said, \"What difference does it make which of us is really the greater, so long as through both of us heaven is glorified?\" (''[[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]]'' 40a). His principle of life he expressed in the maxim,\n\n{{quote|Let man ever be of the persecuted, and not of the persecutors; for there are none among the birds more persecuted than turtle-doves and pigeons, and the [[Scriptures]] declare them worthy of the [[Altar (Bible)|altar]].|''[[Bava Kamma]]'' 93a<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>}}\n\nR. Abbahu, though eminent as a halakist, was more distinguished as a [[haggadist]] and controversialist. He had many interesting disputes with the [[Christians]] of his day (''Shab.'' 152b; ''[[San.]]'' 39a; ''[[Av. Zarah]]'' 4a). Sometimes these disputes were of a jocular nature. Thus, a heretic bearing the name of Sason (=Joy) once remarked to him, \"In the [[Olam Haba|next world]] your people will have to draw water for me; for thus it is written in the [[Bible]] ([[Isaiah]] 12:3), 'With joy shall ye draw water.'\" To this R. Abbahu replied, \"Had the Bible said 'for joy' [''le-sason''], it would mean as thou sayest, but since it says 'with joy' [''be-sason''], it means that we shall make bottles of thy hide and fill them with water\" (''[[Suk.]]'' 48b). These controversies, though forced on him, provoked resentment, and it is even related that his physician, Jacob the [[Jewish schisms|Schismatic]] (''Minaah''), was slowly poisoning him, but [[R. Ammi]] and [[R. Assi]] discovered the crime in time (''Av. Zarah'' 28a).<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n\nAbbahu had two sons, Zeira and \u1e24anina. Some writers ascribe to him a third son, Abimi ([[Wilhelm Bacher|Bacher]], ''Agada der Babylonischen Amor\u00e4er''). Abbahu sent \u1e24anina to the academy at Tiberias, where he himself had studied, but the lad occupied himself with the [[burial]] of the dead, and on hearing of this, the father sent him a reproachful message in this laconic style: \"Is it because there are no graves in [[C\u00e6sarea]] (compare [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 14:11) that I have sent thee off to Tiberias? Study must precede practice\" (''Yer. Pesahim'' chapter III, 30b). Abbahu left behind him a number of disciples, the most prominent among whom were the leaders of the 4th amoraic generation, [[R. Jonah]] and [[R. Jose]]. At Abbahu's death the mourning was so great that it was said, \"Even the statues of C\u00e6sarea shed tears\" (''[[Mo'ed Katan]]'' 25b; ''Yer. Av. Zarah'' chapter III, 42c).<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n\n== Other Abbahus ==\nThere are several other Abbahus mentioned in the [[Talmud]]im and [[Midrashim]], prominent among whom is Abbahu (Abuha, Aibut) b. Ihi (Ittai), a [[Jews of Babylonia|Babylonian]] halakist, contemporary of [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]] and [[Anan (amora)|Anan]] (''[[Eruvin (tractate)|Eruvin]]'' 74a), and brother of Minyamin (Benjamin) b. Ihi. While this Abbahu repeatedly applied to Samuel for information, Samuel in return learned many Halakot from him (''[[Naz.]]'' 24b; ''[[Bava Metzia]]'' 14a; 75a).<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n\n== Against the Christians ==\n\"When does your Messiah come?\" a [[Christian]] (''Minaah'') once asked Abbahu in a tone of mockery, whereupon he replied: \"When you will be wrapped in darkness, for it says, 'Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the nations; then shall the Lord rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen on thee' <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Isaiah]] 60:2],\" (''Sanhedrin''  99a). A Christian came to Abbahu with the quibbling question: \"How could your God in His priestly holiness bury [[Moses]] without providing for purificatory rites, yet oceans are declared insufficient?\" (Isaiah 40:12). \"Why,\" said Abbahu, \"does it not say, 'The Lord cometh with fire'?\" (Isaiah 64:15). \"Fire is the true element of purification, according to [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 31:23,\" was his answer (''Sanhedrin''  39a). Another question of the same character: \"Why the boastful claim: 'What nation on earth is like Thy people Israel' (II [[Books of Samuel|Sam.]] 7:23), since we read, 'All the nations are as nothing before Him'?\" (Isaiah 40:17), to which Abbahu replied: \"Do we not read of Israel, he 'shall not be reckoned among the nations'?\", ''Sanhedrin''  as above).<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n\nAbbahu made a notable exception with reference to the [[Tosefta]]'s statement that the ''Gilionim'' (Evangels) and other books of the Mineans (''Minnin'') are not to be saved from a conflagration on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]: \"the books of those [written by ''Minnin'' for the purpose of debating with Jews] at Abidan may or may not be saved\" (''Shab.'' 116a).<ref>[[s:he:\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e7\u05d8\u05d6 \u05d0|\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e7\u05d8\u05d6 \u05d0]] and [[Rashi]]'s commentary (in Hebrew/Aramaic)</ref> In regard to the benediction \"''Baruk Shem Kebod Malkuto''\" (Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom) after the \"''Shema' Yisrael'',\" Abbahu says that in Palestine, where the Christians look for points of controversy, the words should be recited aloud (lest the Jews be accused of silently tampering with the unity of God proclaimed in the ''Shema''), whereas in the Babylonian city of [[Nehardea]], where there are no Christians, the words are recited with a low voice (''Pesahim'' 56a).<ref>[[s:he:\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0|\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0]] and Rashi's commentary (in Hebrew/Aramaic)</ref> Preaching directly against the Christian dogma, Abbahu says: \"A king of flesh and blood may have a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the Lord saith, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first; that is, I have no father, and I am the last; that is, I have no brother, and besides me there is no God; that is, I have no son'\" (Isaiah 44:6; ''[[Ex. R.]]'' 29). His comment on Numbers 23:19 has a still more polemical tone:<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> \"God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; if a man says: 'I am God,' he is a liar; if he says: 'I am a son of man,' he will have cause to regret it; and if he says, 'I will go up to heaven,' he has said [''something''] but will not keep his word\" (''Yer.

Abbreviations were of two kinds: the use of a single letter for a single word and the use of a sign, note, or mark for a word or phrase.\nThe [[Emperor Justinian]] forbade the use of abbreviations in the compilation of the ''Digest'' and afterward extended his prohibition to all other writings. This prohibition was not universally obeyed. The Abbreviators found it convenient to use the abbreviated form, and this was especially the case in [[Rome]]. The early Christians practised the abbreviated mode, no doubt as an easy and safe way of communicating with one another and safeguarding their secrets from enemies and false brethren.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{Catholic|wstitle=Abbreviators|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Ecclesiastical ''abbreviatores'' ==\nIn course of time the [[Papal Chancery]] adopted this mode of writing as the \"curial\" style, still further abridging by omitting the [[diphthong]]s \"ae\" and \"oe\", and likewise all lines and marks of punctuation. The ''Abbreviatores'' were officials of the [[Roman Curia]].<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThe scope of its labour, as well as the number of its officials, varied over time. Up to the twelfth or thirteenth century, the duty of the Apostolic&nbsp;\u2013 or [[Roman Chancery|Roman&nbsp;\u2013 Chancery]] was to prepare and expedite the Papal letters and writs for collation of ecclesiastical dignitaries and other matters of grave importance which were discussed and decided in [[Papal consistory]]. About the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the Popes, then residing in [[Avignon]], [[France]], began to reserve the collation of a great many [[benefice]]s, so that all the benefices, especially the greater ones, were to be conferred through the [[Roman Curia]] (Lega, ''Praelectiones Jur. Can.'', 1, 2, 287). As a consequence, the labour was immensely augmented, and the number of ''Abbreviatores'' necessarily increased. To regulate the proper expedition of these reserved benefices, [[Pope John XXII]] instituted the rules of chancery to determine the competency and mode of procedure of the Chancery. Afterwards the establishment of the ''[[Dataria Apostolica]]'' and the [[Secretariate of Briefs]] lightened the work of the Chancery and led to a reduction in the number of ''Abbreviatores''.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nAccording to Ciampini (''Lib. de abbreviatorum de parco majore etc.'', Cap. 1) the institution of curial abbreviators was very ancient, succeeding after the persecutions to the notaries who recorded the acts of the martyrs. Other authors reject this early institution and ascribe it to [[Pope John XXII]] in 1316. It is certain that he uses the name \"''abbreviatores''\", but speaks as if they had existed before his time, and had, by over-taxation of their labour, caused much complaint and protest. He (''Extravag. Joan.'', Tit. 13, \"Cum ad Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae\") prescribed their work, determined how much they could charge for their labour, fixed a certain tax for an abstract or abridgment of twenty-five words or their equivalent at 150 letters, forbade them to charge more, even though the abstract was over twenty-five words but less than fifty words, enacted that the basis of the tax was the labour employed in writing, expediting, etc. the bulls, and by no means the emoluments that accrued to the recipient of the favour or benefice conferred by the bull, and declared that whoever charged more than the tax fixed by him was suspended for six months from office, and upon a second violation of the law, was deprived of it altogether, and if the delinquent was an abbreviator, he was excommunicated. Should a large letter have to be rewritten, owing to the inexact copy of the abbreviator, the abbreviator and not the receiver of the bull had to pay the extra charge for the extra labour to the Apostolic writer.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nWhatever may be the date of the institution of the office of abbreviator, it is certain that it became of greater importance and more highly privileged upon its erection into a college of prelates. [[Pope Martin V]] (Constit. 3 \"In Apostolicae\", 2 and 5) fixed the manner for their examination and approbation and also the tax they could demand for their labour and the punishment for overcharge. He also assigned to them certain remunerations. The Abbreviators of the lower, or lesser, were to be promoted to the higher, or greater, bar or presidency. Their offices were compatible with other offices, i. e. they could hold two benefices or offices simultaneously, some conferred by the Cardinal Vice Chancellor, others by the [[Pope]].<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n== Institution of the College of Abbreviators ==\nIn the pontificate of [[Pope Pius II]], their number, which had been fixed at twenty-four, had overgrown to such an extent as to diminish considerably the individual remuneration, and, as a consequence, competent men no longer sought the office, and hence the old style of writing and expediting the bulls was no longer used, to the great injury of justice, the interested parties, and the dignity of the [[Apostolic See]]. To remedy this and to restore the old established chancery style, the Pope selected out of the many then living Abbreviators seventy, and formed them into a college of prelates denominated the \"'''College of Abbreviators'''\", and decreed that their office should be perpetual, that certain remunerations should be attached to it, and granted certain privileges to the possessors of the same. He ordained further that some should be called \"Abbreviators of the Upper Bar\"<ref name=\"Catholic\"/> (''Abbreviatores de Parco Majori''; the name derived from a place in the Chancery that was surrounded by a grating, in which the officials sat, which is called higher or lower (major or minor) according to the proximity of the seats to that of the Vice Chancellor<ref name=\"Chisholm\"/>), the others of the Lower Bar (''Abbreviatores de Parco Minori''); that the former should sit upon a slightly raised portion of the chamber, separated from the rest of the chamber by lattice work, assist the [[Cardinal Vice-Chancellor]], subscribe the letters and have the principal part in examining, revising, and expediting the Apostolic letters to be issued with the leaden seal; that the latter, however, should sit among the Apostolic writers upon benches in the lower part of the chamber, and their duty was to carry the signed schedules or supplications to the prelates of the Upper Bar. Then one of the prelates of the Upper Bar made an abstract, and another prelate of the same bar revised it. Prelates of the Upper Bar formed a quasi-tribunal, in which as a college they decided all doubts that might arise about the form and quality of the letters, of the clauses and decrees to be adjoined to the Apostolic letters, and sometimes about the payment of the remunerations and other contingencies. Their opinion about questions concerning Chancery business was held in the highest estimation by all the Roman tribunals.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[Pope Paul II]] suppressed the College; but [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (''Constitutio'' 16, \"Divina\") re-instituted it. He appointed seventy-two abbreviators, of whom twelve were of the upper, or greater, and twenty-two of the lower, or lesser, presidency (\"parco\"), and thirty-eight examiners on first appearance of letters. They were bound to be in attendance on certain days under penalty of fine, and sign letters and diplomas. Ciampini mentions a decree of the Vice Chancellor by which absentees were mulcted in the loss of their share of the remuneration of the following session of the Chancery. The same Pope also granted many privileges to the College of Abbreviators, but especially to the members of the greater presidency.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[Pope Pius VII]] suppressed many of the offices of the Chancery, and so the [[Tribunal of Correctors]] and the Abbreviators of the lower presidency disappeared. Of the Tribunal of Correctors, a [[substitute-corrector]] alone remains. Bouix (''Curia Romana'', edit. 1859) chronicled the suppression of the lower presidency and put the number of Abbreviators at that date at eleven. Later the College consisted of seventeen prelates, six substitutes, and one sub-substitute, all of whom, except the prelates, were clerics or laity. Although the duty of Abbreviators was originally to make abstracts and abridgments of the Apostolic letters, diplomas, et cetera, using the legal abbreviations, clauses, and [[Formulary (model documents)|formularies]], in course of time, as their office grew in importance they delegated that part of their office to their substitute and confined themselves to overseeing the proper expedition of the Apostolic letters. Prior to 1878, all Apostolic letters and briefs requiring for their validity the leaden seal were engrossed upon rough [[parchment]] in Gothic characters or round letters, also called \"Gallicum\" and commonly \"Bollatico\", but in [[Italy]] \"Teutonic\", without lines, diphthongs, or marks of punctuation. Bulls engrossed on a different parchment, or in different characters with lines and punctuation marks, or without the accustomed abbreviations, clauses, and formularies, were rejected as spurious. [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his ''Constitutio Universae Eccles.'' of 29 December 1878 ordained that they should be written henceforth in ordinary Latin characters upon ordinary parchment and that no abbreviations were to be used except those easily understood.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n== Titles and privileges ==\nMany great privileges were conferred upon Abbreviators. By decree of [[Pope Leo X]] they were elevated as Papal nobles, ranking as ''[[Comes palatinus]]'' (\"Count Palatine\"), [[wikt:familiar|familiars]] and members of the Papal household, so that they might enjoy all the privileges of [[domestic prelate]]s and of prelates in actual attendance on the Pope, as regards plurality of benefices as well as expectives. They and their clerics and their properties were exempt from all jurisdiction except the immediate jurisdiction of the [[Pope]], and they were not subject to the judgments of the [[Auditor of Causes]] or the [[Cardinal Vicar]]. He also empowered them to confer, later within strict limitations, the degree of Doctor, with all university privileges, institute notaries (later abrogated), legitimize children so as to make them eligible to receive benefices vacated by their fathers (later revoked), also to ennoble three persons and to make Knights of the [[Order of St. Sylvester]] (''Militiae Aureae''), the same to enjoy and to wear the insignia of nobility. [[Pope Gregory XVI]] rescinded this privilege and reserved to the Pope the right of institution of such knights (''Acta Pont. Greg. XVI'', Vol. 3, 178-179-180).<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[Pope Paul V]], who in early manhood was a member of the College (Const. 2, \"Romani\"), made them [[Referendaries of Favours]], and after three years of service, [[Referendaries of Justice]], enjoying the privileges of Referendaries and permitting one to assist in the signatures before the Pope, giving all a right to a portion in the Papal palace and exempting them from the registration of favours as required by [[Pope Pius IV]] (Const., 98) with regard to matters pertaining to the [[Apostolic Chamber]].<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThey followed immediately after the twelve voting members of the Signature ''in capella''. Abbreviators of the greater presidency were permitted to wear the purple cassock and ''cappa'', as also [[rochet]] ''in capella''. Abbreviators of the lower presidency before their suppression were simple clerics, and according to permission granted by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (loc. cit.) might be even married.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThese offices becoming vacant by death of the Abbreviator, no matter where the death occurred, were reserved to the [[Roman Curia]]. The prelates could resign their office in favour of others. Formerly these offices as well as those of the other Chancery officers from the Regent down were occasions of venality, until Popes, especially [[Pope Benedict XIV]] and [[Pope Pius VII]], gradually abolished that. [[Pope Leo XIII]] in a [[motu proprio]] of 4 July 1898 most solemnly decreed the abolition of all venality in the transfer or collation of the said offices.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nAs domestic prelates, prelates of the [[Roman Curia]], they had personal preeminence in every diocese of the world. They were addressed as \"Reverendissimus\", \"Right Reverend\", and \"Monsignor\". As prelates, and therefore possessing the legal dignity, they were competent to receive and execute Papal commands. [[Pope Benedict XIV]] (Const. 3, \"Maximo\") granted prelates of the greater presidency the privilege of wearing a hat with a purple band, which right they held even after they ceased to be abbreviators.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n== Suppression ==\n[[Pope Pius X|Pope St. Pius X]] abrogated the College in 1908 and their obligations were transferred to the ''[[protonotarius apostolicus participans|protonotarii apostolici participantes]]''.<ref name=\"Chisholm\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Catholic Church offices]]", "sha1": "bpzy4ibflpd1zpgn5x6o5w1k65t6vgw"}}, {"title": "Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi", "ns": "0", "id": "2674", "revision": {"id": "860373752", "parentid": "827262857", "timestamp": "2018-09-20T06:53:14Z", "contributor": {"ip": "95.253.203.9"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the 20th-century Egyptian politician|Abdel Latif Boghdadi (politician)}}\n\n'''Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi''' or '''Abdallatif al-Baghdadi''' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u063a\u062f\u0627\u062f\u064a}}, 1162 in [[Baghdad]]\u20131231), short for '''Muwaffaq al-Din Muhammad Abd al-Latif ibn Yusuf al-Baghdadi''' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0648\u0641\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641 \u0628\u0646 \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u063a\u062f\u0627\u062f\u064a}}), was a [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[Historiography of early Islam|historian]], [[Egyptologist]] and traveler, and one of the most voluminous writers of the [[Near East]] in his time.<ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 3</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nMany details of Abd al-Latif's life are known from his autobiography. As a young man, he studied grammar, law, tradition, medicine, alchemy and philosophy.

He traveled extensively and resided for a while in [[Mosul]] (in 1189) where he studied the works of al-Suhrawardi before traveling on to [[Damascus]] (1190) and the camp of [[Saladin]] outside [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (1191). It was at the latter location that he met Baha\u2019 al-Din Ibn Shaddad and \u2018Imad al-Din al-Isfahani and acquired the [[qadi]] al-Fadil's patronage. He went on to [[Cairo]], where he met Abu'l-Qasim al-Shari'i, who introduced him to the works of al-Farabi, [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], and [[Themistius]] and (according to al-Latif) turned him away from Avicenna and alchemy.<ref name=\"Leaman2015\">{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Islamic Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpvKBwAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4725-6944-8|page=44}}</ref><ref name=\"Meri2005\">{{cite book|last=Meri|first=Josef W.|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-96690-0|page=2}}</ref>\n\nHe met Saladin himself in 1192 in [[Jerusalem]], then went to Damascus again before returning to Cairo. In later years he again journeyed to Jerusalem and to Damascus in 1207-8, and eventually made his way via [[Aleppo]] to [[Erzindjan]], where he remained at the court of Ala\u2019-al-Din Da\u2019ud until the city was conquered by the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] ruler [[Kayqubadh]]. \u2018Abd al-Latif returned to Baghdad in 1229, travelling back via [[Erzerum]], [[Kamakh]], [[Diwrigi]] and [[Malatiya]].

The family fled from Damascus to the River [[Euphrates]]. All along the way the path was filled with danger, as the [[Abbasids]] had dispatched horsemen across the region to try to find the Umayyad prince and kill him. The Abbasids were merciless with all Umayyads that they found. Abbasid agents closed in on Abd al-Rahman and his family while they were hiding in a small village. He left his young son with his sisters and fled with Yahya. Accounts vary, but Bedr likely escaped with Abd ar-Rahman.

It should be noted that al-Maqqari quotes from historian [[Ibn Hayyan]]'s ''Muktabis'' when detailing Abd al-Rahman's flight from Syria.</ref>\n\nAbd al-Rahman, Yahya, and Bedr quit the village, narrowly escaping the Abbasid assassins. On the way south, Abbasid horsemen again caught up with the trio. Abd al-Rahman and his companions then threw themselves into the River Euphrates. The horsemen urged them to return, promising that no harm would come to them; and Yahya, perhaps from fear of drowning, turned back. The 17th-century historian [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari]] poignantly described Abd al-Rahman's reaction as he implored Yahya to keep going: \"O brother! Come to me, come to me!\"<ref>Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari. ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 60.</ref> Yahya returned to the near shore, and was quickly dispatched by the horsemen. They cut off his head and left his body to rot. Al-Maqqari quotes earlier historians reporting that Abd al-Rahman was so overcome with fear that from the far shore he ran until exhaustion overcame him.<ref>Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 60.</ref> Only he and Bedr were left to face the unknown.\n\n===Exile years===\nAfter barely escaping with their lives, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr continued south through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], the [[Sinai]], and then into [[Egypt]]. Abd al-Rahman had to keep a low profile as he traveled. It may be assumed that he intended to go at least as far as northwestern Africa ([[Maghreb]]), the land of his mother, which had been [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|partly conquered]] by his Umayyad predecessors. The journey across Egypt would prove perilous. At the time, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri]] was the semi-autonomous governor of [[Ifriqiya]] (roughly, modern Tunisia) and a former Umayyad client. The ambitious Ibn Habib, a member of the illustrious [[Fihrid]] family, had long sought to carve out Ifriqiya as a private dominion for himself. At first, he sought an understanding with the Abbasids, but when they refused his terms and demanded his submission, Ibn Habib broke openly with the Abbasids and invited the remnants of the Umayyad dynasty to take refuge in his dominions. Abd al-Rahman was only one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make their way to Ifriqiya at this time.\n\nBut Ibn Habib soon changed his mind. He feared the presence of prominent Umayyad exiles in Ifriqiya, a family more illustrious than his own, might become a focal point for intrigue among local nobles against his own usurped powers. Around 755, believing he had discovered plots involving some of the more prominent Umayyad exiles in [[Kairouan]], Ibn Habib turned against them. At the time, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr were keeping a low profile, staying in [[Kabylie]], at the camp of a Nafza [[Berbers|Berber]] chieftain friendly to their plight. Ibn Habib dispatched spies to look for the Umayyad prince. When Ibn Habib's soldiers entered the camp, the Berber chieftain's wife Tekfah hid Abd al-Rahman under her personal belongings to help him go unnoticed.<ref>Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain''. Again al-Maqqari cited [[Ibn Hayyan]] for the vast majority of the preceding information, 58\u201361.</ref> Once they were gone, Abd a-Rahman and Bedr immediately set off westwards.\n\nIn 755, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr reached modern-day Morocco near [[Ceuta]]. Their next step would be to cross the sea to [[al-Andalus]], where Abd al-Rahman could not have been sure whether or not he would be welcomed. Following the [[Berber Revolt]] of the 740s, the province was in a state of confusion, with the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] torn by tribal dissensions among the [[Arab]]s (the [[Qays\u2013Yemeni feud]]) and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abd-ar-Rahman|display=Abd-ar-Rahman s.v. Abd-ar-Rahman I|volume=1|page=31}}</ref> At that moment, the nominal ruler of al-Andalus, emir [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]]\u2014another member of the Fihrid family and a favorite of the old Arab settlers (''baladiyun''), mostly of south Arabian or \"[[Yemen]]i\" tribal stock\u2014was locked in a contest with his vizier (and son-in-law) [[al-Sumayl ibn Hatim al-Kilabi]], the head of the \"Syrians\"\u2014the ''shamiyum'', drawn from the ''[[jund]]s'' or military regiments of Syria, mostly of north Arabian [[Qays]]id tribes\u2014who had arrived in 742.<ref name=Kennedy>H. Kennedy (1996) ''Muslim Spain and Portugal: a political history of al-Andalus''. London: Longman.</ref>\n\nAmong the Syrian ''junds'' were contingents of old Umayyad clients, numbering perhaps 500,<ref name=Kennedy/> and Abd al-Rahman believed he might tug on old loyalties and get them to receive him. Bedr was dispatched across the straits to make contact. Bedr managed to line up three Syrian commanders\u2014[[Ubayd Allah ibn Uthman]] and [[Abd Allah ibn Khalid]], both originally of Damascus, and [[Yusuf ibn Bukht]] of Qinnasrin.<ref name=Kennedy/> The trio approached the Syrian arch-commander al-Sumayl (then in [[Zaragoza]]) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Abd al-Rahman would try to make himself [[emir]].<ref name=Kennedy/> As a result, Bedr and the Umayyad clients sent out feelers to their rivals, the Yemenite commanders. Although the Yemenites were not natural allies (the Umayyads are a Qaysid tribe), their interest was piqued. The emir Yusuf al-Fihri had proven himself unable to keep the powerful al-Sumayl in check and several Yemenite chieftains felt their future prospects were poor, whether in a Fihrid or Syrian-dominated Spain, so that they had a better chance of advancement if they hitched themselves to the glitter of the Umayyad name.<ref name=Kennedy/> Although the Umayyads did not have a historical presence in the region (no member of the Umayyad family was known to have ever set foot in al-Andalus before) and there were grave concerns about young Abd al-Rahman's inexperience, several of the lower-ranking Yemenite commanders felt they had little to lose and much to gain, and agreed to support the prince.<ref name=Kennedy/>\n\nBedr returned to Africa to tell Abd al-Rahman of the invitation of the Umayyad clients in al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, they set off with a small group of followers for Europe. When some local Berber tribesmen learned of Abd al-Rahman's intent to set sail for al-Andalus, they quickly rode to catch up with him on the coast. The tribesmen might have figured that they could hold Abd al-Rahman as hostage, and force him to buy his way out of Africa. He did indeed hand over some amount of dinars to the suddenly hostile local Berbers. Just as Abd al-Rahman launched his boat, another group of Berbers arrived. They also tried to obtain a fee from him for leaving. One of the Berbers held on to Abd al-Rahman's vessel as it made for al-Andalus, and allegedly had his hand cut off by one of the boat's crew.<ref>Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain''. pp. 65\u201368.</ref>\n\nAbd al-Rahman landed at [[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]] in al-Andalus, to the east of [[M\u00e1laga]], in September 755; however his landing site was unconfirmed.\n\n===Fight for power===\n[[File:Abd ar-Rahman I.jpg|thumb|Statue of Abd al-Rahman I in [[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]], [[Spain]]]]\nUpon landing in al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman was greeted by clients Abu Uthman and Ibn Khalid and an escort of 300 cavalry.<ref name=Kennedy/> During his brief time in [[M\u00e1laga]], he was able to amass local support quickly. Waves of people made their way to M\u00e1laga to pay respect to the prince they thought was dead, including many of the aforementioned Syrians. One famous story that persisted through history related to a gift Abd al-Rahman was given while in M\u00e1laga. The gift was a beautiful young slave girl, but Abd al-Rahman humbly returned her to her previous master.\n\nNews of the prince's arrival spread like wildfire throughout the peninsula. During this time, emir al-Fihri and the Syrian commander al-Sumayl pondered what to do about the new threat to their shaky hold on power. They decided to try to marry Abd al-Rahman into their family. If that did not work, then Abd al-Rahman would have to be killed. Abd al-Rahman was apparently sagacious enough to expect such a plot. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he was prepared to take advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Zaragoza, an important trade city on the [[Upper March]] of al-Andalus, made a bid for autonomy. Al-Fihri and al-Sumayl rode north to quash the rebellion. This might have been fortunate timing for Abd al-Rahman, since he was still getting a solid foothold in al-Andalus. By March 756, Abd al-Rahman and his growing following of Umayyad clients and Yemenite ''junds'', were able to take [[Sevilla]] without violence. He managed to break the rebellion attempt in Zaragoza, but just about that time the Cordovan governor received news of a Basque rebellion in Pamplona. An important detachment was sent by Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman to quash it, but his troops were annihilated. After the setback, al-Fihri turned his army back south to face the \"pretender\". The fight for the right to rule al-Andalus was about to begin. The two contingents met on opposite sides of the [[Guadalquivir|River Guadalquivir]], just outside the capital of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] on the plains of Musarah.\n\nThe river was, for the first time in years, overflowing its banks, heralding the end of a long drought. Nevertheless, food was still scarce, and Abd al-Rahman's army suffered from hunger. In an attempt to demoralize Abd al-Rahman's troops, al-Fihri ensured that his troops not only were well fed, but also ate gluttonous amounts of food in full view of the Umayyad lines. An attempt at negotiations soon followed in which it is likely that Abd al-Rahman was offered the hand of al-Fihri's daughter in marriage and great wealth. Abd ar-Rahman, however, would settle for nothing less than control of the emirate, and an impasse was reached. Even before the fight began, dissension spread through some of Abd al-Rahman's lines. Specifically, the Yemeni Arabs were unhappy that the prince was mounted on a fine Spanish steed. And the prince's mettle was untried in battle, after all! The Yemenis observed significantly that such a fine horse would provide an excellent mount to escape from battle.\n\nBeing the ever-wary politician, Abd al-Rahman acted quickly to regain Yemeni support, and rode to a Yemeni chief who was mounted on a mule named \"Lightning\". Abd al-Rahman averred that his horse proved difficult to ride and was wont to buck him out of the saddle. He offered to exchange his horse for the mule, a deal to which the surprised chief readily agreed. The swap quelled the simmering Yemeni rebellion. Soon both armies were in their lines on the same bank of the Guadalquivir. Abd al-Rahman had no banner, and so one was improvised by unwinding a green turban and binding it round the head of a spear. Subsequently, the turban and the spear became the banner and symbol of the Andalusian Umayyads.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Abd al-Rahman led the charge toward al-Fihri's army. Al-Sumayl in turn advanced his cavalry out to meet the Umayyad threat. After a long and difficult fight \"Abd ar-Rahman obtained a most complete victory, and the field was strewn with the bodies of the enemy.\".<ref>[[Philip Khuri Hitti|Philip K. Hitti]]. ''Makers of Arab History''. (New York. St Martin\u2019s Press), 1968. p. 66</ref> Both al-Fihri and al-Sumayl managed to escape the field (probably) with parts of the army too. Abd al-Rahman triumphantly marched into the capital, C\u00f3rdoba. Danger was not far behind, as al-Fihri planned a [[counterattack]]. He reorganized his forces and set out for the capital Abd al-Rahman had usurped from him. Again Abd al-Rahman met al-Fihri with his army; this time negotiations were successful, although the terms were somewhat changed. In exchange for al-Fihri's life and wealth, he would be a prisoner and not allowed to leave the city limits of C\u00f3rdoba. Al-Fihri would have to report once a day to Abd al-Rahman, as well as turn over some of his sons and daughters as hostages. For a while al-Fihri met the obligations of the one-sided truce, but he still had many people loyal to him; people who would have liked to see him back in power.\n\nAl-Fihri eventually did make another bid for power. He quit C\u00f3rdoba and quickly started gathering supporters. While at large, al-Fihri managed to gather an army allegedly numbering to 20,000. It is doubtful, however, that his troops were \"regular\" soldiers, but rather a [[wikt:hodge-podge|hodge-podge]] of men from various parts of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman's appointed governor in Sevilla took up the chase, and after a series of small fights, managed to defeat al-Fihri's army. Al-Fihri himself managed to escape to the former Visigoth capital of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in central al-Andalus; once there, he was promptly killed. Al-Fihri's head was sent to C\u00f3rdoba, where Abd al-Rahman had it nailed to a bridge.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} With this act, Abd ar-Rahman proclaimed himself the emir of al-Andalus.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} However, one final act to take over southern Iberia had to be performed: al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, had to be dealt with, and he was garroted in C\u00f3rdoba's jail. Now most of central and northern al-Andalus (Toledo, Zaragoza, Barcelona, etc.) was out of his rule, with large swathes remaining in the hands of [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]]'s supporters until 779 (submission of Zaragoza).\n\n===Rule===\nIt is unclear whether Abd al-Rahman proclaimed himself caliph. There are documents in the archives of Cordoba that state that this was his first act upon entering the city. He himself believed he was destined to be Caliph because of prophesies he had heard as a boy, so it seems likely he would. However, historically he is recorded as Emir and not Caliph. Abd al-Rahman's 7th descendent, Abd al-Rahman III, would, however, take up the title of caliph. In the meantime, a call went out through the Muslim world that al-Andalus was a [[wikt:safe haven|safe haven]] for friends of the house of Umayya, if not for Abd al-Rahman's scattered family that managed to evade the Abbasids. Abd al-Rahman probably was quite happy to see his call answered by waves of Umayyad faithful and family. He was finally reacquainted with his son Sulayman, whom he last saw weeping on the banks of the Euphrates with his sisters. Abd ar-Rahman's sisters were unable to make the long voyage to al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman placed his family members in high offices across the land, as he felt he could trust them more than non-family. The Umayyad family would again grow large and prosperous over successive generations. However, by 763 Abd ar-Rahman had to get back to the business of war. Al-Andalus had been invaded by an Abbasid army.\n\nFar away in [[Baghdad]], the current Abbasid caliph, [[al-Mansur]], had long been planning to depose the Umayyad who dared to call himself emir of al-Andalus. Al-Mansur installed al-Ala ibn-Mugith (also known as al-Ala) as governor of Africa (whose title gave him dominion over the province of al-Andalus). It was al-Ala who headed the Abbasid army that landed in al-Andalus, possibly near [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]] (in modern-day [[Portugal]]). Much of the surrounding area of Beja capitulated to al-Ala, and in fact rallied under the Abbasid banners against Abd al-Rahman. Abd al-Rahman had to act quickly. The Abbasid contingent was vastly superior in size, said to have numbered 7,000 men. The emir quickly made for the redoubt of Carmona with his army. The Abbasid army was fast on their heels, and laid siege to Carmona for approximately two months. Abd al-Rahman must have sensed that time was against him as food and water became scarce, and his troops morale likely came into question. Finally Abd al-Rahman gathered his men as he was \"resolved on an audacious sally\". Abd al-Rahman hand-picked 700 fighters from his army and led them to Carmona's main gate. There, he started a great fire and threw his scabbard into the flames. Abd al-Rahman told his men that time had come to go down fighting rather than die of hunger.\nThe gate lifted and Abd ar-Rahman's men fell upon the unsuspecting Abbasids, thoroughly routing them. Most of the Abbasid army was killed. The heads of the main Abbasid leaders were cut off. Their heads were preserved in salt, and identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled together in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at [[Mecca]]. Upon receiving the evidence of al-Ala's defeat in al-Andalus, al-Mansur is said to have gasped, \"God be praised for placing a sea between us!\"<ref>Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 81</ref> Al-Mansur hated, and yet apparently respected Abd al-Rahman to such a degree that he dubbed him the \"Hawk of Quraysh\" (The Umayyads were from a branch of the Quraysh tribe.)<ref>Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain''. p. 82</ref>\n\nDespite such a tremendous victory, Abd al-Rahman had to continuously put down rebellions in al-Andalus.<ref>W. Montgomery Watt. ''Islamic Surveys 4: A History of Islamic Spain''. (Edinburgh; Edinburgh University Press, 1965), p. 32</ref> Various Arab and Berber tribes fought each other for varying degrees of power, some cities tried to break away and form their own state, and even members of Abd al-Rahman's family tried to wrest power from him. During a large revolt, dissidents marched on C\u00f3rdoba itself; However, Abd al-Rahman always managed to stay one step ahead, and crushed all opposition; as he always dealt severely with dissidence in al-Andalus.<ref>Thomas F. Glick. ''Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages''. (Princeton, [[Princeton University Press]]), p. 38</ref> However, this assumption needs to be in perspective, since in 756 he was in charge of a limited number of southern strongholds and he faced resistance to submit from other towns during the next 25 years, rather than revolts.\n\nDespite all this turmoil in al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman wanted to take the fight back east to Baghdad. Revenge for the massacre of his family at the hands of the Abbasids must surely have been the driving factor in Abd al-Rahman's war plans. However his war against Baghdad was put on hold by more internal problems. The city of Zaragoza on the Upper March remained out of reach of the Umayyad leader since the times of [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]], bidding for autonomy. Little could Abd al-Rahman have known that as he set off to settle matters in that northern city, his hopes of warring against Baghdad would be indefinitely put on hold.\n\n===Problems in the Upper March===\nZaragoza proved to be a most difficult city to reign over for not only Abd ar-Rahman, but his successors as well. In the year 777\u2013778, several notable men including Sulayman ibn Yokdan al-Arabi al-Kelbi,<ref>Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 85</ref> the self-appointed governor of Zaragoza, met with delegates of the leader of the Franks, [[Charlemagne]]. \"(Charlemagne's) army was enlisted to help the Muslim governors of Barcelona and Zaragoza against the Umayyad (emir) in Cordoba....\"<ref>Jo Ann Hoeppner Moran Cruz. ''Western Views of Islam in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Perception and Other''. Edited by David R. Blanks and Michael Frassetto. (New York, Saint Martin's Press, 1999), p. 56</ref> Essentially Charlemagne was being hired as a mercenary, even though he likely had other plans of acquiring the area for his own empire. After Charlemagne's columns arrived at the gates of Zaragoza, Sulayman got cold feet and refused to let the Franks into the city, after his subordinate, [[Husayn of Zaragoza|al-Husayn ibn Yahiya]], had successfully defeated and captured Abd al-Rahman's most trusted general, Thalaba Ibn Ubayd.<ref>[https://books.google.cat/books?id=OeiQxLSvC2IC&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=Balch+ben+Bishr+al-Qushayr%C3%AD&source=bl&ots=rQQLLz4Owc&sig=xe_T0DfMIzYUGc-3lIPB0pQtz4c&hl=ca&ei=pus3SobhDOKrjAflqOmoDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#v=onepage&q=Balch%20ben%20Bishr%20al-Qushayr%C3%AD&f=false Historia de Espana antigua y media], Volum 1 Historia de Espa\u00f1a antigua y media; Luis Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez Volum 23;  Luis Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez, 1976;  {{ISBN|9788432118821}}</ref> It is possible that he realized that Charlemagne would want to usurp power from him. After capturing Sulayman, Charlemagne's force eventually headed back to France via a narrow pass in the Pyrenees, where his rearguard was wiped out by [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascon]] rebels (this disaster inspired the epic [[Chanson de Roland]]).,<ref>Philip K. Hitti. ''Makers of Arab History''. (New York. St Martin\u2019s Press), 1968. p. 68</ref> Charlemagne also suffered attack from Sulayman's relatives, who had freed Sulayman.\n\nNow Abd al-Rahman could deal with Sulayman and the city of Zaragoza without having to fight a massive Christian army. In 779 Abd al-Rahman offered Husayn, one of Sulayman's allies, the job of Zaragoza's governorship. The temptation was too much for al-Husayn, who murdered his colleague Sulayman. As promised, al-Husayn was awarded Zaragoza with the expectation that he would always be a subordinate of C\u00f3rdoba. However, within two years al-Husayn broke off relations with Abd al-Rahman and announced that Zaragoza would be an independent city-state. Once again Abd al-Rahman had to be concerned with developments in the Upper March. He was intent on keeping this important northern border city within the Umayyad fold. By 783 Abd al-Rahman's army advanced on Zaragoza.  It appeared as though Abd al-Rahman wanted to make clear to this troublesome city that independence was out of the question. Included in the arsenal of Abd al-Rahman's army were thirty-six [[siege engine]]s.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Luis Corral Lafuente. ''Historia de Zaragoza: Zaragoza Musulmana''. (Zaragoza; Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza, 1998), p. 14</ref> Zaragoza's famous white granite [[defensive wall]]s were breached under a torrent of ordnance from the Umayyad lines. Abd al-Rahman's warriors spilled into the city's streets, quickly thwarting al-Husayn's desires for independence.\n\n===Military and social, and constructions works===\nAfter the aforementioned period of conflict, Abd al-Rahman continued in his improvement of al-Andalus' infrastructure. He ensured roadways were begun, aqueducts were constructed or improved, and that a new mosque was well funded in his capital at C\u00f3rdoba. Construction on what would in time become the world-famous [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]] was started circa the year 786. Abd al-Rahman knew that one of his sons would one day inherit the rule of al-Andalus, but that it was a land torn by strife. In order to successfully rule in such a situation, Abd al-Rahman needed to create a reliable civil service and organize a standing army. He felt that he could not always rely on the local populace in providing a loyal army; and therefore bought a massive [[standing army]] consisting mainly of Berbers from [[North Africa]]<ref>W. Montgomery Watt. ''Islamic Surveys 4: A History of Islamic Spain''. (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 1965), p. 33</ref> as well as slaves from other areas. The total number of army-men under his command were nearly 40,000. As was common during the years of Islamic expansion from Arabia, [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]] was practiced. Abd al-Rahman continued to allow Jews and Christians and other monotheistic religions to retain and practice their faiths. They did,and have to pay a tribute tax for this privilege. Abd al-Rahman's policy of taxing non-Muslims, which was often carried out by later rulers, changed the religious dynamic of al-Andalus. Possibly because of excessive tribute taxes \"the bulk of the country's population must have become Muslim\".<ref>Philip K. Hitti. ''Makers of Arab History''. (New York. St Martin\u2019s Press), 1968. p. 71</ref> However, other scholars have argued that though 80% of al-Andalus converted to Islam, it did not truly occur until near the 10th century.<ref>Thomas F. Glick. ''Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages''. (Princeton, New Jersey. Princeton University Press), pp. 33\u201335. Glick based this work on a prior scholar's work ([[Bulliet]]). On page 33 of this book, Glick writes that Bulliet said \"that the rate of [[Religious conversion|conversion to Islam]] is logarithmic, and may be illustrated graphically by a logistic curve\".</ref>\n\nChristians more often converted to Islam than Jews although there were converted Jews among the new followers of Islam. There was a great deal of freedom of interaction between the groups: for example, Sarah, the granddaughter of the Visigoth king [[Wittiza]], married a Muslim man and bore two sons who were later counted among the ranks of the highest Arab nobility.<ref>Marianne Barrucand & Achim Bednorz.

But he was also known as ''Saqr Quraish'' (\"The Falcon of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]]\"), bestowed on him by one of his greatest enemies, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]].\n\nAccording to the chroniclers, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]] once asked his courtiers who deserved the exalted title of \"Falcon of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]\" (''Saqr Quraish'', foremost of the Prophet's tribe). The obsequious courtiers naturally replied \"You, O [[Commander of the Faithful]]!\", but the Caliph said no. Then they suggested [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiya]] (founder of the Umayyad Caliphate), but the Caliph again said no. Then they suggested [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (one of the greatest of the Umayyad caliphs), but again no.  Then who, they asked, and the Caliph al-Mansur replied:<ref>Safi, L. (1995) \"Leadership and Subordination: An Islamic Perspective\". ''The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences'', pp. 2-12</ref>\n\n{{quote|The falcon of Quraysh is Abd al-Rahman, who escaped by his cunning the spearheads of the lances and the blades of the swords, who after wandering solitary through the deserts of Asia and Africa, had the boldness to seek his fortune without an army, in lands unknown to him beyond the sea. Having naught to rely upon save his own wits and perseverance, he nonetheless humiliated his proud foes, exterminated rebels, organized cities, mobilized armies, secured his frontiers against the Christians, founded a great empire and reunited under his scepter a realm that seemed already parcelled out among others. No man before him ever did such deeds. Mu'awiya rose to his stature through the support of Umar and Uthman, whose backing allowed him to overcome difficulties; Abd al-Malik, because of previous appointment; and the Commander of the Faithful [i.e. al-Mansur himself] through the struggle of his kin and the solidarity of his partisans. But Abd al-Rahman did it alone, with the support of none other than his own judgment, depending on no one but his own resolve.}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula]]\n* [[al-Andalus]]\n* [[Tribute of 100 virgins]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Maria Rosa Menocal]], The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain (2002)\n* [[Andrea Pancini]], L'immigrante (2016)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Abd-er-Rahman I. |short=x}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[Umayyad|Banu Umayyah]]|730|||788|[[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]]|as=[[List of Umayyad Governors of Al-Andalus|Governor of Al-Andalus]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Emir of C\u00f3rdoba]]|years=756\u2013788}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Hisham I]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Umayyads}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Al-Rahman I, Abd}}\n[[Category:Emirs of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n[[Category:731 births]]\n[[Category:788 deaths]]\n[[Category:8th-century rulers in Europe]]", "sha1": "diik5hbh6vxwl64hw3cjwtsy8q3wypv"}}, {"title": "Abd ar-Rahman II", "ns": "0", "id": "2677", "revision": {"id": "851514046", "parentid": "842866122", "timestamp": "2018-07-22T20:42:49Z", "contributor": {"ip": "218.156.121.82"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|individuals with the same or similar name|Abd-ar-Rahman}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2014}}\n{{Infobox royalty\n|name= Abd ar-Rahman II\n|title=|titletext=| image        = Dirham abd al rahman ii 20192.jpg\n| alt          = \n| caption      = Silver [[dirham]] coined during the reign of Abd ar-Rahman II.\n|succession   = 4th [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|Emir of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n|reign=  21 May 822\u2013852\n|predecessor= [[al-Hakam I]]\n|successor= [[Muhammad I of Umayyad|Muhammad I]]\n|birth_date= 792\n|birth_place= [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]\n|death_date= {{death year and age|852|792}}\n|death_place= [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]]\n|father= [[Al-Hakam I]]\n|mother= Halawah\n| image_size   = 250\n|race=arab}}\n'''Abd ar-Rahman II''' ({{lang-ar|<big>\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a</big>}}) (792\u2013852) was the fourth [[Umayyad]] [[Emir of C\u00f3rdoba]] in the [[Al-Andalus]] [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] from 822 until his death.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title='Abd ar-Rahman II |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=17}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Abderram\u00e1n II.jpg|thumb|Statue of Abd ar-Rahman II in [[Murcia]], Spain]]\nAbd ar-Rahman II was born in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the son of [[Emir]] [[Al-Hakam I]].

Called ''al-Nasir li-Din Allah'' (\"the Defender of God's Faith\"), he ascended the throne in his early 20s and reigned for half a century as the most powerful prince of Iberia.<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197605/the.golden.caliphate.htm The Golden Caliphate]</ref> Although people of all creeds enjoyed tolerance and [[freedom of religion]] under his rule, he repelled the [[Fatimid]]s, partly by supporting their [[Maghrawa]] enemies in [[North Africa]], and partly by claiming the title [[Caliph]] (ruler of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]) for himself.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years===\nAbd ar-Rahman was born in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], the grandson of [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi]], seventh independent [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] emir of [[al-Andalus]]. His parents were Abdullah's son Muhammad and Muzna (or Muzayna), a Christian concubine.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/abd-al-rahman-iii/ Abd al-Rahman, III Biography]</ref> His paternal grandmother was also a Christian, the royal infanta [[Onneca Fort\u00fanez]], daughter of the captive king [[Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona]]. Abd ar-Rahman was thus nephew in the half-blood of queen [[Toda of Pamplona]]. He is described as having \"white skin, blue eyes and attractive face; good looking, although somewhat sturdy and stout. His legs were short, to the point that the stirrups of his saddle were mounted just one palm under it. When mounted, he looked tall, but on his feet he was quite short. He dyed his beard black.<ref>[[Ibn Idhari]], ''Kitab al-Bayan''</ref>\n\nMuhammad was assassinated by his brother Al-Mutarrif, who had allegedly grown jealous of the favour Muhammad had gained in the eyes of their father Abdallah. Al-Mutarrif had accused Muhammad of plotting with the rebel [[Umar ibn Hafsun]], and Muhammad had been imprisoned. According to some sources, the emir himself was behind Muhammad's fall, as well as Al-Mutarrif's death in 895. Abd ar-Rahman spent his youth in his mother's harem. Al-Mutarrif's sister, known as ''al-Sayyida'' (\"the Lady\"), was entrusted with his education. She made sure that Abd ar-Rahman's education was conducted with some rigor.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}<ref>[[Ibn Hazm]]</ref>\n\n===Accession to throne===\nEmir Abdallah died at the age of 72. Despite the fact that four of his sons (Aban, Abd al Rahman, Muhammad and Ahmad) were alive at the time of his death, all of them were passed over for succession. Abdallah instead chose as his successor his grandson, Abd al-Rahman III (the son of his first son). This came as no surprise, since Abdallah had already demonstrated his affection for his grandson in many ways, namely by allowing him to live in his own tower (something he did not allow for any of his sons), and allowing him to sit on the throne on some festive occasions. Most importantly Abdallah gave Abd al-Rahman his ring, the symbol of power, when Abdallah fell ill prior to his death. Abd al-Rahman succeeded Abdallah the day after his death, 16 October 912.<ref name=EB/> Historiographers of the time, such as ''[[Al-Bayan al-Mughrib]]'' and the ''Cr\u00f3nica an\u00f3nima de Abd al-Rahman III'', state that his succession was \"without incident\".  At the time, Abd al-Rahman was about 21 or 22 years old. He inherited an emirate on the verge of dissolution, his power extending not far beyond the vicinity of C\u00f3rdoba.<ref name=EB/> To the north, the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] was continuing its program of ''[[Reconquista]]'' in the [[Douro]] valley. To the south in [[Ifriqiya]], the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] had created an independent caliphate that threatened to attract the allegiance of the Muslim population, who had suffered under the harsh rule of Abdullah. On the internal front the discontented [[Muladi]] families (Muslims of Iberian origin) represented a constant danger for the C\u00f3rdoban emir. The most powerful of the latter was Umar ibn Hafsun, who, from his impregnable fortress of [[Umar ibn Hafsun]], controlled much of eastern Al-Andalus.\n\nFrom the very early stages of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman showed a firm resolve to quash the rebels of al-Andalus, consolidate centralized power, and reestablish internal order within the emirate. Within 10 days of taking the throne, he exhibited the head of a rebel leader in Cordoba.<ref name=EB/> From this point on he led annual expeditions against the northern and southern tribes to maintain control over them. To accomplish his aims he introduced into the court the ''[[saqaliba]]h'', slaves of East European origin. The ''saqalibah'' represented a third ethnic group that could neutralize the endless strife between his subjects of Muslim [[Arabs|Arab]] heritage, and those of Muslim [[Berbers|Berber]] heritage.\n\n[[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], a Jewish courtier of the king's court who served as financier to the king, wrote of the king's revenues on this wise:\n{{quote|The revenue of the king [Abd ar-Rahman] amounts annually to 100,000 florins, this arising only from the income derived from the numerous merchants who come hither from various countries and isles. All their commerce and affairs must be subjected to my guidance, praised be the Almighty, who bestows his mercy upon me! The kings of the world no sooner perceive of the greatness of my monarch, than they hasten to convey to him presents in abundance. It is myself who am appointed to receive such presents, and at the same time to return rewards awarded to them.<ref>''Mahberet Menahem'' (ed. Herschell Filipowski), London & Edinburgh 1854 (reprinted: Jerusalem 1987), in: ''Biography of the Author (the Celebrated Rabbi Menahem ben Saruk)'', p. 7; cf.

The Muladi rebels were the first problem he confronted. Those powerful families were supported by Iberians who were openly or secretly Christians and had acted with the rebels. These elements, which formed the bulk of the population, were not averse to supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the Arab aristocracy.<ref name=wikisource>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abd-ar-Rahman|display=Abd-ar-Rahman s.v Abd-ar-Rahman III|volume=1|pages=31-32}}</ref> Abd ar-Rahman moved to subdue them by means of a mercenary army that included Christians.\n\n[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba]].]]\nHe first had to suppress the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun. On 1 January 913 an army, led by the eunuch Badr, conquered the fortress of [[\u00c9cija]], at some {{convert|50|km}} from the capital. All the city's fortifications were destroyed, aside from the citadel, which was left as residence of the governor and a garrison for the emiral troops. In the following spring, after sixty-five days of meticulous preparations, Abd ar-Rahman personally led an expedition to the south of his realm. His troops were able to recover the ''coras'' (provinces) of [[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]] and [[Province of Granada|Granada]], while a cavalry detachment was sent to free [[M\u00e1laga]] from ibn Hafsun's siege. He also obtained the capitulation of [[Fi\u00f1ana]] (in the modern [[province of Almer\u00eda]]), after setting fire to its suburbs. Subsequently, he moved against the castle of [[Juviles]] in the [[Alpujarras]]. After devastating its countryside to deprive it of any resource, he encircled it. Finding it difficult to bombard with catapults, he ordered the construction of a platform where his [[siege engine]]s could be mounted to greater effect, and cut the water supply. The Muladi defenders surrendered after a few days: their lives, apart from fifty-five die-hards who were beheaded, were spared in exchange of their allegiance to the emir. The campaign continued in a similar vein, lasting for a total of ninety days. Abd ar-Rahman forced the defeated Muladi to send hostages and treasures to C\u00f3rdoba, in order to secure their continued submission.\n\nIn the first year of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman took advantage of the rivalries between the [[Banu Hayyay]] lords of [[Seville]] and [[Carmona, Spain|Carmona]] to force them to submit. He initially sent a special corps (''hasam'') under Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hudayr, governor of \u00c9cija, to Seville, to obtain their submission. This attempt failed, but gained him the support of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hayyay, lord of Carmona, and a cousin of the Sevillan lord, Ahmad ibn Maslama. When the latter was surrounded by Umayyad troops, he sued for help to Ibn Hafsun, but the latter was defeated by the besiegers and returned to Bobastro. He next went after the forts in the provinces of Elvira, [[Province of Granada|Granada]], and [[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Jaen]], all of which were either directly or indirectly controlled by Hafsun.<ref name=EB/> Seville finally capitulated on 20 December 913. Ibn al-Mundir al-Qurays, a member of the royal family, was named governor of the city, while the Lord of Carmona obtained the title of [[vizier]]. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim enjoyed his office for only a single day, for Abd ar-Rahman soon discovered his collusion with the rebel governor of Carmona. Muhammad was sent to prison, where he later met his death.\n\nThe region of [[Valencia]] submitted peacefully in 915.\n\n===Ibn Hafsun and other rebels===\n\nAbd ar-Rahman's next objective was to quash the longstanding rebellion of Umar ibn Hafsun.\n\nHis troops left C\u00f3rdoba on 7 May 914 and, after a few days, encamped before the walls of Balda (identified with today's [[Cuevas de San Marcos]]). His cavalry ravaged the nearby woods and the countryside, while the rest of the troopes moved to Turrus, a castle located in the present municipality of [[Algarinejo]], which was surrounded within five days, while its environs were also devastated.\n\nThe Umayyad army then moved to the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun, while the cavalry was sent to the castle of Sant Batir, which was abandoned by the defenders, allowing Abd ar-Rahman's troops to secure a large booty. Then it was the turn of the castles of Ol\u00edas and Reina. The latter fell after a violent fight, leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of M\u00e1laga, which he captured after one day. Abd ar-Rahman then turned and followed the coast by Montemayor, near [[Benahav\u00eds]], Suhayl ([[Fuengirola]]) and another castle called ''Turrus ''or ''Turrus Jusayn'' (identified by [[\u00c9variste L\u00e9vi-Proven\u00e7al]] as [[Oj\u00e9n]]). He finally arrived at [[Algeciras]] on 1 June 914. He ordered a patrol of the coast to destroy the boats that supplied the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun from the [[Maghreb]]. Many of them were captured and set afire in front of the emir. The rebellious castles near Algeciras surrendered as soon as the Cordoban army manifested itself.\n\nAbd ar-Rahman launched three different campaigns against Ibn Hafsun (who died in 917) and his sons. Among them, Jafar ibn Hafsun held the stronghold of Toledo. Abd ar-Rahman ordered ravaged the city's countryside. Jafar, after two years of siege, escaped the city to ask for help in the northern Christian kingdoms. In the meantime Abd ar-Rahman obtained the surrender of the city from its population, after promising them immunity, although 4,000 rebel men escaped in a night sally. The city surrendered on 2 August 932, after a siege of two years.\n\nIn 921 the Banu Muhallab of [[Guadix]] submitted, followed by those of [[Jerez de la Frontera]] and [[C\u00e1diz]], as well as the trading republic of [[Pechina]] (922). In 927, Abd ar-Rahman also launched a campaign against the rebel [[Banu Qasi]], but was forced to break it off by the intervention of [[Jimeno Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona]].\n\nThe last of Ibn Hafsun to fall was Hafs, who commanded his powerful fortress of Umar ibn Hafsun. Surrounded by Abd ar-Rahman's vizier Said ibn al-Mundhir who had ordered the construction of bastions around the city, he resisted the siege for six months,<ref name=EB/> until he surrendered in 928 and had his life spared.<ref>{{cite book|first=Hermann |last=Schreiber|title=Gli Arabi in Spagna|page=142|publisher=Garzanti}}</ref>\n\n===The Levente and Algarve rebels===\nThe continued expeditions against the Hafsunids did not distract Abd ad-Rahman III from the situation of other regions in al-Andalus, which recognized him only nominally, if not being in open revolt. Most of the loyal governors of the cities were in a weak position, such as the governor of [[\u00c9vora]], who could not prevent the attack of the king of Galicia (future king of Le\u00f3n), [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o II]], who captured the city in the summer of 913, taking back a sizable booty and 4,000 prisoners and massacring many Muslims.<ref name=EB/>\n\nIn much of the eastern and western province, Abd ar-Rahman's authority was completely unrecognized. The lord of Badajoz, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, grandson of Abd ar-Rahman ibn Marwan al-Yilliqi, not only fortified his city against a possible attack from Ordo\u00f1o, but also acted in complete independence from C\u00f3rdoba. To avoid the fall of \u00c9vora into the hands of the Berber groups of the region, he ordered the destruction of its defensive towers and lowered the walls, though a year later he decided to reconstruct it, giving its control to his ally Masud ibn Sa' dun al-Surunbaqi. The Algarve was dominated completely by a mulad\u00ed coalition led by Sa'id ibn Mal, who had expelled the Arabs from [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], and the lords of [[Faro, Portugal|Ocs\u00f3noba]], Yahya ibn Bakr, and of [[Taifa of Niebla|Niebla]], Ibn Ufayr. [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] and [[Lisbon]] were under control of the [[Banu D\u0101nis]].\n\nThe absence of royal authority enabled Ordo\u00f1o II to easily campaign in this area, his main objective being the city of [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], in the summer of 915. Abd ar-Rahman III did not send an army and only several local Berber ''jefes'' offered some resistance which was ineffective.\n\n===Assumption of the Caliphate===\n{{Quote box\n |title = Letter proclaiming Abd ar-Rahman III's assumption of the caliphal title\n |quote = We are the most worthy to fulfil our right, and the most entitled to complete our good fortune, and to put on the clothing granted by the nobility of God, because of the favour which He has shown us, and the renown which He has given us, and the power to which He has raised us, because of what He has enabled us to acquire, and because of what He has made easy for us and for our state [? dynasty; {{Lang-ar|[[wiktionary:\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629|dawla]]}}] to achieve; He has made our name and the greatness of our power celebrated everywhere; and He has made the hopes of the worlds depend on us <nowiki>[</nowiki>{{Lang-ar|[[wiktionary:\u0639\u0644\u0642|a\u2018laqa]]}}<nowiki>]</nowiki>, and made their errings turn again to us and their rejoicing at good news be (rejoicing at good news) about our dynasty <nowiki>[</nowiki>{{Lang-ar|[[wiktionary:\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629|dawla]]}}<nowiki>]</nowiki>.

But the force of this tradition had weakened over time; and the title increased Abd ar-Rahman's prestige with his subjects, both in Iberia and Africa.<ref name=wikisource/> He based his claim to the caliphate on his Umayyad ancestors who had held undisputed control of the caliphate until they were overthrown by the Abbasids.\n\nAbd ar-Rahman's move made him both the political and the religious leader of all the Muslims in al-Andalus, as well as the protector of his Christian and Jewish subjects. The symbols of his new caliphate power were a scepter (''jayzuran'') and the throne (''sarir''). In the mint he had founded in November 928, Abd ar-Rahman started to mint gold dinars<ref>No gold Islamic coins had been found in Spain preceding Abd ar-Rahman III's reign. See Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 143.</ref> and silver dirhams, replacing the \"al-Andalus\" title with his name.\n\nIn his new role of caliph, he achieved the surrender of [[Ibn Marwan]] of Badajoz in 930 as well as the surrender of the Banu D\u0101nis of Alc\u00e1cer do Sal. On the southern front, to counter the increasing Fatimid power in North Africa, abd ar-Rahmad ordered the construction of a fleet based in [[Almeria]]. The caliph helped the [[Maghrawa]] Berbers conquer [[Melilla]] (927), [[Ceuta]] (931)<ref name=EB/> and [[Tangiers]] (951), which accepted his suzerainty. However, he was unable to defeat [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]] of the [[Fatamid]]s.<ref name=EB/> In 951 he signed a peace with the new king of Le\u00f3n, [[Ordo\u00f1o III of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o III]], in order to have a free hand against the Fatimids whose ships were harassing the caliphate ones in the Mediterranean and had even launched an assault against Almeria. Abd ar-Rahman's force, led by prime minister Ahmad ibn Said, besieged the Fatimid port of Tunis, which bought its safety through paying a huge sum.<ref>Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 154</ref>\n\nIn the end he was able to create a protectorate covering the northern and central Maghreb, supporting the [[Idrisid]] dynasty; the caliphate influence in the area disappeared after a Fatimid offensive in 958, after which abd ar-Rahman kept only the strongholds of Ceuta and Tangiers.\n\n===War with the Christian kingdoms of the north===\nEven before al-Andalus was firmly under his rule, he had restarted the war against King [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n]], who had taken advantage of the previous troublesome situation to capture some boundary areas and menace the Umayyad territory. In 917 the then emir had sent a large army under his general Ahmad ibn Abi Abda against Le\u00f3n, but this force was destroyed at the [[Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz (917)|Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz]] in September of that year.\n\nRecognizing he had underestimated the power of Ordo\u00f1o II, in 920 Abd ar-Rahman mustered another powerful army to reclaim the territories lost after the previous campaign. He captured the forts of [[Osma]] and [[San Esteban de Gormaz]].<ref name=EB/> After defeating King [[Sancho Garc\u00e9s I of Navarre]] and the king of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Leon]] at [[Battle of Valdejunquera|Valdejunquera]] on 26 July,<ref name=EB/> he penetrated into Navarre, overcoming Aragon by the classic route of the invasions from the south. Abd ar-Rahman reached the Basque city of [[Pamplona]], which was sacked and its cathedral church demolished.\n\nIn 924 Abd ar-Rahman felt obliged to avenge the massacre of Viguera castle perpetrated by King Sancho Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez of Navarre one year earlier. he launched counter offensive against Sancho in which Abd ar-Rahman devastated a large area of Basque territory.<ref>[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=qVYT4Kraym0C&pg=PA435&dq=Abd-ar-Rahman++III+zaragoza&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aNLLVJW5O82qaaaZgbAB&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Abd-ar-Rahman%20%20III%20zaragoza&f=false Al Maqqari, Nafh at-Tih, I, page 363]</ref>\n\nThe succession crisis which struck Le\u00f3n after Ordo\u00f1o II's death in the same year caused hostilities to cease until [[Ramiro II of Le\u00f3n|Ramiro II]] obtained the throne in 932; a first attempt by him to assist the besieged rebels in Toledo was repelled in 932, despite the Christian king capturing [[Madrid]] and scoring a victory at [[Osma]].\n\nIn 934, after reasserting supremacy over Pamplona and [[\u00c1lava]], Abd ar-Rahmad forced Ramiro to retreat to [[Burgos]], and forced the Navarrese queen [[Toda of Navarre|Toda]], his aunt, to submit to him as a vassal and withdraw from direct rule as regent for her son [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I]]. In 937 Abd ar-Rahmad conquered some thirty castles in Le\u00f3n. Next he turned to Muhammad ibn Hashim at-Tugib, governor of [[Zaragoza]], who had allied with Ramiro but was pardoned after the capture of his city.\n\nDespite early defeats, Ramiro and Garc\u00eda were able to crush the caliphate army in 939 at the [[Battle of Simancas]], and almost kill Abd ar-Rahman,<ref name=EB/> due, most likely, to treason by Arab elements in the caliph's army. After this defeat, Abd ar-Rahman stopped taking personal command of his military campaigns. His cause was helped, however, by [[Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile]], one of the Christian leaders at Simancas, who subsequently launched a sustained rebellion against Ramiro. The victory of Simancas enabled the Christian kingdom to maintain the military initiative in the peninsula until the defeat of Ramiro's successor, [[Ordo\u00f1o III of Le\u00f3n]], in 956. However they did not press this advantage as civil war broke out in the Christian territories.\n\n[[File:Dirham abd al rahman iii 17493.jpg|thumb|Dirham of Abd ar-Rahman III, minted in Medina Azahara in 959/960 AD]] \nIn 950 Abd ar-Rahman received in C\u00f3rdoba an embassy from count [[Borrell II of Barcelona]], by which the northern county recognized caliphate supremacy in exchange for peace and mutual support. In 958, [[Sancho I of Le\u00f3n|Sancho]], the exiled king of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Leon]], [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I|Garcia Sanchez]], King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and [[Toda of Navarre|Queen Toda]] all paid homage to Abd ar-Rahman in [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba|Cordoba]].<ref name=EB/>\n\nUntil 961, the caliphate played an active role in the dynastic strife characterizing the Christian kingdom during the period. Ordo\u00f1o III's half-brother and successor, [[Sancho I of Le\u00f3n|Sancho the Fat]], had been deposed by his cousin [[Ordo\u00f1o IV of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o IV]]. Together with his grandmother Toda of Navarre, Sancho sought an alliance with C\u00f3rdoba. In exchange for some castles, Abd ar-Rahman helped them to take back [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] (959) and [[Oviedo]] (960) and to overthrow Ordo\u00f1o IV.\n\n===Later years===\nAbd ar-Rahman was accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the [[harem]].<ref name=wikisource/> He is known to have openly kept a male as well as a female harem.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Medieval Iberia'', ed. Michael Gerli (New York: Routledge, 2003), 398\u2013399.</ref> This likely influenced the polemical story of his falling in love with a 13-year-old boy (later enshrined as a Christian martyr and canonised as [[Pelagius of Cordova|Saint Pelagius of C\u00f3rdoba]]) who refused the Caliph's advances. The love story may have been a construct on top of an original tale, however, in which he ordered the boy-slave to convert to Islam. Either way, enraged, he had the boy tortured and dismembered, thus contributing to the Christian perception of Muslim brutality.<ref>Walter Andrews and Mehmet Kalpakl\u0131, ''The Age of Beloveds'', Duke University Press, 2005; p.2</ref><ref>Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology'', Chicago, 1997; pp.10\u201328</ref>\n\nAbd ar-Rahman spent the rest of his years in his new palace outside C\u00f3rdoba. He died in October 961 and was succeeded by his son [[al-Hakam II]].\n\n==Legacy==\nAbd ar-Rahman was a great [[humanist]] and patron of arts, especially architecture. A third of his revenue sufficed for the ordinary expenses of government, a third was hoarded, and a third was spent on buildings.<ref name=wikisource/> After declaring the caliphate, he had a massive palace complex, known as the [[Medina Azahara]], built some five kilometers north of C\u00f3rdoba.  The Medina Azahara was modeled after the old Umayyad palace in [[Damascus]] and served as a symbolic tie between the new caliph and his ancestors. It was said that Cordoba contained 3000 mosques and 100,000 shops and homes during his reign.<ref name=EB/>\n\nUnder his reign, C\u00f3rdoba became the most important intellectual centre of Western Europe. He expanded the city's library, which would be further enriched by his successors.\n\n{{quote|text=I have now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honours, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot: they amount to Fourteen: - O man! place not thy confidence in this present world!}}\n\nHe also reinforced the Iberian fleet, which became the most powerful in [[Mediterranean Europe]]. Iberian raiders moved up to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Asturias, and North Africa. The colonizers of [[Fraxinetum]] came from al-Andalus as well.\n\nDue to his consolidation of power, Muslim Iberia became a power for a few centuries. It also brought prosperity, and with this he created mints where pure gold and silver coins were created. He renovated and added to the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba]].<ref name=EB/>\n\nHe was very wary of losing control and kept tight reins in his family. In 949, he executed one of his sons for conspiring against him. He was tolerant of non-Muslims, Jews and Christians who were treated fairly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reviewing Imperial Conflicts|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Baptista|first2=Cristina|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=|location=|pages=24|language=en}}</ref> European nations sent emissaries such as from [[Otto I]] of Germany, and the [[Byzantine]] emperor.<ref name=EB/>\n\n==Ancestry==\nAbd ar-Rahman III's mother Muzna was a Christian captive, possibly from the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] region.

Ill feeling mounted against Russia for its encouragement of the rebellions.<ref name=EB/>\n\nWhile no one event led to his being deposed, the crop failure of 1873 and his lavish expenditures on the [[Ottoman Navy]] and on new palaces which he had built, along with mounting public debt, helped to create an atmosphere conducive to his being overthrown.

Steam Navigation Company]].]]\n\n* Abd\u00fclaziz gave special emphasis on modernizing the [[Ottoman Navy]]. In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, ranking as the third largest navy in the world after the British and French navies. His passion for the Navy, ships and sea can be observed in the wall paintings and pictures of the [[Beylerbeyi Palace]] on the [[Bosphorus]] [[strait]] in [[Istanbul]], which was constructed during his reign. However, the large budget for modernizing and expanding the Navy (combined with a severe drought in 1873 and incidents of flooding in 1874 which damaged Ottoman agriculture and reduced the government's tax revenues) contributed to the financial difficulties which caused the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] to declare a [[sovereign default]] with the \"Ramazan Kanunnamesi\" on 30 October 1875. The subsequent decision to increase agricultural taxes for paying the [[Ottoman public debt]] to foreign creditors (mainly British and French banks) triggered the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] in the empire's Balkan provinces, which culminated in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)]] that devastated the already struggling Ottoman economy, and the establishment of the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] in 1881, during the early years of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abd\u00fclhamid II]]'s reign.\n* The first Ottoman railroads were opened between [[\u0130zmir]]\u2013[[Ayd\u0131n]] and [[Alexandria]]\u2013[[Cairo]] in 1856, during the reign of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]]. The first large railway terminal within present-day Turkey, the [[\u0130zmir Alsancak Terminal|Alsancak Terminal]] in [[Izmir]], was opened in 1858. However, these were individual, unconnected railroads, without a railway network. Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz established the first Ottoman railway networks. On 17 April 1869, the concession for the [[Chemins de fer Orientaux|Rumelia Railway]] (i.e. Balkan Railways, [[Rumelia|''Rumeli'' (Rumelia)]] meaning the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]) which connected [[Istanbul]] to [[Vienna]] was awarded to Baron [[Maurice de Hirsch]] (Moritz Freiherr Hirsch auf Gereuth), a Bavaria-born banker from Belgium. The project foresaw a railway route from [[Istanbul]] via [[Edirne]], [[Plovdiv]] and [[Sarajevo]] to the shore of the [[Sava|Sava River]]. In 1873, the first [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] in Istanbul was opened. The temporary Sirkeci terminal building was later replaced with the current one which was built between 1888 and 1890 (during the reign of [[Abdul Hamid II|Abd\u00fclhamid II]]) and became the final destination terminus of the [[Orient Express]]. In 1871, Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz established the [[Chemins de Fer Ottomans d'Anatolie#Ottoman Government Railways (1871-1888)|Anatolia Railway]]. Construction works of the {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}} on the Asian side of Istanbul, from [[Haydarpa\u015fa]] to [[Pendik]], began in 1871. The line was opened on 22 September 1872.<ref name=CFOA>[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/CFOA CFOA History] - Trains and Railways of Turkey</ref> The railway was extended to [[Gebze]], which opened on 1 January 1873. In August 1873 the railway reached [[Izmit]]. [[Chemin de Fer Moudania Brousse|Another railway extension]] was built in 1871 to serve a populated area along [[Bursa]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Anatolia Railway was then extended to [[Ankara]] and eventually to [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]] and [[Arabia]] during the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abd\u00fclhamid II]], with the completion of the [[Baghdad Railway]] and [[Hejaz Railway]].\n* Under his reign, [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey#Tughra issue|Turkey's first postage stamps]] were issued in 1863, and the Ottoman Empire joined the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1875 as a founding member.\n* He also was responsible for the first [[civil code]] for the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=EB/>\n* He was the first Ottoman sultan who travelled to [[Western Europe]].

A contemporary and co-worker of [[Paul the Apostle]], he played an important role in the early development of the churches of [[Ephesus]] and [[Ancient Corinth#Biblical Corinth|Corinth]].\n\n==Biblical account==\n===Acts of the Apostles===\nApollos is first mentioned as a Christian preacher who had come to Ephesus (probably in AD&nbsp;52 or 53), where he is described as \"being fervent in spirit: he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning [[Jesus]], though he knew only the baptism of [[John the Baptist|John]]\".<ref>{{Bibleref2|Acts|18:24-25}}</ref> [[Priscilla and Aquila]], a Jewish Christian couple who had come to Ephesus with the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], instructed Apollos:\n\n:\"When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more adequately.\"<ref>{{bibleref2c|Acts|18:26}}</ref>\n\nThe differences between the two understandings probably related to the Christian baptism, since Apollos \"knew only the baptism of John\". Later, during Apollos' absence, the writer of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] recounts an encounter between Paul and some disciples at Ephesus:\n{{quote|And he said to them, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" And they said, \"No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\" And he said, \"Into what then were you baptized?\" They said, \"Into John's baptism.\" And Paul said, \"John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.\" 5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.<ref>{{Bibleref|Acts|19:2-6}}</ref>}}\n\nBefore Paul's arrival, Apollos had moved from Ephesus to [[Achaia (Roman province)|Achaia]]<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Acts|18:27}}</ref> <ref>So the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian recension]]; the text in [[Papyrus 38|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>38</sup>]] and [[Codex Bezae]] indicate that Apollos went to Corinth. Joseph Fitzmyer, ''The Acts of the Apostles'' (New York: Doubleday, 1998), p. 639.</ref> and was living in [[Corinth]], the provincial capital of Achaia.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Acts|19:1}}</ref> Acts reports that Apollos arrived in Achaia with a [[Epistle to Corinth|letter of recommendation]] from the Ephesian Christians and \"greatly helped those who through grace had believed, for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the [[Old Testament|Scriptures]] that the Christ was Jesus.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Acts|18:27-28}}</ref>\n\n===1 Corinthians===\nPaul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (AD&nbsp;55) mentions Apollos as an important figure at Corinth. Paul describes Apollos' role at Corinth:\n:''I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.''<ref>{{Bibleref2|1 Cor|3:6}}</ref>\nPaul's Epistle refers to a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] between four parties in the Corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to Paul and Apollos respectively, using their names<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apollos|volume=2|page=189}}</ref> (the third and fourth were Peter, identified as Cephas, and Jesus Christ himself).<ref>{{Bibleref2c|1 Cor|1:10-13}}</ref> It is possible, though, that, as Msgr. [[Ronald Knox]] suggests, the parties were actually two, one claiming to follow Paul, the other claiming to follow Apollos. \"It is surely probable that the adherents of St. Paul [...] alleged in defence of his orthodoxy the fact that he was in full agreement with, and in some sense commissioned by, the Apostolic College. Hence 'I am for Cephas'. [...] What reply was the faction of Apollos to make? It devised an expedient which has been imitated by sectaries more than once in later times; appealed behind the Apostolic College itself to him from whom the Apostolic College derived its dignity; 'I am for Christ'.\"<ref>Knox, R. ''Enthusiasm'', p. 13.</ref> Paul states that the schism arose because of the Corinthians' immaturity in faith.<ref>{{Bibleref|1 Cor|3:1-4}}</ref>\n\nApollos was a devout Jew born in Alexandria. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] says that the name \"Apollos\" was probably short for Apollonius or Apollodorus.<ref name=Benedict>[https://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/b16ChrstChrch28.htm Pope Benedict XVI. \"Barnabas, Silas, and Apollos\", ''L'Osservatore Romano'', February 7, 2007, p. 11]</ref> Apollos' origin in Alexandria has led to speculations that he would have preached in the allegorical style of [[Philo]]. Theologian [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], for example, commented: \"It is difficult to imagine that an Alexandrian Jew ... could have escaped the influence of Philo, the great intellectual leader ... particularly since the latter seems to have been especially concerned with education and preaching.\"<ref>J Murphy-O'Connor. ''Paul: A critical life.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996, p. 275</ref> [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict]] suggest there were those in Corinth \"...fascinated by his way of speaking....\"<ref name=Benedict/>\n\nThere is no indication that Apollos favored or approved an overestimation of his person. Paul urged him to go to Corinth at the time, but Apollos refused, stating that he would come later when he had an opportunity.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|1 Cor|16:12}}</ref>\n\n===Epistle to Titus===\nApollos is mentioned one more time in the New Testament. In the [[Epistle to Titus]], the recipient is exhorted to \"speed [[Zenas the Lawyer|Zenas the lawyer]] and Apollos on their way\".<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Titus|3:13}}</ref>\n\n==Extrabiblical information==\n[[Jerome]] states that Apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at Corinth that he retired to [[Crete]] with Zenas; and that once the schism had been healed by Paul's letters to the Corinthians, Apollos returned to the city and became one of its elders.<ref name=\"JCET\">Jerome, Commentary on the Epistle to Titus 3:13</ref> Less probable traditions assign to him the bishop of Duras, or of Iconium in Phrygia, or of Caesarea.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Significance==\n[[Martin Luther]] and some modern scholars have proposed Apollos as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], rather than [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] or [[Barnabas]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Both Apollos and Barnabas were Jewish Christians with sufficient intellectual authority.<ref>''The NIV study bible, new international version''; English (UK) edition; London, Hodder & Stoughton, 1987; p.1817.</ref> The [[Pulpit Commentary]] treats Apollos' authorship of Hebrews as \"generally believed\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm Pulpit Commentary on I Corinthians 3], accessed 19 March 2017</ref> Other than this, there are no known surviving texts attributed to Apollos.\n\nApollos is regarded as a saint by several Christian churches, including the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], which hold a commemoration for him, together with saints [[Aquila and Priscilla]], on 13 February.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Eastern Christianity}}\n* Articles in\n** ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]''\n** Herzog-Hauck, ''Realencyklopadie''\n** ''[[The Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' ([http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1650&letter=A&search=Apollos Jewish Encyclopedia: Apollos])\n* [[James Hastings]], ''[[Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible|Dictionary of the Bible]]''\n* [[Karl Heinrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]], ''Das apostolische Zeitalter'' (1886)\n* [[A.

As a potential heir to the throne, Abdul Hamid was imprisoned in comfort by his cousins and older brother, as was customary. This lasted until 1767. During this period, he received his early education from his mother Rabia \u015eermi, who taught him history and [[calligraphy]].<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nWhen his brother Mustafa III died, Abdul Hamid succeeded him on 21 January 1774.\n\n==Reign==\nAbdul Hamid's long imprisonment had left him indifferent to state affairs and malleable to the designs of his advisors.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Yet he was also very religious and a [[pacifism|pacifist]] by nature. At his accession the financial straits of the treasury were such that the usual donative could not be given to the [[Janissary]] Corps. The new Sultan told the Janissaries \"There are no longer gratuities in our treasury, as all of our soldier sons should learn.\"\n\nDespite his pacific inclinations, the Ottoman Empire was forced to renew [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)|the ongoing war]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] almost immediately. This led to [[Battle of Kozludzha|complete Turkish defeat at Kozludzha]] and the humiliating [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]], signed on 21 July 1774. The Ottomans ceded territory to Russia, and also the right to intervene on behalf of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]s in the Empire.\n\n[[File:TurkischeHauptArmeeHochenleitterBGHistory.jpg|thumb|The [[Ottoman Army]] advances from [[Sofia]], its largest garrison in [[Rumelia]], in the year 1788.]]\n\nAbdul Hamid now sought to reform the Empire's armed forces. He enumerated the Janissary corps and tried to renovate it, and also the navy. He established a new artillery corps. He was also credited with the creation of the Imperial Naval Engineering School.<ref name=EB/>\n\nAbdul Hamid tried to strengthen Ottoman rule over [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]], [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Ottoman Iraq|Iraq]].<ref name=EB/> However, slight successes against rebellions in Syria and the [[Morea]] could not compensate for the loss of the [[Crimean Peninsula]], which had become nominally independent in 1774, but was in practice now controlled by Russia.\n\nRussia repeatedly exploited its position as protector of Eastern Christians to interfere in the Ottoman Empire, and explicitly. Finally the Ottomans declared [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u201392)|war against Russia in 1787]]. [[Austro-Turkish War (1787\u201391)|Austria soon joined Russia]]. Turkey held its own in the conflict, at first, but on 6 December 1788, [[Siege of Ochakov (1788)|Ochakov fell to Russia]] (all of its inhabitants being massacred). It is said that this sad defeat broke Abdul Hamid's spirit, as he died four months later.\n\nIn spite of his failures, Abdul Hamid was regarded as the most gracious Ottoman Sultan.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} He personally directed the [[fire brigade]] during the Constantinople fire of 1782. He was admired by the people for his religious devotion, and was even called a ''Veli'' (\"saint\"). He also outlined a reform policy, supervised the government closely, and worked with statesmen.\n\nIn 1789, [[Tipu Sultan]], ruler of the [[Sultanate of Mysore]] sent an embassy to Abdul Hamid, urgently requesting assistance against the [[British East India Company]], and proposed an offensive and defensive alliance. Abdul Hamid informed the Mysori ambassadors that the Ottomans were still entangled and exhausted from the ongoing war with Russia and Austria.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Death==\nAbdul Hamid died on 7 April 1789, at the age of sixty-four, in Constantinople. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a tomb he had built for himself.\n\nHe bred [[Arabian horse]]s with great passion. One breed of K\u00fcheylan Arabians was named \"K\u00fcheylan Abd\u00fclhamid\" after him.\n\n==Family==\n;Consorts\nAbdul Hamid had nine wives:\n* Ay\u015fe Kad\u0131n<ref name=\"kocaaslan\">{{cite book|first=Murat|last=Kocaaslan|title=I.

At first, the new Amir was quietly recognized. But after a few months, Afzal Khan raised an [[insurrection]] in the north of the country, where he had been governing when his father died.  This began a fierce internecine conflict for power between Dost Mohammad's sons, which lasted for nearly five years.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}} The [[Musahiban]] are descendants of [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s older brother, [[Sultan Mohammad Khan]].\n\nDescribed by the American scholar and explorer [[Eugene Schuyler]] as \"a tall well-built man, with a large head, and a marked Afghan, almost [[Jewish people|Jewish]], face\",<ref>Eugene Schuyler, ''Turkistan : notes of a journey in Russian Turkistan, Kokand, Bukhara and Kuldja'', F.A. Praeger (1966), p. 136</ref> Abdur Rahman distinguished himself for his ability and energetic daring. Although his father, Afzal Khan came to terms with the Amir Sher Ali, Abdur's behaviour in the northern province soon excited the Amir's suspicion and, when he was summoned to Kabul, fled across the [[Oxus]] into [[Bukhara]]. Sher Ali threw Afzal Khan into prison, and a revolt followed in southern Afghanistan.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}\n\nThe Amir had scarcely suppressed it by winning a desperate battle when Abdur Rahman's reappearance in the north was a signal for a mutiny by troops stationed in those parts and a gathering of armed bands to his standard. After some delay and desultory fighting, he and his uncle, Azam Khan, occupied Kabul in March 1866.  The Amir Sher Ali marched up against them from [[Kandahar]]; but in the battle that ensued at Sheikhabad on May 10, he was deserted by a large body of his troops, and after his signal defeat Abdur Rahman released his father, Afzul Khan, from prison in [[Ghazni]], and installed him upon the throne as Amir of Afghanistan.  Notwithstanding the new Amir's incapacity, and some jealousy between the real leaders, Abdur Rahman and his uncle, they again routed Sher Ali's forces, and occupied Kandahar in 1867. When Afzal Khan died at the end of the year, Azam Khan became the new ruler, with Abdur Rahman installed as governor in the northern province. But towards the end of 1868, Sher Ali's return and a general rising in his favour resulted in Abdur Rahman and Azam Khan's defeat at ''Tinah Khan'' on January 3, 1869. Both sought refuge to the east in Central Asia, where Abdur Rahman placed himself under Russian protection at [[Samarkand]].<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title='Abdor Rahman Khan |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak \u2013 Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=20}}</ref> Azam died in Kabul in October 1869.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}\n\n==Exile and negotiated return to power==\n[[File:Indian Celebrities- Amir Abd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n WDL11441.png|thumb|\"Iron Amir\" Abd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n Kh\u0101n during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].

His achievements included the introduction of some modern manufacturing, agriculture, and health care. This portrait shows him as a young man in uniform, clutching the hilt of his sword]]\n\nAbdur Rahman lived in exile in [[Tashkent]]. The [[Governor-General|governor-general]] of [[Tashkent]] sent for Abdur Rahman and [[motivated]] him by bringing up the [[blessing of Jacob]], Abdur's [[patriarch]]. He was being told to cross the [[Oxus]] and claim [[throne]] for [[Amir]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}<ref name=EB/> In March 1880, a report reached India that Abdur Rahman was in northern Afghanistan; and the Governor-General, [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], opened communications with him to the effect that the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] were prepared to withdraw their troops, and to recognize Abdur Rahman as Amir of Afghanistan, with the exception of Kandahar and some districts adjacent to it.  After some negotiations, and an interview with [[Lepel Griffin]], the diplomatic representative at Kabul of the Indian government.  Griffin described Abdur Rahman as a man of middle height, with an exceedingly intelligent face and frank and courteous manners, shrewd and able in conversation on the business in hand.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Ameer Abdurahman Khan.jpg|left|thumb|Abdur Rahman Khan during his younger years.]]\n\nAt the ''[[Durbar (court)|durbar]]'' on July 22, 1880, Abdur Rahman was officially recognized as Amir, granted assistance in arms and money, and promised, in case of unprovoked foreign aggression, such further aid as might be necessary to repel it, provided that he align his foreign policy with the British. The British evacuation of Afghanistan was settled on the terms proposed, and in 1881, the [[British Army|British troops]] also handed over Kandahar to the new ''Amir''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}\n\nHowever, [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]], one of Sher Ali Khan's sons, marched upon that city from Herat, defeated Abdur Rahman's troops, and occupied the place in July 1880. This serious reverse roused the ''Amir'', who had not at first displayed much activity. He led a force from Kabul, met Ayub's army close to Kandahar, and the complete victory which he there won forced Ayub Khan to flee into Persia. From that time Abdur Rahman was fairly seated on the throne at Kabul, and in the course of the next few years he consolidated his dominion over all Afghanistan, suppressing [[insurrection]]s by a sharp and relentless use of his [[Despotism|despotic]] authority. The powerful [[Ghilzai]] tribe revolted against the severity of his measures several times. In that same year, Ayub Khan made a fruitless inroad from Persia.\n\nIn 1885, at the moment when the ''Amir'' was in conference with the British [[viceroy]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], in India, the news came of a skirmish between Russian and Afghan troops at [[Panjdeh]], over a disputed point in the demarcation of the northwestern frontier of Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman's attitude at this critical juncture is a good example of his political sagacity. To one who had been a man of war from his youth, who had won and lost many fights, the rout of a detachment and the forcible seizure of some debatable frontier lands was an untoward incident; but it was not a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] for calling upon the British, although they had guaranteed his territory's integrity, to vindicate his rights by hostilities which would certainly bring upon him a Russian invasion from the north, and would compel his British allies to throw an army into Afghanistan from the southeast.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pages=37\u201338}} He also published his [[autobiography]] in 1885, which served more as an advice guide for [[prince]]s than anything else.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11308/ |title= Worthy Advice in the Affairs of the World and Religion: The Autobiography of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan |website= [[World Digital Library]] |year= 1885 |accessdate = 2013-09-30 }}</ref>\n\nHis interest lay in keeping powerful neighbours, whether friends or foes, outside his kingdom. He knew this to be the only policy that would be supported by the Afghan nation; and although for some time a rupture with Russia seemed imminent, while the [[India Office|Government of India]] made ready for that contingency, the Amir's reserved and circumspect tone in the consultations with him helped to turn the balance between peace and war, and substantially conduced towards a pacific solution. Abdur Rahman left on those who met him in India the impression of a clear-headed man of action, with great self-reliance and hardihood, not without indications of the implacable severity that too often marked his administration. His investment with the insignia of the highest grade of the [[Order of the Star of India]] appeared to give him much pleasure.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}\n\nHis adventurous life, his forcible character, the position of his state as a barrier between the Indian and the Russian empires, and the skill with which he held the balance in dealing with them, combined to make him a prominent figure in contemporary Asian politics and will mark his reign as an epoch in the history of Afghanistan. The Amir received an annual [[subsidy]] from the British government of 1,850,000 [[rupee]]s. He was allowed to import munitions of war.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}} He succeeded in imposing an organized government upon the fiercest and most unruly population in [[Asia]]; he availed himself of [[Europe]]an inventions for strengthening his armament, while he sternly set his face against all innovations which, like [[railway]]s and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]s, might give Europeans a foothold within his country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}\n\nIn 1893 he built himself a summer house called the [[Bagh-e Bala Palace]].\n\nThe Amir found himself unable, by reason of [[Illness|ill-health]], to accept an invitation from [[Queen Victoria]] to visit England; but his second son [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]] went instead.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}} \n\n==Durand Line==\n{{See also|Durand Line}}\n\nIn 1893, Mortimer Durand was deputed to Kabul by the government of British India for this purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the boundary between northeastern Afghanistan and the Russian possessions, and in order to discuss with  Amir Abdur Rahman Khan other pending questions. Abdur Rahman Khan showed his usual ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation.\n\nIn the agreement that followed relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed; and an understanding was reached upon the important and difficult subject of the border line of Afghanistan on the east, towards India.  A Royal Commission was set up to determine the boundary between Afghanistan and British Governed India was rasked to negotiate terms for agreeing to the Durand line, between the two parties camped at [[Parachinar]], now part of FATA Pakistan, which is near [[Khost]], Afghanistan. From the British side the camp was attended by Mortimer Durand and [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]], [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]] Khyber. Afghanistan was represented by [[Sahibzada Abdul Latif]] and the Governor [[Sardar Shireendil Khan]] representing Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] negotiated with Abdur Rahman Khan the ''[[Durand Line]] Treaty'' for the demarcation of the frontier between Afghanistan, the [[FATA]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]] Provinces of Pakistan the successor state of [[British India]]. The [[Durand Line]] still remains as an unrecognized boundary by the Government of Afghanistan. <!-- DO NOT judge the past by the politics of the present.  What happened in the past is written by historians, not by hacking. -->\n\n==Dictatorship and the \"Iron Amir\"==\nAbdur Rahman Khan's government was a military despotism resting upon a well-appointed army; it was administered through officials absolutely subservient to an inflexible will and controlled by a widespread system of [[espionage]]; while the exercise of his personal authority was too often stained by acts of unnecessary cruelty.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}} He held open courts for the receipt of petitioners and the dispensation of justice; and in the disposal of business he was indefatigable. \n\n[[File:Abdur Rahman Khan.jpg|thumb|Abdur Rahman Khan in 1897]]\n[[File:Abdur Rahman Khan sitting.jpg|thumb|Abdur Rahman Khan in 1897 with family members]]\nIn the 1880s, the \"Iron Emir\" decided to strategically displace some members of different ethnic groups in order to bring better security.

His two eldest sons, Habibullah Khan and [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]], were born at [[Samarkand]].

Some remember him as a ruler who initiated many programs for modernization and effectively prevented the country from being occupied by Russia and Britain during [[the Great Game]]. On the other hand, some sectors of Afghanistan remember him as a domestically violent and geopolitically weak ruler in that he was brought to power by the British and declared war on Afghan minorities instead of fighting the British who were deciding Afghanistan's foreign policy for him.<ref name=EB/>\n{{clearleft}}\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India]] (GCSI) \u2013 1885\n*[[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] (GCB)- 1893<ref>[http://www.royalark.net/Afghanistan/barak12.htm Barak12].

It returns one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[Plurality voting system|first past the post]] system. It is represented by [[Stephen Kinnock]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==History==\nThe constituency was created for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]] by a division of the [[Swansea District (UK Parliament constituency)|Swansea District]]. With the exception of the first term, it has always been held by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who became Labour's first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1924, held the seat from 1922 to 1929. Its current MP, Stephen Kinnock, is the son of [[Neil Kinnock]], who was Labour leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 1983 to 1992.\n\nIt is one of the most consistently [[safe seat]]s for Labour; since the end of the Second World War, the Labour candidate has always won Aberavon with a majority at least 33%, and with the exception of [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015]], the Labour candidate has also always won an overall majority of the vote in the seat. In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's voteshare rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]. The 2017 result also made Aberavon the safest Labour seat in Wales.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918-1950''': The Borough of Aberavon, the Urban Districts of Briton Ferry, Glencorwg, Margam, and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural Districts of Neath and Penybont.\n\n'''1950-1983''': The Borough of Port Talbot, the Urban Districts of Glyncorrwg and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural District of Penybont.\n\n'''1983-1997''': The Borough of Afan, and the Borough of Neath wards nos. 3 and 6.\n\n'''1997-2010''': The Borough of Port Talbot, and the Borough of Neath wards of Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North and Coedffranc West.\n\n'''2010-present''': The Neath Port Talbot County Borough electoral divisions of Aberavon, Baglan, Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Bryn and Cwmavon, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North, Coedffranc West, Cymmer, Glyncorrwg, Gwynfi, Margam, Port Talbot, Sandfields East, Sandfields West, and Tai-bach.\n\nThe constituency is in [[South Wales]], situated on the right bank of the [[River Afan]], near its mouth in [[Swansea Bay]].\n\nCommenting on the 1983 boundary changes to the constituency when moving the 2000 Loyal Address of the Blair Government in Parliament, then-MP [[Sir John Morris]], who would retire at [[United Kingdom general election 2001|the next general election]], said:\n\n{{quote|It is a happy tradition on this occasion to refer to one's constituency and to the people who sent one here....Whatever may occur in future, I would deplore the loss of the Member-constituency link.
