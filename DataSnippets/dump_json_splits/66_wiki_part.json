It looks approximately [[linear function|linear]] for all reasonable values of ''n'', but this intuition is false.\nWe get one of the simplest approximations for ln ''n''! by bounding the sum with an [[integral]] from above and below as follows:\n\n:<math> \\int_1^n \\ln x \\, dx \\leq \\sum_{x=1}^n \\ln x \\leq \\int_0^n \\ln (x+1) \\, dx</math>\n\nwhich gives us the estimate\n\n:<math> n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)+1 \\leq \\ln n! \\leq (n+1)\\ln\\left( \\frac{n+1}{e} \\right) + 1.</math>\n\nHence <math>\\ln n! \\sim n\\ln n</math> (see [[Big O notation#Family of Bachmann\u2013Landau notations|Big ''O'' notation]]).

In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.\n\nThe main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in [[personal computer]]s, however many languages support variable length integer types capable of calculating very large values.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/wesselbosman/nFactorial|title=wesselbosman/nFactorial|author=|date=|website=GitHub|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426001413/https://github.com/wesselbosman/nFactorial|archivedate=26 April 2018|df=}}</ref> [[Floating-point]] representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow.

One function that \"fills in\" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the [[Gamma function]], denoted \u0393(''z''), defined for all complex numbers ''z'' except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of ''z'' is positive by\n\n:<math>\\Gamma(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t}\\, \\mathrm{d}t. </math>\n\nIts relation to the factorials is that for any natural number ''n''\n:<math>n!=\\Gamma(n+1).</math>\n\n[[Leonhard Euler|Euler's]] original formula for the Gamma function was\n\n:<math>\\Gamma(z)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n^zn!}{\\displaystyle\\prod_{k=0}^n (z+k)}. </math>\n\nAn alternative notation, originally introduced by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], is sometimes used.  The '''Pi function''', denoted \u03a0(''z'') for real numbers ''z'' no less than&nbsp;0, is defined by\n\n:<math>\\Pi(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^z e^{-t}\\, \\mathrm{d}t\\,.</math>\n\nIn terms of the Gamma function it is\n\n:<math>\\Pi(z) = \\Gamma(z+1) \\,.</math>\n\n[[File:Generalized factorial function.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0!&nbsp;=&nbsp;1!&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, (\u22120.5)!&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{math|{{sqrt|''\u03c0''}}}}, (0.5)!&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''\u03c0''}}|2}}}}.]]\n\nIt truly extends the factorial in that\n\n:<math>\\Pi(n) = n! \\text{ for } n \\in \\mathbf{N}\\, .</math>\n\nIn addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value ''z'' where it is defined\n\n:<math>\\Pi(z) = z\\Pi(z-1)\\,.</math>\n\nIn fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a [[functional equation]].\nExpressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form\n\n:<math>\\Gamma(n+1)=n\\Gamma(n)\\,.</math>\n\nSince the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value ''z'' where it is defined, we can write:\n\n:<math>z! = \\Pi(z)</math>\n\nThe values of these functions at [[half-integer]] values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has\n\n:<math>\\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}\\right )=\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}\\right )!=\\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}\\right ) = \\sqrt{\\pi},</math>\n\nfrom which it follows that for&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''N''',\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right ) = \\left (-\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right )! = \\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}+n\\right ) \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\sqrt{\\pi} \\prod_{k=1}^n {2k - 1 \\over 2} = {(2n)! \\over 4^n n!} \\sqrt{\\pi} = {(2n-1)! \\over 2^{2n-1}(n-1)!} \\sqrt{\\pi}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFor example,\n:<math>\\Gamma(4.5) = 3.5! = \\Pi(3.5) = {1\\over 2}\\cdot{3\\over 2}\\cdot{5\\over 2} \\cdot {7\\over 2} \\sqrt{\\pi} = {8! \\over 4^4 4!} \\sqrt{\\pi} = {7! \\over 2^7 3!} \\sqrt{\\pi} = {105 \\over 16} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 11.63.</math>\n\nIt also follows that for&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''N''',\n\n:<math>\\Gamma\\left (\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right ) = \\left (-\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right )! = \\Pi\\left (-\\frac{1}{2}-n\\right ) = \\sqrt{\\pi} \\prod_{k=1}^n {2 \\over 1 - 2k} = {(-4)^n n! \\over (2n)!} \\sqrt{\\pi}.</math>\n\nFor example,\n:<math>\\Gamma(-2.5) = (-3.5)! = \\Pi(-3.5) = {2\\over -1}\\cdot{2\\over -3}\\cdot{2\\over -5} \\sqrt{\\pi} = {(-4)^3 3! \\over 6!} \\sqrt{\\pi} = -{8 \\over 15} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx -0.9453.</math>\n\nThe Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is [[Analytic function|analytic]] wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function.  For instance, the [[Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem]] states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation \u0393(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''\u0393(''n''), is [[meromorphic]] on the complex numbers, and is [[log-convex]] on the positive real axis.  A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the \u03a0(''n'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''\u03a0(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) functional equation.\n\nHowever, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values.  For example, [[Hadamard's gamma function|Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function]] {{harv|Hadamard|1894}} which, unlike the Gamma function, is an [[entire function]].<ref>Peter Luschny, [http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/hadamard/HadamardsGammaFunction.html ''Hadamard versus Euler \u2013 Who found the better Gamma function?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818171719/http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/hadamard/HadamardsGammaFunction.html |date=2009-08-18 }}.</ref>\n\nEuler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}n! = \\Pi(n) &= \\prod_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{k+1}{k}\\right)^n\\!\\!\\frac{k}{n+k} \\\\ &= \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2}{1}\\right)^n\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right]\\left[ \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^n\\frac{2}{n+2}\\right]\\left[ \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^n\\frac{3}{n+3}\\right]\\cdots. \\end{align}</math>\n\nHowever, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.\n\n===Applications of the Gamma function===\nThe [[volume]] of an [[Dimension|''n''-dimensional]] [[N-sphere|hypersphere]] of radius ''R'' is\n\n:<math>V_n=\\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma((n/2)+1)}R^n.</math>\n\n===Factorial at the complex plane===\n[[File:Factorial05.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Amplitude and phase of factorial of complex argument]]\nRepresentation through the Gamma-function allows evaluation of factorial of complex argument.

When <math>|\\Im(z)| >2 </math> or <math>\\Re(z)>2</math>, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with complex<double> precision.

'''German cinema''' made major technical and artistic contributions to film during the period from 1918&ndash;1933.\n\nGermany witnessed major changes to its identity during the 20th and 21st century. Those changes determined the periodisation of national cinema into a succession of distinct eras and movements.<ref name=\"tbk\">{{cite book | title=The Cinema Book | publisher=British Film Institute | author=Pam Cook | authorlink=Tim Bergfelder | year=2007 | location=London | page=207 | isbn=978-1-84457-192-5}}</ref>\n\n==1895\u20131918 German Empire==\n\n<!-- [[File:UFA logo.png|thumb|The [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] (short for ''Universum Film AG'') is the historical home of the German film industry and produces films since 1917 - until today.]] -->\n<!-- NOTE: \"Cinema of the German Empire\" redirects to this section heading. Please update the redirect if you make a change to the heading. -->\nThe history of cinema in Germany can be traced back to the years shortly after the medium's birth. On November 1, 1895 [[Max Skladanowsky]] and his brother Emil demonstrated their self-invented [[movie projector|film projector]] the [[Bioscop]] at the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Wintergarten]] [[music hall]] in [[Berlin]]. A 15-minute series of eight short films, it was the first screening of films to a paying audience in Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brockmann|first=Stephen|title=A Critical History of German Film|year=2010|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-468-4|page=13}}</ref> This performance pre-dated the first paying public display of the [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]' [[Cinematographe]] in [[Paris]] on December 28 of the same year, a performance that Max Skladanowsky attended and at which he was able to ascertain that the Cinematographe was technically superior to his Bioscop. Other [[German people|German]] film pioneers included the Berliners [[Oskar Messter]] and Max Gliewe, two of several individuals who independently in 1896 first used a [[Geneva drive]] (which allows the film to be advanced intermittently one frame at a time) in a projector, and the [[cinematographer]] [[Guido Seeber]].\n\nIn its earliest days, the cinematograph was perceived as an attraction for upper class audiences, but the novelty of moving pictures did not last long. Soon, trivial short films were being shown as fairground attractions aimed at the working class and lower-middle class. The booths in which these films were shown were known in Germany somewhat disparagingly as ''Kintopps''. Film-makers with an artistic bent attempted to counter this view of cinema with longer movies based on literary models, and the first German \"artistic\" films began to be produced from around 1910, an example being the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] [[adaptation]] [[The Student of Prague (1913 film)|''The Student of Prague'']] (1913) which was co-directed by [[Paul Wegener]] and [[Stellan Rye]], photographed by Guido Seeber and starring actors from [[Max Reinhardt]]'s company.\n\n[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world (founded 1912) and the forerunner to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. It still produces global blockbusters every year.]]\n\nEarly film theorists in Germany began to write about the significance of ''Schaulust'', or \"visual pleasure\", for the audience, including the [[Dada]] movement writer [[Walter Serner]]: \"If one looks to where cinema receives its ultimate power, into these strangely flickering eyes that point far back into human history, suddenly it stands there in all its massiveness: visual pleasure.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Brockmann|first=Stephen|title=A Critical History of German Film|year=2010|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-468-4|page=16}}</ref> Visually striking sets and makeup were key to the style of the [[German expressionism|expressionist]] films that were produced shortly after World War I.\n\nCinemas themselves began to be established landmarks in the years immediately before World War I. Before this, German filmmakers would tour with their works, travelling from fairground to fairground. The earliest ongoing cinemas were set up in cafes and pubs by owners who saw a way of attracting more customers. The storefront cinema was called a ''Kientopp'', and this is where films were viewed for the most part before World War I.<ref name=\"Brockmann 2010 18\">{{cite book|last=Brockmann|first=Stephen|title=A Critical History of German Film|year=2010|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-468-4|page=18}}</ref> The first standalone, dedicated cinema in Germany was opened in [[Mannheim]] in 1906, and by 1910, there were over 1000 cinemas operating in Germany.<ref name=\"Brockmann 2010 18\"/> [[Henny Porten]] and [[Asta Nielsen]] (the latter originally from Denmark) were the first major film stars in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brockmann|first=Stephen|title=A Critical History of German Film|year=2010|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-468-4|page=19}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1914, however, many foreign films were imported. In the era of the [[silent film]] there were no language boundaries and [[Cinema of Denmark|Danish]] and [[Cinema of Italy|Italian films]] were particularly popular in Germany. The public's desire to see more films with particular actors led to the development in Germany, as elsewhere, of the phenomenon of the film star; the actress [[Henny Porten]] was one of the earliest German stars. Public desire to see popular film stories being continued encouraged the production of [[film serial]]s, especially in the genre of [[mystery film]]s, which is where the director [[Fritz Lang]] began his illustrious career.\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] and the subsequent boycott of, for example, [[Cinema of France|French films]] left a noticeable gap in the market. By 1916, there already existed some 2000 fixed venues for movie performances and initially film screenings were supplemented or even replaced by [[Variety show|variety]] turns. In 1917 a process of concentration and partial nationalisation of the German film industry began with the founding of [[Universum Film AG]] (UFA), which was partly a reaction to the very effective use that the Allied Powers had found for the new medium for the purpose of [[propaganda]]. Under the aegis of the military, so-called ''Vaterland'' films were produced, which equalled the Allies' films in the matter of propaganda and disparagement of the enemy. Audiences however did not care to swallow the patriotic medicine without the accompanying sugar of the light-entertainment films which, consequently, Ufa also promoted. The German film industry soon became the largest in Europe.\n\n==1918\u20131933 Weimar Republic==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1991-0109-502, Berlin, Aufnahmegel\u00e4nde der Ufa in Tempelhof.jpg|thumb|[[Universum Film AG|UFA Studios]] in [[Berlin-Tempelhof]], 1920]]\n<!-- NOTE: \"Cinema of the Weimar Republic\" redirects to this section heading.

Many countries banned the import of German films and audiences themselves were resisting anything that was \"German\".<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the economic situation was unstable and the devaluation of the currency made it difficult for the smaller production companies to function. Film industry financing was a fragile business and expensive productions occasionally led to bankruptcy. In 1925 UFA itself was forced to go into a disadvantageous partnership called [[Parufamet]] with the American studios [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[MGM]], before being taken over by the [[nationalist]] industrialist and newspaper owner [[Alfred Hugenberg]] in 1927.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Maria from metropolis.JPG|thumb|upright|1927's ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' by [[Fritz Lang]] was the first feature length science fiction film in history.<ref>[http://www.scififilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=metro SciFi Film History - Metropolis (1927)] - ''Although the first science fiction film is generally agreed to be Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' A Trip To The Moon (1902), Metropolis (1926) is the first feature length outing of the genre.''

This industry was attracting producers and directors from all over Europe. The fact that the films were silent and language was not a factor, enabled even foreign actors, like the Danish film star [[Asta Nielsen]] or the American [[Louise Brooks]], to be hired even for leading roles. This period can also be noted for new technological developments in film making and experimentation in set design and lighting, led by UFA. [[Babelsberg Studio|Babelsberg studio]], which was incorporated into UFA, expanded massively and gave the German film industry a highly developed infrastructure. Babelsberg remained the centre of German filmmaking for many years, became the largest film studio in Europe and produced most of the films in this \"golden era\" of German cinema.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Macropedia - Volume 24 - Motion Pictures|last=|first=|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=376\u2013378}}</ref> In essence it was \"the German equivalent to Hollywood\".<ref>{{cite book|title=A Critical History of German Film|last=Brockmann|first=Stephen|publisher=Camden House|year=2010|isbn=978-1-57113-468-4|page=24}}</ref>\n\nDue to the unstable economic condition and in an attempt to deal with modest production budgets, filmmakers were trying to reach the largest audience possible and in that, to maximize their revenues. This led to films being made in a vast array of genres and styles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:CABINETOFDRCALIGARI-poster.jpg|thumb|left|140px|''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), directed by [[Robert Wiene]].]]\n\nOne of the main film genres associated with the Weimar Republic cinema is [[German Expressionism]] which was inspired by the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] movement in art. Expressionist movies relied heavily on [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and artistic [[image]]ry rather than stark [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to tell their stories. Given the grim mood in post-[[World War I|WWI]], it was not surprising that these films focused heavily on crime and horror. The film usually credited with sparking the popularity of [[expressionism]] is [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), produced by [[Erich Pommer]]. The film tells the story of a demented [[Hypnosis|hypnotist]] who is using a sleepwalker to perform a series of murders. The film featured a dark and twisted visual style - the set was unrealistic with geometric images painted on the floor and shapes in light and shadow cast on walls, the acting was exaggerated and the costumes bizarre. These stylistic elements became trademarks of this cinematic movement. Other notable works of Expressionism are [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), [[Carl Boese]] and [[Paul Wegener]]'s ''[[The Golem: How He Came Into the World]]'' (1920) and ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. The [[Expressionism (film)|Expressionist movement]] began to wane during the mid-1920s, but perhaps the fact that its main creators moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, California]], allowed this style to remain influential in world cinema for years to come, particularly in American [[horror films]] and [[film noir]] and in the works of European directors such as [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts|last=Hayward|first=Susan|publisher=Routledge - Taylor & Francis|year=2000|isbn=0-415-22739-9|location=New York, NY|pages=175\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nDespite its significance, expressionist cinema was not the dominant genre of this era.<ref name=\":2\" /> Many other genres such as; period dramas, melodramas, romantic comedies and films of social and political nature, were much more prevalent and definitely more popular.\n\nThe \"master\" of period-dramas was undoubtedly [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. His most notable films of this genre were ''[[Madame DuBarry (1919 film)|Madame DuBarry]]'' (1919) which portrayed the [[French Revolution|French revolution]] through the eyes of the King of France's mistress, and the film ''[[Anna Boleyn (film)|Anna Boleyn]]'' (1920) on the tragic end of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]'s second wife. In these films, Lubitsch presented prominent historic personalities who are caught up by their weaknesses and petty urges and thus, ironically, become responsible for huge historical events. Despite modest budgets, his films included extravagant scenes which were meant to appeal to a wide audience and insure a wide international distribution.\n\nAs the genre of expressionism began to diminish, the genre of the [[New Objectivity (film)|New Objectivity]] (die neue Sachlichkeit) began to take its place. It was influenced by new issues which occupied the public in those years, as the rampant inflation caused deterioration in the economic status of the middle class. These films, often called \"street films\" or \"asphalt films\", tried to reflect reality in all its complexity and ugliness. They focused on objects surrounding the characters and cynically symbolized the despair felt by the German people, whose lives were shattered after the war. The most prominent film maker who is associated with this genre is [[G. W. Pabst|Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] in his films such as: ''[[Joyless Street]]'' (1925), ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929), and ''[[The Loves of Jeanne Ney]]'' (1927). Pabst is also credited with innovations in film editing, such as reversing the angle of the camera or cutting between two camera angles, which enhanced film continuity and later became standards of the industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPabst is also identified with another genre which branched from the New Objectivity - that of social and political films. These filmmakers dared to confront sensitive and controversial social issues which engaged the public in those days; such as [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], [[prostitution]] and [[homosexuality]]. To a large extent, Weimar cinema was playing a vibrant and important role by leading public debate on those issues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shapira|first=Avner|date=December 20, 2010|title=Going Into the Night -  New Look at Early German Cinema by Ofer Ashkenazi|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/1.1235958|journal=Haaretz|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Pabst, in his film ''[[Diary of a Lost Girl]]'' (1929), tells the story of a young woman who has a child out of wedlock, is thrown out into the street by her family and has to resort to prostitution in order to survive. As early as 1919, [[Richard Oswald]]'s film ''[[Different from the Others]]'' portrayed a man torn between his homosexual tendencies and the moral and social conventions. It is considered to be the first German film to deal with homosexuality and some researchers even believe it to be the first in the world to examine this issue explicitly.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiss |first1=Robert |chapter=Queer Traditions in German Cinema |editor1-last=Bergfelder |editor1-first=Tim |editor2-last=Carter |editor2-first=Erica |editor3-last=Goektuerk |editor3-first=Deniz |title=The German Cinema Book |publisher=British Film Institute |date=2002 |isbn=0-85170-946-X |location= |page=48}}</ref> That same year, the film ''[[Ritual Murder]]'' (1919) by Jewish film producer [[Max Nivelli]] came to the screen. This film was the first to make the German public aware of the consequences of anti-Semitism and [[xenophobia]]. It portrayed a \"[[pogrom]]\" which is carried out against the [[Jews|Jewish]] inhabitants of a village in [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]]. In the background, a love story also evolves between a young Russian student and the daughter of the leader of the Jewish community, something that was considered a [[taboo]] at the time. Later on, in an attempt to reflect the rapidly growing anti-Semitic atmosphere, Oswald confronted the same issue with his film [[Dreyfus (1930 film)|''Dreyfus'']] (1930), which portrayed the 1894 political scandal of the \"[[Dreyfus affair|Dreyfus Affair]]\", which until today remains one of the most striking examples of miscarriage of justice and blatant anti-Semitism.\n\nThe polarised politics of the [[Weimar culture|Weimar period]] were also reflected in some of its films. A series of patriotic films about [[Prussia]]n history, starring [[Otto Geb\u00fchr]] as [[Frederick the Great]] were produced throughout the 1920s and were popular with the nationalist right-wing, who strongly criticised the \"asphalt\" films' decadence. Another dark chapter of the Weimar period was reflected in [[Joseph Delmont]]'s film ''[[Humanity Unleashed]]'' (1920). The film was an adaptation of a novel by the same name, written by [[Max Glass]] and published in 1919. The novel described a dark world consumed by disease and war. The filmmakers decided to take the story to a more contemporary context by reflecting the growing fear among the German public of political [[radicalization]]. They produced what was to become the first fictional account of the events of January 1919 in Berlin, the so-called \"[[Spartacist Uprising]]\". This film is also considered one of the anti-[[Bolshevik]] films of that era.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"Humanity Unleashed: Anti-Bolshevism as Popular Culture in Early Weimar Cinema\" in The Many Faces of Weimar Cinema (Edited by Christian Rogowski)|last=Stiasny|first=Philipp|publisher=Camden House|year=2010|isbn=1-57113-532-4|location=Rochester, New York|pages=48\u201366}}</ref>\n\nAnother important film genre of the Weimar years was the [[Kammerspielfilm|Kammerspiel]] or \"chamber drama\", which was borrowed from the theater and developed by stage director, who would later become a film producer and director himself, [[Max Reinhardt]]. This style was in many ways a reaction against the spectacle of expressionism and thus tended to revolve around ordinary people from the lower-middle-class. Films of this genre were often called \"instinct\" films because they emphasized the impulses and intimate psychology of the characters. The sets were kept to a minimum and there was abundant use of camera movements in order to add complexity to the rather intimate and simple spaces. Associated with this particular style is also screenwriter [[Carl Mayer]] and films such as Murnau's ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|Last Laugh]] (1924).''\n\nNature films, a genre referred to as ''[[Mountain film|Bergfilm]],'' also became popular. Most known in this category are the films by director [[Arnold Fanck]], in which individuals were shown battling against nature in the mountains. [[Animator]]s and directors of [[experimental film]]s such as; [[Lotte Reiniger]], [[Oskar Fischinger]] and [[Walter Ruttmann]], were also very active in Germany in the 1920s. Ruttman's experimental documentary ''[[Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis]]'' (1927) epitomised the energy of 1920s Berlin.\n\nThe arrival of sound at the very end of the 1920s, produced a final artistic flourish of German film before the collapse of the Weimar Republic in 1933. As early as 1918, three inventors came up with the Tri-Ergon sound-on-film system and tried to introduce it to the industry between 1922 and 1926. [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] showed an interest, but possibly due to financial difficulties, never made a sound film.<ref>Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristen. (2003) \"Film History An Introduction\". New York: McGraw-Hill, p.200.</ref> But in the late 1920s, sound production and distribution were starting to be adopted by the German film industry and by 1932 Germany had 3,800 cinemas equipped to play sound films. The first filmmakers who experimented with the new technology often shot the film in several versions, using several soundtracks in different languages. The film ''[[The Blue Angel|The Blue angel]]'' (1930), directed by the Austrian [[Josef von Sternberg]] and produced by [[Erich Pommer]], was also shot in two versions - German and English, with a different supporting cast in each version. It is considered to be Germany's first \"[[talkie]]\" and will always be remembered as the film that made an international superstar of its lead actress [[Marlene Dietrich]]. Other notable early sound films, all from 1931, include [[Phil Jutzi|Jutzi's]] adaptation to Alfred D\u00f6blin's novel ''[[Berlin-Alexanderplatz (1931 film)|Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', Pabst's [[Bertolt Brecht]] adaptation ''[[The Threepenny Opera (1931 film)|The Threepenny Opera]]'' and Lang's ''[[M (1931 film)|M]],'' as well as [[Werner Hochbaum|Hochbaum's]] ''[[Raid in St. Pauli]]'' (1932). Brecht was also one of the creators of the explicitly [[communist]] film ''[[Kuhle Wampe]]'' (1932), which was banned soon after its release.\n\nIn addition to developments in the industry itself, the Weimar period saw the birth of [[film criticism]] as a serious discipline whose practitioners included [[Rudolf Arnheim]] in ''[[Die Weltb\u00fchne]]'' and in ''Film als Kunst'' (1932), [[B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs]] in ''Der Sichtbare Mensch'' (1924), [[Siegfried Kracauer]] in the [[Frankfurter Zeitung]], and [[Lotte H. Eisner]] in the ''Filmkurier''.\n\n{{See also|List of German films 1919\u20131933}}\n\n==1933\u20131945 Nazi Germany==\n{{anchor|Nazi Germany}}\n\nThe uncertain economic and political situation in Weimar Germany had already led to a number of film-makers and performers leaving the country, primarily for the United States; Ernst Lubitsch moved to [[Hollywood]] as early as 1923, the Hungarian-born [[Michael Curtiz]] in 1926. Some 1,500 directors, producers, actors and other film professionals [[emigration|emigrated]] in the years after the [[Nazi]]s came to power. Among them were such key figures as the producer [[Erich Pommer]], the studio head of Ufa, stars Marlene Dietrich and [[Peter Lorre]], and director [[Fritz Lang]]. Lang's exodus to America is legendary; it is said that ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' so greatly impressed [[Joseph Goebbels]] that he asked Lang to become the head of his [[propaganda]] film unit.  Lang fled to America instead, where he had a long and prosperous career. Many up-and-coming German directors also fled to the U.S., having a major influence on American film as a result. A number of the [[Universal Horror]] films of the 1930s were directed by German emigrees, including [[Karl Freund]], [[Joe May]] and [[Robert Siodmak]]. Directors [[Edgar Ulmer]] and [[Douglas Sirk]] and the Austrian-born screenwriter (and later director) [[Billy Wilder]] also emigrated from Nazi Germany to Hollywood success. Not all those in the film industry threatened by the Nazi regime were able to escape; the actor and director [[Kurt Gerron]], for example, perished in a [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]].\n\n[[File:Titania-Palast bei Nacht 2.jpg|thumb|The ''Titania-Palast'' in [[Berlin-Steglitz]], an [[Art Deco]] style movie theater opened in 1928]]\n\nWithin weeks of the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'', Alfred Hugenberg had effectively turned over Ufa to the ends of the Nazis, excluding Jews from employment in the company in March 1933, several months before the foundation in June of the ''[[Reichsfilmkammer]]'' (Reich Chamber of Film), the body of the Nazi state charged with control of the film industry, which marked the official exclusion of Jews and foreigners from employment in the German film industry. As part of the process of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' all film production in Germany was subordinate to the ''Reichsfilmkammer'', which was directly responsible to Goebbel's [[Propagandaministerium|Propaganda ministry]], and all those employed in the industry had to be members of the ''Reichsfachschaft Film''. \"Non-Aryan\" film professionals and those whose politics or personal life were unacceptable to the Nazis were excluded from the ''Reichsfachschaft'' and thus denied employment in the industry. Some 3,000 individuals were affected by this employment ban. In addition, as journalists were also organised as a division of the Propaganda Ministry, Goebbels was able to abolish film criticism in 1936 and replace it with ''Filmbeobachtung'' (film observation); journalists could only report on the content of a film, not offer judgement on its artistic or other worth.\n\nWith the German film industry now effectively an arm of the [[totalitarian]] state, no films could be made that were not ostensibly in accord with the views of the ruling regime. However, despite the existence of anti-semitic propaganda works such as ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|The Eternal Jew]]'' (1940)\u2014which was a box-office flop\u2014and the more sophisticated but equally anti-semitic ''[[Jud S\u00fc\u00df (1940 film)|Jud S\u00fc\u00df]]'' (1940), which achieved commercial success at home and elsewhere in Europe, the majority of German films from the National Socialist period were intended principally as works of entertainment. The import of foreign films was legally restricted after 1936 and the German industry, which was effectively [[nationalisation|nationalised]] in 1937, had to make up for the missing foreign films (above all American productions). Entertainment also became increasingly important in the later years of [[World War II]] when the cinema provided a distraction from Allied bombing and a string of German defeats. In both 1943 and 1944 cinema admissions in Germany exceeded a billion,<ref name=spio>[http://www.spio.de/media_content/610.pdf Kinobesuche in Deutschland 1925 bis 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204111257/http://www.spio.de/media_content/610.pdf |date=2012-02-04 }} Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft e.

''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]'' (1943) was another big-budget epic that arguably inspired other films about the ill-fated ocean liner.<ref>Fiebing, Malte.

Technical and aesthetic achievement could also be turned to the specific ends of the Nazi state, most spectacularly in the work of [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. Riefenstahl's ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), documenting the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally]], and ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' (1938), documenting the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that have influenced many later films. Both films, particularly ''Triumph of the Will'', remain highly controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of Nazi ideals.\n\n{{See also|Nazism and cinema|List of German films 1933\u20131945}}\n\n== 1945\u20131989 East Germany ==\n<!-- NOTE: \"Cinema of East Germany\" redirects to this section heading. Please update the redirect if you make a change to the heading. -->\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\nEast German cinema initially profited from the fact that much of the country's film infrastructure, notably the former UFA studios, lay in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] which enabled film production to get off the ground more quickly than in the Western sectors. The authorities in the Soviet Zone were keen to re-establish the film industry in their sector and an order was issued to re-open cinemas in Berlin in May 1945 within three weeks of German capitulation. The film production company [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]] was founded on 17 May 1946, and took control of the film production facilities in the Soviet Zone which had been confiscated by order of the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] in October 1945. Theoretically a [[joint-stock company]], the majority interest in DEFA was actually held by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) which became the ruling party of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) after 1949, formally placing DEFA as the state-owned monopoly for film production in East Germany.  A sister \"company\", [[Progress Film]], had also been established as a similar monopoly for domestic film distribution, its principal \"competition\" being Sovexportfilm, which handled distribution of Soviet films.\n\n\n\nIn total DEFA produced some 900 feature films during its existence as well as around 800 animated films and over 3000 documentaries and short films. In its early years, production was limited due to strict controls imposed by the authorities which restricted the subject-matter of films to topics that directly contributed to the Communist project of the state. Excluding newsreels and educational films, only 50 films were produced between 1948 and 1953. However, in later years numerous films were produced on a variety of themes. DEFA had particular strengths in [[children's film]]s, notably [[fairy tale]] adaptations such as ''[[T\u0159i o\u0159\u00ed\u0161ky pro Popelku|Drei Haseln\u00fcsse f\u00fcr Aschenbr\u00f6del]] (Three Nuts for Cinderella)'' (1973), but it also attempted other genre works: science-fiction, for example ''[[Der schweigende Stern]] (The Silent Star)'' (1960), an adaptation of a [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]] novel, or \"[[Ostern|red westerns]]\" such as ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear]]'' (1966) in which, in contrast to the typical American western, the heroes tended to be [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Many of these genre films were co-productions with other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries.\n\nNotable non-genre films produced by DEFA include Wolfgang Staudte's adaptation of [[Heinrich Mann]]'s ''[[Der Untertan (film)|Der Untertan]]'' (1951); [[Konrad Wolf]]'s ''[[Divided Heaven (film)|Der geteilte Himmel]] (Divided Heaven)'' (1964), an adaptation of [[Christa Wolf]]'s novel; [[Frank Beyer]]'s adaptation of [[Jurek Becker]]'s ''[[Jacob the Liar (1975 film)|Jacob the Liar]]'' (1975), the only [[East Germany|East German]] film to be nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]; ''[[The Legend Of Paul And Paula]]'' (1973), directed by [[Heiner Carow]] from [[Ulrich Plenzdorf]]'s novel; and ''[[Solo Sunny]]'' (1980), again the work of Konrad Wolf.\n\nHowever, film-making in the GDR was always constrained and oriented by the political situation in the country at any given time. [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], the communist leader in the Weimar period, was the subject of several [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] films in the 1950s (''[[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann (film)|Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]]'', 1954), and although East German filmmaking moved away from this overtly [[Stalinist]] approach in the 1960s, filmmakers were still subject to the changing political positions, and indeed the whims, of the SED leadership. For example, DEFA's full slate of contemporary films from 1966 were denied distribution, among them Frank Beyer's ''[[Traces of Stones]]'' (1966) which was pulled from distribution after three days, not because it was antipathetic to communist principles, but because it showed that such principles, which it fostered, were not put into practice at all times in East Germany. The huge box-office hit ''The Legend of Paul and Paula'' was initially threatened with a distribution ban because of its satirical elements and supposedly only allowed a release on the say-so of Party General Secretary [[Erich Honecker]].\n\nIn the late 1970s numerous film-makers left the GDR for the West as a result of restrictions on their work, among them director [[Egon G\u00fcnther]] and actors [[Angelica Domr\u00f6se]], [[Eva-Maria Hagen]], [[Katharina Thalbach]], [[Hilmar Thate]], [[Manfred Krug]] and [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]].  Many had been signatories of a 1976 petition opposing the [[expatriation]] of socially critical singer-songwriter [[Wolf Biermann]] and had had their ability to work restricted as a result.\n\nIn the final years of the GDR, the availability of television and the programming and films on television broadcasts reaching into the GDR via the uncontrollable airwaves, DEFA's productions' importance was reduced, although its continuing role in producing shows for East German television channel remained. Following the [[Die Wende|Wende]], DEFA had ceased production altogether, and its studios and equipment was sold off by the [[Treuhand]] in 1992, but its [[intellectual property rights]] were handed to the charitable ''DEFA-Stiftung'' (DEFA Foundation) which exploits these rights in conjunction with a series of private companies, especially the quickly privatized Progress Film GmbH, which has issued several East German films with English subtitles since the mid-1990s.\n\n==1945\u20131989 West Germany==\n<!-- NOTE: \"Cinema of West Germany\" redirects to this section heading. Please update the redirect if you make a change to the heading. -->\n\n===1945\u20131960 Reconstruction===\n\nThe occupation and reconstruction of Germany by the [[Allied Control Council|Four Powers]] in the period immediately after the end of [[World War II]] brought a major and long-lasting change to the economic conditions under which the industry in Germany had previously operated. The holdings of Ufa were confiscated by the Allies and, as part of the process of [[decartelisation]], licences to produce films were shared between a range of much smaller companies. In addition, the [[Occupation Statute]] of 1949, which granted partial independence to the newly created [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], specifically forbade the imposition of import quotas to protect German film production from foreign competition, the result of lobbying by the American industry as represented by the [[MPAA]].\n\nAmidst the devastation of the ''[[Stunde Null]]'' year of 1945 cinema attendance was unsurprisingly down to a fraction of its wartime heights, but already by the end of the decade it had reached levels that exceeded the pre-war period.<ref name=\"spio\" /> For the first time in many years, German audiences had free access to cinema from around the world and in this period the films of [[Charlie Chaplin]] remained popular, as were [[melodrama]]s from the United States. Nonetheless, the share of the film market for German films in this period and into the 1950s remained relatively large, taking up some 40 percent of the total market. American films took up around 30 percent of the market despite having around twice as many films in distribution as the German industry in the same time frame.<ref>Schneider 1990:35, 42 & 44</ref>\n\nMany of the German films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as belonging to the genre of the ''[[Tr\u00fcmmerfilm]]'' (literally \"rubble film\"). These films show strong affinities with the work of [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], not least [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s neorealist trilogy which included ''[[Germany Year Zero]]'' (1948), and are concerned primarily with day-to-day life in the devastated Germany and an initial reaction to the events of the Nazi period (the full horror of which was first experienced by many in documentary footage from liberated concentration camps). Such films include [[Wolfgang Staudte]]'s ''[[Die M\u00f6rder sind unter uns]] (The Murderers are among us)'' (1946), the first film made in post-war Germany (produced in the soviet sector), and [[Wolfgang Liebeneiner]]'s ''[[Liebe 47]] (Love 47)'' (1949), an adaptation of [[Wolfgang Borchert]]'s play ''[[Drau\u00dfen vor der T\u00fcr]]''.\n\nDespite the advent of a regular [[television]] service in the Federal Republic in 1952, cinema attendances continued to grow through much of the 1950s, reaching a peak of 817.5 million visits in 1956.<ref name=\"spio\" /> The majority of the films of this period set out to do no more than entertain the audience and had few pretensions to artistry or active engagement with social issues. The defining genre of the period was arguably the ''[[Heimatfilm]]'' (\"homeland film\"), in which morally simplistic tales of love and family were played out in a rural setting, often in the mountains of [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]] or [[Switzerland]].  In their day ''Heimatfilms'' were of little interest to more scholarly film critics, but in recent years they have been the subject of study in relation to what they say about the culture of West Germany in the years of the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''. Other film genres typical of this period were adaptations of [[operetta]]s, hospital [[melodrama]]s, comedies and musicals. Many films were [[remake]]s of earlier Ufa productions.\n\n[[Wiederbewaffnung|Rearmament]] and the founding of the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' in 1955 brought with it a wave of war films which tended to depict the ordinary German soldiers of World War II as brave and apolitical.<ref name=\"Bartov, Omer pages 130\u2013143\"/> The Israeli historian [[Omer Bartov]] wrote that German films of the 1950s showed the average German soldier as a heroic victim: noble, tough, brave, honourable, and patriotic while fighting hard in a senseless war for a regime that he did not care for.<ref>Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy '' edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 pages 134\u2013135.</ref>  The ''[[08/15 (film)|08/15]]'' film trilogy of 1954\u201355 concerns a sensitive young German soldier who would rather play the piano than fight, and who fights on the Eastern Front without understanding why; however, no mention is made of the genocidal aspects of Germany's war in East.<ref name=\"Bartov, Omer pages 130\u2013143\">Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy '' edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 136.</ref> The last of the ''08/15'' films ends with Germany occupied by a gang of American soldiers portrayed as bubble-gum chewing, slack-jawed morons and uncultured louts, totally inferior in every respect to the heroic German soldiers shown in the ''08/15'' films.<ref name=\"Bartov, Omer pages 130\u2013143\"/> The only exception is the Jewish American officer, who is shown as both hyper-intelligent and very unscrupulous, which Bartov noted seems to imply that the real tragedy of World War II was the Nazis did not get a chance to exterminate all of the Jews, who have now returned with Germany's defeat to once more exploit the German people.<ref name=\"Bartov, Omer pages 130\u2013143\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Doctor of Stalingrad]]'' (1958) dealing with German POWs in the Soviet Union, Germans are portrayed as more civilized, humane and intelligent than the Soviets, who are shown for the most part as Mongol savages who brutalized the German POWs.<ref name=\"Reference A\">Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy '' edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 137.</ref> One of the German POWs successfully seduces the beautiful and tough Red Army Captain Alexandra Kasalniskaya ([[Eva Bartok]]) who prefers him to the sadistic camp commandant, which as Bartov comments also is meant to show that even in defeat, German men were more sexually virile and potent than their Russian counterparts.<ref name=\"Reference A\"/> In ''[[Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?|Hunde, wollt ihr ewig leben?]]'' (''Dogs, do you want to live forever?'') of 1959, which deals with the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the focus is on celebrating the heroism of the German soldier in that battle, who are shown as valiantly holding out against overwhelming odds with no mention at all of what those soldiers were fighting for, namely National Socialist ideology or the Holocaust.<ref>Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy '' edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 138.</ref> This period also saw a number of films that depicted the military [[Widerstand|resistance to Hitler]].

Other Edgar Wallace adaptations in a similar style were made by the Germans [[Artur Brauner]] and [[Kurt Ulrich]], and the British producer [[Harry Alan Towers]].\n\nThe international significance of the [[West Germany|West German]] film industry of the 1950s could no longer measure up to that of [[France]], [[Italy]], or [[Japan]]. German films were only rarely distributed internationally as they were perceived as provincial. International co-productions of the kind which were becoming common in France and Italy tended to be rejected by German producers (Schneider 1990:43). However a few German films and film-makers did achieve international recognition at this time, among them [[Bernhard Wicki]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Die Br\u00fccke (film)|Die Br\u00fccke]] (The Bridge)'' (1959), and the actresses [[Hildegard Knef]] and [[Romy Schneider]].\n\n=== 1960\u20131970 cinema in crisis ===\n[[File:Klaus Kinski - Per un pugno di dollari.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Klaus Kinski]]]]\n\nIn the late 1950s, the growth in cinema attendance of the preceding decade first stagnated and then went into freefall throughout the 1960s. By 1969 West German cinema attendance at 172.2 million visits per year was less than a quarter of its 1956 post-war peak.<ref name=\"spio\" /> As a consequence of this, numerous German production and distribution companies went out of business in the 1950s and 1960s and cinemas across the Federal Republic closed their doors; the number of screens in West Germany almost halved between the beginning and the end of the decade.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nInitially, the crisis was perceived as a problem of overproduction. Consequently, the German film industry cut back on production. 123 German movies were produced in 1955, only 65 in 1965. However, many German film companies followed the 1960s trends of [[international co-production]]s with Italy and Spain in such genres as [[spaghetti westerns]] and [[Eurospy]] films with films shot in those nations or in Yugoslavia that featured German actors in the casts.\n\nThe roots of the problem lay deeper in changing economic and social circumstances. Average incomes in the Federal Republic rose sharply and this opened up alternative leisure activities to compete with cinema-going. At this time too, television was developing into a mass medium that could compete with the cinema. In 1953 there were only 1,000,000 sets in West Germany; by 1962 there were 7 million (Connor 1990:49) (Hoffman 1990:69).\n\nThe majority of films produced in the Federal Republic in the 1960s were genre works: [[western (genre)|westerns]], especially the series of movies adapted from [[Karl May]]'s popular genre novels which starred [[Pierre Brice]] as the [[Apache]] [[Winnetou]] and [[Lex Barker]] as his white blood brother [[Old Shatterhand]]; [[Thriller film|thriller]]s and crime films, notably a series of [[Edgar Wallace movies]] from [[Rialto Film]] in which [[Klaus Kinski]], [[Heinz Drache]], [[Karin Dor]] and [[Joachim Fuchsberger]] were among the regular players.  The traditional Krimi films expanded into series based on German pulp fiction heroes such as ''[[Jerry Cotton]]'' played by [[George Nader]] and ''[[Kommissar X]]'' played by [[Tony Kendall (actor)|Tony Kendall]] and [[Brad Harris]]. West Germany also made several [[horror film]]s including ones starring [[Christopher Lee]].  The two genres were combined in the return of ''[[Doctor Mabuse]]'' in a series of several films of the early 1960s.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] sex films, both the relatively serious ''Aufkl\u00e4rungsfilme'' ([[sex education]] films) of [[Oswalt Kolle]] and such [[exploitation films]] as ''[[Schulm\u00e4dchen-Report]] (Schoolgirl Report)'' (1970) and its successors were produced into the 1970s. Such movies were commercially successful and often enjoyed international distribution, but won little acclaim from critics.\n\n===1960\u20131980 New German Cinema===\n{{further|New German Cinema}}\n\nIn the 1960s more than three quarters of the regular cinema audience were lost as consequence of the rising popularity of TV sets at home. As a reaction to the artistic and economic stagnation of German cinema, a group of young film-makers issued the [[Oberhausen Manifesto]] on February 28, 1962. This call to arms, which included [[Alexander Kluge]], [[Edgar Reitz]], [[Peter Schamoni]] and [[Franz-Josef Spieker]] among its signatories, provocatively declared ''\"Der alte Film ist tot. Wir glauben an den neuen\"'' (\"The old cinema is dead. We believe in the new cinema\"). Other up-and-coming filmmakers allied themselves to this Oberhausen group, among them [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Jean-Marie Straub]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[Werner Schroeter]] and [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg]] in their rejection of the existing German film industry and their determination to build a new cinema founded on artistic and social measures rather than commercial success. Most of these directors organized themselves in, or partially co-operated with, the film production and distribution company ''[[Filmverlag der Autoren]]'' established in 1971, which throughout the 1970s brought forth a number of critically acclaimed films.\n\nDespite the foundation of the ''Kuratorium Junger Deutscher Film'' (Young German Film Committee) in 1965, set up under the auspices of the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior]] to support new German films financially, the directors of this [[New German Cinema]] were consequently often dependent on money from television. Young filmmakers had the opportunity to test their mettle in such programmes as the stand-alone drama and documentary series ''Das kleine Fernsehspiel'' (The Little TV Play) or the television films of the crime series ''[[Tatort]]''. However, the broadcasters sought TV premieres for the films which they had supported financially, with theatrical showings only occurring later. As a consequence, such films tended to be unsuccessful at the box office.\n\nThis situation changed after 1974 when the ''Film-Fernseh-Abkommen'' (Film and Television Accord) was agreed between the Federal Republic's main broadcasters, [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]], and the German Federal Film Board (a government body created in 1968 to support film-making in Germany).<ref name=FFA>[http://www.ffa.de/index.php?page=profil&language=_en Information on the Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt (FFA) \u2013 German Federal Film Board]</ref> This accord, which has been repeatedly extended up to the present day, provides for the television companies to make available an annual sum to support the production of films which are suitable for both theatrical distribution and television presentation. (The amount of money provided by the public broadcasters has varied between 4.5 and 12.94 million euros per year. Under the terms of the accord, films produced using these funds can only be screened on television 24 months after their theatrical release. They may appear on [[video]] or [[DVD]] no sooner than six months after cinema release. Nevertheless, the New German Cinema found it difficult to attract a large domestic or international audience.\n\nThe socially critical films of the New German Cinema strove to delineate themselves from what had gone before and the works of [[auteur theory|auteur]] film-makers such as Kluge and Fassbinder are examples of this, although Fassbinder in his use of stars from German cinema history also sought a reconciliation between the new cinema and the old. In addition, a distinction is sometimes drawn between the avantgarde \"Young German Cinema\" of the 1960s and the more accessible \"New German Cinema\" of the 1970s. For their influences the new generation of film-makers looked to [[Italian neorealism]], the French ''[[French New Wave|Nouvelle Vague]]'' and the [[British New Wave]] but combined this eclectically with references to the well-established genres of Hollywood cinema. The New German Cinema dealt with contemporary German social problems in a direct way; the Nazi past, the plight of the ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (\"guest workers\"), and modern social developments, were all subjects prominent in New German Cinema films.<ref>{{cite book|last=Julia|first=Knight|title=New German Cinema: Images of a Generation|year=2004|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-28-4|pages=45\u20136}}</ref>\n\nFilms such as Kluge's ''[[Yesterday Girl|Abschied von Gestern]]'' (1966), Herzog's ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972), Fassbinder's ''[[Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]'' (1979), and Wenders' ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' (1984) found critical approval. Often the work of these auteurs was first recognised abroad rather than in Germany itself. The work of post-war Germany's leading novelists [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]] and [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] provided source material for the adaptations ''[[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (film)|The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum]]'' (1975) (by Schl\u00f6ndorff and [[Margarethe von Trotta]]) and ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' (1979) (by Schl\u00f6ndorff alone) respectively, the latter becoming the first German film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The New German Cinema also allowed for female directors to come to the fore and for the development of a feminist cinema which encompassed the works of directors such as [[Margarethe von Trotta]], [[Helma Sanders-Brahms]], [[Helke Sander]] and [[Cristina Perincioli]].\n\nGerman production companies have been quite commonly involved in expensive French and Italian productions from [[Spaghetti Westerns]] to French comic book adaptations.\n\n=== 1980\u20131989 popular productions ===\n[[File:Boulevard-der-stars-IMG 1461x.JPG|thumb|Bernd Eichinger \"star\" at the Boulevard of Stars in Berlin.]]\n\nHaving achieved some of its goals, among them the establishment of state funding for the film industry and renewed international recognition for German films, the New German Cinema had begun to show signs of fatigue by the 1980s, even though many of its proponents continued to enjoy individual success.\n\nAmong the commercial successes for German films of the 1980s were the ''Otto'' film series beginning in 1985 starring comedian [[Otto Waalkes]], [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s adaptation of ''[[Die Unendliche Geschichte (film)|The NeverEnding Story]]'' (1984), and the internationally successful ''[[Das Boot (film)|Das Boot]]'' (1981), which still holds the record for most [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for a German film (six). Other notable film-makers who came to prominence in the 1980s include producer [[Bernd Eichinger]] and directors [[Doris D\u00f6rrie]], [[Uli Edel]], and [[Vicco von B\u00fclow|Loriot]].\n\nAway from the mainstream, the [[splatter film]] director [[J\u00f6rg Buttgereit]] came to prominence in the 1980s. The development of arthouse cinemas (''Programmkinos'') from the 1970s onwards provided a venue for the works of less mainstream film-makers.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s the spread of [[videocassette recorder]]s and the arrival of private TV channels such as [[RTL Television]] provided new competition for theatrical film distribution. Cinema attendance, having rallied slightly in the late 1970s after an all-time low of 115.1 million visits in 1976, dropped sharply again from the mid-1980s to end at just 101.6 million visits in 1989.<ref name=\"spio\" /> However, the availability of a back catalogue of films on video also allowed for a different relationship between the viewer and an individual film, while private TV channels brought new money into the film industry and provided a launch pad from which new talent could later move into film.\n\n==1990\u2013Modern Germany==\n[[File:John Rabe filming.jpg|thumb|[[John Rabe (film)|John Rabe]] (2009), directed by [[Florian Gallenberger]], filming on location in Shanghai harbour.]]\n\nToday's biggest German production studios include [[Babelsberg Studio]], [[Bavaria Film]], [[Constantin Film]] and [[Universum Film AG|UFA]]. Film releases such as ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' by [[Tom Tykwer]], ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' by [[Wolfgang Becker]], ''[[Head-On (film)|Head-On]]''  by [[Fatih Akin]], ''[[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)|Perfume]]'' by [[Tom Tykwer]] and ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' by [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]], have arguably managed to recapture a provocative and innovative nature. Movies like ''[[The Baader Meinhof Complex]]'' produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]] achieved some popular success.\n\nNotable directors working in German currently include [[S\u00f6nke Wortmann]], [[Caroline Link]] (winner of an Academy Award), [[Romuald Karmakar]], [[Dani Levy]], [[Hans-Christian Schmid]], [[Andreas Dresen]], [[Dennis Gansel]] and [[Uli Edel]] as well as comedy directors [[Michael Herbig]] and [[Til Schweiger]].\n[[File:Hans zimmer 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Acclaimed film composer [[Hans Zimmer]]]]\nInternationally, German filmmakers such as [[Roland Emmerich]] or [[Wolfgang Petersen]] built successful careers as directors and producers. [[Hans Zimmer]], a film composer, has become one of the world's most acclaimed producers of movie scores. [[Michael Ballhaus]] became a renowned cinematographer.\n\nGermany has a long tradition of cooperation with the European-based film industry, which started as early as during the 1960s. Since 1990 the number of international projects financed and co-produced by German filmmakers has expanded.\n\nThe new millennium since 2000 has seen a general resurgence of the German film industry, with a higher output and improved returns at the German box office. Internationally though\nGerman productions are widely unknown and unsuccessful. Even domestically, the German movies hold only a market share of about 20-25%. The movie culture is recognized to be underfunded, problem laden and rather inward looking. Since its golden age in the 1920s the German film industry has never regained the technical excellence, the star system appeal, or the popular narratives suitable for a German, European or global audience.<ref>[http://www.exberliner.com/culture/film/the-german-film-have-a-future/ Does German film have a future?], Exberliner, retrieved 06 JUly 2016</ref>\n\n== German Film Academy ==\nThe [[Deutsche Filmakademie]] was founded in 2003 in [[Berlin]] and aims to provide native filmmakers a forum for discussion and a way to promote the reputation of German cinema through publications, presentations, discussions and regular promotion of the subject in the schools.\n\n===Awards===\nSince 2005, the winners of the [[Deutscher Filmpreis]], also known as the ''Lolas'' are elected by the members of the Deutsche Filmakademie.

The DFFF is a grant given by the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media. To receive the grant a producer has to fulfill different requirements including a cultural eligibility test. The fund offers 60 million euros a year to film producers and or co-producers and grants can amount to up to 20% of the approved German production costs. At least 25% the production costs must be spent in Germany, or only 20%, if the production costs are higher than 20 million euros. The DFFF has been established in 2007 and supported projects in all categories and genres.\n\nIn 2015 the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Energie) launched a new film & TV funding program entitled \"German Motion Picture Fund\". For the first time in Germany innovative series formats and digital filmmaking will be funded at a federal level in the same manner as feature films.<ref>[http://www.unverzagtvonhave.com/en/GermanMotionPictureFund-SummaryofKeyElementsUNVERZAGTVONHAVE_01_2016.PDF GERMAN MOTION PICTURE FUND] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308215502/http://www.unverzagtvonhave.com/en/GermanMotionPictureFund-SummaryofKeyElementsUNVERZAGTVONHAVE_01_2016.PDF |date=2016-03-08 }} (PDF), 8 March 2016</ref>\n\n==Film schools==\n[[File:Staatliches Museum \u00c4gyptischer Kunst und HFF.jpg|thumb|[[University of Television and Film Munich]]]]\n\nSeveral institutions, both government run and private, provide formal education in various aspects of filmmaking.\n\n*[[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin]] (dffb) [[Berlin]]\n*[[Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg]] (HfbK) [[Hamburg]]\n*[[Film Academy Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Ludwigsburg]]\n*[[Internationale filmschule k\u00f6ln|International Film School Cologne]], [[Cologne]]\n*[[University of Television and Film Munich]], [[Munich]]\n* Filmuniversit\u00e4t Babelsberg, [[Potsdam]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Personalities==\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Marlene Dietrich in No Highway (1951) (Cropped).png|[[Marlene Dietrich]]\nFile:Michael Ballhaus.4676.jpg|[[Michael Ballhaus]]\n\nFile:Hans zimmer 2014.jpg|[[Hans Zimmer]]\nFile:Roland Emmerich Deauville 2013.jpg|[[Roland Emmerich]]\nFile:Boulevard der Stars 2012 Sir Kenneth Adam (cropped) (cropped).jpg|[[Ken Adam]]\nFile:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F034157-0020, Bonn, Bundeskanzler Brandt empf\u00e4ngt Schauspieler cropped.jpg|[[Curd J\u00fcrgens]]\n</Gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|Germany|European Union}}\n* [[European Film Academy]]\n* [[Cinema of the world]]\n* [[History of cinema]]\n* [[Kammerspielfilm]]\n* [[List of films set in Berlin]]\n* [[German underground horror]]\n* [[Media of Germany]]\n* [[World cinema]]\n\n==References==\n{{Div col}}\n<references/>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Germany film list}}\n\n* Bergfelder, Tim, et al. eds.

The term does not include cases that may be lost due to other matters not related to legal merit. While colloquially, a person may term a lawsuit to be frivolous if he or she personally finds a claim to be absurd, in legal usage \"frivolous litigation\" consists of a claim or defense that is presented where the party (or the party's legal counsel) had reason to know that the claim or defense was manifestly insufficient or futile.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The fact that a claim is lost does not imply that it was frivolous.\n\nFrivolous litigation may be based on absurd legal theories, may involve a superabundance or repetition of [[Motion (legal)|motion]]s or additional suits, may be uncivil or harassing to the court, or may claim extreme [[Legal remedy|remedies]]. A claim or defense may be frivolous because it had no underlying justification in fact, or because it was not presented with an [[argument]] for a reasonable extension or reinterpretation of the [[law]].  A claim may be deemed frivolous because existing laws unequivocally prohibit such a claim, such as a so-called [[Good Samaritan law]].\n\nIn the [[United States]], Rule 11 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and similar state rules require that an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] perform a [[due diligence]] investigation concerning the factual basis for any claim or defense. Jurisdictions differ on whether a claim or defense can be frivolous if the attorney acted in [[good faith]]. Because such a defense or claim wastes the court's and the other parties' time, resources and legal fees, [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] may be imposed by a court upon the party or the lawyer who presents the frivolous defense or claim. The law firm may also be sanctioned, or even [[contempt of court|held in contempt]].\n\n==Federal statutes and rules of court penalizing frivolous litigation==\nIn the [[United States Tax Court]], frivolous arguments may result in a penalty of up to $25,000 under {{uscsub|26|6673|a|1}}. Similarly, section 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and the [[U.S. Courts of Appeals]] may impose penalties in which the taxpayer's appeal of a U.S. Tax Court decision was \"maintained primarily for delay\" or where \"the taxpayer's position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless.\"<ref>See paragraph (4) of subsection (c) of {{usc|26|7482}}.</ref> A common example, as shown below, is an argument based on [[tax protestor]] claims.\n\nIn a noncriminal case in a [[U.S. District Court]], a litigant (or a litigant's attorney) who presents any pleading, written motion or other paper to the court is required, under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to certify that, to the best of the presenter's knowledge and belief, the legal contentions \"are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law\".<ref>Rule 11(b)(2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</ref> Monetary civil penalties for violation of this rule may in some cases be imposed on the litigant or the attorney under Rule 11.<ref>Rule 11(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</ref>\n\nIn one case, the Seventh Circuit Court issued an order giving such an attorney \"14 days to show cause why he should not be fined $10,000 for his frivolous arguments\".<ref>''United States v. Patridge'', 507 F.3d 1092, 2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas.

The particular tendency of [[prison]]ers to bring baseless lawsuits led to passage of the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] of 1995, which limits the ability of prisoners to bring actions without payment. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n==Court treatment of frivolous arguments==\nAn example of a Court's treatment of frivolous arguments is found in the case of ''Crain v. Commissioner'', [http://www.openjurist.org/737/f2d/1417 737 F.2d 1417] (1984), from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]]:\n\n{{quote|Glenn Crain appeals from the dismissal of his [[United States Tax Court|Tax Court]] petition challenging the constitutional authority of that body and defying the jurisdiction of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to levy taxes on his income. Crain asserts that he \"is not subject to the [[jurisdiction]], taxation, nor regulation of the state,\" that the \"Internal Revenue Service, Incorporated\" lacks authority to exercise the judicial power of the United States, that the Tax Court is unconstitutionally attempting to exercise [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] powers, and that jurisdiction over his person has never been affirmatively proven.\n\nWe perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some [[Color (law)|colorable]] merit. The constitutionality of our income tax system&mdash;including the role played within that system by the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Court&mdash;has long been established. We affirm the dismissal of Crain's spurious \"petition\" and the assessment of a penalty imposed by the Tax Court for instituting a frivolous proceeding. {{UnitedStatesCode|26|6673}}.\n\nThe government asks us to assess penalties against Crain for bringing this frivolous appeal, as is authorized by Fed. R. App. P. 38. In Parker v. C. I. R., [http://www.openjurist.org/724/f2d/469/parker-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue 724 F. 2d 469], 472 (5th Cir. 1984), we sounded \"a cautionary note to those who would persistently raise arguments against the income tax which have been put to rest for years. The full range of sanctions in Rule 38 hereafter shall be summoned in response to a totally frivolous appeal.\"\n\nWe are sensitive to the need for the courts to remain open to all who seek in good faith to invoke the protection of law. An appeal that lacks merit is not always&mdash;or often&mdash;frivolous. However, we are not obliged to suffer in silence the filing of baseless, insupportable appeals presenting no colorable claims of error and designed only to delay, obstruct, or incapacitate the operations of the courts or any other governmental authority. Crain's present appeal is of this sort. It is a hodgepodge of unsupported assertions, irrelevant platitudes, and legalistic gibberish. The government should not have been put to the trouble of responding to such spurious arguments, nor this court to the trouble of \"adjudicating\" this meritless appeal.\n\nAccordingly, we grant the government's request. The United States shall recover from appellant Crain twice its cost of this appeal. Additionally, we assess against Crain a damage award of $2000 in favor of the appellee United States.<ref>''Crain v. Commissioner'', 737 F.2d 1417, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas.

These contrasting traditions may be vestiges of historical performance settings: large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments, before electronic amplification, than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddlers played in.\n\nThe difference was likely compounded by the different sounds expected of violin music and fiddle music. Historically, the majority of fiddle music was dance music,<ref name=\"OKHistory\" /> while violin music had either grown out of dance music or was something else entirely. Violin music came to value a smoothness that fiddling, with its dance-driven clear beat, did not always follow. In situations that required greater volume, a fiddler (as long as they kept the beat) could push their instrument harder than could a violinist.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Various fiddle traditions have differing values. \n\n===Scottish fiddle with cello===\nIn the very late 20th century, a few artists have successfully attempted a reconstruction of the Scottish tradition of violin and \"big fiddle,\" or cello.

fl\u00fcgelhorn}}</ref> or ''flank.'' In early 18th century Germany, a ducal hunt leader known as a ''Fl\u00fcgelmeister'' blew the ''Fl\u00fcgelhorn'', a large semicircular brass or silver valveless forerunner of the modern-day flugelhorn to direct the wings of the hunt (military use dates from the [[Seven Years' War]], where this valveless instrument was employed as a predecessor of the bugle).<ref name=Grove>{{cite web| last1=Baines | first1=Anthony C. | last2=Herbert | first2=Trevor |title=Flugelhorn |website=[[Grove Music Online]] |publisher=Oxford Music Online |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09887| accessdate = 17 March 2017}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Structure and variants==\n[[File:Yamaha Flugelhorn YFH-436G.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A rotary valve flugelhorn]]\nThe flugelhorn is built in the same B{{music|flat}} pitch as many trumpets and [[cornet]]s. It usually has three [[brass instrument valve|piston valves]] and employs the same fingering system as other brass instruments, but four-piston valve and rotary valve variants also exist. It can thus be played without too much trouble by trumpet and cornet players, though some adaptation to their playing style may be needed. It is usually played with a more deeply conical [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] than either trumpets or cornets (though not as conical as a [[French horn]] mouthpiece). The shank of the flugelhorn mouthpiece is similar in size to a cornet mouthpiece shank, and standard tapered flugelhorns are interchangeable with cornets.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nSome modern flugelhorns feature a fourth valve that lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (similar to the fourth valve on some [[euphonium]]s, [[tuba]]s, and [[piccolo trumpet]]s, or the [[F attachment|trigger]] on [[trombone]]s). This adds a useful low range that, coupled with the flugelhorn's dark sound, extends the instrument's abilities. More often, however, players use the fourth valve in place of the first and third valve combination, which is somewhat sharp (compensated for on trumpets and cornets and some three-valve flugelhorns by an easily movable slide for the first or third valve).\n\nA pair of bass flugelhorns in C, called [[fiscorn]]s, are played in the Catalan [[cobla]] bands which provide music for [[sardana]] dancers.\n\n==Timbre==\nThe tone is fatter and usually regarded as more mellow and dark than the trumpet or cornet. The sound of the flugelhorn has been described as halfway between a trumpet and a [[French horn]], whereas the cornet's sound is halfway between a trumpet and a flugelhorn.<ref>{{cite book|first= Cecil |last= Forsyth| title= Orchestration |page= 165| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m9_CTe8qNWIC&pg=PA165&dq=%22cornet+stands+midway+in+the+matter+of+brightness%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=v9MJVYn_I8ukNsTIgsAD&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22cornet%20stands%20midway%20in%20the%20matter%20of%20brightness%22&f=false| publisher= republished online at Google Books |year= 1922}}</ref> The flugelhorn is as agile as the cornet but more difficult to control in the high register (from approximately written G<sub>5</sub>), where in general it slots or locks onto notes less easily. It is not generally used for aggressive or bright displays as trumpets and cornets often are, but tends more towards a softer and more reflective role.\n\n==Use==\n{{unref|section|date=September 2018}}\nThe flugelhorn is a standard member of the [[British brass band|British-style brass band]], and it is also used frequently in [[jazz]]. It also appears occasionally in [[orchestra]]l and [[concert band]] music. Famous orchestral works with flugelhorn include [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Threni (Stravinsky)|Threni]]'', [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|Ninth Symphony]], [[Danzon no. 2]] by [[Arturo M\u00e1rquez]], and [[Michael Tippett]]'s third symphony. The flugelhorn is sometimes substituted for the [[post horn]] in [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]], and for the soprano Roman [[Buccina|buccine]] in [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pines of Rome]]''. In [[HK Gruber]]'s trumpet concerto ''Busking'' (2007) the soloist is directed to play a flugelhorn in the slow middle movement. The flugelhorn figured prominently in many of [[Burt Bacharach]]'s 1960s pop song arrangements. It is featured in a solo role in [[Bert Kaempfert]]'s 1962 recording of \"That Happy Feeling\". Flugelhorns have occasionally been used as the alto or low soprano voice in a [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]].\n\nAnother use of the flugelhorn is found in the Dutch and Belgian \"''Fanfareorkesten''\" or [[fanfare orchestra]]s. In these orchestras the flugelhorns, often between 10 and 20 in number, have a significant role, forming the base of the orchestra. They are pitched in B{{music|flat}}, with sporadically an E{{music|flat}} soloist. Due to poor intonation these E{{music|flat}} flugelhorns are mostly replaced by the E{{music|flat}} trumpet or cornet.\n\n==Notable players==\n{{unref|section|date=September 2018}}\nJoe Bishop, as a member of the [[Woody Herman]] band in 1936, was one of the earliest jazz musicians to use the flugelhorn. [[Shorty Rogers]] and [[Kenny Baker (trumpeter)|Kenny Baker]] began playing it in the early fifties, and [[Clark Terry]] used it in Duke Ellington's orchestra in the mid-1950s. [[Chet Baker]] recorded several albums on the instrument in the 1950s and 1960s. [[Miles Davis]] further popularized the instrument in jazz on the albums ''[[Miles Ahead (album)|Miles Ahead]]'' and ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'', (both arranged by [[Gil Evans]]) though he did not use it much on later projects. Other prominent flugelhorn players include Freddy Buzon, [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Tom Browne (trumpeter)|Tom Browne]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Bill Dixon]], [[Wilbur Harden]], [[Art Farmer]], [[Roy Hargrove]], [[Hugh Masekela]], Feya Faku, [[Tony Guerrero]], Gary Lord, [[Jimmy Owens (jazz)|Jimmy Owens]], [[Maynard Ferguson]], [[Terumasa Hino]], [[Woody Shaw]], [[Guido Basso]], [[Kenny Wheeler]], [[Tom Harrell]], [[Bill Coleman]], [[Thad Jones]], [[Arturo Sandoval]], [[Lee Loughnane]] of the rock band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Mike Metheny]], [[Harry Beckett]], and [[Ack van Rooyen]]. Most jazz flugelhorn players use the instrument as an auxiliary to the trumpet, but in the 1970s [[Chuck Mangione]] gave up playing the trumpet and concentrated on the flugelhorn alone, notably on his jazz-pop hit song \"[[Feels So Good (Chuck Mangione song)|Feels So Good]]\". Mangione, in an interview on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the [[1980 Winter Olympics]], for which he wrote the theme \"[[Give It All You Got]]\", referred to the flugelhorn as \"the right baseball glove\".\n\nPop flugelhorn players include Probyn Gregory ([[Brian Wilson]] Band), Ronnie Wilson of the [[Gap Band]], [[Rick Braun]], [[Mic Gillette]], [[Jeff Oster]], [[Zach Condon]] of the band [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]], and [[Scott Spillane]] of the band [[Neutral Milk Hotel]].  [[Marvin Stamm]] played the flugelhorn solo on \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\" by [[Paul McCartney and Wings]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book| first1= Ralph T. |last1= Dudgeon |first2= Franz X. |last2= Streitwieser |title= The Fluegelhorn| publisher= Bergkirchen |edition= Bochinsky| year= 2004 |language=English, German |isbn= 3-932275-83-7}}\n* {{cite book|chapter=Flugelhorn |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |edition= 2nd| editor-first1=Stanley |editor-last1=Sadie |editor-first2=John |editor-last2=Tyrrell |location= London| year= 2001}}\n* {{cite book|chapter=Flugelhorn |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz |edition= 2nd| editor-first1=Barry |editor-last1= Kernfeld |location= London| year= 2002}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* [http://www.jewelrygenius.com/flugInfo.html An overview and brief history of the flugelhorn], including a short sound clip\n* [http://www.thetrumpetblog.com/how-to-play-a-flugel-horn How to play a flugelhorn] at TheTrumpetBlog.com\n\n{{Musical instruments |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:B-flat instruments]]\n[[Category:Brass instruments]]\n[[Category:Horns]]", "sha1": "dp5fz5o7re5furv2r67ikytz9z6pfll"}}, {"title": "Folk music", "ns": "0", "id": "10623", "revision": {"id": "864512234", "parentid": "864512214", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T18:22:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/206.227.38.115|206.227.38.115]] to version by Jerome Kohl.

Some types of folk music may be called [[world music]]. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and [[art music|classical styles]]. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that. \n\nStarting in the mid-18th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (third) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called [[contemporary folk music]] or [[folk revival]] music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms.<ref name=\"AboutDefinition\">{{cite web |url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/glossary/g/FolkMusic.htm |publisher=About.com definition |title=Folk Music |first1=Kim |last1=Ruehl |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>  Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as [[folk rock]], [[folk metal]], and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in Romanian it shares a different name, and it often does not share the same people and animals as traditional music.\n\n{{toclimit|4}}\n\n== Traditional folk music ==\n<!-- Traditional folk music redirects here -->\n{{Infobox music genre\n| name = Traditional folk music\n| color = white\n| bgcolor = goldenrod\n| stylistic_origins = Traditional music\n| cultural_origins = Individual nations or regions\n| instruments = See [[Folk instruments]]\n| popularity =\n| derivatives =\n* [[Popular music]]\n* [[Contemporary music]]\n| subgenrelist = List of folk music traditions\n| subgenres    =\n| fusiongenres =\n* [[Folk metal]]\n* [[Folk rock]]\n* [[Neofolk]]\n* [[Anti-folk]]\n| regional_scenes =\n| local_scenes =\n| other_topics = [[Roots revival]]\n}}\n\n=== Definitions ===\nA consistent definition of '''traditional folk music''' is elusive.<ref name = NERevival>''The Never-Ending Revival'' by Michael F.

They are extensions of the term ''[[folklore]]'', which was coined in 1846 by the English antiquarian [[William Thoms]] to describe \"the traditions, customs, and superstitions of the uncultured classes\".<ref name=\"Percy Scholes 1977\">Percy Scholes, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 1977, article \"Folk Song\".</ref> The term further derives from the German expression ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement|Volk]]'', in the sense of \"the people as a whole\" as applied to popular and national music by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and the German Romantics over half a century earlier.<ref>A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, p. 13.</ref> Traditional folk music also includes most [[indigenous music]].<ref name = NERevival/>\n\nHowever, despite the assembly of an enormous body of work over some two centuries, there is still no certain definition of what folk music (or [[folklore]], or the [[Wikt:folk|folk]]) is.<ref>[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]], ''Studying Popular Music'', Philadelphia: Open University Press (1990/2002). {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}, p. 127.</ref><ref name = NERevival/> Some do not even agree that the term Folk Music should be used.<ref name = NERevival/> Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics<ref name=\"Percy Scholes 1977\" /> but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of \"old songs, with no known composers\",<ref name=\"Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2\">Ronald D. Cohen ''Folk music: the basics'' (CRC Press, 2006), pp. 1\u20132.</ref> another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary \"process of [[oral transmission]].... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character\".<ref name=\"Lloyd 1969\">International Folk Music Council definition (1954/5), given in Lloyd (1969) and Scholes (1977).</ref>\n\nSuch definitions depend upon \"(cultural) processes rather than abstract musical types...\", upon \"''continuity'' and ''oral transmission''...seen as characterizing one side of a cultural dichotomy, the other side of which is found not only in the lower layers of feudal, capitalist and some oriental societies but also in 'primitive' societies and in parts of 'popular cultures'\".<ref>[[Charles Seeger]] (1980), citing the approach of Redfield (1947) and Dundes (1965), quoted in Middleton (1990) p.127.</ref>  One widely used definition is simply \"Folk music is what the people sing\".<ref name=\"Donaldson, 2011 page 13\">Donaldson, 2011 p. 13</ref>\n\nFor Scholes,<ref name=\"Percy Scholes 1977\" /> as well as for [[Cecil Sharp]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]],<ref name=\"A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5\">A.

Lloyd rejected this in favour of a simple distinction of economic class<ref name=\"A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5\" /> yet for him true folk music was, in [[Charles Seeger]]'s words, \"associated with a lower class\"<ref name=\"Mills\" /> in culturally and socially stratified societies. In these terms folk music may be seen as part of a \"schema comprising four musical types: 'primitive' or 'tribal'; 'elite' or 'art'; 'folk'; and 'popular'\".<ref name=\"Charles Seeger 1980 p.127\">Charles Seeger (1980) quoted in Middleton (1990) p. 127.</ref>\n\nMusic in this genre is also often called ''traditional music.''  Although the term is usually only descriptive, in some cases people use it as the name of a genre.  For example, the [[Grammy Award]] previously used the terms \"traditional music\" and \"traditional folk\" for folk music that is not contemporary folk music.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n==== Characteristics ====\nFrom a historical perspective, traditional folk music had these characteristics:<ref name=\"Mills\" />{{verification needed|date=November 2016}}\n* It was transmitted through an [[oral tradition]]. Before the 20th century, ordinary people were usually illiterate; they acquired songs by memorizing them. Primarily, this was not mediated by books or recorded or transmitted media. Singers may extend their repertoire using [[Broadside (music)|broadsheets]] or [[song book]]s, but these secondary enhancements are of the same character as the primary songs experienced in the flesh.\n* The music was often related to [[Culture|national culture]]. It was culturally particular; from a particular region or culture. In the context of an [[immigrant]] group, folk music acquires an extra dimension for social cohesion. It is particularly conspicuous in immigrant societies, where [[Greek Australians]], [[Somali Americans]], [[Punjabi Canadians]], and others strive to emphasize their differences from the mainstream. They learn songs and dances that originate in the countries their grandparents came from.\n* They commemorate historical and personal events. On certain days of the year, such as [[Easter]], [[May Day]], and [[Christmas]], particular songs celebrate the yearly cycle. [[Wedding]]s, [[birthday]]s, and [[funeral]]s may also be noted with songs, dances and special costumes. Religious festivals often have a folk music component. [[Choral music]] at these events brings children and non-professional singers to participate in a public arena, giving an emotional bonding that is unrelated to the aesthetic qualities of the music.\n* The songs have been performed, by [[Convention (norm)|custom]], over a long period of time, usually several [[generation]]s.\n\nAs a side-effect, the following characteristics are sometimes present:\n* There is no [[copyright]] on the songs. Hundreds of folk songs from the 19th century have known authors but have continued in oral tradition to the point where they are considered traditional for purposes of music publishing. This has become much less frequent since the 1940s. Today, almost every folk song that is recorded is credited with an arranger.\n* Fusion of cultures: Because cultures interact and change over time, traditional songs evolving over time may incorporate and reflect influences from disparate cultures. The relevant factors may include instrumentation, [[Musical tuning|tunings]], [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], [[Phrasing (music)|phrasing]], subject matter, and even production methods.\n\n==== Terminology ====\n\n===== Tune =====\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nIn folk music, a ''tune'' is a short [[instrumental]] [[piece (music)|piece]], a [[melody]], often with repeating [[section (music)|sections]], and usually played a number of times. A collection of tunes with structural similarities is known as a [[tune-family]]. ''America's Musical Landscape'' says \"the most common [[form (music)|form]] for tunes in folk music is AABB, also known as [[binary form]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn some traditions, tunes may be strung together in [[medley (music)|medleys]] or \"[[set (folk music)|sets]]\".\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Indian village musicians.jpg|thumb|Indians always distinguished between classical and folk music, though in the past even classical Indian music used to rely on the unwritten transmission of repertoire.]]\nThroughout most of human prehistory and history, listening to [[recorded music]] was not possible. Music was made by common people during both their work and leisure, as well as during religious activities. The work of economic production was often manual and communal. [[Manual labor]] often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the [[boredom]] of repetitive tasks, it kept the [[rhythm]] during [[Synchronization|synchronized]] pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as [[Sowing|planting]], [[weeding]], [[reaping]], [[threshing]], [[weaving]], and [[Milling (grinding)|milling]]. In [[leisure time]], singing and playing [[musical instrument]]s were common forms of entertainment and history-telling\u2014even more common than today, when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.<ref name=\"SeegerLomaxDocumentary\">{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr9FP93o8Ro |title=To Hear Your Banjo Play, Alan Lomax's 1947 Documentary narrated by Pete Seeger |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref>\n\nSome believe that folk music originated as [[art music]] that was changed and probably debased by oral transmission, while reflecting the character of the society that produced it.<ref name=\"Percy Scholes 1977\" /> In many societies, especially preliterate ones, the cultural transmission of folk music requires [[Learning music by ear|learning by ear]], although [[Musical notation|notation]] has evolved in some cultures. Different cultures may have different notions concerning a division between \"folk\" music on the one hand and of \"art\" and \"court\" music on the other. In the proliferation of popular music genres, some traditional folk music became also referred to \"[[World music]]\" or \"Roots music\".\n\nThe English term \"[[folklore]]\", to describe traditional folk music and dance, entered the vocabulary of many continental European nations, each of which had its folk-song collectors and revivalists.<ref name=\"Percy Scholes 1977\" /> The distinction between \"authentic\" folk and national and [[popular song]] in general has always been loose, particularly in America and Germany<ref name=\"Percy Scholes 1977\" /> \u2013 for example popular songwriters such as [[Stephen Foster]] could be termed \"folk\" in America.<ref name=\"Percy Scholes 1977\" /><ref>A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969</ref>  The [[International Folk Music Council]] definition allows that the term can also apply to music that, \"...has originated with an individual composer and has subsequently been absorbed into the unwritten, living tradition of a community. But the term does not cover a song, dance, or tune that has been taken over ready-made and remains unchanged.\"<ref>Quoted by both Scholes (1977) and Lloyd (1969).</ref>\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] folk revival in America and in Britain started a new genre, [[Contemporary Folk Music|contemporary folk music]], and brought an additional meaning to the term \"folk music\": newly composed songs, fixed in form and by known authors, which imitated some form of traditional music. The popularity of \"contemporary folk\" recordings caused the appearance of the category \"Folk\" in the [[Grammy Award]]s of 1959: in 1970 the term was dropped in favor of \"Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording (including Traditional Blues)\", while 1987 brought a distinction between \"Best Traditional Folk Recording\" and \"Best Contemporary Folk Recording\". After that, they had a \"Traditional music\" category that subsequently evolved into others. The term \"folk\", by the start of the 21st century, could cover [[Singer-songwriter|singer songwriters]], such as [[Donovan]] from Scotland and American [[Bob Dylan]], who emerged in the 1960s and much more. This completed a process to where \"folk music\" no longer meant only traditional folk music.<ref name=\"Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2\" />\n\n=== Subject matter ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Armenian Musicians.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian culture|Armenian]] traditional musicians]]\n[[File:Assyrianfolk.jpg|Assyrian folk music|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] playing ''[[zurna]]'' and ''[[Davul]]'', the typically used instruments for their folk music and [[Assyrian folk dance|dance]].]]\nTraditional folk music often includes [[Lyrics|sung words]], although folk [[instrumental music]] occurs commonly in [[dancing music|dance music]] traditions. [[Narrative verse]] looms large in the traditional folk music of many cultures. This encompasses such forms as traditional [[epic poetry]], much of which was meant originally for oral performance, sometimes accompanied by instruments. Many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse, which explains their episodic structure, repetitive elements, and their frequent ''[[in medias res]]'' plot developments. Other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of [[battle]]s or describe [[Tragedy (event)|tragedies]] or [[natural disaster]]s.\n\nSometimes, as in the triumphant ''[[Song of Deborah]]'' found in the [[Bible|Biblical]] ''[[Book of Judges]]'', these songs celebrate victory. Laments for lost battles and wars, and the lives lost in them, are equally prominent in many traditions; these laments keep alive the cause for which the battle was fought. The narratives of traditional songs often also remember [[folk hero]]es such as [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] or [[Robin Hood]]. Some traditional song narratives recall [[supernatural]] events or mysterious deaths.\n\n[[Hymn]]s and other forms of [[religious music]] are often of traditional and unknown origin. Western [[musical notation]] was originally created to preserve the lines of [[Gregorian chant]], which before its invention was taught as an oral tradition in [[monasticism|monastic]] communities. Traditional songs such as ''[[Green grow the rushes, O]]'' present religious lore in a mnemonic form, as do Western [[Christmas carol]]s and similar traditional songs.\n\n[[Work song]]s frequently feature [[call and response (music)|call and response]] structures and are designed to enable the laborers who sing them to coordinate their efforts in accordance with the rhythms of the songs. They are frequently, but not invariably, composed. In the American [[armed force]]s, a lively oral tradition preserves [[jody call]]s (\"Duckworth chants\") which are sung while soldiers are on the march. Professional sailors made similar use of a large body of [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]]. [[Love poetry]], often of a tragic or regretful nature, prominently figures in many folk traditions. [[Nursery rhyme]]s and [[nonsense verse]] used to amuse or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs.\n\n=== Folk song transformations and variations ===\n{{See also|List of folk music traditions}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Korean music-Nongak-03.jpg|thumb|Korean traditional musicians]]\n[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Naxi traditional musicians]]\nMusic transmitted by word of mouth through a community, in time, develops many variants, because this kind of transmission cannot produce word-for-word and note-for-note accuracy. Indeed, many traditional singers are quite creative and deliberately modify the material they learn.\n\nFor example, the words of \"[[I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day]]\" (Roud 975) are known from a [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] in the [[Bodleian Library]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/acwwweng/ballads/image.pl?ref=Harding+B+20(69)&id=08664.gif&seq=1&size=0 |title=Ballads Catalogue: Harding B 20(69) |publisher=Bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref> The date is almost certainly before 1900, and it seems to be Irish. In 1958 the song was recorded in Canada (My Name is Pat and I'm Proud of That). Scottish traveler [[Jeannie Robertson]] from Aberdeen, made the next recorded version in 1961. She has changed it to make reference to \"Jock Stewart\", one of her relatives, and there are no Irish references. In 1976 Scottish artist [[Archie Fisher]] deliberately altered the song to remove the reference to a dog being shot. In 1985 [[The Pogues]] took it full circle by restoring all the Irish references.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}\n\nBecause variants proliferate naturally, it is na\u00efve to believe that there is such a thing as the single \"authentic\" version of a [[ballad]] such as \"[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]\". Field researchers in traditional song (see below) have encountered countless versions of this ballad throughout the English-speaking world, and these versions often differ greatly from each other. None can reliably claim to be the original, and it is possible that the \"original\" version ceased to be sung centuries ago.  Many versions can lay an equal claim to authenticity.\n\nThe influential folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] felt that these competing variants of a traditional song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological [[natural selection]]: only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would be picked up by others and transmitted onward in time. Thus, over time we would expect each traditional song to become aesthetically ever more appealing&nbsp;\u2014 it would be collectively composed to perfection, as it were, by the community.\n\nLiterary interest in the popular ballad form dates back at least to [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]] and [[William Wordsworth]]. English Elizabethan and Stuart composers had often evolved their music from folk themes, the classical [[Suite (music)|suite]] was based upon stylised folk-dances, and [[Haydn and folk music|Joseph Haydn]]'s use of folk melodies is noted. But the emergence of the term \"folk\" coincided with an \"outburst of national feeling all over Europe\" that was particularly strong at the edges of Europe, where [[Self-determination|national identity]] was most asserted. [[Musical nationalism|Nationalist composers]] emerged in Central Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain and Britain: the music of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana|Smetana]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Manuel de Falla|de Falla]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]], and many others drew upon folk melodies.\n\n=== Regional forms ===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:015 Die Br\u00fcder Steinegger nach einem Lichtbild in den 1880er-Jahren - \u00c4nderung der Tracht.jpg|thumb|right|The Steinegger brothers, traditional pipers of [[Grundlsee]], [[Styria]], 1880]]\nWhile the loss of traditional folk music in the face of the rise of [[popular music]] is a worldwide phenomenon, it is not one occurring at a uniform rate throughout the world. The process is most advanced \"where [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[Commercialization|commercialisation]] of culture are most advanced\"<ref>Alison Vardy, et al., [http://www.celticharpsheetmusic.com/about/traditional-music.htm About Traditional Music Page], Celtic Harp Sheet Music site. Accessed 16 February 2007.</ref> but also occurs more gradually even in settings of lower technological advancement. However, the loss of traditional music is slowed in nations or regions where traditional folk music is a badge of cultural or national identity, for instance in the case of [[Bangladesh]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Pakistan]], [[Scotland]], [[Latvia]], [[Turkey]], [[Fado|Portugal]], [[Brittany]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]] and [[Music of Crete|Crete]]. Tourism revenue can provide a potent incentive to preserve local cultural distinctives. Local government often sponsors and promotes performances during tourist seasons, and revives lost traditions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Early folk music, fieldwork and scholarship ===\nMuch of what is known about folk music prior to the development of audio recording technology in the 19th century comes from [[Field research|fieldwork]] and writings of scholars, collectors and proponents.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==== 19th-century Europe ====\nStarting in the 19th century, academics and amateur scholars, taking note of the musical traditions being lost, initiated various efforts to preserve the music of the people. One such effort was the collection by [[Francis James Child]] in the late 19th century of the texts of over three hundred [[ballad]]s in the English and Scots traditions (called the [[Child Ballads]]), some of which predated the 16th century.<ref name=\"Donaldson, 2011 page 13\" />\n\nContemporaneously with Child, the Reverend [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] and later [[Cecil Sharp]] worked  to preserve a great body of English rural traditional song, music and dance, under the aegis of what became and remains the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] (EFDSS). Sharp campaigned with some success to have English traditional songs (in his own heavily edited and expurgated versions) to be taught to school children in hopes of reviving and prolonging the popularity of those songs. Throughout the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, American scholar Bertrand Harris Bronson published an exhaustive four-volume collection of the then-known variations of both the texts and tunes associated with what came to be known as the Child Canon. He also advanced some significant theories concerning the workings of oral-aural tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSimilar activity was also under way in other countries. One of the most extensive was perhaps the work done in [[Riga]] by [[Krisjanis Barons]], who between the years 1894 and 1915 published six volumes that included the texts of 217,996 Latvian folk songs, the ''Latvju dainas''. In Norway the work of collectors such as [[Ludvig Mathias Lindeman]] was extensively used by Edvard Grieg in his ''Lyric Pieces'' for piano and in other works, which became immensely popular.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}\n\nAround this time, composers of [[European classical music|classical music]] developed a strong interest in collecting traditional songs, and a number of outstanding composers carried out their own field work on traditional music. These included [[Percy Grainger]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in England and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] in Hungary. These composers, like many of their predecessors, both made arrangements of folk songs and incorporated traditional material into original classical compositions. The ''Latviju dainas'' are extensively used in the classical choral works of [[Andrejs Jur\u0101ns]], [[J\u0101nis Cimze]], and [[Emilis Melngailis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==== North America ====\n[[File:Cecil-sharp-appalachia-map.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Locations in Southern and Central Appalachia visited by the British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] in 1916 (blue), 1917 (green), and 1918 (red). Sharp sought \"old world\" English and Scottish ballads passed down to the region's inhabitants from their British ancestors. He collected hundreds of such ballads, the most productive areas being the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky.]]\n\nThe advent of [[audio recording]] technology provided folklorists with a revolutionary tool to preserve vanishing musical forms. The earliest American folk music scholars were with the [[American Folklore Society]] (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies as well.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, p. 22-23</ref>\nIn North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Library of Congress]] worked through the offices of traditional music collectors [[Robert Winslow Gordon]], [[Alan Lomax]] and others to capture as much North American field material as possible.  Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, ''Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads''.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, p 24-26</ref> and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s. Cecil Sharp also worked in America, recording the traditional songs of the Appalachian Mountains in 1916\u20131918 in collaboration with [[Maud Karpeles]] and [[Olive Dame Campbell]] and is considered the first major scholar covering American folk music.<ref>Donaldson, 2011 p. 20</ref> Campbell and Sharp are represented under other names by actors in the modern movie ''[[Songcatcher]]''.\n\nOne strong theme amongst folk scholars in the early decades of the 20th century was [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], the analysis of the diversity of folk music (and related cultures) based on regions of the US rather than based on a given song's historical roots. Later, a dynamic of class and circumstances was added to this.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, p 32-37</ref> The most prominent regionalists were literary figures with a particular interest in folklore. [[Carl Sandburg]] often traveled the U.S. as a writer and a poet.  He also collected songs in his travels and, in 1927, published them in the book ''[[The American Songbag]]''. \"In his collections of folk songs, Sandburg added a class dynamic to popular understandings of American folk music. This was the final element of the foundation upon which the early folk music revivalists constructed their own view of Americanism. Sandburg's [[working class]] Americans joined with the [[Ethnic group|ethnically]], [[Race (human categorization)|racially]], and regionally diverse citizens that other scholars, public intellectuals, and folklorists celebrated their own definitions of the American folk, definitions that the folk revivalists used in constructing their own understanding of American folk music, and an overarching American identity\".<ref>Donaldson, 2011, p. 37</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1930s, the study of folk music was primarily the province of scholars and collectors.  The 1930s saw the beginnings of larger scale themes, commonalities, themes and linkages in folk music developing in the populace and practitioners as well, often related to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55\">Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55</ref>  Regionalism and [[cultural pluralism]] grew as influences and themes.  During this time folk music began to become enmeshed with political and social activism themes and movements.<ref name=\"Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55\" /> Two related developments were the U.S. Communist Party's interest in folk music as a way to reach and influence Americans,<ref>Donaldson, 2011, pp. 72\u201374</ref> and politically active prominent folk musicians and scholars seeing communism as a possible better system, through the lens of the Great Depression.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, pp. 67\u201370</ref> [[Woody Guthrie]] exemplifies songwriters and artists with such an outlook.\n\nFolk music festivals proliferated during the 1930s.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, p. 44-52</ref> [[President Franklin Roosevelt]] was a fan of folk music, hosted folk concerts at the [[White House]], and often patronized folk festivals.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, pp. 42\u201343</ref>  One prominent festival was [[Sarah Gertrude Knott]]'s [[National Folk Festival (United States)|National Folk Festival]], established in St. Louis, Missouri in 1934.<ref>Michael Ann Williams, ''Staging Tradition: John Lair and Sarah Gertrude Knott'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006) p. 13</ref>  Under the sponsorship of [[the Washington Post]], the festival was held in Washington, DC at Constitution Hall from 1937\u20131942.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, p 103-104</ref> The folk music movement, festivals, and the wartime effort were seen as forces for social goods such as democracy, cultural pluralism, and the removal of culture and race-based barriers.<ref>Donaldson, 2011, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nThe American folk music revivalists of the 1930s approached folk music in different ways.<ref name=\"Donaldson87\" /> Three primary schools of thought emerged: \"Traditionalists\" (e.g. Sarah Gertrude Knott and [[John Lomax]]) emphasized the preservation of songs as artifacts of deceased cultures. \"Functional\" folklorists (e.g. Botkin and Alan Lomax) maintained that songs only retain relevance when utilized by those cultures which retain the traditions which birthed those songs.  \"Left-wing\" folk revivalists (e.g. Charles Seeger and Lawrence Gellert) emphasized music's role \"in 'people's' struggles for social and political rights\".<ref name=\"Donaldson87\">Donaldson, 2011, p. 87</ref>  By the end of the 1930s these and others had turned American folk music into a social movement.<ref name=\"Donaldson87\" />\n\nSometimes folk musicians became scholars and advocates themselves. For example, [[Jean Ritchie]] (born in 1922) was the youngest child of a large family from [[Viper, Kentucky]] that had preserved many of the old [[Appalachia]]n traditional songs. Ritchie, living in a time when the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] had opened up to outside influence, was university educated and ultimately moved to New York City, where she made a number of classic recordings of the family repertoire and published an important compilation of these songs.

Ensembles consisting of [[mouth organ]]s ([[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]]), shawms ([[suona]]), [[flute]]s ([[Dizi (musical instrument)|dizi]]) and percussion instruments (especially [[yunluo]] [[gong]]s) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of [[Beijing]], [[Xi'an]], [[Wutai shan]] and [[Tianjin]]. [[Xi'an]] drum music, consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi'an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[Chinese flute|pipes]], an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western [[free reed]] instruments, such as the [[accordion]]. Parades led by Western-type [[brass band]]s are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.\n\nIn southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken women. Further south, in [[Shantou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and [[Chaozhou]], [[erxian]] and [[Guzheng|zheng]] ensembles are popular.[[Sizhu]] ensembles use [[flute]]s and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in [[Nanjing]] and [[Hangzhou]], as well as elsewhere along the southern [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas.[[Jiangnan Sizhu]] (silk and bamboo music from [[Jiangnan]]) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in [[Shanghai]]; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin. [[Guangdong music (genre)|Guangdong Music]] or [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese Music]] is instrumental music from [[Guangzhou]] and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time.

It is considered less developed/evolved, true to the folk tradition and a preserving of a more ancient artform. It is limited to approximately 3\u20134 notes and is used by the ordinary people for pleasure and entertainment.\n* Nadagam music is a more developed form of drama influenced from South Indian street drama which was introduced by some south Indian Artists.  [[Phillippu Singho]] from Negombo in 1824 Performed \u201c[[Harishchandra Nadagama]]\u201d in [[Hanguranketha Divisional Secretariat|Hnguranketha]] which was originally written in [[Telugu language|Telingu]] language.

This drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations, which the drummer sometimes can bring to a [[crescendo]] of intensity. There are six common types of drums falling within 3 styles (one-faced, two-faced, and flat-faced):\n* The typical Sinhala Dance is identified as the [[Kandy]]an dance and the [[Geta Bera|Gatabera]] drum is indispensable to this dance.\n* [[Yak Bera|Yak-bera]] is the demon drum or the, drum used in low country dance in which the dancers wear masks and perform devil dancing, which has become a highly developed form of art.\n* The Dawula is a [[barrel]]-shaped drum, and it was used as a companion drum in the past, to keep strict time with the beat.\n* The [[Thammattama]] is flat, two-faced drum. The drummer strikes the drum on the two surfaces on top with sticks, unlike the others where you drum on the sides. This is a companion drum to the afore mentioned Dawula.\n* A small double headed hand drum, used to accompany songs. It is mostly heard in the poetry dances (vannam).\n* The Rabana is a flat faced circular drum and comes in several sizes. The large Rabana has to be placed on the floor like a circular short-legged [[Table (furniture)|table]] and several people (especially the womenfolk) can sit around it and beat on it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the [[Sinhalese New Year]] and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion.  The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat, since the player carries it wherever he goes.\n\nOther instruments include:\n* The \"[[Thalampata]]\" \u2013 2 small cymbals joined together by a string.\n* The wind section, is dominated by an instrument akin to the [[clarinet]]. This is not normally used for the dances. This is important to note because the Sinhalese dance is not set to music as the western world knows it; rhythm is king.\n* The [[flute]]s of metal such as silver & brass produce [[Shrillness|shrill]] music to accompany Kandyan Dances, while the plaintive strains of music of the reed flute may pierce the air in devil-dancing. The [[conch-shell]] ([[Hakgediya]]) is another form of a natural instrument, and the player blows it to announce the opening of ceremonies of grandeur.\n* The [[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilisation of Sri Lanka in the time of King Ravana. The bowl is made of cut coconut shell, the mouth of which is covered with goat hide. A dandi, made of bamboo, is attached to this shell. The principal strings are two: one of steel and the other of a set of horsehair. The long bow has jingle bells<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=/2011/02/09/art21.asp |title=&#124;&#124; Daily News Online Edition \u2013 Sri lanka :: Print Page |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004045/http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=%2F2011%2F02%2F09%2Fart21.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"dailynews.lk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |title=Artscope &#124; Online edition of Daily News \u2013 Lakehouse Newspapers |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2008-02-13 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004038/http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==== Australia ====\n{{See also|Australian folk music|Indigenous Australian music}}\nFolk song traditions were taken to Australia by early settlers from England, Scotland and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]].

It is possible to group together the Baltic states (or, sometimes, only Estonia) and parts of northwest Russia as sharing cultural similarities, contrasted with Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Atlantic islands of, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  Greenland's Inuit culture has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture.  Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the Baltic nations and the Scandinavian nations.

It includes folklore music of parts of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The [[Nueva Canci\u00f3n]] movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and bought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.\n\n[[Nueva canci\u00f3n]] (Spanish for 'new song') is a movement and genre within [[Latin American music|Latin American]] and [[Iberia]]n music of folk music, folk-inspired music and socially committed music. It some respects its development and role is similar to the second folk music revival. This includes evolution of this new genre from traditional folk music, essentially contemporary folk music except that that English genre term is not commonly applied to it. Nueva cancion is recognized as having played a powerful role in the social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nNueva cancion first surfaced during the 1960s as \"The Chilean New Song\" in [[Chile]]. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in Spain and other areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names. Nueva canci\u00f3n renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American [[New Left]], [[Liberation Theology]], [[hippie]] and [[human rights]] movements due to political lyrics. It would gain great popularity throughout [[Latin America]], and is regarded as a precursor to [[Rock en espa\u00f1ol]].\n\n[[Cueca]] is a family of musical styles and associated dances from [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Argentina]].\n\n[[Trova]] and [[Son (music)|Son]] are styles of traditional [[Cuban music]] originating in the province of Oriente that includes influences from Spanish song and dance such as [[Bolero]] and [[contradanza]] as well as [[Afro-Cuban]] rhythm and percussion elements.\n\n[[Moda de viola]] is the name designed to Brazilian folk music. Is often performed with a 6-string nylon acoustic guitar, but the most traditional instrument is the [[viola caipira]]. The songs basically detailed the hardness of life of those who work in the country. The themes are usually associated with the land, animals, folklore, impossible love and separation. Although there are some upbeat songs, most of them are nostalgic and melancholic.\n\n==== North America ====\n\n===== Canada =====\n[[File:Lumbermen violin and sticks 1943.jpg|thumb|French-Canadian [[lumberjack]]s playing the fiddle, with sticks for [[percussion instrument|percussion]], in a lumber camp in 1943.]]\n{{Main|music of Canadian cultures}}\n{{See also|Canadian folk music|Music of Canada|French-Canadian music}}\nCanada's traditional folk music is particularly diverse.<ref name=\"Canada1\" />  Even prior to liberalizing its immigration laws in the 1960s, Canada was ethnically diverse with dozens of different Indigenous and European groups present.  In terms of music, academics do not speak of a Canadian tradition, but rather ethnic traditions ([[Acadian music]], [[Irish-Canadian music]], [[Blackfoot music]], [[Innu music]], [[Inuit music]], [[M\u00e9tis fiddle]], etc.) and later in Eastern Canada regional traditions ([[Music of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland music]], [[Cape Breton fiddling]], [[Quebecois music]], etc.)\n\n{{quote|Traditional folk music of European origin has been present in Canada since the arrival of the first French and British settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries....They fished the coastal waters and farmed the shores of what became Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the St Lawrence River valley of Quebec.\n\nThe fur trade and its [[voyageurs]] brought this farther north and west into Canada; later lumbering operations and lumberjacks continued this process.\n\nAgrarian settlement in eastern and southern Ontario and western Quebec in the early 19th century established a favorable milieu for the survival of many Anglo-Canadian folksongs and broadside ballads from Great Britain and the US. Despite massive industrialization, folk music traditions have persisted in many areas until today. In the north of Ontario, a large Franco-Ontarian population kept folk music of French origin alive.\n\nPopulous Acadian communities in the Atlantic provinces contributed their song variants to the huge corpus of folk music of French origin centred in the province of Quebec. A rich source of Anglo-Canadian folk music can be found in the Atlantic region, especially Newfoundland. Completing this mosaic of musical folklore is the Gaelic music of Scottish settlements, particularly in Cape Breton, and the hundreds of Irish songs whose presence in eastern Canada dates from the Irish famine of the 1840s, which forced the large migrations of Irish to North America.<ref name=\"Canada1\">{{cite web|author=Kenneth Peacock, Carmelle B\u00e9gin |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/folk-music-emc/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |title=Folk music |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref>}}\n\n\"Knowledge of the [[history of Canada]]\", wrote Isabelle Mills in 1974, \"is essential in understanding the mosaic of Canadian folk song. Part of this mosaic is supplied by the folk songs of Canada brought by European and Anglo-Saxon settlers to the new land.\"<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Isabelle (1974). http://cjtm.icaap.org/content/2/v2art5.html The Heart of the Folk Song, ''[[Canadian Journal for Traditional Music]]'' Vol. 2</ref> She describes how the French colony at Qu\u00e9bec brought French immigrants, followed before long by waves of immigrants from Great Britain, Germany, and other European countries, all bringing music from their homelands, some of which survives into the present day. Ethnographer and folklorist [[Marius Barbeau]] estimated that well over ten thousand French folk songs and their variants had been collected in Canada. Many of the older ones had by then died out in France.\n\nMusic as professionalized paid entertainment grew relatively slowly in Canada, especially remote rural areas, through the 19th and early 20th centuries.  While in urban music clubs of the [[dance hall]]/[[vaudeville]] variety became popular, followed by jazz, rural Canada remained mostly a land of traditional music. Yet when American radio networks began broadcasting into Canada in the 1920s and 1930s, the audience for Canadian traditional music progressively declined in favour of [[Nashville sound|American Nashville-style country music]] and urban styles like jazz.  The [[Americanization]] of Canadian music led the [[Canadian Radio League]] to lobby for a national public broadcaster in the 1930s, eventually leading to the creation of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) in 1936. The CBC promoted Canadian music, including traditional music, on its radio and later television services, but the [[modernism|mid-century craze for all things \"modern\"]] led to the decline of folk music relative to rock and pop. Canada was however influenced by the folk music revival of the 1960s, when  local venues such as the Montreal Folk Workshop, and other folk clubs and coffee houses across the country, became crucibles for emerging songwriters and performers as well as for interchange with artists visiting from abroad.\n\n===== United States =====\n{{See also|American folk music}}\nAmerican traditional music is also called roots music.  Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the [[United States]] or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered \"roots music\" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including [[rock and roll]], contemporary folk music, [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]]. Some of these genres are considered to be traditional folk music.\n* [[Cajun music]], an emblematic [[music of Louisiana]], is rooted in the [[ballads]] of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s of [[Canada]]. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]-based, [[Cajun]]-influenced [[zydeco]] form, both of [[Acadiana]] origin. These [[French Louisiana#Modern French Louisiana|French Louisiana]] sounds have influenced [[American popular music]] for many decades, especially [[country music]], and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.\n* [[Appalachian music]] is the traditional music of the region of [[Appalachia]] in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences, including English [[ballad]]s, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially [[fiddle]] music), hymns, and African-American [[blues]].  First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of [[Old-time music]], [[country music]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and were an important part of the [[American folk music revival]].  Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and [[guitar]].<ref name=olson>Ted Olson, \"Music&nbsp;\u2013 Introduction\".

Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], and [[Doc Watson]].  Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.<ref name=olson />  Artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.\n* The [[Carter Family]] was a [[American folk music|traditional American folk music]] group that recorded between 1927 and 1956.

A prominent example of the former is the British folk revival of approximately 1890\u20131920. The most prominent and influential example of the latter (to the extent that it is usually called \"''the'' folk music revival\") is the folk revival of the mid 20th century, centered in the English-speaking world which gave birth to contemporary folk music.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 18\u201319}}  See the \"[[Contemporary folk music]]\" article for a description of this revival.\n\nOne earlier revival influenced western [[classical music]]. Such composers as [[Percy Grainger]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], made field recordings or transcriptions of folk singers and musicians.\n\nIn Spain, [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] (1860\u20131909) produced piano works reflect his Spanish heritage, including the ''[[Suite Iberia]]'' (1906\u20131909). [[Enrique Granados]] (1867\u20131918) composed ''[[zarzuela]]'', Spanish light opera, and ''Danzas Espa\u00f1olas'' \u2013 Spanish Dances. [[Manuel de Falla]] (1876\u20131946) became interested in the [[cante jondo]] of Andalusian [[flamenco]], the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works, which include ''[[Nights in the Gardens of Spain]]'' and ''Siete canciones populares espa\u00f1olas'' (\"Seven Spanish Folksongs\", for voice and piano). Composers such as [[Fernando Sor]] and [[Francisco Tarrega]] established the [[guitar]] as Spain's national instrument.  Modern Spanish folk artists abound ([[Mil i Maria]], [[Russian Red]], et al.) modernizing while respecting the traditions of their forebears.\n\nFlamenco grew in popularity through the 20th century, as did northern styles such as the Celtic music of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. French classical composers, from [[Bizet]] to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], also drew upon Spanish themes, and distinctive Spanish genres became universally recognized.\n\nFolk music revivals or [[roots revival]]s also encompass a range of phenomena around the world where there is a renewed interest in traditional music.  This is often by the young, often in the traditional music of their own country, and often included new incorporation of social awareness, causes, and evolutions of new music in the same style. [[Nueva canci\u00f3n]], a similar evolution of a new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish speaking countries.\n\n=== First British folk revival ===\nThe \"first\" [[British folk revival]] was a [[roots revival]] which occurred approximately 1890\u20131920 and was marked by heightened interest in traditional music and its preservation. It arose from earlier developments, perhaps combined with changes in the nature of British identity, led to a much more intensive and academic attempt to record what was seen as a vanishing tradition, and is now usually referred to as the first English or British folk revival.\n\n== Contemporary folk music ==\n{{Main|Contemporary folk}}\n\n== Festivals ==\n{{Main|List of folk festivals}}\n;United States\nIt is sometimes claimed that the earliest folk festival was the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival, 1928, in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], founded by [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]]. The [[National Folk Festival (USA)]] is an itinerant folk festival in the [[United States]]. Since 1934, it has been run by the [[National Council for the Traditional Arts]] (NCTA) and has been presented in 26 communities around the nation. After leaving some of these communities, the National Folk Festival has [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] several locally run folk festivals in its wake including the [[Lowell Folk Festival]], the Richmond Folk Festival, the [[American Folk Festival]] and, most recently, the Montana Folk Festival.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe [[Newport Folk Festival]] is an annual folk festival held near Newport, Rhode Island.

It is sponsored by the non-profit Philadelphia Folksong Society. The event hosts contemporary and traditional artists in genres including World/Fusion, Celtic, Singer/Songwriter, Folk Rock, Country, Klezmer, and Dance. It is held annually on the third weekend in August.

The resulting [[carbon]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] arc between the electrodes cools into sooty residue from which many fullerenes can be isolated.\n\nThere are many calculations that have been done using [[ab-initio]] quantum methods applied to fullerenes. By [[Density functional theory|DFT]] and [[Time-dependent density functional theory|TD-DFT]] methods one can obtain [[Infra-red spectroscopy|IR]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] and [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|UV]] spectra. Results of such calculations can be compared with experimental results.\n\n===Aromaticity===\nResearchers have been able to increase the reactivity of fullerenes by attaching active groups to their surfaces. Buckminsterfullerene does not exhibit \"[[superaromaticity]]\": that is, the electrons in the hexagonal rings do not [[Delocalized electron|delocalize]] over the whole molecule.\n\nA spherical fullerene of ''n'' carbon atoms has ''n'' [[pi-bond]]ing electrons, free to delocalize. These should try to delocalize over the whole molecule. The quantum mechanics of such an arrangement should be like one shell only of the well-known quantum mechanical structure of a single atom, with a stable filled shell for ''n'' = 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98, 128, etc.; i.e. twice a perfect [[square number]]; but this series does not include 60. This 2(''N''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<sup>2</sup> rule (with ''N'' integer) for [[spherical aromaticity]] is the three-dimensional analogue of [[H\u00fcckel's rule]]. The 10+ [[cation]] would satisfy this rule, and should be aromatic.

The sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms, which are at their energy minimum in planar [[graphite#Structure|graphite]], must be bent to form the closed sphere or tube, which produces [[Ring strain|angle strain]]. The characteristic reaction of fullerenes is [[electrophilic addition]] at 6,6-double bonds, which reduces angle strain by changing sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons into sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized ones. The change in hybridized [[atomic orbital|orbital]]s causes the bond angles to decrease from about 120\u00b0 in the sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals to about 109.5\u00b0 in the sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals. This decrease in bond angles allows for the bonds to bend less when closing the sphere or tube, and thus, the molecule becomes more stable.\n\nOther atoms can be trapped inside fullerenes to form [[inclusion compound]]s known as [[endohedral fullerenes]].

For example, solubility of C<sub>60</sub> in [[benzene]] solution shows maximum at about 313 K. Crystallization from benzene solution at temperatures below maximum results in formation of triclinic solid solvate with four benzene molecules C<sub>60</sub>\u00b74C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> which is rather unstable in air. Out of solution, this structure decomposes into usual [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) C<sub>60</sub> in few minutes' time. At temperatures above solubility maximum the solvate is not stable even when immersed in saturated solution and melts with formation of fcc C<sub>60</sub>. Crystallization at temperatures above the solubility maximum results in formation of pure fcc C<sub>60</sub>.

Research efforts are ongoing to develop specific sensors for their enantiomers.\n\n==Construction==\n\nTwo theories have been proposed to describe the molecular mechanisms that make fullerenes. The older, \u201cbottom-up\u201d theory proposes that they are built atom-by-atom. The alternative \u201ctop-down\u201d approach claims that fullerenes form when much larger structures break into constituent parts.<ref name=kurz/>\n\nIn 2013 researchers discovered that asymmetrical fullerenes formed from larger structures settle into stable fullerenes. The synthesized substance was a particular [[metallofullerene]] consisting of 84 carbon atoms with two additional carbon atoms and two [[yttrium]] atoms inside the cage. The process produced approximately 100 micrograms.<ref name=kurz/>\n\nHowever, they found that the asymmetrical molecule could theoretically collapse to form nearly every known fullerene and metallofullerene. Minor perturbations involving the breaking of a few molecular bonds cause the cage to become highly symmetrical and stable. This insight supports the theory that fullerenes can be formed from graphene when the appropriate molecular bonds are severed.<ref name=kurz>[http://www.kurzweilai.net/support-for-top-down-theory-of-how-buckyballs-form Support for top-down theory of how 'buckyballs\u2019 form]. kurzweilai.net. 24 September 2013</ref><ref name=topdown>{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = J. | last2 = Bowles | first2 = F.

Prentice-Hall. \"Using in the definition itself the word to be defined or a close synonym of it.\"</ref>]]\n\nIf one concept is defined by another, and the other is defined by the first, this is known as a [[circular definition]], akin to [[begging the question|circular reasoning]]: neither offers enlightenment about what one wanted to know.<ref name=\"the-logical-fallacies\">{{Cite web |website= Stephen's Guide to the Logical Fallacies |title= Circular Definition | url= http://onegoodmove.org/fallacy/circle.htm}} Accessed September 2, 2014.</ref> \"It is a fallacy because by using a synonym in the ''definiens'' the reader is told nothing significantly new.\"<ref name=\"H&D\"/>\n\nA straightforward example would be to define \"Jew\" as \"a person believing in Judaism\", and \"Judaism\" as \"the religion of the Jewish people\", which would make \"Judaism\" \"the religion of the people believing in Judaism.\"\n\n== Incongruity: overly broad or narrow ==\nA definition intended to describe a given set of individuals fails if its description of matching individuals is incongruous: too broad (excessively loose with parameters) or too narrow (excessively strict with parameters). For example, \"a shape with four sides of equal length\" is not a good definition for \"square\", because squares are not the only shapes that can have four sides of equal length; [[rhombi]] do as well. Likewise, defining a \"rectangle\" as \"a shape with four perpendicular sides of equal length\" is not useful because it is too narrow, as it describes only squares while excluding all other kinds of rectangles, thus being a plainly incorrect definition.\n\nIf a cow were defined as an animal with horns, this would be overly broad (including goats, for example), while if a cow were defined as a black-and-white quadruped, this would be both overly narrow (excluding all-black or all-white cows, for example)<ref name=\"Potter\"/> and overly broad (including [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatians]], for example).\n\n== Obscurity ==\nDefinitions can go wrong by using [[ambiguous]], obscure, or [[figurative language]]. If \"beauty\" is defined as \"aesthetically successful\", one must continue to break down and define the following definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This can lead to circular definitions. Definitions should be defined in the most prosaic form of language to be understood. Failure to elucidate provides fallacious definitions.<ref name=\"the-logical-fallacies\"/>\n\nAn example of obscurity is [[Samuel Johnson]]'s definition for [[oat]]s: \"A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in [[Scotland]] supports the people.\"<ref name=oats>{{citation|last=Johnson|first= Samuel|entry= Oats|title= A Dictionary of the English Language|year=1755|url= http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/?p=3471}}</ref> The thing defined should be pointed out rather than remain obscure. (Of course, this was not seriously intended as a definition of \"oats\" but as an ironic comment on the social, cultural, and financial differences between England and Scotland.)\n\n==Mutual exclusivity==\nThe definition completely excludes what is being defined. For example a cow might be defined as a flying animal with no legs.<ref name=\"Potter\"/>  In reality a cow has legs and cannot fly, but this example claims to define a cow using a definition that is opposite to what a cow actually is.  \"Cow\" and \"flying animal with no legs\" are mutually exclusive to each other: they cannot refer to the same thing.\n\n== Self-contradictory requirements ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nDefinitions may fail by imposing conflicting requirements, making it impossible for them to apply to anything at all. An example would occur if a cow were defined as a legless quadruped.\n\n== Definist fallacy ==\n{{Main|Definist fallacy}}\n\nThe [[definist fallacy]] is a [[Informal fallacy|logical fallacy]], coined by [[William Frankena]] in 1939, that involves the definition of one property in terms of another.<ref name=\"BunninYu2008\">{{citation|last1=Bunnin|first1=Nicholas|last2=Yu|first2=Jiyuan|authorlink2=Jiyuan Yu|title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdbxabeToQYC&pg=PA165|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99721-5|page=165}}</ref>{{clarify|reason= Does not explain anything|date=October 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Logic}}\n*[[Inscrutability of reference]]\n* [[Equivocation]]\n* [[Persuasive definition]]\n* [[Fallacy]]\n* [[Fallacy of division]]\n* [[Fallacy of equivocation]]\n* [[Fallacies of inference]]\n* [[Formal fallacy]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Defining}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fallacies Of Definition}}\n[[Category:Informal fallacies]]\n[[Category:Lexicography]]", "sha1": "q8whg0cn5b4qi7sweokv8ffs7n4ivbr"}}, {"title": "Fredericton", "ns": "0", "id": "10633", "revision": {"id": "864507338", "parentid": "859397594", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T17:49:02Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2607:FEA8:7A1F:EB17:1D11:20A8:B011:696E"}, "comment": "/* Economy */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the capital of New Brunswick}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=March 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = Fredericton\n|official_name          = City of Fredericton<br>''Ville de Fredericton''\n|settlement_type        = [[List of cities in New Brunswick|City]]\n|image_skyline          = <center>{{Photomontage\n| photo1a = FrederictonSkyline2013.jpg\n| photo2a = Nashwaak River, Fredericton, NB (29905645230).jpg\n| photo2b = Christ Church Cathedral, Fredricton..3.jpg\n| photo3a = Fredericton, New Brunswick.jpg\n| size    = 245\n}}</center>\n|imagesize              =\n|image_caption          = From top to bottom;

The city is situated in the west-central portion of the province along the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]], which flows west to east as it bisects the city. The river is the dominant natural feature of the area. One of the main urban centres in New Brunswick, the city had a population of 56,224 in the 2011 census.<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMA&Code1=320__&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&Data=Count&SearchText=Fredericton&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=13&B1=All&Custom=|title=Community Profiles from the 2006 Census, Statistics Canada - Census Metropolitan Area/Census Agglomeration|author=|date=13 March 2007|work=statcan.ca}}</ref> It is the third-largest city in the province after [[Moncton]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]].\n\nAn important cultural, artistic, and educational centre for the province, Fredericton is home to two universities, the [[New Brunswick College of Craft and Design]], and cultural institutions such as the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]], the [[Fredericton Region Museum]], and [[The Playhouse (Fredericton)|The Playhouse]], a performing arts venue. The city hosts the annual [[Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival]], attracting regional and international [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[world music|world]] artists. Fredericton is also an important and vibrant center point for the region's top visual artists; many of New Brunswick's notable artists live and work there today. Fredericton has also been home to some great historical Canadian painters as well, including [[Goodridge Roberts]], and [[Molly Bobak|Molly]] and [[Bruno Bobak]].\n\nAs a provincial capital, its economy is tied to the public sector; however, the city also contains a growing IT and commercial sector. The city has the highest percentage of residents with a post-secondary education in the province and one of the highest per capita incomes.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Fredericton|History of New Brunswick|List of historic places in York County, New Brunswick}}\n\nThe earliest known inhabitation of the area dates back 12,000 years, according to archaeologists, evidenced by recent finds.  Excavations unearthed a campsite with firepit and more than 600 artifacts including stone tool fragments and arrowheads.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/route-8-artifacts-12000-years-1.3648907 CBC News: \"Campsite dating back 12,000 years unearthed by Route 8\"], 23 June 2016</ref>\n\nThe area of the present-day city of Fredericton was first used for seasonal farming by the [[Maliseet]] peoples. Maliseet cultivated food plants including: beans, pumpkins, Jerusalem artichokes, ground nuts, and maize on the river banks and islands of the Saint John River.  In the mid-18th century their principal village of Aucpaque was located several kilometres upriver from the site of present-day Fredericton.<ref>Jason Hall, \"Maliseet Cultivation and Climatic Resilience on the W\u0259last\u0259kw/St. John River during the Little Ice Age,\" Acadiensis vol.

Raymond, The River St. John, Tribune Press, 1907</ref>\n\n===Colonial history (1690\u20131867)===\nThe first European contact was by the [[France|French]] in the late 17th century. [[Joseph Robineau de Villebon]] received a land grant and was appointed  governor of Acadia. During [[King William's War]], Villebon built [[Fort Nashwaak]] on the north side of the Saint John River, at the mouth of the [[Nashwaak River]]. For most of the war, Fort Nashwaak served as the capital of the French colony of [[Acadia]]; forces from here conducted numerous military raids on English settlers on the New England/ Acadia border.\n[[File:FortStJosephAcadia1692.png|thumb|left| Built in 1692, [[Fort Nashwaak]] was the capital of the French colony of [[Acadia]], after the [[Battle of Port Royal (1690)|French defeat at Port Royal]]. Nashwaak was later [[Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696)|captured]] by the English in 1696.]]\nFrench and English hostilities continued along the border. Within weeks of an attack of French and Indigenous forces launched from Fort Nashwaak on [[Siege of Pemaquid (1696)|Pemaquid, Maine]] (present day [[Bristol, Maine]]), the New Englanders struck back. In 1696, an expedition under command of Major [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] set out to destroy Fort Nashwaak (present-day Fredericton). Commander Villebon had been alerted and prepared his defences. On 18 October, the British troops arrived near the fort, landed three cannons, and assembled earthworks on the south bank of the Nashwaak River.<ref name=Murdoch>{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=Beamish|title=A History of Nova-Scotia, or Acadie, volume 1|year=1865|publisher=James Barnes|location=Halifax, NS|pages=228\u2013231|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=k68NAAAAQAAJ&vq=villebon&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false|authorlink=Beamish Murdoch}}</ref>  The [[Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696)|siege of Fort Nashwaak]] last for two days gunfire was fiercely exchanged, with the advantage going to the better-sited Acadian guns.

The Acadians sustained losses of one killed and two wounded.<ref name=Marsters>{{cite book|last=Marsters|first=Roger|title=Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast|year=2004|publisher=Formac Publishing|location=Toronto|isbn=9780887806445|page=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter Villebon's death in 1700 and a devastating flood that destroyed several French farms in the area, the fort was abandoned. The Fredericton area was first permanently settled and named Pointe-Sainte-Anne (later often anglicized to \"Ste. Anne's Point\") in 1732 by Acadians fleeing [[Nova Scotia]] after the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] took over the territory (1710). Their townsite was on the south side of the river, approximately a mile upriver from Fort Nashwaak.<ref>William O. Raymond, ''The River St. John'', 1910</ref>\n\nThe British captured Ste. Anne's Point during the [[expulsion of the Acadians]], burning the settlement to the ground in the [[St. John River Campaign]] (1759) during the French and Indian War, the North American front of their [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe against France.\n\nA 1762 settlement attempt by the British was unsuccessful due to the hostility of local Acadian and Aboriginal populations. These settlers eventually erected a community downriver at what is today the town of [[Maugerville, New Brunswick|Maugerville]] (pronounced \"majorville\"). However, three [[fur traders]] settled permanently here in 1768.\n[[File:Henry Sandham - The Coming of the Loyalists.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[United Empire Loyalists]] arrival to [[New Brunswick]]. New Brunswick was partitioned from Nova Scotia in 1784, with Ste. Anne Point selected as its capital.]]\nIn 1783, [[United Empire Loyalists]] were settled in Ste. Anne's Point after the [[American Revolution]], having left their properties in the United States. They were granted land in compensation in British North America by the Crown. Many died during the harsh and long first winter in Fredericton. The dead were buried in what became the Loyalist cemetery, which is still found on the south bank of the Saint John River. When spring came, more Loyalists left the new settlement to take up land grants in other areas.\n\nWhen New Brunswick became a separate colony from Nova Scotia in 1784, Ste. Anne's Point became the provincial capital, winning out over Parrtown (present-day [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]]) due to its central inland location. This made it less prone to American attack from the sea. A street plan was laid out to the west of the original townsite, King's College (now the [[University of New Brunswick]]) was founded, and the locale was renamed \"Frederick's Town\", in honour of the second son of King [[George III of the United Kingdom]], [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick Augustus, Duke of York]]. The name was shortened to Fredericton shortly after the city became the official provincial capital of New Brunswick on 25 April 1785.  Thus, in a period of less than three years, the area of Fredericton went from being a sparsely populated region to being the capital of the new colony of New Brunswick.\n\nThe same attributes that made Fredericton the capital city also made it an ideal spot for a military installation. Many of the original military buildings downtown still stand, and are now tourist attractions.\n\n===Modern history (1867\u2013present)===\nThe building constructed to house the colonial-era legislative assembly in 1788 was destroyed by a fire in 1880. Two years later, the present [[New Brunswick Legislative Building|Legislature Building]] was constructed.\n\nThe first major expansion of the city occurred on 1 July 1945 when it amalgamated with the town of Devon. Today the city of Fredericton comprises Fredericton proper, and the boroughs of Silverwood, [[Nashwaaksis]], Barker's Point and [[Marysville, New Brunswick|Marysville]], which were incorporated into the city in 1973.\n\nThe commemorative brass [[cenotaph]] plaques were stolen in October 2015, and were replaced by replicas cast by an [[Amherst, Nova Scotia|Amherst]] foundry called Liberty Enterprises.<ref>[https://ca.news.yahoo.com/n-b-cenotaph-plaques-expected-135344015.html yahoo.com: \"Cenotaph plaques will be replaced by Remembrance Day\"], 7 Nov 2015</ref>\n\nOne of the communities amalgamated into Fredericton in 1973, Marysville, has a unique and distinctive history of its own.  Marysville is located on the [[Nashwaak River]],  a tributary of the Saint John River, just north of pre-1973 Fredericton.  The community is distinguished by its 19th-century mill and historic buildings, which include 19th-century company houses and buildings patterned after those of British industrial towns.\n[[File:Marysville cotton mill.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Marysville [[cotton mill]] in 1885, two years after it first opened.]]\nMarysville can be described as a prime example of a 19th-century mill town. In the 1830s a [[sawmill]] was built on the site of Marysville by two local entrepreneurs. However, the mill frequently changed ownership and never showed a profit.  [[Alexander Gibson (industrialist)|Alexander Gibson]] (popularly referred to as \"Boss Gibson\") turned this situation around and built a prosperous industrial town. In 1883, under the direction of Gibson, construction began of a [[cotton mill]], which was state-of-the-art for its time. \"Boss\" Gibson named the company town that grew up around the mill Marysville in honour of his wife.\n\nIn 1908, having faced financial problems, Gibson sold the mill to a Montreal-based company which, in turn, sold it to Canadian Cottons Ltd. After World War II, foreign competition devastated the mill's business; jobs moved offshore and it ceased operations in 1954. There were numerous attempts to re-open the mill; however, in 1980, it closed its doors permanently. The mill was renovated and re-opened in 1985 for use as provincial government offices. The mill remains the dominant feature in the Marysville skyline.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, a [[Fredericton shooting|mass shooting]] took place on Brookside Drive that left four people dead, including two police officers.\n\n==Geography==\n{{climate chart\n| Fredericton\n|-15.0 |  -3.8 |  95.3\n|-13.7 |  -2.0 |  73.1\n|-7.8 |  3.0 | 93.2\n|-1.0 |  10.0 | 85.9\n| 4.6 |  17.6 | 96.2\n| 9.7 | 22.7 | 82.4\n|13.0 | 25.5 | 88.3\n|12.1 | 24.8 | 85.6\n| 7.1 | 20.0 |  87.5\n| 1.6 |  13.2 | 89.1\n|-3.0 |  6.0 |  106.3\n|-10.7 |  0.7 |  94.9\n| float = left\n| source = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"CCN\"/>\n\n}}\nThe Saint John River runs through Fredericton,  with most of the city's post-war suburban development occurring on the gently sloping hills on either side of the river (although the downtown core is flat and lies low to the river).\n[[File:Ice covered tree - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Fredericton's climate is influenced by its inland position, resulting in colder winters than most other coastal areas of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.]]\nAt an altitude of about {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, Fredericton is nestled in the Pennsylvanian Basin. It differs markedly from the geologically older parts of the province. There are prominently two distinct areas in the region that are divided around the area of Wilsey Road, in the east end of the city. In the west side, the bedrock underneath the earth is topographically dominant, whereas the other is controlled by Pleistocene and recent deposits leading to the rivers (resulting in the area being shallow and wide). Fredericton and its surroundings are rich in water resources, which, coupled with highly arable soil, make the Fredericton region ideal for agriculture. The Saint John River and one of its major tributaries, the [[Nashwaak River]], come together in Fredericton.  The uninhabited parts of the city are heavily forested.\n\nFredericton has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'').

Snowfall is common between late November and early April, and snow usually stays on the ground beginning in December. [[Flood]]ing occurs during the spring of most years on area rivers and affects the city's low-lying neighbourhoods. Its climate is somewhat influenced by its inland position, with warmer summers and colder winter nights than expected for coastal areas of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\n\nThe highest temperature

the [[Fredericton City Council|seat of municipal government]].]]\n\n===Municipal===\nFredericton has a [[mayor-council]] and [[non-partisan]] form of government, with the mayor and council serving fixed four-year terms (three years until 2004), and elections held in May. The current mayor is Mike O'Brien, who was elected in 2016.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/> The city is divided into twelve [[ward (politics)|wards]] (six on each side of the Saint John River), with each ward electing one councillor.\n\nThe Boyce Farmers Market, open on Saturday mornings, is a place where municipal, provincial and federal politicians frequently visit to mingle with their electorate - something which has evolved into a political tradition.\n\n===Federal and provincial===\nProvincially, Fredericton elected Progressive Conservatives from 1952 until electoral sweep of the Liberal Party in 1987 when they won every seat in New Brunswick under [[Frank McKenna]]. Since then there has been greater political alteration in the provincial electoral landscape in Fredericton.\n\nIn 1991, the right-wing [[Confederation of Regions Party of New Brunswick|Confederation of Regions Party]] won the riding of Fredericton North (along with several other nearby ridings). In 1999 Progressive Conservatives swept all three Fredericton area seats; however, in 2003, Fredericton-North and Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak returned to the Liberals.<ref>[http://www.gnb.ca/elections/index-e.asp Elections New Brunswick<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220133149/http://www.gnb.ca/elections/index-e.asp |date=20 December 2005 }}</ref>\n\nFederally, the city forms most of the riding of [[Fredericton (electoral district)|Fredericton]]. This riding was known as Fredericton-York-Sunbury but was redistributed prior to the 1997 general election.  From 1957 until 1993 Fredericton returned Progressive Conservatives. In the 2008 federal election, the candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada, former New Maryland MLA [[Keith Ashfield]], won this seat with 42% of the popular vote.\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Downtown Fredericton.jpg|thumb|Downtown Fredericton is the city's [[central business district]]. Located on the south side of the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]], it also hosts a number of the city's cultural attractions.]] \nArchitecturally, Fredericton spans more than two centuries. The city features an eclectic mix of buildings and residences ranging from classical [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style to modern office buildings and architecture. Fredericton\u2019s skyline is also distinguished by many historic churches.  There are 12 [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in New Brunswick|National Historic Sites of Canada]] in Fredericton.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fredericton|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/page3_E.asp?locateinp=Fredericton&nhsprov=New+Brunswick&nhschoice=nhsdesig&list4=Generate+List|work=Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada|publisher=[[Parks Canada]]|accessdate=3 March 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nNeighbourhoods in Fredericton include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Barker's Point, New Brunswick|Barker's Point]]\n*Brookside West\n*Devon\n*[[Douglas, New Brunswick|Douglas]]\n*[[Downtown Frederiction]] (CBD)\n*[[Hanwell, New Brunswick|Hanwell]]\n*Lincoln Heights\n*[[Marysville, New Brunswick|Marysville]]\n*[[Nashwaaksis, New Brunswick|Nashwaaksis]]\n*North Brook\n*Silverwood\n*Skyline Acres\n*Southwood Park\n*[[St. Mary's, New Brunswick|St. Mary's]]\n*Sunset Acres\n*Sunshine Gardens\n*Town Platt\n*West Platt\n{{div col end}}\nThe City of Fredericton is bisected by the Saint John River. This has created two distinctive regions of the city characterized as the \"Northside\" and the \"Southside\". The Southside is characterized by a downtown core consisting of provincial government departments, historical buildings, and numerous business establishments, banks, and law firms.  Downtown also hosts many of the city's cultural attractions, such as [[The Playhouse (Fredericton)|The Playhouse]], the [[York Sunbury Museum|Fredericton Region Museum]] (formerly the York-Sunbury Museum), the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]] and [[Science East]], New Brunswick's science centre.  Many notable historical buildings are also located in or near downtown, including grand Victorian-era residences, the [[New Brunswick Legislative Building]], and Christ Church Cathedral. South of downtown, the city's elevation rises along a sloping hill (part of the river valley feature of the city).\n\n\"The Hill\", as it is called, includes an area known as \"College Hill\", where the adjoining campuses of the [[University of New Brunswick]] and [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] are located, slightly southeast of the downtown area. Southwest of the universities on the crest of the hill, near the highway interchange between [[New Brunswick Route 8|Route 8]] and [[New Brunswick Route 7|Route 7]], is the [[Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital]]. East of the universities is the Skyline Acres/Southwood Park area, consisting of a core of older established suburbs, and newer, more affluent areas such as Poets Hill.\n[[File:MarysvilleStreetscapeNB2014.jpg|thumb|left|Residential area of Marysville. The neighbourhood is located on the north side of the Saint John River.]]\nOccupying the hill southwest of downtown is Odell Park, a large preserved forest area. Its trails and wooded areas are a favourite for hiking, jogging, dog walking, and cross-country skiing for city residents. [[Odell Park (Frederiction)|Odell Park]] borders on the [[Fredericton Botanic Garden]]. West of the park and garden is Hanwell Road, Golf Club Road, and Silverwood neighbourhoods consisting largely of suburban residences.\n\nSouth of the \"Hill Area\", where it plateaus, is a sizeable shopping district consisting of the city's largest mall, the [[Regent Mall]]; two big-box retail complexes, [[Corbett Centre]] and [[Uptown Centre]];  and numerous adjacent strip malls and restaurants.\n\nThe city's \"Northside\" consists of several boroughs which were, at one time, separate communities. These include Devon, [[Nashwaaksis, New Brunswick|Nashwaaksis]], [[Marysville, New Brunswick|Marysville]] and [[Barker's Point, New Brunswick|Barker's Point]]. These communities are largely suburban neighbourhoods and retail outlets. Main Street (in Nashwaaksis) which becomes Union Street in Devon, runs along the northern bank of the Saint John River. It includes numerous retail outlets as well as an eclectic array of businesses including IT firms, law firms, and real estate agents.  Also located on the Northside is the [[Brookside Mall (Fredericton)|Brookside Mall]], a retail mall anchored by [[Sobeys]], [[Alcool NB Liquor]] and a [[Lawtons Drugs]] store as well as government offices. A new retail \"power centre\" development including [[Canadian Tire]]/[[Marks Work Warehouse]], [[Kent Building Supplies]] and a [[Wal-Mart Canada|Wal-Mart]], is located at [[Two Nations Crossing (Fredericton)|Two-Nations Crossing]]. Willie O'Ree Place - a new multimillion-dollar hockey complex - opened in the same area in 2007.\n\nThe Northside is also home to the [[Saint Mary's First Nation]] [[Indian reserve]], which includes a community centre and a shopping centre. During the Christmas season, the neighbourhood has some of the most spectacular and creative decorations in the city.\n\n==Culture==\nDue to the presence of the universities, Fredericton is more cosmopolitan than many cities its size.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}  This is reflected in cuisine offered by local ethnic restaurants (which include Caribbean, Chinese, Greek, Indian, Korean, Italian, Japanese, Lebanese, Mexican, Pakistani and Vietnamese foods). There are also several retail outlets that sell ethnic products and artifacts. The federal government named Fredericton the \"Cultural Capital of Canada\" for the year 2009.  Officers' Square is an outdoor public space located at the centre of the city. It serves as a venue for outdoor concerts during the summer, featuring a variety of local and national talent. During the winter, Officers' Square is transformed into an outdoor skating rink.\n[[File:Fredericton - Galerie d'art Beaverbrook 2.JPG|thumb|The [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]] is New Brunswick's provincial [[art gallery]].]]\n\n===Arts===\nFredericton is an important cultural centre of the region featuring art galleries, the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design, museums and theatres which promote local artistic and literary talent. The [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]] is New Brunswick's provincial art gallery. It was established in 1959 by [[Lord Beaverbrook]] as a gift to his native province. Fredericton is also home to several commercial art galleries.\n\nThe [[The Playhouse (Fredericton)|Playhouse]] hosts plays and musicals throughout the year, as well as presenting visiting comedians and musical performances by both Canadian and international artists. The Playhouse is the main venue for Theatre New Brunswick (TNB). TNB was founded by prominent Canadian director [[Walter Learning]] in 1969, and is the province\u2019s largest professional theatre company.\n\nEvery fall Fredericton hosts the [[Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival]]. The week-long festival draws artists from all over North America. Since its inception in 1991, the event has grown into a large, diverse festival which has attracted artists from around the world including [[Buddy Guy]], Warren Haynes, [[Oscar Peterson]], and Parliament.\n[[File:FrederictonPlayhouse.JPG|thumb|left|Built at the behest of [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|The Lord Beaverbrook]], the [[The Playhouse (Fredericton)|Playhouse]] is a non-profit organization venue for hosting local and touring performers.]]\nFredericton is home to the [[New Brunswick Summer Music Festival]], which, each August, features professional chamber music by top local players and nationally renowned performers. [[Motion Ensemble]], NB\u2019s contemporary music organization, is also based here. In addition, [[Symphony New Brunswick]] performs most of its season in Fredericton.\n\nEvery November Fredericton hosts the Silver Wave Film Festival. Originally called the Tidal Wave Film Festival, it has been running since 2001. Each year attendance and interest in the festival has risen. Because of the its relationship with the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], the Silver Wave Festival offers Frederictonians the opportunity to see films that would otherwise be overlooked in their smaller market. Films created by New Brunswickers are also screened at the festival. Many of the local films come from shorts created through the [[University of New Brunswick]] and the New Brunswick Filmmaker's Co-operative.\n\nFredericton has been called the Poets' Corner of Canada, because it was the birthplace of [[Bliss Carman]], [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] and [[Francis Joseph Sherman]]. For many years, it was the home of the acclaimed [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]]-winning poet, playwright, and journalist [[Alden Nowlan]].\n\nProminent writers and poets living in Fredericton include [[Raymond Fraser]], Robert Gibbs, M.T. Dohaney, [[Herb Curtis]], Wayne Curtis, [[David Adams Richards]], Robert Hawkes, Shari Andrews, [[Mark Anthony Jarman]], [[Gerard Beirne]] and Joe Blades.\n\n===Attractions===\n[[File:New Brunswick Legislative Building (6838973457).jpg|thumb|The [[New Brunswick Legislative Building]] is home to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]].]]\n\n====Museums and historic buildings====\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]]\n* [[New Brunswick Legislative Building]]\n* [[Old Government House, Fredericton|Old Government House]]\n* Historic Garrison District\n* [[York Sunbury Museum]]\n* Boyce Farmers Market\n* [[Christ Church Cathedral (Fredericton)|Christ Church Cathedral]]\n* [[New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame]]\n* Gallery 78\n* [[Science East]]\n* Loyalist Cemetery\n* Old Burial Ground\n* [[Sir Howard Douglas Hall|Sir Howard Douglas Hall (Old Arts Building)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Parks and public spaces====\nFredericton contains many public parks featuring preserved forest lands - such as Odell Park and Reading Park. Odell Park is adjacent to the Fredericton Botanic Garden. Furthermore, Fredericton features tree-lined streets and elm trees in particular which have earned the city its nickname \"The City of Stately Elms\".  Fredericton's parks and public spaces include:\n[[File:Fredericton - Queen's Square 3.JPG|thumb|Queen Square Park is a large urban park located in Downtown Fredericton.]]\n*'''Carleton Park''' - A part of the Northside Riverfront Trail, Carleton Park boasts a large open field and a boat launching area. The park, which was once the site of [[Alexander \"Boss\" Gibson's rail yard]], is adjacent to the [[Fredericton Railway Bridge|Bill Thorpe Walking Bridge]], which provides easy access to the Southside of the City.\n* '''The Green''' - along the north and south banks of the Saint John River, the green is primarily a walking and biking trail flanked by grassy areas for picnics and sun bathing. Along Waterloo Row, the Green becomes Morrell Park which features two football/soccer fields and a baseball field. Closer to the Downtown, across Saint Annes Point Drive from Officers' Square is the Lighthouse which is an ice cream parlour and tourist attraction, as well as hosting a Tourism Fredericton Information Desk.\n* '''Killarney Lake Park''' - A lakeside park with a beach and picnic spots as well as an extensive network of nature trails\n* '''Odell Park''' - features preserved forested areas and well groomed trails, as well as recreational spaces for picnics and outdoor gatherings. In the lower centre of the park is a lodge for events such as wedding receptions and adjacent to Prospect street at the top of the park is the [[Fredericton Botanic Garden]] and the Prospect Street Softball Fields.\n* '''Officers' Square''' - Officers' Square is adjacent to the former Officers' Quarters, which houses the [[Fredericton Region Museum]]. The [[Calithumpians Theatre Company]] holds daily shows on a permanent stage every weekday throughout the summer. As well, the Fredericton City Guard holds a parade in the Square several times a day throughout the summer. The Square is also a popular venue for outdoor concerts and boasts an outdoor skating rink in the winter.\n* '''Queen Square Park''' - this popular park, located in the heart of Downtown Fredericton, features a new pool (a hybrid of a kids wading pool with fun water toys and a lap pool), playground, tennis courts and 2 baseball fields. \n* '''Reading Park''' - a {{convert|33|acre|m2|adj=on}} passive use park incorporating an open meadow, and a 1.1 kilometre walking trail through a beautiful old-growth forest.\n* '''Wilmot Park''' - a recreational park in the downtown, across from [[Old Government House, Fredericton|Old Government House]] featuring a splash pad, playground, outdoor basketball and tennis courts and the Fredericton Lawn Bowling Centre.\n\n===Sports===\nThere are no professional sports teams in Fredericton, although both universities have extensive athletic programs. The [[UNB Varsity Reds]] and [[St. Thomas (New Brunswick) Tommies|St. Thomas Tommies]] are rivals in most sports. When their men's hockey teams play (UNB has no women's hockey program in the AUS), the matches are called the \"Battle of the Hill\". The first National Champions ever produced at UNB was in the fall of 1980. The men's soccer team under the leadership of Coaches Gary Brown and Robin Hopper defeated Sir Wilfred Laurier 3-1 on a frigid day in November. The UNB Varsity Reds men hockey team has experienced recent success in national competition, winning the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS) championships in the 2008\u20132009, 2010\u20132011, 2015\u20132016, and 2016-2017 seasons.  They also finished in second place to the [[University of Alberta]] during the 2007\u20132008 championship. Other varsity (AUS) sports at UNB include women's soccer and swimming, along with men's and women's cross country, track and field, basketball and volleyball. Club sports (non-varsity) include baseball, cheerleading, cricket, fencing, football, golf, rowing, wrestling and men's rugby.\n[[File:Aitken University Centre, University of New Brunswick.jpg|thumb|left|Constructed in 1976, [[Aitken University Centre]] is a 3,278 seat multi-purpose arena primarily used by the [[UNB Varsity Reds]].]]\nAt St. Thomas University, their men's and women's hockey and cross country teams compete in the AUS conference of the CIS, while their other sports teams (which include men's and women's soccer, rugby, golf, basketball, and volleyball) play in the [[Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association]] (ACAA) conference of the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA). The Tommies men's volleyball team has won four ACAA titles, including in 2012, while the men's and women's basketball teams were both 2012 CCAA bronze medalists.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] was once represented in Fredericton, with the [[Fredericton Express]] playing between 1981 and 1988, and the [[Fredericton Canadiens]] between 1990 and 1999. \nFredericton has 5 permanent rink facilities which have a combined seven ice surfaces. On the Northside, the York Arena, opened in 1947, is the oldest arena still in use in the city. Also on the Northside is Willie O'Ree Place, the building is named after Fredericton-born [[Willie O'Ree]], the first black player in the [[National Hockey League]]. The building, which serves as the home for the Leo Hayes High School Lions, opened in 2008. It houses two NHL-sized ice surfaces, as well as meeting facilities, an indoor track and a small YMCA workout centre, while outside in Scotiabank Park North there is a soccer field and beach volleyball courts.\n\nOn the Southside, the Lady Beaverbrook Rink (opened in 1954), the home the Fredericton High School Black Kats, and the [[Aitken Centre|Aitken University Centre]] (opened in 1976 and owned by the University of New Brunswick) were joined in 2012 by the new [[Grant-Harvey Centre]], named after Fredericton-born NHL alumni [[Danny Grant]] and [[Buster Harvey]], which is another two rink complex; one is NHL sized and the other Olympic. The Grant-Harvey Centre also houses a walking track and meeting facilities. Behind the arena is the new [[Abony Family Tennis Centre]], a six court indoor tennis facility and to the South is Scotiabank Park South has an artificial turf soccer pitch as well as a two-acre, fenced dog park. {{As of|2012}}, the Grant-Harvey Centre replaced the Lady Beaverbrook Rink as the home of the St. Thomas Tommies.\n[[File:Crabbe Mountian.jpg|thumb|Located outside the city limits, [[Crabbe Mountain]] is an alpine ski hill that features New Brunswick's highest vertical.]]\nFredericton has a strong [[Rugby football|Rugby]] history with the Fredericton Loyalists RFC.  Each summer the Loyalists host the [[New Brunswick Black Spruce]] team which competes in the [[Rugby Canada Super League]].\n\nThere are healthy programs in both baseball and softball at all age levels around the city. The Fredericton U18 Twins hosted the Canadian U18 Softball Fast Pitch Championships in 2011 and 2012, while the Senior Twins hosted the National Senior Fast Pitch Championships in 2012. In baseball, the Fredericton Senior Royals celebrated their 100th anniversary in 2011 and their 11th (17th including when the team was the Marysville Royals) [[New Brunswick Senior Baseball League]] Championship in 2012. That same Royals program produced [[Matt Stairs]], a Major League baseball player who played for Team Canada in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] and won the World Series with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in 2008.\n\nFredericton has several large parks, including Odell Park, Reading Park, Queen's Square, Officer's Square, Carleton Park and Wilmot Park. Killarney Lake and nearby Mactaquac Provincial Park have small beaches which are popular in the summer. These, along with the river, provide excellent venues for water sports. Skiing and snowboarding at nearby [[Crabbe Mountain]] are also common winter activities among city residents, as is skating on the outdoor rinks at Officer's and Queen's Squares. There are also several trails within the city which are used in the winter for cross-country skiing. Fredericton also boasts public and private facilities for archery, soccer, track and field, golf, football, fencing, rowing, sailing, swimming, curling, martial arts, bowling, paintball, and lawn bowling.\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"| Historical populations\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Census<br>year !! style=\"text-align:right;\"| Population\n|-\n| colspan=2|<hr>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1861 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,000\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1871 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,006\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1881 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,218\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1891 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,502\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1901 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,117\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1911 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,208\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1921 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 8,114\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1931 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 8,830\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1941 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 10,062*\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1951 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 16,018\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1956 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 18,303\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1961 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 19,683\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1966 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 22,460\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1971 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 24,254\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1976 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 45,248**\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1981 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 43,723\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1986 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 44,352\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1991 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 47,510\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2001 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 48,560\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2006 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 50,535\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2011 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 56,224\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2016 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 58,220\n|-\n| ||align=\"right\"|* Boundary change\n|-\n| ||align=\"right\"|** City amalgamated with<br> surroundings in 1973\n|}\nThe population of Fredericton is 56,224 (2011 Census). Along with [[Moncton]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Fredericton is one of three Maritime cities to register a population increase in recent years.\n\n===Ethnicity===\nFredericton's population is predominantly [[White people|white]].  However, a [[Black people|black]] minority has had a long presence in the city, primarily in the Barker's Point borough. [[Willie O'Ree]], the first black player in the NHL, is from Fredericton. The largest non-white segment of Fredericton's population is made up of First Nations people, who live primarily on the Saint Mary's Reserve located in the city's north side.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, an influx of immigrants from [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] began, although their numbers remain small. Since 2000, the city's universities, Saint Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick, have seen a growing number of students from overseas attending. Visible minorities comprise 9.9% of the city's population.<ref>https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0305&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&Data=Count&SearchText=Fredericton&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&GeoLevel=PR&GeoCode=0305&TABID=1/</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, over 500 refugees from the [[Syrian Civil War]] have immigrated to the Fredericton area, more per capita than anywhere else in Canada, and equal to approximately 1% of the city's population.<ref>https://globalnews.ca/news/3192030/fredericton-welcomed-more-syrians-per-capita-than-other-canadian-cities-multicultural-association/</ref>\n\n===Language===\nWhile a predominantly Anglophone city, the civil service has seen an increase in the city's Francophone population.  This population is served by the Centre Communautaire Sainte-Anne (which includes K-12 schooling, a radio station, a public library, and cultural centre).  In addition, Fredericton is served by a Francophone church located on Regent Street.\n\nThe linguistic breakdown of Fredericton is as follows:\n*75.6% [[English language|English]] only\n*23.6% bilingual (French and English)\n*0.5% [[French language|French]] only\n*0.3% other\n[[File:Tintamarre Fredericton.JPG|thumb|Celebration of Acadian culture in Fredericton. The city has a significant number of residents that is bilingual (in English and French).]]\n\n===Religion===\nThe residents of Fredericton are predominantly Christian, with Protestants forming the largest denomination. The city is notable for its many churches, a high number per capita in comparison to most other Canadian cities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The small [[Pentecostalism#Oneness Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] Northeast Christian College is located on the city's north side. While the [[Roman Catholic]] population is not as large, the city does have the province's only Roman Catholic university, [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]].\n\nFredericton has a [[synagogue]], a [[mosque]], and a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple as well. The importance of these institutions has been growing in recent years warranting visits by prominent politicians in the area seeking election. On 9 October 2011, a swastika was scrawled on the front door of the community's synagogue, and was investigated as a potential hate crime.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swastika drawn on Fredericton synagogue|url=http://antisemitism.org.il/article/67617/swastika-drawn-fredericton-synagogue|publisher=CFCA|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> A [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] fellowship has been serving Fredericton since 1960 as a place for people to find a liberal religious home.

Over the course of the 20th century, this industry declined and gave way to the provincial government and the universities becoming the primary employers in the city.\n\nThe policies of centralizing provincial government functions during the 1960s under New Brunswick Premier [[Louis Robichaud]] - along with the expanded role of the public sector characteristic of the 1960s/70s - led to a sizeable expansion of the city's population. It was during these decades that the Hill area on the city's Southside was largely developed and bedroom communities such as [[New Maryland, New Brunswick|New Maryland]] emerged.\n[[File:MarysvillePlaceMarysvilleNB2014.jpg|thumb|left|Marysville Place houses a number of offices for the provincial government. The [[Government of New Brunswick]] is the largest employer in Fredericton.]]\nThe 1960s also saw an expansion of the [[University of New Brunswick]] due to increased post-war university enrolment, as well as the construction of the Fredericton campus of [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|Saint Thomas University]]. Also contributing to this expansion was the move of the Law School from Saint John to the Fredericton area. This expansion of the post-secondary sector also contributed to Fredericton's population growth during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, the city's population has continued to grow though at a slower rate due to slower growth of the government sector, along with hiring freezes and in some cases layoffs, during the [[Frank McKenna]] and [[Bernard Lord]] governments.\n\nIn recent years, increased student enrolment at the city's universities has led to greater demand for rental property. This has led to the construction of new university residences and apartment buildings in the city, and increased rates of rent, making them the highest rental rates in the province.\n\nThe predominance of the universities and government provide Fredericton with a measure of economic stability. The city has not been subject to the uncertainty and hardships faced by Atlantic Canadian cities dealing with mill shutdowns and the decline of the mining and fishing industries. For this reason, Fredericton is one of the few Atlantic Canadian cities that has actually reported a population increase in recent years.\n\nThe city has been investing actively in IT infrastructure. The City of Fredericton won the \"Judges Innovation Award\" at the 2004 Canadian Information Productivity Awards due to their \"Fred-eZone\" free municipality wide [[WiFi]] network initiative. This and other innovations by the city's utelco, e-Novations, led [[Intel]] to do a case study on their successes. Fred-eZone spans much of the city\u2019s downtown and parts of surrounding residential areas, as well as peripheral commercial areas such as Fredericton's Regent Mall. In 2008 and 2009 the [[Intelligent Community Forum]] selected Fredericton as a Top 7 Intelligent Community, based partly on the city's work in the IT sector.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 7 By Year |url=https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=gendocs&ref=Top7_by_Year&category=Events |accessdate=25 March 2014 |author=Intelligent Community Forum |authorlink=Intelligent Community Forum |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209002659/https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=gendocs&ref=Top7_by_Year&category=Events |archivedate=9 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Greater Fredericton]] region has also established an investment attraction program called Invest Greater Fredericton. The purpose is to provide investors and site selectors with one central source for economic information such as real estate, demographics, key industries and more.\n\n==Education==\n===Primary and secondary education===\nFredericton's public schools are located in either the [[Anglophone West School District]] (formerly known as District 18, and prior to that, District 26) or the District Scolaire Francophone Sud (District 1). Fredericton is home to three public [[High school (North America)|high school]]s, two operating in the English language and one in the French language. [[Fredericton High School]], which was once the largest school in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], operates in English and primarily serves students living on Fredericton's south side. It is also one of the oldest public high schools in Canada, tracing its beginnings to 1785 \u2013 having celebrated its bicentennial in 1985. Fredericton High School is home to several sports teams \u2013 including basketball, hockey, soccer, and football \u2013 which dominated New Brunswick provincial high school sports championships during much of the 1980s and 1990s. The school motto is \"Palma Non Sine Pulvere\", Latin for \"No Reward Without Effort\" (literally \"no palm without dust\").\n\n[[Leo Hayes High School]], which opened in 1999, also operates in English and primarily serves students living on Fredericton's north side. The high school is a Public Private Partnership, known as a P3. Leo Hayes' current principal is Brad Sturgeon. The motto of the school is \"Somnia Sunt Circuli Veritatis\", Latin for \"Dreams are the Seedlings of Reality\". Leo Hayes High School places priority on both Arts and Athletics, in addition to Academia. In addition, there are four [[middle schools]], fourteen [[elementary schools]] and three [[private schools]] in the city. A recent issue with middle schools in the city has been the location of George Street Middle School and Albert Street Middle School close to the city centre. This fails to account for the city's changing demographic which has seen the growth of suburban neighbourhoods. In 2009 Albert Street Middle School was replaced by [[Bliss Carman Middle School]], located in the Kimble Road Park area of Skyline Acres. Albert Street Middle School has since been demolished, with a new YMCA having been erected in its place.\n\nFredericton is also served by [[\u00c9cole Sainte-Anne (Fredericton)|\u00c9cole Sainte-Anne]] (ESA), which provides French language education for grades 6-12, and ''[[\u00c9cole des B\u00e2tisseurs]]'' (opened in 2007) and \u00c9cole Les \u00c9claireurs (opened in 2015), which provide K-5 education on the north and south side, respectively. \u00c9cole Sainte-Anne is in the same building as that used by the French community centre - the Centre communautaire Sainte-Anne, which also houses the French public library, the Dr. Margu\u00e9rite Michaud Library, and an amphitheatre.  The current principal of ESA is Gabrielle McLaughlin.\n\nFredericton is also home to a private Christian school, Fredericton Christian Academy, which is located on the Northside. Its current principal is Jonathan McAloon.\n\n===Post-secondary institutions===\n====Universities====\n[[File:UNB Old Arts Building.jpg|thumb|Established in 1785, the [[University of New Brunswick]] is the oldest public university in North America.]]\nFredericton's status as an educational centre is evident in the city's two degree-granting universities: the [[University of New Brunswick]] and [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]]. The [[University of New Brunswick]] (UNB) was founded in 1785, making it the oldest public university in [[North America]], compared to the oldest private university, Harvard University, in 1636. Built in 1826, UNB's Old Arts Building is the oldest university building still in use in Canada. UNB also houses Renaissance College, which is a leading leadership training institution in New Brunswick. UNB houses a Faculty of Law which is one of two Anglophone common-law schools in Atlantic Canada.\n\nSt. Thomas University (STU) is the province's only [[Catholic university]] and has been located in Fredericton since 1964, when it moved from its [[Chatham, New Brunswick]] campus. It is a liberal arts university with programs in [[gerontology]], [[criminology]], [[journalism]], [[social work]], native studies, and [[education]]. STU offers an excellent program in Human Rights and is the home of the Atlantic Human Rights Research and Development Centre.\n\n====Colleges====\nFredericton is also home to several colleges and similar institutions. The [[New Brunswick College of Craft and Design]] houses the province's leading programs in photography and visual arts. The Fredericton location of the [[New Brunswick Community College]] is on the campus of the University of New Brunswick. The [[Maritime College of Forest Technology]] maintains its English-language campus in the city. MCFT is a small post-secondary school training students from across the Maritime provinces.\n\nOther institutions include 3D and 2D animation schools such as da Vinci College and the Gaming and Animation Institute of Fredericton. Located on the north side is a small Pentecostal College, the Northeast Christian College, which trains and certifies [[pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]].<ref name=NCC>{{cite web|title=Northeast Christian College|url=http://northeastchristiancollege.com|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Other institutions====\nAlongside Fredericton's more established universities, the city also is home to several online for-profit universities. [[University of Fredericton]] (UFred) and Yorkville University are operational. The University of Fredericton was founded in 2006, making it the youngest private university in Canada. It is a degree-granting online university providing certificate and graduate degree programs in business leadership. UFred offers MBA and EMBA Programs under Section 3 of the Degree Granting Act of the Province of New Brunswick in Canada.<ref>[http://www.gnb.ca/redirect/0105/index.htm]</ref> Yorkville offers graduate programs in counselling psychology and adult education. Meritus closed in 2012. These universities typically have offices downtown.\n\n===Research===\nFredericton hosts several major research centres - dealing with policy development, agriculture, forestry, and engineering. These research institutions are connected to the city's two universities as well as the provincial and federal governments.\n\nThe [[Hugh John Flemming]] Forestry Centre (including Provincial and Federal Departments) is the leading forestry research centre in Atlantic Canada. This Centre carries out major research endeavours in forestry management and scientific research. The Centre closely collaborates with the Forestry Department at the [[University of New Brunswick]] which is one of the top Forestry Departments in Canada.  As well, research and development in agriculture and crop development is carried out at the Agricultural Research Station in Lincoln.\n\nThe University of New Brunswick is the site of several major research centres in social science, forestry, geomatics and biomedical engineering, and policy development. These include the Centre for Conflict Studies, which carries out research on military and strategic issues and the Muriel McQueen Fergusson Centre for Family Violence Research, which carries out multi-disciplinary research on family violence issues. Furthermore, the Institute of Biomedical Engineering has completed groundbreaking work on prosthetic limbs to aid war amputees in developing countries.\n\nAs well, the city's growing [[Information technology|IT]] sector has been the basis for new research on IT and computer programming development, including the October 2002 opening of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] Institute for Information Technology \u2013 [[Electronic business|e-Business]] facility, located on the [[University of New Brunswick]] campus.\n\nFredericton is also the home of New Brunswick's Provincial Research Organization (PRO), RPC. RPC specializes in applied research and technical services in support of New Brunswick industry.  Specializations include capabilities in aquaculture, mining, manufacturing, energy and the environment.<ref>[http://www.rpc.ca/ RPC]</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n===Air===\nAir service is provided out of the [[Fredericton International Airport]], located approximately 15 kilometres east of downtown in [[Lincoln, New Brunswick|Lincoln]]. It is served by [[Air Canada Express]], which operates direct flights to [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[Montreal]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. Seasonal direct flights are also offered to Cuba and the Caribbean during the late winter and early spring months. As of May 2015, [[WestJet Encore]] provides daily Q400 Turboprop service to [[Toronto]].\n\n===Public transit===\n[[File:Fredericton Transit New Brunswick Canada Bus 4936.JPG|thumb|Operating a fleet of buses, [[Fredericton Transit]] is the public transit operator for the city.]]\n[[Fredericton Transit]] provides bus transit service to most areas of the city.  All city buses feature bike racks so that cyclists can take advantage of bus services as well. Fredericton is also served by several taxi companies. The major companies in alphabetical order are: ABC Car Services, Checker Cab, George's Skycab, Loyal Taxi, Standard Taxi and Trius Taxi.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Fredericton started installing bicycle lanes in July 2008, with a plan to establish 45 kilometres of on-street painted bicycle lanes and 39 kilometres of signed bicycle routes by 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bike Lanes and Bike Routes in Fredericton|url=http://www.fredericton.ca/en/transportation/2008July10BikeLanesPage.asp|publisher=City of Fredericton|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere is no rail service into Fredericton. Passenger service started in 1869 and ended in the 1960s. Via Rail's \"Atlantic\" passenger train ran for many years between Saint John and Montreal, stopping at Fredericton Junction, about 28 kilometers south of Fredericton, and passing through Maine. The service was cancelled in the Via Rail cuts of 1981, but it was resumed in 1985. In 1994, Canadian Pacific announced that it would abandon its railway line through Maine and New Brunswick, thus leading to VIA Rail's decision to cancel the Atlantic train service. The last passenger train left Fredericton Junction in November 1994.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Robert|title=What Happened to the Fredericton Train Station|url=http://www.newbrunswickbeacon.ca/28409/what-happened-to-the-fredericton-train-station/|publisher=The New Brunswick Beacon|accessdate=6 April 2013|date=27 January 2013}}</ref> Freight service to Fredericton ended in 1996 and all railway tracks have been abandoned and removed. The city joined [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and [[Charlottetown]] as Canada's only provincial capitals without rail service. Since 1 December 2012, Fredericton has been served by Maritime Bus connections to points throughout Eastern Canada.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maritime Bus organising fleet for Dec 1 start|url=http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/Business/2012-11-21/article-3125069/Maritime-Bus-organizing-fleet-for-Dec.-1-start/1|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian (Charlottetown)|date=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Princess Margaret Bridge At Sunrise.jpg|thumb|The [[Princess Margaret Bridge]] is one of two bridges crosses over the Saint John River.]]\nFredericton is located on the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], which passes along the southern municipal boundary. Routes [[New Brunswick Route 7|7]] and [[New Brunswick Route 8|8]] (the latter being a former alignment of the Trans-Canada) also pass through the city. Two highway bridges, the [[Westmorland Street Bridge]] and the [[Princess Margaret Bridge]], cross the Saint John River. Those bridges feed into controlled-access roads (Routes 8 and [[New Brunswick Route 105|105]] serving the city's north side.) The city's highway system is mostly complete, and traffic jams rarely occur.\n\nStreets in downtown follow a grid pattern. In residential areas of downtown, some neighbourhoods are traffic-calmed and include traffic circles at intersections to slow the speed of cars and discourage thoroughfare traffic. Northumberland Street and Odell Avenue have adopted speedbumps to slow fast moving traffic. The pattern of streets in the rest of the city varies including straight thoroughfares (such as Smythe Street, Prospect Street and Regent Street), to curved streets and cul-de-sacs in primarily residential areas.\n\n===Trail system===\nFredericton has a network of 25 trails totalling more than {{convert|85|km|mi}} on both sides of the Saint John and Nashwaak Rivers. Many of the city trails are [[rail trail]]s that follow old railway lines. These include the Old Train Bridge that spans 0.6&nbsp;km across the Saint John River, providing a panoramic view of downtown Fredericton. The rail trail system in Fredericton is part of the Sentier NB Trail system and some of these trails are also part of the larger [[Trans-Canada Trail]] network. Some sections of the trail system are being paved to make it more accessible to non-motorized vehicles such as bicycles and wheelchairs.\n[[File:Nashwaak River trail.JPG|thumb|left|The Nashwaak River Trail in Fredericton North.]]\nRailway service through Fredericton was discontinued by [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP Rail]] in fall 1993 and [[Canadian National Railway|CN Rail]] in spring 1996. Following abandonment, both companies sold their right-of-ways to the provincial government which developed the trail network in partnership with the city and volunteer trail organizations. The trails are used by residents for walking, biking, and jogging and boast several scenic vistas along the Saint John and Nashwaak rivers as well as a mix of urban and wooded/natural scenery.\n\nOn the south side of the city, CP Rail's Fredericton Subdivision enters the city from [[Rusagonis-Waasis]] to the south, following the Wilsey Road and Beaverbrook Street to the former railway yard where a [[Sobeys]] supermarket has been built along Regent Street. The former CP passenger station ([[York Street Railway Station]]) is located at the end of the Fredericton Subdivision and, after sitting abandoned for decades, was renovated into a winery and liquor store in 2011.\n\nOn the north side of the city, CP Rail's Gibson Subdivision enters the city from [[Douglas, New Brunswick|Douglas]] in the west, following the Saint John River through Nashwaaksis to South Devon. CP Rail's Minto Subdivision enters the city from Barker's Point in the east and follows the Saint John River to South Devon and crossing the Nashwaak River. CP Rail's Marysville Spur runs from Barker's Point to [[Marysville, New Brunswick|Marysville]] along the east bank of the Nashwaak River.\n\n[[File:Reading Trail.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Reading Trail runs through the last remaining [[old-growth forest]] in Fredericton's Skyline Acres neighbourhood.]]On the south side, CN Rail's Oromocto Subdivision enters the city from [[Lincoln, New Brunswick|Lincoln]] in the east and parallels the former CP line to the downtown rail yard and York Street Station. CN's former Centreville Subdivision continues beyond the station to Silverwood in the west; this rail line was abandoned west of the Hanwell Road after the [[Mactaquac Dam]] opened in 1968 and flooded the right-of-way through to [[Woodstock, New Brunswick|Woodstock]]. CN Rail's Nashwaak Subdivision joined the Oromocto Subdivision at Una Junction, immediately north of Beaverbrook Street opposite the University of New Brunswick campus. The line proceeds north, crossing the Saint John River on the [[Fredericton Railway Bridge]], to the former railway yard in South Devon where CP Rail's Gibson and Minto subdivisions join. The Nashwaak Subdivision continues up the Nashwaak River valley to [[McGivney, New Brunswick|McGivney]].\n\nReading Park Trail ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Reading.ogg|\u02c8|r|\u025b|d|\u026a|\u014b}} {{respell|RED|ing}}) is a 1.1&nbsp;km forested trail going through Reading Park in Skyline Acres on the City's south side. Protected by trees, and constructed in a loop, Reading Park Trail is very popular with city residents for walking their dogs. It's also a destination for bird watchers, as the park's [[old-growth forest]] is one of the city's last remaining habitats for the [[pileated woodpecker]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Fredericton}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Fredericton}}\n\n==Partner cities==\n*{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Gangnam-gu]], [[South Korea]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|New Brunswick}}\n*[[Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire|IODE]], the first chapter of which was formed in Fredericton on 15 January 1900 \n*[[List of cities in Canada]]\n*[[Fredericton Public Library]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Dallison, Robert L. \"A Tour of Boss Gibson's Marysville: A Nineteenth Century Mill Town.\"  Fredericton Heritage Trust, 1991.\n* Hachey, Philip Osmond \"The geology and ground water of the Fredericton district.\" UNB Thesis, 1955.\n* McIntyre, Glen, Bruce Oliver and Bob Watson, \"A Valuable and Important Place - Fredericton's Loyalist Origins 1783.\"  A Fredericton Historical Research Project, 1983.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060615100220/http://christchurchcathedral.com/history/ History of Christchurch Cathedral]\n* Harvest Jazz and Blues Festival [https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000349/http://harvestjazzandblues.com/about.html]\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{wikivoyage-inline|Fredericton}}\n* [http://www.fredericton.ca/ City of Fredericton]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030706/http://www.tourismfredericton.ca/en/thingstodo/resources/trailguide2015.pdf Fredericton Trail System]\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre =  Fredericton\n | North =  [[McLeod Hill, New Brunswick|McLeod Hill]], [[Killarney Road, New Brunswick|Killarney Road]], [[Penniac, New Brunswick|Penniac]]\n | Northeast = \n | East =[[Richibucto Road, New Brunswick|Richibucto Road]]\n | Southeast = [[Lower Lincoln, New Brunswick|Lower Lincoln]]\n | South = [[New Maryland, New Brunswick|New Maryland]]\n | Southwest = [[Hanwell, New Brunswick|Hanwell]]\n | West = [[Keswick, New Brunswick|Keswick]], [[Island View, New Brunswick|Island View]],\n | Northwest = \n}}\n{{Subdivisions of New Brunswick|cities=yes|expanded=yes}}\n{{Canada capitals}}\n{{Saint John River}}\n{{Coord|45|57|00|N|66|40|00|W|name=Fredericton, New Brunswick|display=title|region:CA-NB_type:city(50535)_scale:100000}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Fredericton| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1785]]\n[[Category:Greater Fredericton]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)]]\n[[Category:Former colonial capitals in Canada]]", "sha1": "rqvorqn4512u0ov4zuozp86ep4a3hja"}}, {"title": "Free software", "ns": "0", "id": "10635", "revision": {"id": "857365682", "parentid": "856371086", "timestamp": "2018-08-31T06:21:30Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ambadyanands", "id": "32314426"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Cleaned up using [[WP:AutoEd|AutoEd]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|software licensed to preserve user freedoms}}\n{{pp-protected|reason=Persistent [[WP:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]]|expiry=12:45, 24 March 2019|small=yes}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Distinguish|Freeware}}\n{{broader|Free software movement}}\n\n[[File:Desktop-Linux-Mint.png|thumb|300px|Example of a modern free software\noperating system running some representative applications.|Example of\na modern free software operating system running some representative\napplications.

Users cannot study, change, and share their [[source code]].\n* [[freeware]], which is a category of proprietary software that does not require payment for basic use.\n\nFor software under the purview of [[copyright]] to be free, it must carry a [[software license]] whereby the author grants users the aforementioned rights. Software that is not covered by copyright law, such as software in the [[public domain]], is free as long as the source code is in the public domain too, or otherwise available without restrictions.\n\nProprietary software uses restrictive software licences or [[End-user license agreement|EULAs]] and usually does not provide users with the source code. Users are thus legally or technically prevented from [[patch (computing)|changing]] the software, and this results on reliance on the publisher to provide updates, help, and support. (See also [[vendor lock-in]] and [[abandonware]]). Users often may not [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]], modify, or redistribute proprietary software.<ref name=\"Dixon\"/><ref name=\"Graham\"/> Beyond copyright law, contracts and lack of source code; there could be additional shenanigans keeping users from exercising freedom over a piece of software, such as [[software patent]]s and [[digital rights management]] (more specifically, [[tivoization]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2008/spring/the-last-mile-is-always-the-hardest/|title = The Last Mile is Always the Hardest|date = 17 July 2008|accessdate = 29 December 2014|website = [[Free Software Foundation|fsf.org]]|publisher = |last = Sullivan|first = John|authorlink = William John Sullivan|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141028230334/http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2008/spring/the-last-mile-is-always-the-hardest/|archivedate = 28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt must be noted that free software can be a for-profit, commercial activity or not.

Left: free software, right: proprietary software, encircled: [[Freeware|Gratis software]]]]\n\nThe first formal definition of free software was published by FSF in February 1986.<ref name=\"bull6\"/> That definition, written by Richard Stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms.<ref name=\"free-sw\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html|title=Four Freedoms - FSFE|work=fsfe.org}}</ref> The numbering begins with zero, not only as a spoof on the common usage of [[zero-based numbering]] in programming languages, but also because \"Freedom 0\" was not initially included in the list, but later added first in the list as it was considered very important.\n* Freedom 0: The freedom to ''run'' the program for any purpose.\n* Freedom 1: The freedom to ''study'' how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.\n* Freedom 2: The freedom to ''redistribute'' and make copies so you can help your neighbor.\n* Freedom 3: The freedom to ''improve'' the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.\n\nFreedoms 1 and 3 require [[source code]] to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code can range from highly impractical to nearly impossible.\n\nThus, free software means that [[User (computing)|computer users]] have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use. To summarize this into a remark distinguishing ''libre'' (freedom) software from ''[[Gratis versus libre|gratis]]'' (zero price) software, the Free Software Foundation says: \"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in '[[freedom of speech|free speech]]', not as in 'free beer{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"free-sw\"/> See [[Gratis versus libre|''Gratis'' versus ''libre'']].\n\nIn the late 1990s, other groups published their own definitions that describe an almost identical set of software. The most notable are [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] published in 1997,<ref name=\"Perens\"/> and the [[The Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]], published in 1998.\n\nThe [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]-based operating systems, such as [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]], do not have their own formal definitions of free software. Users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see copyleft as restrictive. They generally advocate [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software licenses]], which allow others to use the software as they wish, without being legally ''forced'' to provide the source code. Their view is that this permissive approach is more free. The [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], [[MIT License|X11]], and [[Apache License|Apache]] software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n{{Main article|List of free and open-source software packages}}There are thousands of free applications and many operating systems available on the Internet.

Organizations of users and suppliers, for example, [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]], were formed to facilitate exchange of software. As software was often written in an interpreted language such as [[BASIC]], the [[source code]] was distributed to use these programs. Software was also shared and distributed as printed source code ([[Type-in program]]) in [[computer magazine]]s (like [[Creative Computing]], [[SoftSide]], [[Compute!]], [[Byte magazine|Byte]] etc) and books, like the bestseller ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Ahl/DHAbio.htm\n  | title       = David H.

In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]].<ref name=\"Fisher\"/> While some software might always be free, there would henceforth be a growing amount of software produced primarily for sale. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as only distributing [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer program]]s) to prevent [[User (computing)|computer users]] from being able to study or adapt the software applications as they saw fit. In 1980, [[copyright]] law was extended to computer programs.\n\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], one of the original authors of the popular [[Emacs]] program and a longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], the purpose of which was to produce a completely non-proprietary [[Unix-like|Unix-compatible]] operating system, saying that he had become frustrated with the shift in climate surrounding the computer world and its users. In his initial declaration of the project and its purpose, he specifically cited as a motivation his opposition to being asked to agree to [[non-disclosure agreement]]s and restrictive licenses which prohibited the free sharing of potentially profitable in-development software, a prohibition directly contrary to the traditional [[hacker ethic]]. Software development for the [[GNU|GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. He developed a free software definition and the concept of \"[[copyleft]]\", designed to ensure ''software freedom'' for all.\nSome non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under [[copyleft]] licenses (see the [[OpenCores]] project, for instance). [[Creative Commons]] and the [[free culture movement]] have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.\n\n===1980s: Foundation of the GNU project===\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the GNU project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users.<ref>[[#William02|William 2002]]</ref> Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the [[GNU Manifesto]]. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[The Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]]'' and \"[[copyleft]]\" ideas.\n\n===1990s: Release of the Linux kernel===\nThe [[Linux kernel]], started by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. The first licence was a proprietary software licence. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org }}</ref> Much like Unix, Torvalds' kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers.\n[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as free software when the [[UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.|USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995.

So it's possible for a license to be free and not in the FSF list. The OSI list only lists licenses that have been submitted, considered and approved. All open-source licenses must meet the [[Open Source Definition]] in order to be officially recognized as open source software. Free software on the other hand is a more informal classification that does not rely on official recognition. Nevertheless, software licensed under licenses that do not meet the Free Software Definition cannot rightly be considered free software.\n\nApart from these two organizations, the [[Debian]] project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]. Debian doesn't publish a list of ''approved'' licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives. That is summarized at the Debian web site.<ref name=\"Debian\"/>\n\nIt is rare that a license announced as being in-compliance with the FSF guidelines does not also meet the [[Open Source Definition]], although the reverse is not necessarily true (for example, the [[NASA Open Source Agreement]] is an OSI-approved license, but non-free according to FSF).\n\nThere are different categories of free software.\n* [[Public domain]] software: the copyright has expired, the work was not copyrighted (released without [[copyright notice]] before 1988), or the author has released the software onto the public domain with a [[waiver]] statement (in countries where this is possible). Since public-domain software lacks copyright protection, it may be freely incorporated into any work, whether proprietary or free. The FSF recommends the [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|CC0]] public domain dedication for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0|work=gnu.org|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n* [[permissive free software licence|Permissive licenses]], also called BSD-style because they are applied to much of the software distributed with the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] operating systems: these licenses are also known as [[Free content#Copyfree|copyfree]] as they have no restrictions on distribution.<ref name=\"copyfree\"/> The author retains copyright solely to disclaim warranty and require proper attribution of modified works, and permits redistribution and '''any''' modification, even closed-source ones. In this sense, a permissive license provides an incentive to create non-free software, by reducing the cost of developing restricted software. Since this is incompatible with the spirit of software freedom, many people consider permissive licenses to be less free than copyleft licenses.\n* [[Copyleft]] licenses, with the [[GNU General Public License]] being the most prominent: the author retains copyright and permits redistribution under the restriction that all such redistribution is licensed under the same license. Additions and modifications by others must also be licensed under the same \"copyleft\" license whenever they are distributed with part of the original licensed product. This is also known as a [[viral license|''viral'']], ''[[protective license|protective]]'', or ''reciprocal'' license. Due to the restriction on distribution not everyone considers this type of license to be free.<!-- this last one 404ed at the original source so a quoted copy works --><ref name=\"charvolant\"/><ref name=\"sunsetbrew\"/>\n\n== Security and reliability ==\n[[File:ClamTK3.08.jpg|thumb|230x230px|Although nearly all [[computer viruses]] only affect [[Microsoft Windows]],<ref name=\"mookhey-2005\">{{cite book |authors=Mookhey, K.K.; Burghate, Nilesh\n|title=Linux: Security, Audit and Control Features |publisher=ISACA|year=2005|isbn=9781893209787|page=128\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kD0sxQ0EkIC&pg=PA128}}</ref><ref name=\"toxen-2003\">{{Cite book|author=Toxen, Bob|title=Real World Linux Security: Intrusion Prevention, Detection, and Recovery|publisher=Prentice Hall Professional |year=2003 |isbn=9780130464569 |page=365 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-1jwRwNaEoC&pg=PA365}}</ref><ref name=\"noyes-2010\">{{cite news |author=Noyes, Katherine |title=Why Linux Is More Secure Than Windows |work=PCWorld |date=Aug 3, 2010 |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/202452/why_linux_is_more_secure_than_windows.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901151841/http://www.pcworld.com/article/202452/why_linux_is_more_secure_than_windows.html |archivedate=2013-09-01 |df= }}</ref> [[antivirus software]] such as  [[ClamAV]] (shown here) is still provided for GNU/Linux and other Unix-based systems, so that users can detect [[malware]] that might infect Windows hosts.]]\nThere is debate over the [[Computer security|security]] of free software in comparison to proprietary software, with a major issue being [[security through obscurity]]. A popular quantitative test in computer security is to use relative counting of known unpatched security flaws. Generally, users of this method advise avoiding products that lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.\n\nFree software advocates strongly believe that this methodology is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software systems, since their source code is accessible and their community is more forthcoming about what problems exist,<ref name=\"cnet\" /> (This is called \"Security Through Disclosure\"<ref name=\"albion\" />) and proprietary software systems can have undisclosed societal drawbacks, such as disenfranchising less fortunate would-be users of free programs. As users can analyse and trace the source code, many more people with no commercial constraints can inspect the code and find bugs and loopholes than a corporation would find practicable. According to Richard Stallman, user access to the source code makes deploying free software with undesirable hidden [[spyware]] functionality far more difficult than for proprietary software.<ref name=\"rms-fs-2006-03-09\" />\n\nSome quantitative studies have been done on the subject.<ref name=\"Wheeler\" /><ref name=\"Delio\" /><ref name=\"fuzz-revisited\" /><ref name=\"fuzz-macos\" />\n\n===Binary blobs and other proprietary software===\nIn 2006, [[OpenBSD]] started the first campaign against the use of [[binary blob]]s in [[Kernel (computing)|kernels]]. Blobs are usually freely distributable [[device driver]]s for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers. This restricts the users' freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions. Also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have [[Software bug|bugs]], they pose a security risk to any [[operating system]] whose kernel includes them. The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.\n\nThe issue of binary blobs in the [[Linux kernel]] and other device drivers motivated some developers in Ireland to launch [[gNewSense]], a Linux based distribution with all the binary blobs removed. The project received support from the [[Free Software Foundation]] and stimulated the creation, headed by the [[Free Software Foundation Latin America]], of the [[Linux-libre]] kernel.<ref name=\"FreeGNULinuxDistributions\" /> As of October 2012, [[Trisquel]] is the most popular FSF endorsed Linux distribution ranked by Distrowatch (over 12 months).<ref name=\"DW02\" /> While [[Debian]] is not endorsed by the FSF and does not use Linux-libre, it is also a popular distribution available without kernel blobs by default since 2011.<ref name=\"FreeGNULinuxDistributions\" />\n\n== Business model ==\n\n{{see also|Business models for open-source software}}\n\n[[Commercial software|Selling software]] under any free software licence is permissible, as is commercial use. This is true for licenses with or without [[copyleft]].<ref name=\"Popp2\"/><ref name=\"linfo\"/><ref name=\"bsdl-gpl\"/>\n\nSince free software may be freely redistributed, it is generally available at little or no fee. Free software business models are usually based on adding value such as customization, accompanying hardware, support, training, integration, or certification.<ref name=\"Popp2\"/> Exceptions exist however, where the user is charged to obtain a copy of the free application itself.<ref name=\"paid-and-libre\">{{Cite web |url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2016-02/msg00227.html |title=[libreplanet-discuss] Is there any software that is libre but not gratis}}</ref>\n\nFees are usually charged for distribution on compact discs and bootable USB drives, or for services of installing or maintaining the operation of free software. Development of large, commercially used free software is often funded by a combination of user donations, [[crowdfunding]], corporate contributions, and tax money. The [[SELinux]] project at the United States [[National Security Agency]] is an example of a federally funded free software project.\n\nProprietary software on the other hand tends to use a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary application pays a fee for a license to legally access and use it. This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves. Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee. Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.<ref name=\"Dornan\"/>\n\nThe Free Software Foundation encourages selling free software. As the Foundation has written, \"distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development. Don't waste it!\".<ref name=\"selling\"/> For example, the FSF's own recommended license (the [[GNU GPL]]) states that \"[you] may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\"<ref name=\"GPLsection4\"/>\n\nMicrosoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] stated in 2001 that \"open source is not available to commercial companies. The way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source.\"<ref name=\"suntimes\"/> This misunderstanding is based on a requirement of [[copyleft]] licenses (like the GPL) that if one distributes modified versions of software, they must release the source and use the same license. This requirement does not extend to other software from the same developer. The claim of incompatibility between commercial companies and Free Software is also a misunderstanding. There are several large companies, e.g. [[Red Hat]] and [[IBM]], which do substantial commercial business in the development of Free Software.\n\n== {{anchor|Adoption}} Economical aspects and adoption ==\n\n{{main article|Free and open-source software#Adoption}}\n{{See also|Linux adoption|Open-source software#Adoption}}\n\n{{Infobox\n| decat   = yes\n| above   = Free Software runs the world\n| image   = [[File:Titan supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.jpg|250px]]\n| caption = Of the [[TOP500|world's five hundred]] fastest [[supercomputer]]s, 494 (98.8%) use the Linux kernel.<ref name=top500stats>{{cite web|title=Top500 - List Statistics - November 2015|url=http://www.top500.org/statistics/list/\n|website=Top500.org\n|accessdate=29 May 2016}}.</ref> The world's second fastest computer is the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]'s [[Titan (supercomputer)|Titan supercomputer]] (illustrated), which uses the [[Cray Linux Environment]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Roadrunner - BladeCenter QS22/LS21 Cluster, PowerXCell 8i 3.2 GHz / Opteron DC 1.8 GHz, Voltaire Infiniband |url=http://www.top500.org/system/177975 |website=Top500.org\n|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nFree software played a significant part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web and the infrastructure of [[dot-com companies]].<ref name=\"Web Server Survey\" /><ref name=\"Apache Strategy\" /> Free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a [[pure public good]] rather than a [[private good]].

Free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone. However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage. Such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.\n\nA report by [[Standish Group]] estimates that adoption of free software has caused a drop in revenue to the [[proprietary software]] industry by about $60 billion per year.<ref name=\"standishgroup\" /> In spite of this, [[Eric S.

Although drawing on traditions and philosophies among members of the 1970s [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker culture]] and academia, [[Richard Stallman]] formally founded the movement in 1983 by launching the [[GNU Project]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Announcement of the GNU project\n|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html\n}}</ref> Stallman later established the [[Free Software Foundation]] in 1985 to support the movement.\n\n== Philosophy ==\nThe philosophy of the movement is that the use of computers should not lead to people being prevented from cooperating with each other.  In practice, this means rejecting \"[[List of proprietary software for Linux|proprietary software]]\", which imposes such restrictions, and promoting [[free software]],<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Use Free Software\n|publisher=gnu.org\n|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/use-free-software.html\n}}</ref> with the ultimate goal of liberating everyone in cyberspace<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Stallman interviewed by Sean Daly\n|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060625001523547\n|publisher=Groklaw\n|date=2006-06-23\n}}</ref> \u2013 that is, every computer user. Stallman notes that this action will promote rather than hinder the progression of technology, since \"it means that much wasteful duplication of system programming effort will be avoided. This effort can go instead into advancing the state of the art\".<ref name=\"The GNU Manifesto\">{{cite web\n|title=The GNU Manifesto\n|publisher=gnu.org\n|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html\n}}</ref>\n\nMembers of the free software movement believe that all users of software should have the freedoms listed in [[The Free Software Definition]].

If it is assumed that social change is not only affected, but in some points of view, directed by the advancement of technology, is it ethical to hold these technologies from certain people? If not to make a direct change, this movement is in place to raise awareness about the effects that take place because of the physical things around us. A computer, for instance, allows us so many more freedoms than we have without a computer, but should these technological mediums be implied freedoms, or selective privileges? The debate over the morality of both sides to the free software movement is a difficult topic to compromise respective opposition.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=The Effect of Computerization Movements Upon Organizational Adoption of Open Source\n|publisher=San Jose State University\n|url=http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/opensource/research/westdedrick_si_2005.pdf\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117193051/http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/OpenSource/Research/WestDedrick_SI_2005.pdf\n|dead-url=yes\n|archive-date=2006-01-17\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Free Software Foundation also believes all software needs [[GNU Free Documentation License|free documentation]], in particular because conscientious programmers should be able to update manuals to reflect modification that they made to the software, but deems the freedom to modify less important for other types of written works.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Free Software and Free Manuals\n|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html\n|publisher=gnu.org\n}}</ref> Within the free software movement, the [[FLOSS Manuals]] foundation specialises on the goal of providing such documentation.

Elliot, a researcher in the Institute for Software at the University of California Irvine, not only outlines many benefits that could come from a free software movement, she claims that it is inherently necessary to give every person equal opportunity to utilize the Internet, assuming that the computer is globally accessible. Since the world has become more based in the framework of technology and its advancement, creating a selective internet that allows only some to surf the web freely is nonsensical according to Elliot. If there is a desire to live in a more coexistent world that is benefited by communication and global assistance, then globally free software should be a position to strive for, according to many scholars who promote awareness about the free software movement.

Some users believe that a compromise term encompassing both aspects is ideal, to promote both the user's freedom with the software and also to promote the perceived superiority of an open-source-development model. This eclectic view is reinforced by the fact that the overwhelming majority of [[List of OSI approved software licences|OSI-approved licenses]] and self-avowed open-source programs are also compatible with the free software formalisms and vice versa.<ref name=\"OSS misses the point\" />\n\nWhile some people prefer to link the two ideas of \"open-source software\" and \"free software\" together, they offer two separate ideas and values. This ambiguity began in 1998 when people started to use the term \"open-source software\" rather than \"free software\". People in the community of free software used these separate terms as a way to differentiate what they did. Richard Stallman has called open source \"''a non-movement''\", because it \"''does not campaign for anything''\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/04/28/gnu-founder-stallman-open-source-is-not-free-software/|title=GNU founder Stallman: 'Open source is not free software' - SiliconANGLE|last=Gillin|first=Paul|date=2016-04-28|work=SiliconANGLE|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> Open source addresses software being open as a practical question as opposed to an ethical dilemma. In other words, it focuses more on the development.

It is argued that whatever economical or technical merits free software may have, those are byproducts stemming from the rights that free software developers and users must enjoy.

The loan adjective [[Gratis vs Libre|''libre'']] has gained some traction in the English-speaking free software movement as unequivocally conveying the state of being in freedom that free software refers to. This is not considered schismatic; ''libre'' is seen as an alternative explanatory device.

The open-source movement denies that selectivity and the privatization of software is unethical. Although the open-source movement is working towards the same social benefits as the free software movement, Kelty claims that by disregarding this fundamental belief of the free software advocates, one is destroying the overall argument. If it can be claimed that it is ethical to limit the internet and other technology to only users who have the means to use this software, then there is no argument against the way things are at the moment; there is no need to complain if all morality is in effect.<ref>{{cite book\n|publisher=anthropology of media\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=IbycR6djcEEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA281&dq=free+software+movement&ots=MP7ORZCGuh&%7Csig=c2kggN8Sg75Qs2lxCoQtf-Xn7jo#v=onepage&q=free%20software%20movement&f=false\n|title=theorizing media and practice\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the movements have separate values and goals, people in both the open-source community and free software community collaborate when it comes to practical projects.<ref>{{cite web\n|publisher=gnu.org\n|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html\n|title=Why \"Free Software\" is better than \"Open Source\"\n}}</ref> By 2005, Richard Glass considered the differences to be a \"serious fracture\" but \"vitally important to those on both sides of the fracture\" and \"of little importance to anyone else studying the movement from a software engineering perspective\" since they have had \"little effect on the field\".<ref>{{Citation\n | author = Richard Glass\n | chapter = Standing in Front of the Open Source Steamroller\n | title = Perspectives on Free and Open Source Software\n |editor1=Joseph Feller |editor2=Brian Fitzgerald |editor3=Scott A.

Many of these plant species have several distinct [[cultivar]]s.<ref>McGee, 253.</ref>\n\n[[Seed]]s of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as [[Omega-3|omega fats]]. In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. Edible seeds include cereals ([[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[et cetera]]), [[legume]]s ([[bean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, et cetera), and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. [[Oilseed]]s are often pressed to produce rich oils - [[sunflower]], [[flaxseed]], [[rapeseed]] (including [[canola oil]]), [[sesame]], [[et cetera]].<ref name=McGee9>McGee, Chapter 9.</ref>\n\nSeeds are typically high in [[unsaturated fat]]s and, in moderation, are considered a [[health food]]. However, not all seeds are edible.

Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some botanical fruits, such as [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[eggplant]]s, are eaten as vegetables.<ref>McGee, Chapter 7.</ref> (For more information, see [[list of fruits]].)\n\n[[Vegetable]]s are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food.

Artificial sweeteners such as [[sucralose]] are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include [[raw sugar]], which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.\n\nThe [[stevia]] plant contains a compound known as [[steviol]] which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.<ref><!--note-->The [[sweetness]] multiplier \"300 times\" comes from [http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&type=6&root=3&parent=3&cat=30 subjective evaluations by a panel of test subjects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123124043/http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&type=6&root=3&parent=3&cat=30 |date=January 23, 2009 }} tasting various dilutions compared to a standard dilution of [[sucrose]].

Sour foods include [[citrus]], specifically [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and to a lesser degree [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]].

It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including [[sea salt]], [[fleur de sel]], [[kosher salt]], mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate [[electrolyte]] balance, which is the [[kidney]]'s function. Salt may be iodized, meaning [[iodine]] has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes [[thyroid]] function. Some canned foods, notably [[soup]]s or packaged [[broth]]s, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion.

According to Goode, Curtis and Theophano, food \"is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shugart|first=Helene A.|year=2008|title=Sumptuous Texts: Consuming \"Otherness\" in the Food Film Genre|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume=25 |issue=1|pages=68\u201390|doi=10.1080/15295030701849928}}</ref>\n\nMany cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of [[cooking]] traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as [[gastronomy]]. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.\n\nSome popular types of ethnic foods include [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[African cuisine|African]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese]]. Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food [[Habit (psychology)|habits]]. While [[evolution]]arily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are [[omnivore]]s, religion and social constructs such as [[morality]], [[activism]], or [[environmentalism]] will often affect which foods they will consume. Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of [[taste]], the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.\n\n===Presentation===\n[[File:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|thumb|left|A [[France|French]] basil salmon [[terrine (food)|terrine]], with eye-appealing [[Garnish (food)|garnishes]]]]\n{{Main|Food presentation}}\nAesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people \"eat with their eyes\".

Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding [[granola]] to [[yogurt]], adding [[crouton]]s to a [[salad]] or [[soup]], and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=aJBIbvClWfcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Food+texture#v=onepage&q=&f=false | title = Food Texture: Measurement and Perception | isbn = 978-0-8342-1238-1 | author1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Andrew J | date = 1999-02-28}}</ref>\n\n===Contrast in taste===\nAnother universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. For example, such opposite flavors as [[sweetness]] and [[saltiness]] tend to go well together, as in [[kettle corn]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].\n\n===Food preparation===\n{{Main|Outline of food preparation}}\nWhile many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, [[palatability]], [[Mouthfeel|texture]], or [[flavor]]. At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, [[pressure cooking]], fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a [[kitchen]]. Some preparation is done to enhance the [[taste]] or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to [[Food preservation|preserve]] the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A [[meal]] is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.<ref>Mead, 11\u201319</ref>\n[[File:LG refrigerator interior.jpg|thumb|A refrigerator helps to keep foods fresh.]]\n\n====Animal preparation====\nThe preparation of animal-based food usually involves [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughter]], [[evisceration (organ removal)|evisceration]], hanging, portioning, and [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering]]. In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in [[slaughterhouses]], which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the [[United States]] has established the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as [[kosher]], [[shechita]], and [[dhab\u012b\u1e25ah]] halal. Strict interpretations of [[kashrut]] require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut.<ref>McGee, 142\u2013143.</ref>\n\nOn the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. In addition, fish and [[seafood]] may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger. However, fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality.<ref>McGee, 202\u2013206</ref>\n\n====Cooking====\n[[File:Wok cooking and the heat source by The Pocket in Nanjing.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Cooking with a [[wok]] in [[China]]]]\n{{Main|Cooking}}\n\nThe term \"cooking\" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. Cooking technique, known as [[culinary art]], generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual cook.<ref>McGee Chapter 14.</ref> The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it.<ref name=\"silhnc\">Mead, 11\u201319.</ref>\n\nCooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, [[Mouthfeel|texture]], appearance, and nutritional properties.<ref>McGee</ref> Cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at ''[[Homo erectus]]'' campsites dating from 420,000 years ago.<ref>Campbell, 312.</ref> Boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of [[pottery]].<ref>McGee, 784.</ref>\n\n=====Cooking equipment=====\n[[File:Pfanne (Edelstahl).jpg|thumb|A [[stainless steel]] [[frying pan]]]]\n[[File:TraditionalAsado.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[asado]] (barbecue)]]\n{{Main|Cookware and bakeware}}\n\nThere are many different types of equipment used for cooking.\n\n[[Oven]]s are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to {{convert|500|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a [[tandoor]] oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature.<ref>Davidson, 782\u2013783</ref> Western kitchens use variable temperature [[convection oven]]s, conventional ovens, [[toaster oven]]s, or non-radiant heat ovens like the [[microwave oven]]. Classic Italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, [[natural gas|gas]], electric, or oil-fired.<ref>McGee, 539,784.</ref>\n\nVarious types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a [[saut\u00e9 pan]], sauce pot, [[frying pan]], or [[pressure cooker]]. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as [[steam]]ing, [[simmer]]ing, [[boiling]], and [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]] for moist methods, while the dry methods include [[saut\u00e9]]ing, [[pan fry]]ing, and [[deep-fry]]ing.<ref>McGee, 771\u2013791</ref>\n\nIn addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A [[Grill (cooking)|grill]] operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking.<ref>Davidson, 356.</ref> A [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] style of barbecue is called [[barbacoa]], which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In [[Argentina]], an [[asado]] (Spanish for \"grilled\") is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.<ref>Asado Argentina</ref>\n\n====Raw food preparation{{anchor|Raw Food Preparation}}====\n[[File:2007feb-sushi-odaiba-manytypes.jpg|thumb|left|Many types of [[fish]] ready to be eaten, including [[salmon]] and [[tuna]]]]\n\nCertain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in a [[Raw foodism|raw state]]. [[Salad]]s consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines. [[Sashimi]] in [[Japanese cuisine]] consists of raw sliced [[fish]] or other meat, and [[sushi]] often incorporates raw fish or seafood. [[Steak tartare]] and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon, mixed with various ingredients and served with [[baguette]]s, [[brioche]], or [[frites]].<ref>Davidson, 786\u2013787.</ref> In Italy, [[carpaccio]] is a dish of very thinly sliced raw [[beef]], drizzled with a [[vinaigrette]] made with olive oil.<ref>Robuchon, 224.</ref> The health food movement known as [[raw foodism]] promotes a mostly [[vegan]] diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above {{convert|118|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}}.<ref>Davidson, 656</ref> An example of a raw meat dish is [[ceviche]], a Latin American dish made with raw meat that is \"cooked\" from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Restaurants===\n[[File:Inside_Le_Procope.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caf\u00e9 Procope]] in Paris was founded in 1686]]\n[[File:Allyn House restaurant menu (March 5, 1859).jpg|thumb|The Allyn House restaurant menu (March 5, 1859)]]\n{{Main|Restaurant}}\n\nRestaurants employ [[chef]]s to prepare the food, and [[waiting staff|waiters]] to serve customers at the table.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/restaurant|work=collinsdictionary.com|title=Definition of 'restaurant'}}</ref> The term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative [[broth|meat broth]]; this broth (or bouillon) was served in elegant outlets in Paris from the mid 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/restaurant|work=etymonline.com|title=restaurant (n.)}}</ref><ref name=history/> These refined \"restaurants\" were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns,<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/menus/history-restaurant|work=digital.library.unlv.edu|title=The History of the Restaurant}}</ref> and some had developed from early [[Parisian caf\u00e9]]s, such as [[Caf\u00e9 Procope]], by first serving bouillon, then adding other cooked food to their menus.<ref>Davidson, 660\u2013661.</ref>  \n\nCommercial eateries existed during the [[Roman period]], with evidence of 150 \"thermopolia\", a form of fast food restaurant, found in [[Pompeii]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/pompeii/9850077/Pompeii-exhibition-the-food-and-drink-of-the-ancient-Roman-cities.html|work=telegraph.co.uk|title=Pompeii exhibition: the food and drink of the ancient Roman cities|author=Bee Wilson|date=3 Mar 2013}}</ref> and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in [[China]] during the [[Song dynasty]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion on out-of-home [[dining]].

This can be as simple as a [[butcher]] preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international [[food industry]]. Early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. This mainly involved [[salting (food)|salting]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], curdling, [[drying (food)|drying]], [[pickling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], and [[smoking (food)|smoking]].<ref>Aguilera, 1\u20133.</ref> Food manufacturing arose during the [[industrial revolution]] in the 19th century.<ref>Miguel, 3.</ref> This development took advantage of new [[Mass-marketing|mass markets]] and emerging technology, such as [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], preservation, [[packaging]] and [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]], and transportation. It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants.<ref name=Jango>Jango-Cohen</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food [[brand]]s. There also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies.<ref>Hannaford</ref> Advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture. Computer-based control systems, sophisticated [[Food processing|processing]] and packaging methods, and [[logistics]] and [[food distribution|distribution]] advances can enhance product quality, improve [[food safety]], and reduce costs.<ref name=Jango/>\n\n==Commercial trade==\n[[File:Seawifs global biosphere 2002.png|thumb|[[SeaWiFS]] image for the global biosphere]]\n[[File:Food consumption.gif|thumb|Global average daily [[calorie]] consumption in 1995]]\n[[File:2005food import.png|thumb|right|Food [[import]]s in 2005]]\n[[File:Population density countries 2017 world map, people per sq km.svg|thumb|[[Population density]] by country]]\n\n===International food imports and exports===\n{{see also|Population density}}\nThe [[World Bank]] reported that the European Union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the USA and Japan. [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s need for food was especially well illustrated in [[World War II]].  Despite the implementation of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], Britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nFood is traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season.<ref>The Economic Research Service of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]</ref> Between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports.<ref>Regmi</ref> Some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports.<ref>[[CIA World Factbook]]</ref>\n\nIn 1994, over 100 countries became signatories to the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in a dramatic increase in [[trade liberalization]]. This included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers, underpinned by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] enforcement of [[Agricultural policy|agricultural subsidy]], [[Tax, tariff and trade|tariffs]], import [[Quota Share|quotas]], and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved.<ref>World Trade Organization, The Uruguay Round</ref> Where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety, the WTO refer the dispute to the [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission, which was founded in 1962 by the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and the World Health Organization. Trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade.<ref>Van den Bossche</ref>\n\n===Marketing and retailing===\n[[File:Fredmeyer edit 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Packaged food aisles of supermarket in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States|United States of America]]]]\n{{main|Food marketing}}\n[[Food marketing]] brings together the producer and the consumer. The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one [[canning|can]] of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans.<ref>Smith, 501\u20133.</ref> The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.\n\nIn the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to [[grocer]]s for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers.<ref name=\"silhnc\"/><ref name=Jango/> With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.<ref name=\"silhnc\"/><ref>Benson</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, [[supermarket]]s were born. Supermarkets brought with them a [[self service]] approach to shopping using [[shopping cart]]s, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through [[economies of scale]] and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.<ref>Humphery</ref>\n\nUnlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large [[Corporation|companies]] control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to [[advertising]], transportation, and intermediate corporations.<ref>Magdoff, Fred (Ed.) \"[T]he farmer's share of the food dollar (after paying for input costs) has steadily declined from about 40 percent in 1910 to less than 10 percent in 1990.\"</ref>\n\n===Prices===\n[[File:GrainProducts.jpg|thumb|right|Some essential food products including [[bread]], [[rice]] and [[pasta]]]]\n{{See also||Food vs. fuel}}\n\n[[File:Annual real food price indices.svg|thumb|Food, meat, dairy, cereals, vegetable oil, and sugar price indices, deflated using the World Bank Manufactures Unit Value Index (MUV)<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual real food price indices|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/worldfood/Reports_and_docs/Food_price_indices_data.xls|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401183726/http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/worldfood/Reports_and_docs/Food_price_indices_data.xls|archivedate=1 April 2014|df=}}</ref>]]\nIt is rare for price spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once, but [[food prices]] suffered all-time peaks in 2008 and 2011, posting a 15% and 12% deflated increase year-over-year, representing prices higher than any data collected.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAO food prices index|url=http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/|website=FAO.org|accessdate=25 Feb 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224070948/http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/|archivedate=25 Feb 2018|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls.

Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities.

According to [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following [[George W Bush]]'s [[Commodities Futures Modernization Act]] of 2000.<ref name=\"Ind\"/> De Schutter told the Independent in March 2012: \"What we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing \u2013 they never actually buy the ton of wheat or [[maize]]; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. The result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic. This explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding, because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand.\"<ref name=\"Ind\"/> In 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the [[G20]] to regulate the commodities market more.<ref name=\"Ind\"/>\n\nSome experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors, such as [[climate change]], competition with [[bio-fuels]] and overall rising demand.<ref name=\"Ind\"/> However, some such as [[Jayati Ghosh]], professor of economics at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in [[New Delhi]], have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues: Ghosh points to world wheat prices, which doubled in the period from June to December 2010, despite there being no fall in global supply.<ref name=\"Ind\"/>\n\n==Famine and hunger==\nFood deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately [[starvation]]. This is often connected with [[famine]], which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. [[Rationing]] is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.<ref name=\"Messer\"/>\n\nStarvation is a significant international problem. Approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes.<ref>[[World Health Organization]]</ref> Food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and is measured using [[famine scales]].<ref>Howe, 353\u2013372</ref>\n\n===Food aid===\n{{main|Food aid}}\n[[Food aid]] can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food. It can be used to improve peoples' lives in the short term, so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required.<ref>World Food Programme</ref> Conversely, badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets, depressing crop prices, and discouraging food production. Sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop.<ref>Shah</ref> Its provision, or threatened withdrawal, is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country, a strategy known as [[food politics]]. Sometimes, food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers, and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries.<ref>Kripke</ref> International efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the [[World Food Programme]].<ref>United Nations World Food program</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n{{Main|Food safety}}\n[[File:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salmonella]] bacteria is a common cause of foodborne illness, particularly in undercooked [[chicken]] and [[chicken egg]]s.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HACCP Seven Principles.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ([[HACCP]]) Flowchart]] -->\n\n[[Foodborne illness]], commonly called \"food poisoning\", is caused by [[bacteria]], [[toxin]]s, [[virus]]es, [[parasite]]s, and [[prion]]s. Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version.<ref name=MedlinePlus>[[National Institute of Health]], MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia</ref> The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as \"foreign bodies\") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>\n\n[[Food poisoning]] has been recognized as a disease since as early as Hippocrates.<ref>[[Hippocrates]], [[s:On acute diseases|On Acute Diseases]].</ref> The sale of [[Rancidity|rancid]], contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of [[hygiene]], refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other [[microbiological]] studies by scientists such as [[Louis Pasteur]], contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. This was further underpinned by the work of [[Justus von Liebig]], which led to the development of modern [[food storage]] and [[food preservation]] methods.<ref>Magner, 243\u2013498</ref> In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] ([[HACCP]]), which can identify and eliminate many risks.<ref>USDA</ref>\n\nRecommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html|title=Check Your Steps|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521002552/http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html|archivedate=21 May 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\nFoods that spoil easily, such as [[meats]], [[dairy]], and [[seafood]], must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' or ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040519004032/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archivedate=2004-05-19|title=Fact sheets - Poultry Preparation - Focus on Chicken}}</ref>\n\n===Allergies===\n{{Main|Food allergy}}\nSome people have [[allergies]] or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's [[immune system]] mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy.<ref name=allergy>[[National Institute of Health]]</ref> The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are [[gluten]], [[maize|corn]], [[shellfish]] (mollusks), [[peanut]]s, and [[soy]].<ref name=allergy/> Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as [[diarrhea]], [[rash]]es, bloating, [[vomiting]], and [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the [[allergen]].<ref name=allergy/>\n\nRarely, food allergies can lead to a [[medical emergency]], such as [[anaphylactic shock]], [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although [[latex]] products can induce similar reactions.<ref name=allergy/> Initial treatment is with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an [[Epi-pen]] or [[Twinject]].<ref>[http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx About Epipen], Epipen.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106164129/http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx |date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.twinject.com/ About Twinject], Twinject.com</ref>\n\n===Other health issues===\nHuman diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of [[Diet and cancer|cancers]] in a human epidemiological analysis by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Richard Peto]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Doll | first1 = R. | last2 = Peto | first2 = R. | title = The causes of cancer: Quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 1191\u20131308 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7017215 | doi=10.1093/jnci/66.6.1192}}</ref>  These cancer may be caused by [[carcinogen]]s that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. Food contaminated with fungal growth may contain [[mycotoxin]]s such as [[aflatoxins]] which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts.  Other carcinogens identified in food include [[heterocyclic amine]]s generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, [[polyaromatic hydrocarbon]]s in charred meat and smoked fish, and [[nitrosamine]]s generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in [[cured meat]] such as [[bacon]].<ref name=\"carcinogens and anticarcinogens\"/>\n\n[[Anticarcinogen]]s that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruit and vegetables. [[Antioxidant]]s are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. It is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.<ref name=\"carcinogens and anticarcinogens\">{{cite book |title=Carcinogens and Anticarcinogens in the Human Diet |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-309-05391-9 }}</ref>\nThere are many international certifications in cooking field, such as [[Monde Selection]]\u3001A.A.Certification\u3001iTQi. They use the high quality evaluation methods to make the food become more safe.\n\n==Diet==\n[[File:FAO kcal his.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Changes of food supply (by energy)<ref>FAO [http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/FB/FB/E FAOSTAT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235055/http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/FB/FB/E |date=2013-12-02 }}</ref><ref>These are supplied energy, intake energy are about 60-80% of supply.</ref><br>Other area (Yr 2010)<ref>FAO [http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/x3936e/x3936e03.htm Food Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031073459/http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/x3936e/x3936e03.htm |date=2013-10-31 }}</ref>\n* Africa, sub-Sahara - 2170 kcal/capita/day\n* N.E. and N.

Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. For example, only [[Kosher|kosher foods]] are permitted by [[Judaism]], [[halal]] foods by [[Islam]], and in [[Hinduism]] [[beef]] is restricted.<ref>Simoons</ref> In addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. This is highly related to a culture's [[cuisine]].\n\n===Diet deficiencies===\n{{Main|Avitaminosis}}\nDietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans. Imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of [[adipose]] tissue, known as body fat.<ref>Nicklas</ref> Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health. For instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, [[iodine deficiency]].<ref>Merson, 245</ref> It is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to [[vitamin A]] deficiency.<ref>Merson, 231.</ref> [[Vitamin C]] deficiency results in [[scurvy]].<ref>Merson, 464.</ref> [[Calcium]], [[Vitamin D]], and [[phosphorus]] are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others. [[Kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]] are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein.<ref>Merson, 224.</ref>\n\n===Moral, ethical, and health-conscious diets===\nMany individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality, or other habit. For instance, [[vegetarian]]s choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Others choose a [[Healthy diet|healthier diet]], avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and [[antioxidant]]s.<ref>Carpenter</ref> [[Obesity]], a serious problem in the western world, leads to higher chances of developing [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], cancer and many other diseases.<ref>Merson, 266\u2013268.</ref> More recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from [[genetically modified food]].<ref>Parekh, 187\u2013206.</ref> Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming ([[Cereal|grains]]) on [[animal welfare]], human health, and the [[Ecology|environment]] are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. This has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food]].<ref>Schor</ref>\n\n==Nutrition and dietary problems==\n[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|[[MyPlate]] replaced [[MyPyramid]] as the [[USDA]] nutrition guide.]]\nBetween the extremes of optimal health and death from [[starvation]] or [[malnutrition]], there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as [[scurvy]], [[obesity]], or [[osteoporosis]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular diseases]] as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.\n\nNutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] and [[vitamins]]. Additionally, food contains water and [[dietary fiber]].\n\nAs previously discussed, the body is designed by [[natural selection]] to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]]. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with [[biotechnology|advanced technology]], enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes [[obesity]] in adults and children alike.\n\n==Legal definition==\nSome countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word ''foodstuff''. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by [[human]]s. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, [[chewing gum]], water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include [[Pet food|animal feed]], live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, [[cosmetics]], [[tobacco]] and tobacco products, [[narcotic]] or [[psychotropic substance]]s, and residues and contaminants.<ref>[[United Kingdom]] [[Office of Public Sector Information]]</ref>\n\n==Types of food==\n{{prose|section|date=October 2018}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Comfort food]]\n* [[Fast food]]\n* [[Junk food]]\n* [[Natural food]]\n* [[Organic food]]\n* [[Slow food]]\n* [[Whole food]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Too many see alsos|date=October 2018}}\n{{Portal|Food|Drink|Agriculture and Agronomy}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bulk foods]]\n* [[Drink|Beverages]]\n* ''[[Food and Bioprocess Technology]]''\n* [[:Category:Lists of foods]]\n* [[Food engineering]]\n* ''[[Food Inc.]]'', a 2009 documentary\n* [[Food science]]\n* [[Food security]]\n* [[Future food technology]]\n* [[List of foods]]\n* [[Lists of prepared foods]]\n* [[Non-food crop]]\n* [[Nutrition facts label]]\n* [[Optimal foraging theory]]\n* [[Outline of cooking]]\n* [[Outline of nutrition]]\n* [[Packaging and labeling]]\n* [[Traditional food]]\n* [[Urban farming]]\n* [[Food Justice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\nSources:\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Aguilera, Jose Miguel and David W.

These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players' players in actual games.  This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager.  These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a \"league commissioner\" who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport.  In fantasy sports, team owners draft, trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.\n\nSimulation games such as [[Strat-O-Matic]] are not considered fantasy sport, because they are not scored using real results of actual sporting events.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe concept of picking players and running a contest based on their year-to-date stats has been around since shortly after [[World War II]]. One of the earliest published accounts of fantasy sports involved [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] businessman and one time [[Oakland Raiders]] limited partner Wilfred \"Bill\" Winkenbach.  He devised [[fantasy golf]] in the latter part of the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/wink-wilfred-bill-winkenbach-invented-fantasy-football-way-back-in-1962-with-gopppl-in-oakland|title='Wink': Wilfred 'Bill' Winkenbach invented Fantasy Football way back in 1962 with GOPPPL in Oakland|publisher=newsnet5.com|date=2014-09-11|accessdate=2015-09-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929163914/http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/wink-wilfred-bill-winkenbach-invented-fantasy-football-way-back-in-1962-with-gopppl-in-oakland|archivedate=2015-09-29|df=}}</ref>  Each player selected a team of professional golfers and the person with the lowest combined total of strokes at the end of the tournament would win.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Golf is a simple fantasy game to administer and keep tabs on, since each participant is concerned only with the scores of his or her team members without anything else to complicate it. However, it was never organized into a widespread hobby or formal business.\n\nIn Oakland in 1962, Winkenbach formed the first reported [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] league, called the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League (GOPPPL), with eight teams.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jon | last=Saraceno | coauthors= | title=As fantasy football fever continues to spread, it's not all geeks to me | date=2006-08-17 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/saraceno/2006-08-17-saraceno-fantasy-football_x.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}</ref> [[George Blanda]] was the first player taken in the first draft in 1963.\n[http://www.nflplayers.com/fantasy/gopppl_draft.htm 1963 draft results]\n\nThe first reported [[fantasy baseball]] league began in Boston in 1960. [[Harvard University]] [[sociologist]] [[William A. Gamson|William Gamson]] started the \"Baseball Seminar\" where colleagues would form rosters that earned points on the players' final standings in batting average, [[Run batted in|RBI]], [[Earned run average|ERA]] and wins.<ref name=\"The Numbers Game p. 175\">[[Alan Schwarz]]: ''The Numbers Game : Baseball's Lifelong Fascination with Statistics'' [[Thomas Dunne Books]] p. 175, {{ISBN|0-312-32222-4}}</ref> Gamson later brought the idea with him to the [[University of Michigan]] where some professors played the game. One professor playing the game was Bob Sklar, who taught an American Studies seminar which included [[Daniel Okrent]], who learned of the game his professor played.<ref name=\"The Numbers Game p. 175\"/> At around the same time a league from [[Rowan University|Glassboro State College]] also formed a similar baseball league and had its first draft in 1976.<ref>{{cite news\n |first=Ed \n |last=Hilt \n |coauthors= \n |title=Fantasy baseball league owners still bonding in their 32nd season \n |date=2007-06-26 \n |publisher= \n |url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/sports/local/story/7487701p-7382875c.html \n |work=Press of Atlantic City \n |pages= \n |accessdate=2007-07-17 \n |language= \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704103821/http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/sports/local/story/7487701p-7382875c.html \n |archivedate=2007-07-04 \n |deadurl=yes \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\n===Modern founding of rotisserie===\n\nAn important development in fantasy sports came with the development of Rotisserie League Baseball in 1980 (although research \nsuggests a team of players from Southern New Jersey have been running the same style league since 1976 making them the first Rotisserie players).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Magazine writer/editor [[Daniel Okrent]] is credited with inventing it, the name coming from the New York City restaurant La Rotisserie Francaise where he and some friends used to meet and play.<ref>{{cite news | first=Lisa | last=Tozzi | coauthors= | title=The Great Pretenders | year=1999 | publisher=The Austin Chronicle | url =http://weeklywire.com/ww/07-05-99/austin_xtra_feature2.html | work = | pages = | accessdate =2008-12-16 | language = }}</ref>  The game's innovation was that \"owners\" in a Rotisserie league would draft teams from the list of active Major League Baseball players and would follow their statistics during the ongoing season to compile their scores.  In other words, rather than running realistic simulations using statistics for seasons whose outcomes were already known, the owners would have to make similar predictions about players' playing time, health, and expected performance that real baseball managers must make.\n\nBecause Okrent was a member of the media, other journalists, especially sports journalists, were introduced to the game. Many early players were introduced to the game by these sports journalists, especially during the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]]; with little else to write about, many baseball writers wrote columns about Rotisserie league.  A July 8, 1980 New York Times Article titled \"What George Steinbrenner is to the American League, Lee Eisenberg is to the Rotisseries League\" set off a media storm that led to stories about the league on CBS TV and other publications.<ref>{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Walker | coauthors= | title=Fantasyland | year=2006 | publisher=Viking | url =http://www.fantasyland.com | work = | page =145 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}</ref>\n\nIn March 1981, Dan Okrent wrote an essay about the Rotisserie League for [[Inside Sports]] called \"The Year George Foster Wasn't Worth $36.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Walker | coauthors= | title=Fantasyland | year=2006 | publisher=Viking | url =http://www.fantasyland.com | work = | page =70 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}</ref> The article included the rules of the game. Founders of the original Rotisserie league published a guide book starting in 1984.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1982, Ballantine published the first widely available [[Bill James]] Abstract, which helped fuel fantasy baseball interest. Fantasy fans often used James' statistical tools and analysis as a way to improve their teams.<ref name=\"moneyball\">[[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]: ''Moneyball: the art of winning an unfair game'' [[W. W.

Okrent, based on discussions with colleagues at USA Today, credits Rotisserie league baseball with much of USA Today's early success,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} since the paper provided much more detailed box scores than most competitors and eventually even created a special paper, ''[[Sports Weekly|Baseball Weekly]]'', that almost exclusively contained statistics and box scores.\n\nThe first experts on record as having written fantasy baseball articles for USA Today were John Benson, Alex Patton, and Ron Shandler.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Perhaps the most well-known fantasy baseball expert in the late 1980s and early 1990s was Benson, who published his first fantasy baseball book in 1989. Later that year Benson developed the first draft-simulation program, software that he still sells today.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fantasyland |last=Walker |first=Sam |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=110|isbn= 0143038435}}</ref>\n\nPatton published his first book (\"Patton's 1989 Fantasy Baseball League Price Guide\") in 1989 and his dollar values were included in USA Today Baseball Weekly's fantasy annual throughout the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n[[Ron Shandler]] published his \"Baseball SuperSTATS\" book in November 1986. At first the book wasn't meant for fantasy \nbaseball fans, but rather as a book of Sabermetric analysis.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nFantasy football also saw new businesses and growth. Fantasy Football Index became the first annual fantasy football guide in 1987. Fantasy Sports Magazine debuted in 1989 as the first regular publication covering more than one fantasy sport. Fantasy Football Weekly was launched in 1992 (later becoming [[Fanball|Fanball.com]]) and had $2 million in revenue by 1999.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jim | last=Martyka | coauthors= | title=Fantasy fans get new outlet | date= 2000-02-28 | publisher=American City Business Journals | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/1999/09/13/story3.html | work =Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | language = }}</ref> A large number of companies emerged to calculate the stats for fantasy leagues and primarily send results via fax.\n\nIn 1993, USA Today included a weekly columnist on fantasy baseball, John Hunt, and he became perhaps the most visible writer in the industry before the rise of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netshrine.com/jhunt.html |title=NetShrine was privileged to interview USA Today Baseball Weekly Fantasy Insider columnist John Hunt |accessdate=2007-07-28 |date=2000-06-25 |work=NetShrine |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024943/http://www.netshrine.com/jhunt.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Hunt started the first high-profile experts league, the [[LABR|League of Alternate Baseball Reality]] which first included notables as [[Peter Gammons]], [[Keith Olbermann]] and [[Bill James]].<ref name=\"LABR\">{{cite news\n| first=Jonah\n| last=Keri\n| title='Tis the season to project stats\n| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=keri/070214\n| publisher=ESPN.com\n| year=2007\n}}</ref>\n\nThe hobby continued to grow with 1 million to 3 million playing from 1991 to 1994.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Modern times===\n\n====Internet boom====\n\nA large factor in the growth of fantasy sports was the rise of the Internet and personal computers in the mid-1990s. The new technology lowered the barrier to entry to the hobby as stats could quickly be compiled online and news and information became readily available.\n\nIn 1991 2 guys from Dallas, TX created what was known as the first computerized Fantasy Sports Application.  AutoStat was launched in the spring of 1991 by the company Fantasy Sports, Inc. for Baseball.  The software was a huge success, but the public was not quite ready to deal with comm ports, serial cables and 1200 Baud modems.   After 4 years, sadly Fantasy Sports, Inc. closed its doors.  \n\nIn early October 1995, what would become a popular fantasy hockey website was released by [[Molson|Molson Breweries]].<ref name=\"fantasy\">{{cite web|url=http://strategyonline.ca/1995/10/16/11295-19951016/|title=Hockey Net in Canada: Molson scores with fantasy league|last=Summerfield|first=Patti|publisher=strategy (Brunico Communications)|date=16 October 1995| accessdate=2003-03-27}}</ref> It was part of the company's \"I am Online\" strategy and centred on its \"[[I am Canadian]]\" \nadvertising campaign; it would focus on music, entertainment and hockey.<ref name=\"iamonline\">{{cite news|title=Molson uncaps Internet site aimed at young adults|last=McHutchion|first=John|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers| date=20 July 1995}}</ref> The website allowed visitors to register accounts and participate in hockey leagues of nine teams in which the visitor would be the general manager for one of those teams.<ref name=\"fantasy\" /> The general manager would draft a team from a pool of NHL players, and could later negotiate trades with other teams in the league.<ref name=\"fantasy\" /> Disputes would be arbitrated by a commissioner by [[email]].<ref name=\"fantasy\" /> The site included daily updates of NHL statistics, and also featured content from the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"fantasy\" /> On 24 May 1996, Molson Breweries won the International Digital Media Award for best website of 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://playbackonline.ca/1996/06/03/5401-19960603/|title=Int\u2019l.

In 1997, two such sites that debuted were Commissioner.com and [[Rotowire|RotoNews.com]].\n\nCommissioner.com launched on January 1, 1997 and first offered a fantasy baseball commissioner service that offered real-time statistics, league message boards, daily updated box scores and other features.

Under most state laws, lotteries are illegal only if they involve three elements: an entry fee (known as \"consideration\"), a prize (a \"reward\", in legal terms) and chance.  Whether fantasy sports are a lottery varies from state to state and hinges on the definition of \"chance\" that the state interprets.  For some states, if skill dominates the outcome of the event, then the contest is legal, and passes what's called the \"dominant factor test\".  Other states with a stricter definition of chance, called \"any chance test\", have made fantasy football illegal.<ref name=forbes1>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2013/09/03/is-it-legal-to-play-fantasy-football-for-money/ |title=Is It Legal To Play Fantasy Football For Money? |publisher=forbes.com |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2015-09-23}}</ref>\n\nSeveral states have clarified that paid fantasy sports contests are games of skill and exempt from gambling laws, beginning with Maryland in 2012<ref>{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/12544/maryland-comptroller-dfs-reguation/ |title=Maryland Comptroller Officially Implements Fantasy Sports Regulations |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2017-01-03 }}</ref>.\n\nOne exception is the state of Nevada, which has an exemption in PASPA to allow for sports betting.

The players associations of the major sports leagues believed that fantasy games using player names were subject to licensing due to the right of publicity of the players involved. Since the player names were being used as a group, the players had assigned their publicity rights to the players association who then signed licensing deals. During the 1980s and 1990s many companies signed licensing deals with the player associations, but some companies did not. The issue came to a head with the lawsuit of [[MLBAM|Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM)]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB's]] Internet company, vs. St. Louis-based CBC Distribution and Marketing Inc., the parent company of [[Fanball|CDM Sports]]. When CBC was denied a new licensing agreement with MLBAM (they had acquired the rights from the baseball players' association) for its fantasy baseball game, CBC filed suit.\n\nCBC argued that intellectual property laws and so-called \"right of publicity\" laws don't apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports.<ref name=\"sports.espn.go.com\">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy leagues permitted to use MLB names, stats | date=2006-08-08 | publisher= | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2543720 | work =ESPN | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}</ref> The [[Fantasy Sports Trade Association|FSTA]] filed an [[amicus curiae]] in support of CBC, also arguing that if MLBAM won the lawsuit it would have a dramatic impact on the industry, which was largely ignored by the major sports leagues for years while a number of smaller entrepreneurs grew it into a multibillion-dollar industry, and a ruling could allow the MLBAM to have a monopoly over the industry.\n\n\"This will be a defining moment in the fantasy sports industry,\" said Charlie Wiegert, executive vice president of CBC. \"The other leagues are all watching this case.

The forward pass is one of the main distinguishers between [[gridiron football]] ([[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]) in which the play is legal and widespread, and [[rugby football]] ([[rugby union|union]] and [[rugby league|league]]) from which the North American games evolved, in which the play is illegal.\n\nIn some football codes, such as [[association football]] (soccer), the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all.  In these sports, the concept of [[Offside (sport)|offside]] is used to regulate who can be in front of the play or be nearest to the goal. However, this has not always been the case. Some earlier incarnations of football allowed unlimited forward passing, while others had strict offside rules similar to rugby.\n\nThe development of the forward pass in American football shows how the game has evolved from its rugby roots into the distinctive game it is today.  Illegal and experimental forward passes had been attempted as early as 1876, but the first legal forward pass in [[American football]] took place in 1906, after a change in rules.  Another change in rules occurred on January 18, 1951, which established that no center, tackle, or guard could receive a forward pass (unless such a player announces his intent to the referee he will be an eligible receiver, called a [[tackle-eligible play]]). Today, the only linemen who can receive a forward pass are the [[tight end]]s.  Current rules regulate who may throw and who may receive a forward pass, and under what circumstances, as well as how the defensive team may try to prevent a pass from being completed.  The primary pass thrower is the [[quarterback]], and statistical analysis is used to determine a quarterback's success rate at passing in various situations, as well as a team's overall success at the \"passing game.\"\n\n==American and Canadian football==\n[[File:Luckthrowingfotball.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Andrew Luck]] tosses a pass.]]\nIn [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], a '''forward pass''', usually referred to simply as a '''pass''', consists of a player throwing the football towards the opponent's goal line.  This is permitted only once during a [[line of scrimmage|scrimmage]] [[down (gridiron football)|down]] by the offensive team before team possession has changed, provided the pass is thrown from in or behind the [[Neutral zone (gridiron football)|neutral zone]]. An illegal forward pass can incur a yardage penalty and the loss of a down, although it may be legally intercepted by the opponents and advanced.\n\nIf an [[eligible receiver]] on the passing team legally catches the ball, the pass is '''completed''' and the receiver may attempt to advance the ball. If an opposing player legally catches the ball (all defensive players are eligible receivers) it is an [[interception]]. That player's team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponent's goal. If no player is able to legally catch the ball it is an [[incomplete pass]] and the ball becomes [[Dead ball (American football)|dead]] the moment it touches the ground. It will then be returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next [[Down (football)|down]]. If any player interferes with an eligible receiver's ability to catch the ball it is [[pass interference]] which draws a penalty of varying degree (largely depending upon the particular league's rules).\n\nThe person passing the ball must be a member of the [[offensive team]], and the recipient of the forward pass must be an [[eligible receiver]] and must touch the passed ball before any ineligible player.\n\nThe moment that a forward pass begins is important to the game. The pass begins the moment the passer's arm begins to move forward. If the passer drops the ball before this moment it is a [[fumble]] and therefore a [[Glossary of American football#L|loose ball]]. In this case anybody can gain possession of the ball before or after it touches the ground. If the passer drops the ball while his arm is moving forward it is a forward pass, regardless of where the ball lands or is first touched.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/championships/playing-rules/football-rules-game |title=Football Rules of the Game |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/2013%20-%20Rule%20Book.pdf |title=2013 Official Playing Rules of the National Football League |website=www.nfl.com |publisher=National Football League |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Matt Hasselbeck (8) drops back to pass.jpg|thumb|280px|Matt Hasselbeck drops back to pass.]]\nThe quarterback generally either starts a few paces behind the line of scrimmage or drops back a few paces after the ball is snapped.  This places him in an area called the \"pocket\", which is a protective region formed by the offensive blockers up front and between the tackles on each side.  A quarterback who runs out of this pocket is said to be scrambling.  Under NFL and NCAA rules, once the quarterback moves out of the pocket the ball may be legally thrown away to prevent a sack. NFHS (high school) rules do not allow for a passer to intentionally throw an incomplete forward pass to save loss of yardage or conserve time, except for a spike to conserve time after a hand-to-hand snap.  If he throws the ball away while still in the pocket then a foul called \"intentional grounding\" is assessed. In [[Canadian football]] the passer must simply throw the ball across the line of scrimmage\u2014whether he is inside or outside of the \"pocket\"\u2014to avoid the foul of \"intentionally grounding\".\n\nIf a forward pass is caught near a sideline or endline it is a complete pass (or an interception) only if a receiver catches the ball ''in bounds''. For a pass to be ruled complete in-bounds, depending on the rules either one or two feet must touch the ground within the field boundaries, after the ball is first grasped. In the [[National Football League|NFL]] the receiver must touch the ground with both feet, but in most other codes\u2014[[Canadian Football League|CFL]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and high school\u2014one foot in bounds is enough.\n\nCommon to all [[Gridiron football|gridiron]] codes is the notion of control\u2014a receiver must demonstrate control of the ball in order to be ruled in ''possession'' of it, while still in bounds, as defined by his code.  If the receiver handles the ball but the official determines that he was still \"bobbling\" it prior to the end of the play, then the pass will be ruled incomplete.\n\n===Early illegal and experimental passes===\nThe forward pass had been attempted at least 30 years before the play was actually made legal.  Passes \"had been carried out successfully but illegally several times, including the 1876 [[Yale]]\u2013[[Princeton University|Princeton]] game in which Yale's [[Walter Camp]] threw forward to teammate Oliver Thompson as he was being tackled.  Princeton's protest, one account said, went for naught when the referee 'tossed a coin to make his decision and allowed the touchdown to stand'&nbsp;\".<ref name=vahe1>Gregorian, Vahe, [http://nahtmmm.livejournal.com/99821.html \"100 years of Forward Passing; SLU Was the Pioneer\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822231037/http://nahtmmm.livejournal.com/99821.html |date=2011-08-22 }} ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', September 4, 2006</ref>\n\nThe [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|University of North Carolina]] used the forward pass in an 1895 game against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]].  However, the play was still illegal at the time. Bob Quincy stakes Carolina's claim in his 1973 book ''They Made the Bell Tower Chime'':\n<blockquote>\n[[John Heisman]], namesake of the [[Heisman Trophy]], wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs (UGA). It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6\u20130 win. The Carolinians were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by [[George Stephens (American football)|George Stephens]], who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn a [[1905 Fairmount vs. Washburn football game|1905 experimental game]] at [[Wichita, Kansas]], [[Washburn University]] and Fairmount College (what would become [[Wichita State University|Wichita State]]) used the pass before new rules allowing the play were approved in early 1906.<ref name= nelson>\n{{cite book|title=The Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game|first=David M.|last=Nelson|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1994|isbn=0-87413-455-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0874134552&id=OmwfnipKuogC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&sig=yv9laEI7tvftp9CUlkVCUkFRUSU p. 128]</ref>  Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount's Bill Davis, who completed a pass to Art Solter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-bypaths-of-kansas-history-november-1940/12839|publisher=[[Kansas State Historical Society]]|title=ADDENDA TO \"COLLEGE FOOTBALL IN KANSAS\"|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref>[[File:Georgia Tech Auburn football game Thanksgiving 1921.jpg|thumb|240px|A pass at the 1921 Georgia Tech-Auburn game.]]\n1905 had been a bloody year on the gridiron; the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported 18 players had been killed and 159 seriously injured that season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeffrey |first=Terence |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/column.aspx?UrlTitle=one_hundred_years_of_the_forward_pass&ns=TerenceJeffrey&dt=08/30/2006&page=1 |title=One hundred years of the forward pass |date=August 30, 2006 |publisher=Townhall.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215210520/http://townhall.com/columnists/column.aspx?UrlTitle=one_hundred_years_of_the_forward_pass&ns=TerenceJeffrey&dt=08%2F30%2F2006&page=1 |archivedate=February 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> There were moves to outlaw the game, but United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] personally intervened and demanded that the rules of the game be reformed.

In the opening game of the 1906 season against [[Yale University|Yale]], Reiter's quarterback Sammy Moore completed a forward pass to Irvin van Tassell for a thirty-yard gain.

The quarterback, Sam Moore, took the ball from center and faded eight or 10 yards back of our line.  Our two ends angled down the field toward the sidelines as a decoy, and I slipped through the strong side of our line straight down the center and past the secondary defense.  The pass worked perfectly.  However, the quarterback coming up fast nailed me as I caught it.

The highlight of the campaign was St. Louis' 39\u20130 win over [[University of Iowa|Iowa]].  Cochems' team reportedly completed eight passes in ten attempts for four touchdowns. \"The average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards.\"  Nelson continues, \"the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football. St. Louis was on Iowa's thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play. Timekeeper Walter McCormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown.\"<ref name= nelson />\n\nThe 1906 Iowa game was refereed by one of the top football officials in the country, [[West Point]]'s Lt.

St. Louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ...

Hackett was an official in games involving both teams. As Wray recalled almost 40 years later: \"Hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by St. Louis U. nor such bewildering variations of it.\"<ref>Wray's Column, ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', January 9, 1946</ref>\n\n\"Cochems said that the poor Iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass\", Nelson writes. \"Iowa did attempt two basketball-style forward passes.\"<ref name= nelson1>\n{{cite book|title=The Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game|first=David M.|last=Nelson|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1994|isbn=0-87413-455-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0874134552&id=OmwfnipKuogC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&sig=yv9laEI7tvftp9CUlkVCUkFRUSU p. 129]</ref>\n\n\"During the 1906 season [Robinson] threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ...

The Fiji Media Industry Development Authority is responsible for enforcing these provisions. The authority has the power to investigate journalists and media outlets for alleged violations of the decree, including powers of search and seizure of equipment.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Fiji-2012/>\n\nA code of ethics contained in the Media Decree requires that all stories run by the media be balanced, with comment obtained from both sides where there is any disagreement on the facts. This requirement enables government departments and private businesses to prevent stories from being published by not responding to media questions, thus making it impossible for the media to fulfill the decree's requirement for comment from both sides. However, media sources report that if the story is positive toward the government, the balance requirement could be ignored without consequence.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Fiji-2012/>\n\n==Telephones==\n[[File:Public Payphone in Fiji.jpg|thumb|300px|A public payphone in Fiji, c. 2010.]]\n{{See also |Telephone numbers in Fiji}}\n\n* [[Calling code]]: +679<ref name=CIAWFB-Fiji-Communications-2014/>\n* [[List of international call prefixes|International call prefix]]: 00 or 052<ref>[http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/opb/sp/T-SP-E.164C-2011-PDF-E.pdf ''Dialing Procedures (International Prefix, National (Trunk) Prefix and National (Significant) Number) (in Accordance with ITY-T Recommendation E.164 (11/2010))], Annex to ITU Operational Bulletin No. 994-15.XII.2011, International Telecommunication Union (ITU, Geneva), 15 December 2011.

A series of decrees have been issued, including the Public Order Amendment Decree (POAD), the Media Decree, and the Crime Decree.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Fiji-2012/>\n\nBy decree all telephone and Internet service users must register their personal details with telephone and Internet providers, including their name, birth date, home address, left thumbprint, and photographic identification. The decree imposes fines of up to F$100,000 ($56,721) on providers who continue to provide services to unregistered users and up to F$10,000 ($5,672) on users who do not update their registration information as required. Vodafone, one of two mobile telephone providers, also requires users to register their nationality, postal address, employment details, and both thumbprints.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Fiji-2012/>\n\nThe POAD gives the government the power to detain persons on suspicion of \"endangering public safety or the preservation of the peace\"; defines terrorism as any act designed to advance a political, religious, or ideological cause that could \"reasonably be regarded\" as intended to compel a government to do or refrain from doing any act or to intimidate the public or a section thereof; and  makes religious vilification and attempts to sabotage or undermine the economy offenses punishable by a maximum F$10,000 ($5,672) fine or five years\u2019 imprisonment. The Media Decree prohibits \"irresponsible reporting\" and provides for government censorship of the media. The Crimes Decree includes criticism of the government in its definition of the crime of sedition, including statements made in other countries by any person, who can be prosecuted on return to Fiji. The government uses the threat of prosecution under these provisions to intimidate government critics and limit public criticism of the government.

Since 2000, the military has had [[Military unrest following the 2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|a sometimes tense relationship]] with the [[Laisenia Qarase|Qarase]] government, and [[Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|has strongly opposed its plans]] to establish a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Commission]] with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup.  Among other objections, the military claims that its integrity and discipline would be undermined if soldiers who [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|mutinied]] in the 2000 upheaval were to be pardoned.\n\nOn 4 August 2005, [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Opposition Leader]] [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] called for more [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], who presently comprise less than one percent of the military personnel, to be recruited. (Specifically, as of October 2007, Fiji's military had 3527 full-time members, of whom only 15 were Indo-Fijians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/rumblings-of-a-revolution/2007/10/26/1192941338637.html |title=Rumblings of a revolution |first=Hamish |last=McDonald |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref>) This would help guarantee political stability, he considered.  He also spoke against government plans to downsize the military.  Military spokesman [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Orisi Rabukawaqa]] responded the next day by saying that the military was not an ethnic Fijian body, that it stood to serve the entire nation, and that there was no colour bar in its recruitment or promotion.  He said that many Indo-Fijians had been reluctant to commit themselves to a military career because of the slow progress of promotion, often preferring to be discharged and to use their record as a stepping stone to a successful career in some other field.  Nevertheless, he appreciated the Indo-Fijian contribution to the military, and noted the success of Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed Aziz, the head of the military's legal unit who was a pivotal figure in the [[court martial]] of soldiers who mutinied in 2000. Ironically the rate of promotion of indigenous Fijian officers had been very rapid after the 1987 coup, and subsequent expansion of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.\n\nOn 26 August 2005, the government announced plans to study ways to reduce the size of the military.  Military engineers would be transferred to the Regional Development Ministry, said Home Affair Minister [[Josefa Vosanibola]], and the reduction of the military forces would coincide with an increase in the numbers of the police force.\n\nOn 26 September 2005, Rabukawaqa revealed that the military had decided to curtail certain operations to stay within its budget.  The cuts would affect maritime patrols, search and rescue operations, training and exercises, School Cadet training, and the deployment of military engineers to rural areas.  These cuts would be made to ensure that activities accorded a higher priority, such as peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and Iraq, officer cadet training with the [[Military of New Zealand|New Zealand Defence Forces]], and the prosecution of soldiers charged with mutiny, would not be affected, Rabukawaqa said.\n\nThe next day, [[Lesi Korovavala]], chief executive officer of the Ministry of Home Affairs, told the Fiji Village news service that the military had undertaken the reductions on its own initiative, in consultation with the department, an explanation corroborated by Lieutenant Colonel Rabukawaqa.\n\nOn 5 December 2006, the Fijian army staged a [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|third coup d'\u00e9tat]]. On 7 February 2008, the head of the RFMF and post-coup interim Prime Minister [[Frank Bainimarama|Voreqe Bainimarama]] stated: \"Qarase [...] does not understand the role of the Military and as such is misinforming the nation.

d'\u00e9tat|2000]], and [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|2006]]. Fiji has been suspended various times from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a grouping of mostly former [[British Empire|British colonies]].  It was readmitted to the Commonwealth in December 2001, following the [[Fijian general election, 2001|parliamentary election]] held to restore democracy in September that year, and is currently suspended again because of the 2006 coup.  Other Pacific Island governments have generally been sympathetic to Fiji's internal political problems and have declined to take public positions.\n\nFiji became the 127th member of the United Nations on 13 October 1970, and participates actively in the organization. Fiji's contributions to UN peacekeeping are unique for a nation of its size. A nation with a population of less than one million, it maintains nearly 1,000 soldiers overseas in UN peacekeeping missions, mainly in the Middle East.\n\nSince FIji's independence, the country has been a leader in the South Pacific region, and has played a leading role in the formation of the [[Pacific Islands Forum|South Pacific Forum]].  Fiji has championed causes of common interest to [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island]] countries.\n\nSince 2005, Fiji has become embroiled in a number of disagreements with other countries, including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea, the United States, and Vanuatu.\n\nThe country's foreign relations and diplomatic missions are maintained by its [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Fiji)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation]].\n\n==Pacific Ocean countries==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{main|Australia\u2013Fiji relations}}\nOn 13 April 2005, Fiji's prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, rejected criticism from Australia and some other countries over the prosecution and imprisonment of two foreigners charged with committing homosexual acts, which are illegal in Fiji, and said that other countries needed to respect Fiji's independence.  Qarase said that as member of the United Nations, Fiji was as entitled as any other country to make its own laws as it saw fit.\n\nThe Australian Government took a more measured position than its New Zealand counterpart over the controversial [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill]] being debated in the Fijian [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]].  Susan Boyd, a former Australian [[High Commissioner]] to Fiji, strongly criticized the legislation, but Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] said that it is an \"internal matter\" and that Australia does not want to get involved.  He did, however, condemn recent threats from the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]] commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], to declare [[martial law]] and arrest members of the present government if the bill is passed.  The Australian High Commission in Suva told Bainimarama that his threats are not \"the proper role for the military in a democracy.\"\n\nAustralian [[Foreign Minister of Australia|Foreign Minister]] Alexander Downer visited Fiji for two days of talks, from 28 to 30 September 2005. Downer met government ministers and officials, [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Opposition Leader]] [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], and [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]] commander [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]].  The talks covered the controversial Unity Bill, as well as the future of Fiji's preferential trade access to the Australian market, which the Fijian Government regards as a priority.  Downer said that he intended to elaborate further on Australian Prime Minister John Howard's promise of a seven-year extension of the [[SPARTECA\u2013TCF]] scheme, which assists Fiji's textile, clothing, and footwear industry.\n\nForeign Minister Tavola expressed grave concern on 7 February 2006, about a proposed [[regional trade agreement]] (RTA) between Australia and China, saying that Fiji's exports to Australia would be unable to compete with Chinese products.  For that reason, Fiji was persisting in its efforts to persuade Australia to renew the [[South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation]] \u2013 Textile Clothing Footwear ([[SPARTECA\u2013TCF]]) scheme, to improve the competitiveness of Fijian exports, the [[Fiji Live]] news service reported.<ref>[[Fiji Live]] 7 February 2006</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Fiji Times]]'' reported on 14 September 2006, that Prime Ministers Qarase and Howard had discussed possible Australian assistance for the reform of Fiji's sugar industry, with Howard reported receptive to giving aid.  Qarase said that he had asked Australia to provide two or three experts to help with the establishment of the proposed [[Fiji Research Sugar Institute]].<ref>[[Fiji Times]] 14 September 2006</ref>\n\nRegarding the coup, Australia's foreign minister at the time, Alexander Downer, said that the military were \"slowly trying to take control\" and pressured the PM to resign.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coup participants will be banned from NZ|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200612051222/coup_participants_will_be_banned_from_nz|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=5 December 2006}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was reported that in 2006 Fiji's Prime Minister Qarase asked Australia's Prime Minister John Howard for military assistance should a coup take place, but Howard declined.\n\n====2009 events; coup and diplomatic rift====\n\nOn 3 November 2009 Fiji ordered the diplomatic envoys of Australia to leave Fiji within 24 hours.<ref name=\"BBC 3-11-09\">{{cite news|title=Fiji bars NZ and Australia envoys|url=\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8339402.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=3 November 2009}}</ref> The expulsion of the diplomats followed accusations by leader of Fiji, [[Frank Bainimarama]], that Australia and New Zealand were interfering in Fiji's internal affairs and \"wage a negative campaign against the government and people of Fiji\".<ref name=\"BBC 3-11-09\"/> In particular Bainimarama says that the two countries were exerting pressure on Sri Lankan judges, brought in by Bainimarama to replace the uncooperative local judiciary, not to travel to the country and refusing to grant them transit visas.<ref name=\"BBC 3-11-09\"/> The Australian government denied this and stated that it only advised the judges that once they took up office in Fiji they would be subject to an existing travel ban in place against Fijian officials.<ref name=\"BBC 3-11-09\"/> Australia's senior diplomat in Fiji was also expelled in the 2006 coup.<ref name=\"BBC 4-11-09\"/> Fiji announced its withdrawal of their high commissioner from Australia.<ref name=\"BBC 3-11-09\"/>\n\nAustralia and New Zealand responded on 4 November 2009, expelling Fiji's diplomats from both those countries.<ref name=\"BBC 4-11-09\">{{cite news|title=Australia and NZ expel Fijians |url=\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8341721.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=4 November 2009}}</ref> [[Stephen Smith (Australian politician)|Stephen Smith]], Australian Foreign Minister, rejected any accusations of meddling in Fiji's affairs and said that he was \"deeply disappointed\" by Fiji's actions.<ref name=\"BBC 4-11-09\"/> The then Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] said that he would maintain his tough stance against Fiji in order to prevent a \"coup culture\" spreading around the Pacific.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|China\u2013Fiji relations}}\nA diplomatic row with China erupted on 5 May 2005, when President [[Chen Shui-bian]] of Taiwan arrived for a private visit and was welcomed at a private function at [[Suva]]'s [[Sheraton Resort (Fiji)|Sheraton Resort]] by [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] [[Ratu]] [[Joni Madraiwiwi]], [[Ratu]] [[Ovini Bokini]] ([[Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs]]), Senate President [[Taito Waqavakatoga]] and several other [[Senate of Fiji|Senators]] and [[House of Representatives of Fiji|MPs]], and several judges including [[Chief Justice of Fiji|Chief Justice]] [[Daniel Fatiaki]].  Foreign Minister [[Kaliopate Tavola]] asserted that those who attended the welcoming ceremony did so \"of their own accord,\" not as government representatives, and that Prime Minister Qarase's presence in the same hotel where President Chen was staying was purely \"coincidental.\"  Chinese ambassador [[Cai Jin Biao]] rejected this explanation, and said that the visit was a violation of the [[One China Policy]], to which Fiji had agreed when diplomatic relations were established in 1975, which would \"sabotage relations between China and Fiji.\"  He charged that Prime Minister Qarase and Foreign Minister Tavola had known of the upcoming visit for months.  The embassy issued a further statement on 7 May, demanding that Fiji discontinue any effort to establish a dialogue with Taiwan.\n\nThe row escalated when, on 16 May, Health Minister [[Solomone Naivalu]] voted in support of Taiwan's bid to gain observer status at the [[World Health Assembly]] in Geneva.  Naivalu had apparently done so on his own initiative, contrary to a government briefing, sparking a major public disagreement between himself and Foreign Minister Tavola. [[Jia Qinglin]], chairman of the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC), was dispatched to Fiji and met Prime Minister Qarase during a brief stopover on 21\u201322 May, a move that Tavola said was not coincidental.  He said that Fiji could not afford to lose China, and that the government would ensure that \"careless incidences\" like Naivalu's vote in Geneva would not recur.  Naivalu responded by saying that his vote was nothing new: \"We always support Taiwan to get observer status every year,\" he said.\n\nOn 10 December 2005, ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' quoted Tavola as saying that Fiji would have to find a way to resolve a stand-off between the PRC and Taiwan, over membership of the Suva-based [[Council of South Pacific Tourism Organisation]]; China was resisting Taiwanese attempts to join the organization on an equal basis.  \"If China had its way it would not want Taiwan on that. So we have to resolve the situation amicably and are looking at how both countries can be represented there,\" Tavola said.\n\nIn defence of the earlier incident over the Taiwanese President's visit, Tavola said that it was the Pacific way to welcome people.  ''\"Even when considering Taiwan as a province of China,'' he went on, ''the President of a province is a man of high profile, so when he comes there is an urge to extend hospitality.\"''  It did not signify any modification to Fiji's adherence to the One China policy, he had explained to the Chinese ambassador.\n\nChina has invested in a number of major projects in Fiji.  These include the Suva sports stadium, built for the [[South Pacific Games]] of 2003.\n\nOn 14 December 2005, Fiji's [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]] commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]] began an official visit to China, at the invitation of the [[People's Liberation Army]].  He reaffirmed Fiji's support for the One China policy.\n\nIt was announced on 24 January 2006 that Chinese [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] would visit Fiji that April to open the China-Pacific Islands Countries Economic Development & Cooperation Forum Ministerial Conference 2006 at Sofitel Fiji Resort in Nadi, a conference of economic and trade ministers from Pacific Island countries.  Six prime ministers from neighbouring countries are expected to participate, according to a ''[[Fiji Times]]'' report on 23 February.  His visit to Fiji will be the first by a senior Chinese Government official.\n\nIn an interview with [[PACNEWS]] on 1 February 2006, [[Jeremaia Waqanisau]], Fiji's ambassador to Beijing, made a stinging attack on the efficiency of the Fijian civil service, saying that it negatively affected Fiji's ability to present itself to China. [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet ministers]] visited China without the Fijian embassy being informed, he complained.  Certain civil servants were extremely passive in their dealings with China, he said.  Another factor inhibiting Chinese investment was the [[2005\u201306 Fijian political crisis|instability caused by friction between the government and the military]], he surmised, and the Fijian embassy in Beijing was continually engaged in damage control.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Japan}}\nDiplomatic relations between Japan and Fiji were established in October 1970. Japan maintains an embassy at Suva, which is also accredited to Kiribati, Nauru, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Ministerial level visits are frequent between the two countries.<ref>[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/fiji/index.html Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Japan]</ref> Reciprocally, Fiji has an embassy in Tokyo.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|New Zealand-Fiji relations}}\nOn 10 June 2005, Foreign Minister Tavola signed a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" with his New Zealand [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|counterpart]], [[Phil Goff]], aimed at fostering cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Meanwhile, New Zealand's Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] announced that New Zealand would double its annual aid to Fiji, from NZ$4&nbsp;million to NZ$8&nbsp;million. Much of this aid, the Fijian Government revealed, would be used for poverty alleviation and squatter resettlement.\n\nNew Zealand's Foreign Minister [[Winston Peters]] (who replaced Goff in late 2005) flew into Fiji on 8 February 2006, for three days of talks with Fijian Government officials. He met Prime Minister Qarase, Finance Minister [[Ratu]] [[Jone Kubuabola]], and [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]] commander [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]] on the first day of his visit; meetings with Foreign Minister Tavola and [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of Fiji|Speaker]] [[Ratu]] [[Epeli Nailatikau]] were held later. The meeting with Bainimarama attracted some media attention; Bainimarama said that the meeting had been approved by Prime Minister Qarase and that there was nothing underhanded about it.\n\nThe talks are to cover such matters as the [[Pacific Plan]] and a cost-sharing agreement for a citizen education project, promoted by the [[United Nations Development Programme]].\n\nThe New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters described the 2006 coup as a \"creeping siege on democratic institutions\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10413816|title=Clark: Bainimarama attempting 'Thai-style coup'|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=5 December 2006}}</ref> Helen Clark said that the Fijian constitution only allowed the president to request the dissolving of parliament if the prime minister no longer had the confidence of the parliament and that this was clearly not the case.<ref>{{cite news|title=NZ PM condemns Fijian coup takeover|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200612051457/nz_pm_condemns_fiji_takeover|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=5 December 2006}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The New Zealand Government has also stated those taking part in the coup will be banned from entry to New Zealand, and that military ties, aid and sporting contacts will be cut.

Fiji and the Solomon Islands are both located in [[Melanesia]], and are both members of the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]]. They also participate in other regional organisations including the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. In August 2008, it was announced that the Solomon Islands intended to open a [[High Commission]] in [[Suva]],<ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200808/s2334809.htm \"Solomons considers High Commission in Suva\"], Radio Australia, 14 August 2008</ref> and in December the government of Fiji announced that it had \"formally endorsed the establishment of a Resident Diplomatic Mission in Suva by the Government of the Solomon Islands\".<ref>[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_13634.shtml \"Cabinet approves Establishment of a Resident Mission of the Solomon Islands in Suva\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108035451/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_13634.shtml |date=8 January 2009 }}, Fiji government website, 2 December 2008</ref> Fiji's High Commission to Papua New Guinea is accredited to the Solomon Islands. In July 2014, a row between the two nations erupted over air services which resulted in both nations airlines being prevented to fly over the other. But both nations reached an agreement in early January 2015 to lift the suspension of their Air Services Agreement, allowing Fiji Airways and Solomon Airlines to fly between the two countries. Fiji's Civil Aviation Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said both airlines are entitled to operate three flights per week. Fiji Airways Chief executive Stefan Pichler has indicated they will begin the flights in March however Solomon Airlines has yet to confirm when they will begin their flights.<ref>http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/263515/fiji-and-solomon-islands-flight-ban-lifted</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\n{{main|Fiji-South Korea relations|Foreign relations of the Republic of Korea}}\nEstablishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and Fiji is October 1971.<ref>http://www.mofa.go.kr/ENG/countries/asiapacific/countries/20071018/1_24407.jsp?menu=m_30_10{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Tonga===\n{{main|Fiji-Tonga relations}}\nIt was reported on 2 November 2005 that a territorial dispute was looming between Fiji and Tonga over a reef lying to the south of both countries.  The people of [[Ono-i-Lau]] in the [[Lau Islands]] archipelago claim that [[Minerva Reef]] is part of their traditional fishing ground. [[Attorney General of Fiji|Attorney General]] [[Qoriniasi Bale]] told the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] [[Local government in Fiji|Provincial Council]] that the government had a team of experts preparing a case to be taken to the [[United Nations International Seabed Authority]], which is based in Jamaica.  The reef has also been claimed by Tonga since 1972, and Tonga's [[Surveyor General]], [[Tevita Malolo]], told [[Radio New Zealand]] that Fiji had never contested Tonga's claim until now.\n\n===Vanuatu===\n* ''More on [[n:Fiji \"running out of patience\" with Vanuatu over ban on Fijian biscuits|Wikinews]].''\n\nOn 11 March 2005, Vanuatu imposed a ban in biscuit imports, ostensibly to protect its own biscuit manufacturing industry, giving a monopoly on the business to the [[Espiritu Santo]]-based [[Wong Sze Sing]] store.  The ban was the second in a year.  Bread and breakfast cereals produced by [[Flour Mills of Fiji]] (FMF) were the worst-hit; the company claimed to be losing [[Fijian dollar|F$2&nbsp;million]] annually.\n\nFiji retaliated on 13 June with a threat to impose a total commercial embargo on Vanuatu.  Major income-earners for Vanuatu targeted by the Fijian government include Vanuatu [[kava]], valued at almost [[United States dollar|US$]]3.2&nbsp;million, and [[Air Vanuatu]] flights ([[United States dollar|US$]]8&nbsp;million).\n\nOn 29 June, Foreign Minister Tavola said that Fiji was ''\"running out of patience\"'' and that he was writing to the government of Vanuatu in what he called a ''\"final gesture of friendship.\"''\n\nOn 27 July, Vanuatu's Trade Minister [[James Bule]] signed an order lifting the ban, effective from 22 July.  No reason was given for the change of policy, but the [[Fiji Live]] news service reported that the decision averted a lawsuit from FMF and the threatened kava ban.\n\nFiji's Foreign Affairs chief executive officer, [[Isikeli Mataitoga]], said that Fiji's policy of pursuing diplomatic channels in dealing with such disputes had been vindicated.  ''\"Whilst I agree that it can take a bit of time to see it through carefully, it nevertheless, demonstrates to our regional friends that we are principled in our approach to international relations and diplomacy,\"'' Mataitoga said.\n\nThere was another twist on 28 July, however, when FMF chairman [[Hari Punja]] called the lifting of the ban a fabrication.  He said that in place of the ban, the Vanuatu government had introduced a restrictive new quota system for imports which would make it \"impossible\" to export to Vanuatu.  He called on the Fijian government to continue to pressure its Vanuatu counterparts.\n\nForeign Minister Tavola denounced the latest move of the Vanuatu government on 3 August, saying that it breached an agreement.  On 9 August, he announced that the government had decided to go ahead with its threatened embargo against the importing of Vanuatu kava.  On 16 August the [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] finalized the decision, banning all imports of Vanuatu kava for six months, after which the ban would be reviewed.  On 18 August, [[Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs Authority]] chief executive [[Tevita Banuve]] said that importers would be given two weeks to clear their kava stock from the wharf.  A special license would be granted only to clear the stock, he said.  It would not be usable for importing more kava.\n\nOn 27 August, Tavola announced that following negotiations at the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]] meeting in Papua New Guinea, he expected the Vanuatu government to lift the biscuit ban soon.  If they did so, he said he would ask the [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] to lift the embargo against Vanuatu kava.\n\nThe Fiji Village news service reported on 11 October that Vanuatu's Trade Minister, [[James Bule]], would visit Fiji on 25 October.  The purpose of the visit would be to deliver his government's decision to lift the ban on Fijian biscuits, in return for Fiji lifting its ban on Vanuatu kava.\n\nIn return for Vanuatu's lifting of the biscuit ban on 25 October, the Fijian government announced on 7 December that it was lifting its kava ban for the sake of freer trade among the members of the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]] (MSG).\n\nOn 22 December 2005, Vanuatu's Finance Minister [[Willie Rarua]] formally apologized to Fiji's Acting Foreign Minister [[Pita Nacuva]], for having imposed the ban.\n\n==Rest of the

Previously, Franco-Fiji bilateral relations had primarily been centred on military cooperation, with France assisting Fiji in surveiling its maritime zone, and on development aid. French military assistance was suspended after the coup.\n\nFrench aid to Fiji includes the providing of equipment for poor and isolated areas, and assistance in the development of [[renewable energy]]. France also provides Fiji with translations into English of French scientific documents pertaining to the Pacific area. \nFrance promotes [[French culture]] and the French language in Fiji through the presence of the [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise]] and by encouraging the teaching of French in schools and at the [[University of the South Pacific]].

Diplomatic relations would open up new opportunities for trade and investment, Tavola said.  On 27 February, it was announced that South Africa would be opening a [[High Commission]] in Fiji. In 2016, Fiji closed its embassy in Pretoria.\n|-\n|{{flagu|United Kingdom}}||<!--Date started-->\n|Foreign Minister Tavola expressed concern on 11 July about moves by the British government to reduce its presence in the Pacific region.  ''\"We were not happy with that and on occasions, informed them of the folly of their decision to downsize their presence in the Pacific,\"'' Tavola said.  Britain has already closed its [[embassy|consulate]] in Kiribati and subsequently closed its missions in Tonga 2005 and Vanuatu in 2006.  Britain has also withdrawn from the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], a regional organization of which it was a founding member and a major donor.\n\nTavola said the British withdrawal could create a power vacuum which others could exploit. A new [[Cold War]] era could come to the Pacific region, he said, with rivalries between China and Taiwan, as well as between China and Japan.\n|-\n|{{flagu|United States}}||<!--Date started-->\n|See [[Fiji-United States relations]]\nBefore the 2006 coup, the US government was highly critical of Fiji, causing tensions between the two countries.\n\nRelations are currently poor, due to the United States' opposition to Fiji's unelected government which took power after the coup d'\u00e9tat in December 2006 and did not allow elections until September 2014.\n|}\n\n== Fijian missions abroad ==\n{{Main|Diplomatic relations of Fiji}}\n\nFiji maintains direct diplomatic or consular relations with countries with historical, cultural, or trading ties to Fiji; Ambassadors stationed in such countries are often accredited to neighbouring countries. Fiji maintains embassies in Belgium (taking care of Fiji's relations with the entire [[European Union]]), China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States; and [[High Commission]]s in Australia, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the United Kingdom and New Zealand (in keeping with the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] practice of calling missions in fellow-commonwealth countries High Commissions rather than Embassies).  Fiji also has a Permanent Mission to the United Nations.\n\n== Foreign reaction to Fijian legislation ==\n{{Main|International reaction to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill}}\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have both expressed concern over legislation currently before the Fijian [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]] (as of June 2005), which proposes to establish a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]], with the power (subject to [[President of Fiji|presidential]] approval) to compensate victims and pardon persons convicted of crimes related to the [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which deposed the elected government in 2000.\n\nOn 30 August 2005, the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Secretary-General [[Don McKinnon]] called on the Fijian government to ensure that the legislation reflected the views of its citizens.  He emphasized, however, that the Commonwealth did not have a position on the bill.\n\n== Fiji and international organizations ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nFiji plays an active role in numerous international bodies. The [[Pacific Islands Forum|South Pacific Forum]] was largely the brainchild of [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]], Fiji's first Prime Minister.  The country has been an outspoken participant many international forums.\n\n=== Commonwealth of Nations ===\n\nFiji has been a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since it gained its independence in 1970.  It was not a member of the Commonwealth between 1987 and 1997 as a result of a republican coup d'\u00e9tat, and was suspended just three years after rejoining between 2000 and 2001 after a military coup, and was suspended after the 2006 coup.\n\nFiji regained its full status as a [[Commonwealth republic]] after the [[Fijian general election]] in 2014.\n\n=== Oceania Customs Organisation ===\nOn 1 September 2005, it was announced that the [[Oceania Customs Organization]] would relocate to Fiji in 2006.  Though located in Fiji, it would be totally independent of the Fijian government and of the [[Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs Authority]] (FIRCA), Finance Minister [[Jone Kubuabola|Ratu Jone Kubuabola]] said, and for the first three years of its presence in Fiji, its secretariat would be financed by the New Zealand government.\n\n=== World Trade Organization ===\nSpeaking at the 18th [[Fiji-Australia Business Forum]] in Sydney on 17 October 2005, Prime Minister Qarase strongly criticized the [[World Trade Organization]], saying that its policies were unfair to small countries like Fiji.  ''\"WTO is trying to impose equality of trade in an unequal world,\"'' he said, ''\"but for developing countries like Fiji there is no level playing field, just a slippery slope.\"''  It would be a long time before Fiji's economy could compete on equal terms with that of more developed nations, he considered.\n\n=== International Labour Organization ===\n\nOn 10 January 2006, the Fijian government criticized the [[International Labour Organization]] for what it said was the organization's unfair treatment of the [[Fiji Islands Congress of Trade Unions]] (FICTU).  Labour MinisterKenneth Zinck]] said the government had received a complaint from FICTU about the ILO's discrimination against it in favour of the rival [[Fiji Trades Union Congress]].\n\n== Diplomatic initiatives ==\nSpeaking at the 6th Session of the [[Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] in New York City on 23 May 2005, [[Isikia Savua]], Fiji's Permanent Representative (Ambassador) to the United Nations, called for equal recognition of individual and collective rights in national and international policies.  He said that Fiji had embodied both concepts in its [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]], through such provisions as [[Communal constituencies|communal voting]] (giving each elector to vote for two members of the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]], one from his or her own ethnic group, and the other from any ethnic group).\n\nOn 1 September 2005, Prime Minister Qarase announced his intention to ask his Australian counterpart, [[John Howard]], for more favourable market access for Pacific Island products.  He called on Australia and New Zealand to revise the rules of origin under the [[SPARTECA]] trade agreement, and reduce the figure from 50 percent to 35 percent, thereby allowing Fiji to export a higher percentage of garments made elsewhere to Australian and New Zealand markets.\n\nOn 28 October 2005, Prime Minister Qarase criticized Australia and New Zealand for refusing to grant temporary work permits to Pacific Islanders.  He said the two countries were acting unfairly in assuming that such permits would encourage illegal immigration.  The Prime Minister claimed that in the absence of such work permits, Pacific Islanders visiting Australia and New Zealand often undertook illegal employment anyway.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fiji}}\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Fiji]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Fiji]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Fiji bilateral relations}}\n{{Template:Foreign relations of Oceania}}\n{{Fiji topics}}\n\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Fiji| ]]\n[[Category:Fiji and the Commonwealth of Nations]]", "sha1": "2sgggjgkxlm5qq0nzlztvpw38k572iu"}}, {"title": "Goal line (gridiron football)", "ns": "0", "id": "10664", "revision": {"id": "853712275", "parentid": "794179020", "timestamp": "2018-08-06T14:30:53Z", "contributor": {"ip": "64.30.65.80"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Steelers Chiefs goal line.jpg|thumb|320px|The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (red) and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (black) line up for a play on the goal line.]]\nThe '''goal line''' is the chalked or painted line dividing the [[end zone]] from the field of play in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]].

The primary and important purposes of tackling are to dispossess an opponent of the ball, to stop the player from gaining ground towards goal or to stop them from carrying out what they intend.\n\nThe word is used in some [[contact sport|contact]] variations of football to describe the act of physically holding or wrestling a player to the ground. In others, it simply describes one or more methods of contesting for possession of the ball. It can therefore be used as both a defensive or attacking move.\n\n== Name origin ==\nIn [[Middle Dutch]], the verb {{lang|dum|tacken|italic=yes}} meant to grab or to handle. By the 14th century, this had come to be used for the equipment used for fishing, referring to the rod and reel, etc., and also for that used in sailing, referring to rigging, equipment, or gear used on ships. By the 18th century, a similar use was applied to harnesses or equipment used with horses. Modern use in football comes from the earlier sport of rugby, where the word was used in the 19th century.\n\n==American and Canadian football{{anchor|American & Canadian football (gridiron football)}}==<!-- This section is linked from [[Tackle for loss]] -->\n[[File:Navy-UMass.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[College football]] game: [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] [[quarterback]] Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada (blue) is tackled by [[UMass Minutemen football|Massachusetts]] [[defensive back]] James Ihedigbo, (white 7), and [[linebacker]] Charles Walker, (white 11).]]\nIn [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], to tackle is to physically interfere with the forward progress of a player in possession of the ball, such that his forward progress ceases and is not resumed, or such that he is caused to touch some part of his body to the ground other than his feet or hands, or such that he is forced to go out of bounds. In any such case, the ball becomes [[dead ball (American football)|dead]], the down is over, and play ceases until the beginning of the next [[football play|play]].\n\nA tackle is known as a [[quarterback sack]] when the [[quarterback]] is tackled at or behind the [[line of scrimmage]] while attempting to throw a pass. A '''tackle for loss''' indicates a tackle that causes a loss of yardage for the opposing running back or wide receiver. This happens when the quarterback is sacked, when either a rusher or a receiver is tackled behind the line of scrimmage, or when the ball is fumbled behind the line of scrimmage and was picked up by an offensive player who does not manage to move past the line before being tackled. When a player who does not have the ball is taken down, it is generally referred to as a block.\n\nTacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often \"tackled\" by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock them to the ground. Tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey (or even hair, should it be long enough and allowed to dangle freely from beneath the helmet) and pulling him to the ground. As mentioned above, the referee can declare that a play is dead if the ball carrier's forward progress has been stopped, even if he has not actually been taken to the ground.\n\nTo protect players from potentially catastrophic injury, there are some restrictions on tackles and blocks. At no time may a defensive player tackle an offensive player by grabbing the facemask of their [[football helmet|helmet]]; doing so incurs a 15-yard penalty and the victimized team is awarded a new set of downs. Although [[spearing (gridiron football)|spear tackles]] are allowed in gridiron football, a player may not use his helmet to tackle an opponent as the technique can cause serious injury to both players (more often the tackler, due to the force of reaction on the tackler, which is apt to be beyond the limit that the neck can handle) and also warrants a 15-yard penalty as well as a fresh set of downs if committed by the defending team; this is known as \"spearing the player\". A similar penalty is assessed to any player attempting to make contact with his helmet against another opponent's helmet, which is known as a [[helmet-to-helmet collision]]. Grabbing a ball carrier by the pads behind his neck and pulling him down is known as a \"horse collar\", a method which has been made illegal at all levels of American football.\n\nIt is also illegal to tackle a player who has thrown a forward pass (generally a quarterback) after he has released the ball; doing so is called \"roughing the passer\" and incurs a 15-yard penalty and a fresh set of downs for the team with the ball. However, in the NFL a player can continue forward for one step, which means that often a player who is committed to attacking the quarterback will still make a tackle. Place kickers and punters are afforded an even greater protection from being tackled.\n\nOnce the play is ruled complete, no contact is permitted; a player who makes contact with an opponent after the play is charged with \"unnecessary roughness\" and his team is assessed a 15-yard penalty.\n\nBlocks that [[clipping (American football)|occur in the back of the legs and below the knees]], [[glossary of American football#C|initiated below the waist]], or [[clothesline (disambiguation)|clothesline]]s are also generally prohibited and players who use them are subject to much more severe penalties than other illegal tackles. However, a player who plays on the line ''can'' block below the knees ([[cut block]]) as long the block is within five yards of the line and the player they block is in front of them and not engaged by another blocker ([[chop block (American Football)#Chop Block|chop block]]).\n\nIn the [[National Football League]] (NFL), tackles are tracked as an unofficial statistic by a scorekeeper hired by the home team. Though the statistic is widely cited, the league does not verify that the counts are accurate.<ref>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Kevin |title=The NFL's Make-Believe Stat |date=October 9, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444897304578044610803692432 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Vymqz75x |archivedate=January 31, 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n== Association football ==\n[[File:Soccer tackle.JPEG|left|thumb|200px|A tackle in [[Association football]]]]\n[[File:Cole Diamanti and Gerrard England-Italy Euro 2012.jpg|thumb|right|333px|[[Alessandro Diamanti]] (blue 22) slide tackles [[Steven Gerrard]] (white 4) at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].]]\n{{see also|Sliding tackle}}\nUnlike other codes, tackles in [[association football]] have to be predominantly directed against the ball rather than the player in possession of it.

If a foul tackle endangers the tackled player's safety, it is likely to be considered as \"violent conduct\" by the referee and punished with a red card (dismissal).  \n\nTackles that involve lunging at an opponent with both legs, regardless of whether the ball is won, are generally considered to constitute serious foul play and hence result in a sending-off.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2092434/Two-footed-challenges-red-cards.html|title=Exclusive: Go two-footed and you're off!

Players not in possession of the ball are not allowed to be tackled, and will receive a [[holding the man]] free kick if tackled.\n\nAs there is no [[offside (sport)|offside rule]] in Australian rules football, players can be tackled from any direction, and are often blindsided.  For this reason, the sport allows players to [[shepherding (Australian rules football)|shepherd]] and bump their opponents within 5 metres of the ball, to protect the ball carrier.\n\nA tackled player must immediately dispose of the ball legally, by [[kick (football)|kicking]] or [[handball (Australian rules football)|handballing]], but not by throwing or dropping the ball. If this is not done, a [[holding the ball]] [[free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]] will be awarded to the tackler. If the ball is knocked free by the tackler, pinned to the player by the tackler, or the player unsuccessfully attempts a kick or handball, a free kick will only be awarded if the ball carrier is deemed to have had a prior opportunity to dispose of the ball prior to being tackled.  If a player has not had prior opportunity to dispose of the ball and a tackler knocks the ball free during a tackle then no free kick is paid and the game continues.\n\nA tackle must only contact below the shoulders and above the knees, and a player is able to be thrown to the ground, so long as the tackle is deemed not to be reckless or likely to cause injury. There are also rules outlawing pushing in the back making tackling more difficult. Tripping, by both hand or foot, is not allowed and can be a [[AFL Tribunal|reportable offence]].\n\nPlayers wear little to no padding to cushion the impact of tackles, however players generally wear mouthguards to protect their teeth. \n\n=== Types of tackles in Australian rules ===\nThere are many types of tackles in Australian rules football:\n* '''perfect tackle''' \u2013 when a player lays a tackle on an opponent that has had prior opportunity to dispose of the ball and in the process makes it impossible for their opponent to dispose of the ball. For example, if a tackler pins an opponent's arm, then the opponent cannot possibly [[handball (Australian rules football)|handball]], and if they pin both arms, then it is nearly impossible to legally execute a kick. A player is almost always rewarded for a perfect tackle (except in the case of a slam tackle \u2013 see below).\n* '''gang tackle''' \u2013 when the player in possession is tackled by more than one opponent at the same time.\n* '''high tackle''' \u2013 any tackle which infringes on the opponent's neck or head. This includes any tackle which slips above the A/C joint. This is illegal and the penalty is a free kick.\n* '''coathanger''' \u2013 slang for high contact to the head, usually by a stiff arm, which causes a player to land flat on their back. It is often accidental due to the high pace of the game. The penalty may be a free kick if deemed accidental or a reportable offence which may result in suspension.\n* '''diving tackle''' \u2013 when a player leaves the ground in attempting to tackle\n* '''slinging''' \u2013 a player ''slung'' to the ground in a tackle\n* '''broken tackle''' \u2013 when a player is able to break free of a tackle\n* '''[[spear tackle]]''' \u2013 also known as a dangerous throw in rugby, it is a [[AFL Tribunal|reportable offence]] and may result in suspension\n* '''push in the back''' \u2013 Any tackle which forces the player forward, into the ground, or both, from behind. This is an illegal tackle and the penalty is a free kick.\n* ''[[bump (football)|bump]]'' or '''hip and shoulder''' tackle is a legal Aussie rules tactic for both dispossession of the player with the ball and also impeding players involved in a contest but not in possession of the ball. The difference between a bump and a tackle is that arms are not used in a bump, which must be made side-on using the hip and or shoulder. Not all bumping is legal, however. Aggressive head on bumping or \"charging\" of a player with the ball is often described as \"rough play\" and is a reportable offence, this is particularly so if a player is deemed to have their head down over the ball in an attempt to picking it up off the ground when the bump is applied or contact is made above the shoulders. Standing ground against an oncoming player, however, is legal.\n* '''slam tackle''' \u2013 relatively new term for a tackle which results in an opponent's head being deliberately slammed to the ground. It is often associated with the pinning of the arms of an opponent so that they cannot cushion the impact of their head on the ground. Although tolerated in days gone by in recent years, in 2009, the AFL branded this a dangerous type of tackle. Incidents in the professional AFL involving [[Byron Pickett]] and [[Darren Milburn]] have come under particular scrutiny.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25043235-23211,00.html AFL not so tackle happy after Darren Milburn's tackle last season] by Bruce Matthews. {{Nowrap|February 12}}, 2009</ref>\n* '''wing tackle''' or '''[[Chicken wing tackle]]''' \u2013 when one arm is pinned in a tackle. After sustaining severe damage from this type of tackle during the [[2009 AFL season]], [[Brent Harvey]] called for this type of tackle to be banned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/afl/story/0,26576,25402009-19742,00.html|title=No Cookies - Herald Sun<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Other tackling methods ===\nAlthough the term \"tackle\" is used in Australian rules to exclusively describe wrapping, holding or wrestling a player in possession, there are also several other ways of contesting possession in Australian rules that other sports would describe as a \"tackle\"  and that also involve a degree of contact.\n\nOther defensive actions are generally categorised as ''[[one percenter (Australian football)|one percenters]]''. The defensive tactic of punching away (commonly known as spoiling) from a player is allowed. ''Smothering'', which involves using the arms or body to get in the way of an opponent's kick as it leaves their boot, and is similar to a ''charge down'' in rugby football.\n\n== Gaelic football ==\n[[Gaelic football]] defines tackling as wresting the ball from an opponent's hands. Bumping is allowed on the player with the ball, but a player cannot be grabbed.\n\n== International rules football ==\n[[International rules football]] is a hybrid game between [[Australian rules football]] and [[Gaelic football]].\nTackling in International Rules is subject to similar rules as Australian rules football, but with some subtle differences. Tackling is only allowed as low as the waist, whereas it is allowed down to the knees in Aussie Rules. One handed tackling has been banned in International Rules since the [[2008 International Rules Series]].\n==Rugby football==\n===Rugby league===\n{{see also|One on one tackle|Dump tackle}}\n[[File:Ftwins.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A tackle in rugby league]]\nIn [[rugby league]] the ball-carrier can be tackled by any number of defenders from any direction. The initial contact in the tackle must be made below the ball carrier's neck or it will be deemed a high tackle and penalised. A tackle in rugby league is completed when any of the following occurs:<ref>http://www.playnrl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ARL-Rules-book-2015.pdf</ref>\n*The attacking player's ball or the hand or arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground while still held by one or more defenders.\n*Although still on his feet, the attacking player's forward momentum has ceased while still held by one or more defender.\n*Being held by a defender, the attacking player makes it evident that he has succumbed to the tackle and wishes to be released in order to play-the-ball.\n*A defender places a hand on the attacking player lying on the ground.\nOnce the tackle is completed, the ball-carrier must be allowed to get to his feet to '[[playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play-the-ball]]' and the defensive team must retreat 10 metres (except 2 markers, facing the tackled player). [[Spear tackle]]s are illegal in rugby league, with most tackles in which the defender is lifted 'above the horizontal' bringing about penalties in the modern game. A stiff arm tackle is an offence. A 2012 New Zealand study found that over 659 tackles are made per game in professional rugby league.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=King D, Hume PA, Clark T |title=Nature of tackles that result in injury in professional rugby league |journal=Hutt Valley District Health Board |pmid=22458826 |doi=10.1080/15438627.2012.660824 |volume=20 |pages=86\u2013104 }}</ref> Of all the [[rugby league positions]], [[second-row forward]] averages the most tackles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Tim |first2=Richard |last2=Beesley |title=Fitness for Rugby League |year=2006 |publisher=coachrugbyleague.com.au |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125024352/http://coachrugbyleague.com.au/Documents/International/Fitness%20for%20Rugby%20League.pdf |url=http://coachrugbyleague.com.au/Documents/International/Fitness%20for%20Rugby%20League.pdf |archivedate=25 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugby union===\n[[File:Rugby tackle cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A diving tackle in rugby union]]\nIn [[rugby union]], a player must be brought to ground for a [[rugby union gameplay|tackle]] to be completed. The tackled player must release the ball, but the ball is not dead and a ''[[ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' forms to contest possession of it. If the ball carrier is not brought to the ground a ''[[rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'' will usually form. High/reckless or stiff arm tackles laws once dictated any contact made above the shoulders was an offence. Now, even if contact starts below the shoulders, if the head is involved in any reckless tackle it results in the offending player being given a yellow card and therefore sin binned. World Rugby now defines a reckless tackle as being any contact where the tackler \"knew or should have known that there was a risk of making contact with the head of an opponent, but did so anyway\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/38322884 |title=High tackles: World Rugby changes rules over head contact |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=14 December 2016 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Non-tackling variants ==\nFor various codes of football, variant codes have been developed which substitute out the tackling element, making the game less physical.

The tackle has the potential to cause severe injuries to the tackled player's neck, legs and ankles. It is considered an \"equipment tackle\", meaning the protective equipment used by the players is what is used to make the tackle (similarly, a face-mask tackle is considered an \"equipment tackle\"). The horse-collar was made infamous by former Dallas Cowboys [[safety (American football position)|free safety]] Roy Williams when he performed it on former Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]].\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Tackle (rugby)}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Gridiron football maneuvers}}\n{{Australian rules football terminology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tackle (Football Move)}}\n[[Category:American football terminology]]\n[[Category:American football plays]]\n[[Category:Rugby union terminology]]\n[[Category:Rugby league terminology]]\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football terminology]]\n[[Category:Laws of Australian rules football]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football tactics and skills]]", "sha1": "c53g7ve54dxt3kes7xi8qm26yu5evqt"}}, {"title": "Play from scrimmage", "ns": "0", "id": "10668", "revision": {"id": "815059421", "parentid": "766715828", "timestamp": "2017-12-12T14:33:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "TheAxeHandle", "id": "29483590"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* The play */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "A '''play from scrimmage''' is the activity of the games of [[Canadian football]] and [[American football]] during which one team tries to advance the ball, get a first [[Down (gridiron football)|down]], or to score, and the other team tries to stop them or take the ball away.  Once a play is over, and before the next [[American football plays|play]] starts, the football is considered [[dead ball (football)|dead]].  A game of American football (or Canadian Football) consists of many (about 120-150) such plays.\n\n==Specifications==\nThe term is also used to denote a specific plan of action, or its execution, under a particular set of circumstances faced by either team.<ref>Shields, Patricia and Rangarajan, Nandhini. 2013. [http://store.newforums.com/A-Playbook-for-Research-Methods-SEB005.htm ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management''] Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press, p. 1.</ref>  For instance, the [[offensive team]] may be faced with one or two [[down (football)|downs]] left in a possession and still ten or more yards to go to earn a new set of downs.  In this instance, they may decide to employ a [[forward pass]].  Well in advance of the particular game, a number of different kinds of [[forward pass]] plays will have been planned out and practiced by the team.  They will be designated by obscure words, letters and/or numbers so that the name of a play does not reveal its exact execution to outsiders.  The team's coach, or perhaps the [[quarterback]], will choose one of the planned [[forward pass]]ing strategies, and tell the team, during the [[huddle]] which one has been chosen.  Because of planning and practice, each player is expected to know what his role in the play is to be, and how to execute it.  This will be the offensive play.\n\nConversely, the [[defensive team]] will know that the offense has to cover a good deal of ground in a single play, will expect a forward pass, and will know from earlier study something of the propensities of the offense they face.  The defensive captain is likely to call out a specific [[football formation|formation]] or defensive play, to anticipate and counteract the expected action by the offense.\n\n==The play==\nThe play will begin with the [[Snap (gridiron football)|snap]] of the ball (typically but not exclusively to the [[quarterback]]), and it will end when the effort by the offensive squad to advance the ball has either succeeded in scoring, or has been frustrated by the ball being [[football down|downed]] before the aim of the offensive play is accomplished, or by the defensive squad having managed to come into possession of the ball without first downing it.  In the event of change of possession during a play, the team newly in possession of the ball may try to advance it toward their opponent's goal, which the team formerly in possession will naturally resist.  Change of possession during a routine play may occur by [[interception]] or by [[fumble]] (often collectively referred to as ''turnovers'').\n\nChange of possession may also occur in other ways.  A change of possession can occur \"on downs\", if the offensive team fails to achieve a [[first down]] or a [[touchdown]] in a specified number of consecutive attempts, known as \"[[Down (gridiron football)|downs]]\" (four in American football; three in Canadian football).  Another way is through a change of possession play, when the offensive team (having perhaps surmised the unlikelihood of scoring or of achieving a [[first down]] within the allowed consecutive attempts to do so) kicks the ball away in what is known as a [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]. A touchdown (and subsequent conversion attempt, whether successful or not) or successful field goal attempt will be followed by a kickoff. [[Kickoff (American football)|Kickoff]]s and [[field goal (football)|field goal attempt]]s are not considered true change of possession plays. An unsuccessful field goal attempt will usually also result in a change of possession (without a kickoff), but is usually not counted as a turnover.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glossary of American football]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Gridiron football plays}}\n\n[[Category:American football terminology]]", "sha1": "srqr74mjb5nudrjy4d7b25b5h3o63sg"}}, {"title": "Football player", "ns": "0", "id": "10669", "revision": {"id": "864690598", "parentid": "864690330", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T20:42:34Z", "contributor": {"username": "BilCat", "id": "2043601"}, "comment": "/* top */ Removed stale tag - nothing on talk page about this after 3 years", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 370\n | footer = \n | image1 = Cristiano Ronaldo 2017.jpg\n | width1 = 253\n | height1 = 160\n | alt1 = [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]\n | caption1 = [[ Cristiano Ronaldo]]\n | image2 = Lionel Messi.png\n | width2 = 124\n | height2 = 160\n | alt2 = Lionel Messi\n | caption2 = Lionel Messi\n }}\n\nA '''football player''' is a [[sportsperson]] who plays one of the different types of [[football]]. The main types of football are [[association football]], [[American football]], [[Canadian football]], [[Australian rules football]], [[Gaelic football]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]].\n\nIt has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world,<ref>{{citation | last = Rolin | first = Jack | contribution = football | title = Britannica Online Encyclopedia | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550852/football }}</ref> and many play the other forms of football.\n\n==Career==\n[[Jean-Pierre Papin]] has described football as a \"universal language\".<ref>{{cite news | last1 = jarass\u00e9 | first1 = anne-c\u00e9cile | last2 = yulia | first2 = k | others = Andrew Burgess (translator) | title = Jean-Pierre Papin: 'Football is a universal language' | url = http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/20539/jean-pierre-papin-football-is-a-universal-language.html | work = [[caf\u00e9babel]] | date = 30 March 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract [[List of sports attendance figures|large crowds of spectators]], and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as [[association football culture]].\n\nFootballers generally begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.\n\n===Wages===\nWages in some top men's leagues are significantly higher than other jobs.

Wages may be much more moderate in other divisions and leagues, and a significant number{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} of players are [[semi-professional]]. For example, the average annual salary for soccer players in the American [[Major League Soccer]] (which started in 2009) for the [[2013 Major League Soccer season|2013 season]] was $148,693, with significant variations depending on player position (goalkeepers for example earned $85,296, whereas forwards earned $251,805<ref>[http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/average-amount-money-professional-soccer-player-per-year-35008.html Average wages of soccer players in MLS]</ref>). \n\nPopularity and average salaries in women's leagues are far lower.

Lange's descriptions of [[Kant]]'s anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European [[Materialism]], Europe's increased concern with science, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. The cultural environment encouraged him to expand his horizons beyond philology and continue his study of philosophy,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} although Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pence |first=Charles H. |title=Nietzsche's aesthetic critique of Darwin |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=165\u201390 |year=2011 |pmid=22288334 |url=https://www.academia.edu/759427/Nietzsches_Aesthetic_Critique_of_Darwin}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg.

His inaugural lecture at the university was \"[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]\". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.<ref>Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n\nNietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle\u2014including [[Franz Liszt]], of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: \"Liszt or the art of running after women!\".<ref>[[Rupert Hughes]], [http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/11419/1.html#gsc.tab=0 ''The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Volume 2''].</ref> Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of \"The Genesis of the Tragic Idea\" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.\n\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, c. 1872]]\nIn 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: \"[[David Strauss]]: the Confessor and the Writer\", \"On the Use and Abuse of History for Life\", \"Schopenhauer as Educator\" and \"Richard Wagner in Bayreuth\". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]. He also began a friendship with [[Paul R\u00e9e]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of \"German culture\", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.\n\nWith the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorism]]s ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''<ref>Safranski, R\u00fcdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W. W. Norton & Company, 2003. \"This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I \u00a718).\"</ref> and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.\n\n===Independent philosopher (1879\u20131888)===\n{{anchor|independent philosopher|philosopher}}\n[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9|Lou Salom\u00e9]], [[Paul R\u00e9e]] and Nietzsche in 1882 as the three traveled through Italy, planning to establish an educational commune together, but the friendship disintegrated in late 1882 due to complications from R\u00e9e and Nietzsche's mutual romantic interest in Salom\u00e9]]\nLiving off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French conquest of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.<ref>{{Citation|first=Stephan |last=G\u00fcntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |publisher=The [[Pennsylvania State University Press]] |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=15 October 2003 |language=English, German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184745/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}; republished on HyperNietzsche.</ref> Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.\n\nWhile in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Sale and popular use|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, [[Heinrich K\u00f6selitz]] or [[Heinrich K\u00f6selitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul R\u00e9e.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as \"superfluous\" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}\n\nTo the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.\n\nIn 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9]],<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9 |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}</ref> through Malwida von Meysenbug and [[Paul R\u00e9e]].\n\nSalom\u00e9's mother took her to Rome when Salom\u00e9 was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salom\u00e9 became acquainted with [[Paul R\u00e9e]]. R\u00e9e proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as 'brother and sister', along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} R\u00e9e accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salome, as R\u00e9e had done.  Nietzsche asked R\u00e9e to propose marriage to Salome, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with R\u00e9e and Salome touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune.  The three traveled with Salom\u00e9's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their \"Winterplan\" commune.   This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found.  On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.\n.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the \"immoral woman\".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=151}} \nNietzsche and Salom\u00e9 spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salom\u00e9 reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Arriving in [[Leipzig]], (Germany) in October, Salom\u00e9 and R\u00e9e separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salom\u00e9, in which Salom\u00e9 believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.\n\nWhile the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month R\u00e9e and Salome ditched Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to R\u00e9e, stating \"We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?\"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}} In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salome both on Salome, R\u00e9e, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of Salome and R\u00e9e to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt \"genuine hatred for my sister.\"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}}\n\nAmidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salom\u00e9, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days.\n\n[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|Photo of Nietzsche by {{ill|Gustav Adolf Schultze|de}}, 1882]]\nBy 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of [[opium]], but he was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them \"Dr. Nietzsche\".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}\n\nAfter severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].\n\nIn 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent \"feelings of revenge and resentment\" embittered him: \"And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils.\"<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast \u2013 August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as \"completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump\" of Schmeitzner\u2014associating the publisher with a movement that should be \"utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].\n\nIn 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard F\u00f6rster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a \"Germanic\" colony\u2014a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title= |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |edition=online |contribution=F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=10 October 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.\n\nIn 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast \u2013 March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.</ref> He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Relation to S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to [[Copenhagen]] and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.<ref>{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche.

In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and \"fate\". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface\u2014which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate\u2014he declares, \"Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else.\"{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]''.\n\n===Psychological illness and death (1889\u20131900)===\n{{anchor|mental breakdown and death|breakdown|death}}\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche drawn by Hans Olde.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing by [[Hans Olde]] from the photographic series, ''The Ill Nietzsche'', late 1899]]\n[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin]] house where Nietzsche stayed (background) seen from Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown (at left: rear fa\u00e7ade of [[Palazzo Carignano]])]]\nOn 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a [[mental breakdown]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Magnus|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Higgins|editor2-first=Kathleen Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521367677|pages=79\u201381|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Xeb80itrlRIC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}</ref> Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin]]. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=67}}<ref>Anacleto Verrecchia, \"Nietzsche's Breakdown in Turin,\" in ''Nietzsche in Italy'', ed. Thomas Harrison (Stanford University: ANMA Libri, 1988) 105\u201312</ref>\n\nIn the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings\u2014known as the ''Wahnzettel'' (\"Madness Letters\")\u2014to a number of friends including [[Cosima Wagner]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Most of them were signed \"[[Dionysos]]\", though some were also signed \"der Gekreuzigte\" meaning \"the crucified one\". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: \"I have had [[Caiaphas]] put in [[fetters]]. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner.

The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in [[Jena]] under the direction of [[Otto Binswanger]]. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian [[Julius Langbehn]] attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', but the publisher [[C. G. Naumann]] secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing ''The Antichrist'' and ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.{{Chronology citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from [[Nueva Germania]] in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in [[Weimar]], where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including [[Rudolf Steiner]] (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising Nietzsche),<ref>{{Citation |first=Rudolf |last=Steiner |title=Friedrich Nietzsche, ein K\u00e4mpfer gegen seine Zeit |place=Weimar |year=1895}}</ref>{{Rp |needed=yes|date=April 2012}} to meet her uncommunicative brother.

Even though the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the poet [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin|H\u00f6lderlin]] had already spoken of it, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] had talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled \"On Music and Words\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm |title=On Music and words}}</ref> In it he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and drama, which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from music.\n\nNietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian ''Kunsttrieben'' (\"artistic impulses\") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek [[tragedians]]. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy.

Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category\u2014he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche |title=Procrastination in Shakespeare's Hamlet}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)}}</ref> For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity'', which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables making of any art.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=The role of art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}</ref> Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:\n\n<blockquote>In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power\u2014until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is\u2014art.</blockquote>\n\nNietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its ''Untergang'' (literally \"going under\" or \"downward-way,\" meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued with this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian and thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/ |title=Dionysus versus Apollo}}</ref> He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion.

He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. \"A thousand goals have there been so far,\" says Zarathustra, \"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \"On The Thousand And One Goals\". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding.

For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of ''good and bad'' toward ''good and evil''.\n\nThe initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower [[caste]]s such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this \"master morality\" as the original system of morality\u2014perhaps best associated with [[Homer]]ic Greece. To be \"good\" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be \"bad\" was to be like the slaves the aristocracy ruled over: poor, weak, sick, pathetic\u2014an object of pity or disgust rather than hatred.\n\n\"Slave morality\" comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabeling it as \"meekness\". The \"good man\" of master morality is precisely the \"evil man\" of slave morality, while the \"bad man\" is recast as the \"good man\".\n\nNietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are \"[[motley]]\"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own \"inner law\". A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: \"Become what you are.\"\n\nA long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&pg=PA213&dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism|isbn=0691013675|author1=Kaufmann|first1=Walter Arnold|year=1980}}</ref> On the other hand, it is clear from his own writings that Nietzsche wanted the victory of master morality. He linked the \"salvation and future of the human race with the unconditional dominance\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1887|isbn=|location=|pages=First essay, section 16}}</ref> of master morality and called master morality \"a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecce Homo|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1908|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter on The Case of Wagner, section 2}}</ref> Just as \"there is an order of rank between man and man,\" there is also an order of rank \"between morality and morality.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1886|isbn=|location=|pages=Section 228}}</ref> Indeed, Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his \"revaluation of all values\" in order to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the \"philosophy of the future\" (''Beyond Good and Evil'' is subtitled ''Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=31\u201338, 60\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', Nietzsche begins his \"Campaign against Morality\".{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an \"immoralist\" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]].

''Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits'', Univ. of Nebraska Press (1986) p. 231</ref>\n\n===Death of God and nihilism===\n{{Main|God is dead|Nihilism}}\nThe statement \"[[God is dead]]\", occurring in several of Nietzsche's works (notably in ''[[The Gay Science]]''), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, most commentators<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=0-8371-7404-X}}</ref> regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the [[Abrahamic]] God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism\u2014the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, \"If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself.\"{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}\n\nOne such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine\u2014which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Buddhism in the West#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]\u2014advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a \"will to nothingness\", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:<ref>This \"will to nothingness\" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7</ref>\n\n{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: this 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos\u2014an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power'', section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}\n\nNietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has \"become conscious\" in him.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]</ref> Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that \"I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!\"<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.</ref> According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement \"God is dead\".\n\n===Will to power===\n{{Main|Will to power}}\nA basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the \"[[will to power]]\" (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior\u2014more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, \u00a714}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.\n\nIn presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,<ref>[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p. 121</ref> and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''\u2014it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions\u2014in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=\u00a72}}\n\nRelated to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a736}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter\u2014that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of [[atomism]]\u2014the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.<ref>Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, \"Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story\", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.</ref>{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a712}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as \"the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation\" revealing the will to power as \"the principle of the synthesis of forces.\"{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, \u00a722}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than aphorism 36 in ''Beyond Good and Evil'', where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nie/summary/v031/31.1leddy.html |title=Project MUSE \u2013 Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Eternal return===\n{{Main|Eternal return}}\n\n\"Eternal return\" (also known as \"eternal recurrence\") is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space.

Finally, \"(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion.\" Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153).

Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to a mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution.\"{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |p=18}} Zarathustra presents the overman as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The overman does not follow morality of common people since that favors mediocrity but instead rises above the notion of [[good and evil]] and above the \"[[Herd behavior|herd]]\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html |title=Philosophy 302: Ethics Nietzsche, \"Slave and Master Morality\"}}</ref> In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of overman. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the [[superstition]] beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thus-spoke-zarathustra/study-guide/major-themes/ |title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra themes}}</ref>{{better source|date=July 2018}}\n\nWhile interpretations of Nietzsche's overman vary wildly, here is one of his quotations from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (Prologue, \u00a7\u00a73\u20134):\n\n{{quote|text=I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughing stock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman\u2014a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.}}\n\nZarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060856/http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\nThe Nazis tried to incorporate the concept into their ideology. After his death, [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914\u20131918|German nationalist]] ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]]. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]];<ref>Golomb, Jacob and Robert S. Wistrich (eds.), 2002, ''Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?: On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy.'' Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.</ref> 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. \n\nAlthough Nietzsche has famously been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticized anti-Semitism, [[pan-Germanism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[nationalism]].<ref>Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist,'' Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33-34.</ref> Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with [[Richard Wagner]], expressed in ''[[The Case of Wagner]]'' and ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]],'' both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism &mdash; and also of his rallying to Christianity.

His views stand against the concept of popular culture. He believed the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity. Nietzsche saw a lack of intellectual progress, leading to the decline of the human species. According to Nietzsche, individuals needed to overcome this form of mass culture.

While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a \"lost link\" in the development of his thought. \"In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche.\"{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of \"flux\" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as \"child play\" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37\u201339}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}\n\nIn his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was \"an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche.\"{{Sfn|Santayana|1916|p=114}}\n\nNietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re|La Bruy\u00e8re]] and [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]],<ref>Brendan Donnellan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/404869 \"Nietzsche and La Rochefoucauld\"] in ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (May 1979), pp. 303\u201318</ref> as well as for [[Stendhal]].{{Sfn|Nietzsche|1888d|loc=\"Why I am So Clever\", \u00a73}} The [[organicism]] of [[Paul Bourget]] influenced Nietzsche,<ref>Johan Grzelczyk, [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 \"F\u00e9r\u00e9 et Nietzsche: au sujet de la d\u00e9cadence\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116213847/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''HyperNietzsche'', 1 November 2005 {{fr icon}}.

His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', combined songs in conventional [[rock and roll]] format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound [[collage]]s. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.\n\nZappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed \"Project/Object\", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.<ref name=\"semley2012\"/> His lyrics reflected his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so. Zappa's often comedic lyrics led [[AllMusic]] to describe him as the \"godfather\" of [[comedy rock]].<ref name=\"Comedy rock\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>  He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he personally disapproved of drugs and never used them again after briefly trying marijuana,<ref name=\"Loder 1988\">{{cite news |title=Rolling Stone Interview|year=1988|first=Kurt|last=Loder|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> but supported their decriminalization and regulation.\n\nDuring Zappa's lifetime, he was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth. He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an [[independent music|independent artist]] for most of his career. He remains a major influence on musicians and composers. His honors include his 1995 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the 1997 [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|29}} Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began<ref name=\"idol\"/> when he read a ''[[Look (American magazine)|LOOK]]'' magazine article about the [[Sam Goody]] record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as ''The Complete Works of Edgard Var\u00e8se, Volume One''.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|30\u201333}} The article described [[Edgard Var\u00e8se|Var\u00e8se's]] percussion composition ''[[Ionisation (Var\u00e8se)|Ionisation]]'', produced by [[EMS Recordings]], as \"a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds\". Zappa decided to seek out Var\u00e8se's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the \"mad scientist\" looking photo of Var\u00e8se on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|30\u201333}} Thus began his lifelong passion for Var\u00e8se's music and that of other modern classical composers. He also liked the Italian classical music listened by his grandparents, especially [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s opera arias.\n\n[[File:Frank Zappa HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|upright|Zappa's senior yearbook photo, 1958]]\nBy 1956, the Zappa family had moved to [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], a small [[aerospace]] and farming town in the [[Antelope Valley]] of the [[Mojave Desert]] close to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; he would later refer to Sun Village (a town close to Lancaster) in the 1973 track \"Village of the Sun\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Roxy_and_Elsewhere.html#Village|title=Lyrics of Village Of The Sun|first=Frank|last=Zappa|date=December 1973|work=Village Of The Sun, Roxy and Elsewhere|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}</ref> Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Var\u00e8se's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|30\u201333}} Unfortunately, Var\u00e8se was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife and she suggested he call back later.

This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances\u2014which used songs to build sketches based on ''200 Motels'' scenes, as well as new situations that often portrayed the band members' sexual encounters on the road.<ref name=miles />{{rp|203\u201304}}{{refn|group=nb|During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]].

While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|112\u2013115}} Immortalized in [[Deep Purple]]'s song \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' compilation.

During the encore, audience member Trevor Howell pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed\u2014he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|112\u2013115}}\n\nThis attack resulted in an extended period of wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed \"shorter than the other\" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs \"Zomby Woof\" and \"[[Dancin' Fool]]\"), resulting in chronic back pain.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|112\u2013115}} Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.\n\nDuring 1971\u201372 Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni.<ref name=lowe />{{rp|101}} Musically, the albums were akin to ''Hot Rats,'' in that they featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing.<ref name=miles />{{rp|225\u201326}} Zappa began touring again in late 1972.<ref name=miles />{{rp|225\u201326}} His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece [[big band]] referred to as the Grand Wazoo.

''L\u00e4ther'' encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles\u2014rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos.

It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative.

In the APG II circumscription, this order includes the families [[Fabaceae]] or legumes (including the subfamilies [[Caesalpinioideae]], [[Mimosoideae]], and [[Faboideae]]), [[Quillajaceae]], [[Polygalaceae]] or milkworts (including the families [[Diclidantheraceae]], [[Moutabeaceae]], and [[Xanthophyllaceae]]), and [[Surianaceae]]. Under the  [[Cronquist system]] and some other plant classification systems, the order Fabales contains only the family Fabaceae. In the classification system of [[Rolf Dahlgren|Dahlgren]] the Fabales were in the [[superorder]] Fabiflorae (also called Fabanae) with three familiese corresponding to the subfamilies of Fabaceae in APG II. The other families treated in the Fabales by the APG II classification were placed in separate orders by Cronquist, the Polygalaceae within its own order, the [[Polygalales]], and the Quillajaceae and Surianaceae within the [[Rosales]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe Fabaceae, as the third-largest plant family in the world, contain most of the diversity of the Fabales, the other families making up a comparatively small portion of the order's diversity. Research in the order is largely focused on the Fabaceae, due in part to its great biological diversity, and to its importance as food plants. The Polygalaceae are fairly well researched among plant families, in part due to the large diversity of the genus ''[[Polygala]]'', and other members of the family being food plants for various [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Janz|first = N|author2=S Nylin|title = Butterflies and plants: A phylogenetic study|journal = Evolution|volume = 52|issue = 2|pages = 486\u2013502|publisher = [[Society for the Study of Evolution]]|year = 1998|jstor = 2411084|doi = 10.2307/2411084|pmid = 28568350}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = DeVries|first = PJ|author2=AI Chacon|title = Toward a better understanding of host use and biodiversity in riodinid butterflies|journal = Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera|volume = 31|issue = 1\u20132|pages = 103\u2013126|year = 1992}}</ref>  While taxonomists using [[Molecular systematics|molecular phylogenetic techniques]] find strong support for the order, questions remain about the morphological relationships of the Quillajaceae and Surianaceae to the rest of the order, due in part to limited research on these families.<ref>{{cite journal|last =  Morgan|first = DR |author2=Soltis, DE |author3=Robertson KR|title = Systematic and evolutionary implications of rbcL sequence variation in Rosaceae|journal = [[American Journal of Botany]]|volume = 81|issue = 7|pages = 890\u2013903|publisher = Botanical Society of America|date = July 1994|doi = 10.2307/2445770|jstor = 2445770}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nThe Fabales are a [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] order of plants, except only the subfamily [[Papilionoideae]] (Faboideae) of the Fabaceae are well dispersed throughout the northern part of the [[Temperate|North Temperate Zone]].<ref>{{cite web|last =  Stevens|first = PF|title = Angiosperm Phylogeny Website|publisher = Missouri Botanical Garden|date = 7 May 2006|url = http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/| accessdate = 2006-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nImage:Lathyrus tuberosa (Guixa).jpg|Tuberous pea (''[[Lathyrus tuberosus]]'') of the [[Fabaceae]]\nImage:Quillaja saponaria.jpg|Soap bark tree (''[[Quillaja saponaria]]'') of the [[Quillaja]]ceae \nImage:Polygala myrtifolia0.jpg|[[Polygala|Milkwort]] (''Polygala myrtifolia'') of the [[Polygalaceae]]\nFile:Polygala elongata in Talakona, AP I IMG 8388.jpg|[[Polygala|Milkwort]] (''Polygala elongata'') of the [[Polygalaceae]]\nImage:Suriana maritima flowers.JPG|Bay cedar (''[[Suriana maritima]]'' of the [[Surianaceae]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Fabales}}\n{{Wikispecies}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q21878}}\n\n[[Category:Fabales| ]]\n[[Category:Rosid orders]]\n[[Category:Angiosperm orders]]", "sha1": "sa31uyqw2wdv4v3b5kkmla39nbouuo2"}}, {"title": "French", "ns": "0", "id": "10676", "revision": {"id": "866507986", "parentid": "866507979", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T19:27:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/198.236.235.64|198.236.235.64]] to version by Lectonar.

As a result, it is often the first variant learned by new players. It is commonly played in home games but rarely played in [[casino]] and [[poker tournament|tournament]] play.  The variant is also offered by some [[online poker|online]] venues, although it is not as popular as other variants such as [[Seven-card stud]] and [[Texas hold 'em]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn casino play the first betting round begins with the player to the left of the big [[Betting (poker)#Blinds|blind]], and subsequent rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left.  Home games typically use an [[Betting (poker)#Ante|ante]]; the first betting round begins with the player to the dealer's left, and the second round begins with the player who [[Betting (poker)#Open|open]]ed the first round.\n\nPlay begins with each player being dealt five cards, one at a time, all face down.  The remaining deck is placed aside, often protected by placing a chip or other marker on it.  Players pick up the cards and hold them in their hands, being careful to keep them concealed from the other players, then a round of [[Betting (poker)|betting]] occurs.\n\nIf more than one player remains after the first round, the \"draw\" phase begins.  Each player specifies how many of their cards they wish to replace and discards them.  The deck is retrieved, and each player is dealt in turn from the deck the same number of cards they discarded so that each player again has five cards.  \n\nA second \"after the draw\" betting round occurs beginning with the player to the dealer's left or else beginning with the player who opened the first round (the latter is common when antes are used instead of blinds).  This is followed by a [[Showdown (poker)|showdown]], if more than one player remains, in which the player with the best [[Hand (poker)|hand]] wins the pot.\n\n==House rules==\nA common \"house rule\" in some places is that a player may not replace more than three cards, unless they draw four cards while keeping an [[ace]] (or [[Wild card (card games)|wild card]]).  This rule is useful for low-stakes social games where many players will stay for the draw, and will help avoid depletion of the deck.  In more serious games such as those played in casinos it is unnecessary and generally not used.  However, a rule used by many casinos is that a player is not allowed to draw five consecutive cards from the deck.  In this case, if a player wishes to replace all five of their cards, that player is given four of them in turn, the other players are given their draws, and then the dealer returns to that player to give the fifth replacement card; if no other player draws it is necessary to deal a [[burn card]] first.\n\nAnother common house rule is that the bottom card of the deck is never given as a replacement, to avoid the possibility of someone who might have seen it during the deal using that information.  If the deck is depleted during the draw before all players have received their replacements, the last players can receive cards chosen randomly from among those discarded by previous players.  For example, if the last player to draw wants three replacements but there are only two cards remaining in the deck, the dealer gives the player the one top card he can give, then shuffles together the bottom card of the deck, the burn card, and the earlier players' discards (but not the player's own discards), and finally deals two more replacements to the last player.\n\n==Sample deal==\n[[Image:Draw-poker-table.png|200px|right]]\nThe sample deal is being played by four players as shown to the right with Alice dealing. All four players ante $1.  Alice deals five cards to each player and places the deck aside.\n\nBob opens the betting round by betting $5.  Carol folds, David calls, and Alice calls, closing the betting round.\n\nBob now declares that he wishes to replace three of his cards, so he removes those three cards from his hand and discards them.  Alice retrieves the deck, deals a burn card, then deals three cards directly to Bob, who puts them in his hand.  David discards one card, and Alice deals one card to him from the deck.  Alice now discards three of her own cards, and replaces them with three from the top of the deck (Note: in a player-dealt casino game there is often a rule that the dealer must discard before picking up the deck, but this is a home game so we won't worry about such details).\n\nNow a second betting round begins. Bob [[Betting (poker)#Check|checks]], David checks, Alice bets $10, Bob folds, David raises $16, and Alice calls, ending the second betting round and going directly into a [[Showdown (poker)|showdown]].  David shows a [[Flush (poker)|flush]], and Alice shows [[two pair]], so David takes the [[Pot (poker)|pot]].\n\n== Stripped deck variant ==\nFive-card draw is sometimes played with a [[stripped deck]]. This variant is commonly known as \"seven-to-ace\" or \"ace-to-seven\" (abbreviated as A-7 or 7-A). It can be played by up to five players. When four or fewer players play, a normal 32-card deck without jokers, with ranks ranging from ace to seven, is used. With five players, the sixes are added to make a 36-card deck. The deck thus contains only eight or nine different card ranks, compared to 13 in a standard deck. This affects the probabilities of making specific hands, so a [[flush (poker)|flush]] ranks above a [[full house (poker)|full house]] and below [[List of poker hands#Four of a kind|four of a kind]]. Many smaller [[online poker]] rooms, such as [[Boss Media]], spread the variant, although it is unheard of in land casinos.\n\n==Math of Five-card draw==\n{{seealso|Poker probability}}\n; Pre-draw odds of getting each hand\n\n* Royal flush\t<0.001%\t\t\t\t\t\n* Straight flush (not including royal flush)\t<0.002%\t\t\t\t\t\n* Four of a kind\t0.02%\t\t\t\t\t\n* Full house\t0.14%\t\t\t\t\t\n* Flush (excluding royal flush and straight flush)\t0.20%\t\t\t\t\t\n* Straight (excluding royal flush and straight flush)\t0.39%\t\t\t\t\t\n* Three of a kind\t2.11%\t\t\t\t\t\n* Two pair\t4.75%\t\t\t\t\t\n* One pair\t42.30%\t\t\t\t\t\n* No pair / High card\t50.10%\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Draw poker]]\n* [[Poker strategy]]\n\n{{Poker footer}}\n[[Category:Draw poker]]", "sha1": "n8d3gacto0dhml9416uuvl79jgmumzz"}}, {"title": "Flaming (Internet)", "ns": "0", "id": "10680", "revision": {"id": "864541629", "parentid": "864220002", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T21:58:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Carolyncunningham", "id": "34100177"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=November 2016}}\n'''Flaming''' is the online act of posting insults, often laced with profanity or other offensive language on social networking sites. These insults may turn into flame wars where two or more individuals unite to exchange or unite against a third party with verbal attacks. Many attribute the emergence of flaming to the anonymity that internet forums provide. Anonymity can lead to disinhibition, which results in the swearing, offensive and hostile language characteristic of flaming. More than just anonymity contributes to the offensive behaviors of flaming such as lack of social cues, less accountability of face-to-face communications, textual mediation and deindividualization are also probable factors.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}</ref>\n\nWhile these behaviors may be common or expected in some forums they can have dramatic, adverse affects in others.

Furthermore, within a single individual, mental models change with time, even during the flow of a single conversation. The human mind assembles a few relationships to fit the context of a discussion. As debate shifts, so do the mental models. Even when only a single topic is being discussed, each participant in a conversation employs a different mental model to interpret the subject. Fundamental assumptions differ but are never brought into the open. Goals are different but left unstated.\n\nIt is little wonder that compromise takes so long. And even when consensus is reached, the underlying assumptions may be fallacies that lead to laws and programs that fail. The human mind is not adapted to understanding correctly the consequences implied by a mental model. A mental model may be correct in structure and assumptions but, even so, the human mind\u2014either individually or as a group consensus\u2014is apt to draw the wrong implications for the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/Roadmaps/RM1/D-4468-2.pdf |title=Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems |author=Jay W.

Without social context, users are often helpless to know the intentions of their counterparts. In addition to the problems of conflicting mental models often present in online discussions, the inherent lack of face-to-face communication online can encourage hostility. Professor Norman Johnson, commenting on the propensity of Internet posters to flame one another, states:\n<blockquote>\nThe literature suggests that, compared to face-to-face, the increased incidence of flaming when using [[computer-mediated communication]] is due to reductions in the transfer of social cues, which decrease individuals' concern for social evaluation and fear of social sanctions or reprisals. When social identity and ingroup status are salient, computer mediation can decrease flaming because individuals focus their attention on the social context (and associated norms) rather than themselves.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Norman A. |title=Anger and flaming in computer-mediated negotiations among strangers |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=46 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pages=660\u2013672 |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2008.10.008 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGenerally, a lack of social context creates an element of anonymity, which allows users to feel insulated from the forms of punishment they might receive in a more conventional setting. Johnson identifies several precursors to flaming between users, whom he refers to as \"negotiation partners,\" since Internet communication typically involves back-and-forth interactions similar to a negotiation. Flaming incidents usually arise in response to a perception of one or more negotiation partners being unfair. Perceived unfairness can include a lack of consideration for an individual's vested interests, unfavorable treatment (especially when the flamer has been considerate of other users), and misunderstandings aggravated by the inability to convey subtle indicators like [[non-verbal]] cues and [[facial expression]]s.<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n==History==\nEvidence of debates which resulted in insults being exchanged quickly back and forth between two parties can be found throughout history. Arguments over the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] were often socially and emotionally heated and intense, with many attacking one another through local newspapers. Such interactions have always been part of literary criticism. For example, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s contempt for [[Jane Austen]]'s works often extended to the author herself, with Emerson describing her as \"without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world\". In turn, [[Thomas Carlyle]] called Emerson a \"hoary-headed toothless baboon\".<ref name=\"reid\">Goldsborough, Reid. \"How to Respond to Flames (Without Getting Singed).\"  ''Information Today'', February 2005.</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], \"flaming\" was used at East Coast [[engineering]] schools in the United States as a present participle in a crude expression to describe an irascible individual and by extension to such individuals on the earliest [[Internet]] chat rooms and [[message board]]s. Internet flaming was mostly observed in [[Usenet]] newsgroups although it was known to occur in the [[WWIVnet]] and [[FidoNet]] computer networks as well. It was subsequently used in other parts of speech with much the same meaning.\n\nThe term \"flaming\" may originate from ''The Hacker's Dictionary'',<ref>Steele, G., Woods, D., Finkel, R., Crispin, M., Stallman, R., and Goodfellow, G. (1983). ''The Hacker's Dictionary'', 1983.</ref> which in 1983 defined it as \"''to speak rabidly or incessantly on an uninteresting topic or with a patently ridiculous attitude''\". The meaning of the word has diverged from this definition since then.\n\n[[Jerry Pournelle]] in 1986 explained why he wanted a [[kill file]] for [[Byte Information Exchange|BIX]]:<ref name=\"pournelle198603\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-03/1986_03_BYTE_11-03_Homebound_Computing#page/n281/mode/2up | title=All Sorts of Software | work=BYTE | date=March 1986 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=269}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|whereas an open computer conference begins with a small number of well-informed and highly interested participants, it soon attracts others.

Tempers are frayed.\n\nThe result is that while computer conferencing began by saving time, it starts to eat up all the time it saved and more. Communications come from dozens of sources. Much of it is redundant. Some of it is stupid. The user spends more and more time dealing with irrelevancies. One day the user wakes up, decides the initial euphoria was spurious, and logs off, never to return. This is known as burnout, and it's apparently quite common.}}\n\nHe added, \"I noticed something: most of the irritation came from a handful of people, sometimes only one or two.

Specifically, the literature has described aggressive, insulting behavior as \"flaming\", which has been defined as hostile verbal behaviors (Thompsen and Foulger, 1996), the uninhibited expression of hostility, insults, and ridicule (Kayany, 1998), and hostile comments directed towards a person or organization (Aiken and Waller, 2000) within the context of CMC.<ref>Hutchens, M.

In 2012, it was announced that the US State Department would start flame trolling jihadists as part of Operation Viral Peace.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/19/viral_peace_plans_to_combat_terrorism_by_trolling_jihadi_forums_.html New Strategy in the War on Terror].</ref>\n\n===Flame war===\nA flame war results when multiple users engage in provocative responses to an original post\u2014while the original post is sometimes flamebait, this is not always the case. Flame wars often draw in many users (including those trying to defuse the flame war) and can overshadow regular forum discussion if left unchecked.\n\nResolving a flame war can be difficult, as it is often hard to determine who is really responsible for the degradation of a reasonable discussion into flame war. Someone who posts a contrary opinion in a strongly focused discussion forum may be easily labeled a \"baiter\", \"flamer\", or \"troll\".\n\nAn approach to resolving a flame war or responding to flaming is to communicate openly with the offending users. Acknowledging mistakes, offering to help resolve the disagreement, making clear, reasoned arguments, and even self-deprecation have all been noted as worthwhile strategies to end such disputes. However, others prefer to simply ignore flaming, noting that, in many cases, if the flamebait receives no attention, it will quickly be forgotten as forum discussions carry on.<ref name=\"reid\" />  Unfortunately, this can motivate trolls to intensify their activities, creating additional distractions.\n\n\"Taking the bait\" or \"feeding the troll\" refers to someone who responds to the original message regardless of whether they are aware the original message was intended to provoke a response. Often when someone takes the bait, others will point this out to them with the [[acronym]] \"YHBT\", which is short for \"You have been trolled\", or reply with \"don't feed the trolls\". Forum users will usually not give the troll acknowledgement; that just \"feeds the troll\".\n\n==Examples==\nAny subject of a polarizing nature can feasibly cause flaming. As one would expect in the medium of the Internet, technology is a common topic. The Holy war perennial debates between users of competing operating systems, such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], or the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] operating system and [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system, users of [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] processors, and users of the [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] video game systems,  often escalate into seemingly unending \"flamewars\", also called [[software wars]]. As each successive technology is released, it develops its own outspoken fan base, allowing arguments to begin anew.\n\nPopular culture continues to generate large amounts of flaming and countless flamewars across the Internet, such as the constant debates between fans of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Ongoing discussion of current celebrities and television personalities within popular culture also frequently sparks debate.\n\nIn 2005, author [[Anne Rice]] became involved in a flamewar of sorts on the review boards of online retailer [[Amazon.com]] after several reviewers posted scathing comments about her latest novel.  Rice responded to the comments with her own lengthy response, which was quickly met with more feedback from users.<ref name=\"reid\"  />\n\nIn November 2007, the popular audio-visual discussion site AVS Forum temporarily closed its [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] discussion forums because of, as the site reported, \"physical threats that have involved police and possible legal action\" between [[High definition optical disc format war|advocates of the rival formats]].<ref name=\"moskovciak20071107\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/format-war-fanboys-shut-down-avs-forum/ | title=Format war fanboys shut down AVS Forum | publisher=CNet | date=2007-11-07 | accessdate=6 July 2014 | author=Moskovciak, Matthew}}</ref>\n\n==Legal implications==\nFlaming varies in severity and as such so too does the reaction of states in imposing any sort of sanction.<ref>P.

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]. This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> His creative period spanned more than 70 years.\n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home in [[Broadacre City]], his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.  In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and  other structures. He often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and [[stained glass]]. Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as \"the greatest American architect of all time\".<ref name=\"Brewster\" />\n\nHis colorful personal life often made headlines, notably for leaving his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin for [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]], the murders at his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin estate]] in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel, and his relationship with [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]], who became his third wife in 1928.\n\n==Early years==\n===Ancestry===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born Frank Lincoln Wright in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]], United States, in 1867. His father, William Cary Wright (1825\u20131904),<ref>Huxtable, Ada Louise, ''Frank Lloyd Wright: A Life'', London: Penguin, 2004.</ref> was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister.  Wright's mother, Anna Lloyd Jones (1838/39 \u2013 1923), met William Cary Wright while working as a county school teacher when William was the superintendent of schools for [[Richland County, Wisconsin|Richland County]].\n\nOriginally from [[Massachusetts]], William Wright had been a [[Baptist]] minister, but he later joined his wife's family in the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith. Anna was a member of the well-known Lloyd Jones family who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to Spring Green, Wisconsin. One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.\n\n===Childhood===\nAccording to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|page=58}}</ref> In 1870, the family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where William ministered to a small congregation.\n\nIn 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \"For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top\u2026 and played\u2026 with the cube, the sphere and the triangle\u2014these smooth wooden maple blocks\u2026 All are in my fingers to this day\u2026 \"<ref>Alofsin, Anthony (1993).

Architecture and Geometry in the Age of the Baroque. University of Chicago Press. p. 205. {{ISBN|0-226-32783-3}}.</ref> Many of Wright's buildings are notable for their geometrical clarity.\n\nThe Wright family struggled financially in Weymouth and returned to Spring Green, where the supportive Lloyd Jones clan could help William find employment. They settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with his children.\n\nSoon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. Anna had been unhappy for some time with William's inability to provide for his family and asked him to leave. The divorce was finalized in 1885 after William sued Anna for lack of physical affection. William left Wisconsin after the divorce, and Wright claimed he never saw his father again.<ref>''An Autobiography,'' by Frank Lloyd Wright, Duell, Sloan and Pearce, New York City, 1943, p. 51</ref> At this time he changed his middle name from Lincoln to Lloyd in honor of his mother's family, the Lloyd Joneses.\n\n===Education (1885\u20131887)===\nWright attended Madison High School, it is unknown if he graduated.<ref>Secrest, p.72</ref> In 1886 he was admitted to the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] as a special student.

University of Wisconsin-Madison.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n===Silsbee and other early work experience (1887\u20131888)===\nIn 1887, Wright arrived in Chicago in search of employment. As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and a population boom, new development was plentiful in the city. Wright later recalled that while his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Drafter|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]].<ref name=Wright /> Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee\u2014accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor\u2014on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in Spring Green.<ref name=FLWF /> While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the [[Hillside Home School I]] in Spring Green for two of his aunts.<ref name=OGorman /> Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W. Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G. Elmslie]]. Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.\n\nFeeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton. However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee\u2014this time with a raise in salary.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}</ref> Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more \"gracefully picturesque\" than the other \"brutalities\" of the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}</ref> Wright aspired for more progressive work.\n\n===Adler & Sullivan (1888\u20131893)===\n\nWright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] & [[Louis Sullivan|Sullivan]] was \"looking for someone to make the finished  drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}</ref> Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of Louis Sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}</ref> Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his employees, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89\u201394}}</ref> In spite of this, \"Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility.\" As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for \"Dear Master\").<ref name=Tafel /> He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller. Wright later engaged Mueller to build several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.<ref name=Saint />\n\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom).JPG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (1889)]]\n\nOn June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin (1871\u20131959). The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: \"Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?\"<ref name=\"Wright 2005, p. 97\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}</ref> With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.<ref name=Weil />\n\nBy 1890, Wright had an office next to Sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman [[George Elmslie]], who had been hired by Sullivan at Wright's request.<ref name=Saint/><ref name=Gebhard /> Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, the firm of Adler & Sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian Robert Twombly) suggests that Sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches.<ref name=Gebhard/> During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A. Charnley bungalow (1890) in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], the Berry-MacHarg House, [[James A. Charnley House]] (both 1891), and the Louis Sullivan House (1892), all in Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Lind />\n\n[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4.jpg|thumb|The [[Walter Gale House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1893). While a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] in style, it features window bands and a cantilevered porch roof which hint at Wright's developing aesthetics]]\n\nDespite Sullivan's loan and overtime salary, Wright was constantly short on funds. Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These \"bootlegged\" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today, including the [[Thomas H. Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P. Parker House|Robert Parker]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs with the residential projects for Adler & Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement. Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm.<ref name=Lind/> Several stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He \"threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler & Sullivan office never to return.\" Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}</ref> However, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also recounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.<ref name=Lind/><ref>{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}</ref> Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.\n\n===Transition and experimentation (1893\u20131900)===\nAfter leaving Louis Sullivan's firm, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan-designed [[Schiller Building]] on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago. Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler & Sullivan. Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)|Dwight H. Perkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}</ref> These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what  became known as the Prairie School.<ref name=Brooks /> They were joined by Perkins' apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.<ref name=Cassidy /><ref name=MIT />\n\n[[File:William H. Winslow House Front Facade.jpg|thumb|[[William H. Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]] (1893)]]\n\nWright's projects during this period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897) and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style Bagley House (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G. Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E. Roberts]] House (1896).<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56\u2013109}}</ref> While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore house (1895), Oak Park, IL, rear.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan G. Moore House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1895)]]\n\nSoon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome. To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the \u00c9cole lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref name=Goldberger />\n\n[[File:Frank LLoyd Wright Studio Chicago Frontage.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's studio]] viewed from [[Chicago Avenue]] (1898)]]\n\nWright relocated his practice to his home in 1898  to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house. The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio was a poster for Wright's developing aesthetics, and would become the laboratory from which the next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust 2001, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Prairie houses (1900\u20131914)===\nBy 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: <blockquote> \"[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], Marion Mahony, [[Isabel Roberts]], and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches, and recognition today!\"<ref>''My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright,'' by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Arthur Heurtley House (1902), Oak Park, IL.JPG|thumb|[[Arthur Heurtley House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1902)]]\n[[File:Darwin D. Martin House.jpg|thumb|[[Darwin D. Martin House]], [[Buffalo, New York]] (1904)]]\n[[File:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Hillside Home School, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902)]]\n\nBetween 1900 and 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the \"[[Prairie style]]\". Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B. Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations.<ref name=Clayton /> Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style.<ref name=Sommer /><ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}</ref> At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design. \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" and \"A Small House with Lots of Room in it\" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years.<ref name=Clayton/> Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]] in 1904.\n\nOther Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick [[Robie House]] in Chicago and the Avery and Queene [[Coonley House]] in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. The Robie House, with its soaring, [[cantilever]]ed roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]] (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the \"cornerstone of modernism\".\n\nWright's residential designs of this era were known as \"prairie houses\" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago.  Prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials\u2014especially stone and wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquehome.org/Architectural-Style/prairie.htm|title=Prairie School Architecture|website=www.antiquehome.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Textile concrete block system===\nIn the early 1920s, Wright designed a \"[[Textile block house|textile]]\" concrete block system reinforced by an internal system of bars. Wright first used his textile block system on the [[Millard House]] in Pasadena , California, in 1923. The Ennis house is now used in films, television, and print media to represent the future.<ref name=\"loc\" /> Typically Wrightian is the joining of the structure to its site by a series of terraces that reach out into and reorder the landscape, making it an integral part of the architect's vision.<ref name=\"loc\"/> With the [[Ennis House]] and the [[Samuel Freeman House]] (both 1923), Wright had further opportunities to test the limits of the textile block system, including limited use in the [[Arizona Biltmore Hotel]] in 1927.<ref>Sanderson, Arlene, ''Wright Sites'', Princeton Architectural Press, 1995, p. 16,</ref> Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, supervised construction for the Storer, Freeman and Ennis Houses.

Other early notable public buildings include the Hillside Home School, built for his aunts in Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902) and the [[Unity Temple]], home of the Unitarian Universalist congregation in Oak Park. As a lifelong [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and member of Unity Temple, Wright offered his services to the congregation after their church burned down, working on the building from 1905 to 1909. Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space.  [[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wright in 1926]]Wright also designed the Geneva Inn ([[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], 1911), the [[Midway Gardens]] (Chicago, Illinois, 1913), the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] ([[Alberta]], Canada, 1914), and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (Tokyo, 1922).\n\n==Midlife problems==\n\n===Family abandonment{{anchor | Europe and personal troubles}}===\n[[File:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Taliesin, Spring Green, Wisconsin]]\nLocal gossips noticed Wright's flirtations, and he developed a reputation in Oak Park as a man-about-town. His family had grown to six children, but Wright was not parental and he relied on his wife Catherine to care for them. In 1903, Wright designed a house for Edwin Cheney, a neighbor in Oak Park, and immediately took a liking to Cheney's wife, Mamah. Mamah Cheney was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist, and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. The two fell in love, and they became the talk of the town, as they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. Wright's wife, Kitty, sure that this attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce. Mamah had to live in Europe for two years to obtain a divorce from Edwin on the grounds of desertion.<ref>Secrest, p. 207</ref>\n\nIn 1909, even before the Robie House was completed, Wright and Mamah Cheney met up in Europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. Wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class Prairie Style [[single-family house]] model, intending to work on more democratic architecture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Storrer |first1=William Allin |title=The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright : a complete catalog |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0226776204 |page=xvii |edition=Updated 3rd }}</ref> He was also frustrated by not getting larger commissions for commercial or public buildings.\n\nWhat drew Wright to Europe was the chance to publish a portfolio of his work with Berlin publisher [[Ernst Wasmuth Verlag|Ernst Wasmuth]].<ref>Secrest, p. 202</ref> The resulting two volumes, titled ''Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright'', were published in 1911 in two editions, creating the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe. The work contained more than 100 [[lithograph]]s of Wright's designs, and was commonly known as the ''[[Wasmuth Portfolio]]''.\n\nWright remained in Europe for almost a year and set up home first in [[Florence, Italy]]\u2014where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd\u2014and later in [[Fiesole, Italy]], where he lived with Mamah. During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. After Wright returned to the United States in October 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses. Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]}}, by May 1911. The recurring theme of {{lang|cy|Taliesin}} also came from his mother's side: {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin]]}} in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest. The family motto, \"''{{lang|cy|Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd}}''\" (\"The Truth Against the World\"), was taken from the Welsh poet {{lang|cy|[[Iolo Morganwg]]}}, who also had a son named Taliesin. The motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the {{lang|cy|[[Eisteddfod]]}} in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212826/http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 28, 2005 |title=Home Country |publisher=Unitychapel.org |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Catastrophe at Taliesin studio===\nOn August 15, 1914, while Wright was working in Chicago, Julian Carlton, a male servant from [[Barbados]], who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin and murdered seven people with an [[axe]] as the fire burned.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> The dead included Mamah; her two children, John and Martha Cheney; a gardener (David Lindblom); a draftsman (Emil Brodelle); a workman (Thomas Brunker); and another workman's son (Ernest Weston). Two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, William Weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. Carlton swallowed [[hydrochloric acid]] immediately following the attack in an attempt to [[suicide|kill himself]].<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> He was nearly [[Lynching|lynched]] on the spot, but was taken to the [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]] jail.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> Carlton died from [[starvation]] seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" />\n\n===Divorce and further troubles===\nIn 1922, Kitty Wright finally granted Wright a divorce. Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, Maude \"Miriam\" Noel. In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died. Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. In 1924, after the separation, but while still married, Wright met [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]] at a Petrograd Ballet performance in Chicago. They moved in together at Taliesin in 1925, and soon Olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, Iovanna, born on December 2, 1925.\n\nOn April 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at Taliesin. Crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of Japanese prints that Wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000.<ref>Secrest, p. 315\u2013317.</ref> Wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home \"Taliesin III\".\n\nIn 1926, Olga's ex-husband, Vlademar Hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, Svetlana. In October 1926, Wright and Olgivanna were accused of violating the [[Mann Act]] and arrested in [[Tonka Bay, Minnesota]].<ref>Minnesota Historical Society, Collections Up Close, \"[http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/01/frank-lloyd-wright-arrested-in-minnesota/ Frank Lloyd Wright Arrested in Minnesota]\"</ref> The charges were later dropped.\n\nWright and Miriam Noel's divorce was finalized in 1927, and once again, Wright was required to wait for one year before remarrying. Wright and Olgivanna married in 1928.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Later career==\n===Taliesin Fellowship===\nIn 1932, Wright and his wife Olgivanna put out a call for students to come to Taliesin to study and work under Wright while they learned architecture and spiritual development. (Olgivanna Wright had been a student of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]). Twenty-three came to live and work that year, as did many more in the years that followed. \nConsiderable controversy existed over the living conditions and education of the fellows; recent books have given conflicting and often unflattering pictures of their treatment.<ref>Friedland, Roger, and Harold Zellman.

He proposed the idea in his book ''The Disappearing City'' in 1932, and unveiled a {{convert|12|ft2|m2|adj=on}} model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. Concurrent with the development of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including sandwich walls that consisted of layers of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper, a significant change from typically framed walls.<ref>Twombly, p.242</ref> Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.\n\nUsonian houses were Wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most American households. By developing homes with progressively more open plans, Wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room.<ref>Twombly, p.257</ref> As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. Bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal. The built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles which influenced Wright's early work. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. His Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers.<ref>Twombly, p.244</ref> Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.\n\n===Significant later works===\n[[File:Guggenheim museum exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York City (1959)]]\n\n[[File:Wrightfallingwater.jpg|thumb|[[Fallingwater]], [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]] (1937)]] ''Fallingwater'', one of Wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar J. Kaufmann|Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr.]], at [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]]. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using [[limestone]] for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, [[post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]] of the lowest terrace was completed.\n\nTaliesin West, Wright's winter home and studio complex in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], was a laboratory for Wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. Now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.\nWright turned 80 shortly after World War II ended, yet remained busy. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City occupied Wright for 16&nbsp;years (1943\u20131959)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/about/frank-lloyd-wright-building|title=The Frank Lloyd Wright Building|date=November 10, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on [[Fifth Avenue]]; its interior is similar to the inside of a [[seashell]]. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.\n\n[[File:Price tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] (1956)]]\nThe only realized skyscraper designed by Wright is the [[Price Tower]], a 19-story tower in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]]. It is also one of the two existing vertically oriented Wright structures (the other is the [[S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]). The Price Tower was commissioned by Harold C. Price of the H. C. Price Company, a local [[oil pipeline]] and chemical firm. On March 29, 2007, Price Tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]], one of only 20 such properties in Oklahoma.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20070413.HTM National Park Service] \u2014 ''National Historic Landmarks Designated'', April 13, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Monona Terrace]], originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for Madison, Wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of Wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. The \"as-built\" design was carried out by Wright's apprentice Tony Puttnam. Monona Terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|title=Monona Terrace Convention Center, history web page|publisher=|accessdate=May 31, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215652/http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Florida Southern College]], located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) Frank Lloyd Wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the [[Child of the Sun]] project.

He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks, and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]. Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). In 1897, Wright received a patent for \"Prism Glass Tiles\" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior.<ref>http://www.dailyartdaily.com/prismatic-tiles-frank-lloyd-wright-glass/</ref> Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.<ref name=\"TMCnet\">{{cite web|author=Lync Voice UC Industry News|title=The Textile Block System [Concrete International]|url=http://www.lyncvoiceuc.com/news/2012/04/14/6258593.htm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright. \"In the Cause of Architecture, VI: The Meaning of Materials\u2014Glass\". ''The Architectural Record'', 64(July 1928), 10-16.</ref> One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By using this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style. The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Carla|title=Frank Lloyd Wright's glass designs|date=1995|publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780876544686|pages=57}}</ref>\n\nWright also designed some of his own clothing. His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles. Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII. He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Wright-designed window in [[Robie House]], Chicago (1906)]]\nWright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization \"a harbor of refuge for the incompetent,\" and \"a form of refined gangsterism.\" When an associate referred to him as \"an old amateur\" Wright confirmed, \"I am the oldest.\"<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web|title=Biography in Sound: Frank Lloyd Wright|url=https://archive.org/details/Biography_in_Sound|work=Old Time Radio|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:\n# [[Louis Sullivan]], whom he considered to be his ''Lieber Meister'' (dear master)\n# Nature, particularly shapes/forms and colors/patterns of plant life\n# Music (his favorite composer was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]])\n# Japanese art, prints and buildings\n# [[Froebel Gifts]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Jeanne S.|date=1989-03-01|title=The Froebel-Wright Kindergarten Connection: A New Perspective|url=http://jsah.ucpress.edu/content/48/1/24|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=24\u201337|doi=10.2307/990404|issn=0037-9808}}</ref>\n\nHe also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the Prairie School architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates.<ref>\"The Magic of America\", Marion Mahony Griffin</ref> As with any architect, though, Wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. In his earlier days, Wright worked with some of the top architects of the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], including Sullivan. In his Prairie School days, Wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including [[William Eugene Drummond]], [[John Van Bergen]], [[Isabel Roberts]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Albert Chase McArthur|Albert McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin]], and [[Walter Burley Griffin]].\n\nThe Czech-born architect [[Antonin Raymond]], recognized as the father of modern architecture in Japan, worked for Wright at Taliesin and led the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He subsequently stayed in Japan and opened his own practice. [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]] also worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel. His own work is often credited as influencing Wright's Usonian houses. Schindler's friend [[Richard Neutra]] also worked briefly for Wright and became an internationally successful architect.\n\nLater, in the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] days, Wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]], [[John Lautner]], [[E. Fay Jones]], [[Henry Klumb]], and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\n===Community planning===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career. His commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death. He had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.<ref>''Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs'', Charles E. and Berdeana Aguar, McGraw-Hill, 2002, p.344</ref>\n\nHis thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for [[Charles E. Roberts]] entitled the \"Quadruple Block Plan.\" This design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets. The houses, which used the same design as published in \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" from the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the ''Wasmuth Portfolio'' in 1910.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs|first1=Charles E.|last1=Aguar|first2=Berdeana|last2=Aguar|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=2002|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the City Club of Chicago Land Development Competition in 1913. The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. This design expanded on the Quadruple Block Plan and included several social levels. The design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the [[blue collar]] homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces.

He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic \"burying the hatchet\" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, \"Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?\"<ref name=\"archive\" /> He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named \"The Building of the 20th century\" in an unscientific \"Top-Ten\" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C. Robie House, and the Johnson Wax Building.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Madison Opera]] in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera ''[[Shining Brow]]'', by composer [[Daron Hagen]] and [[libretto|librettist]] [[Paul Muldoon]] based on events early in Wright's life. The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2\u00a2 postage stamp. Several of Wright's buildings have been proposed by the United States to be [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage sites]].\n\n\"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]\" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]].

The genre has been active since the early 1950s, and played primarily since the mid-1970s.\n\n==Etymology and definitions==\nThe term \"filk\" (originally a [[typographical error]]) predates 1955.<ref name = \"Coppa in Hellekson and Busse\">{{Cite book\n  | first = Francesca | last = Coppa | author-link =\n  | editor-last = Hellekson | editor-first = Karen\n  | editor2-last = Busse | editor2-first = Kristina\n  | contribution = A Brief History of Media Fandom\n  | title = Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet\n  | year = 2006 | pages = 41\u201359 | place = Jefferson, North Carolina\n  | publisher = [[McFarland & Company]] | isbn = 978-0-7864-2640-9\n  | postscript = <!--None-->}}\n</ref> (See also [[#etymology|below]].)\n\n=== Definitions ===\nIt is used \n* as a noun:\n** referring to the genre (thus equivalent to \"filk music\") or to a filk song\n** it can also be used to refer to a gathering with the primary purpose of singing filk songs. Such a gathering held in someone's home is called a ''housefilk''\n** \"A filk of ___\" refers to a filksong based on another song, using the same tune and often, but not necessarily, similar structure of plot and/or lyrics. It may be a [[Parody music|parody]] of the original (not necessarily humorous), with content referring back to it, or  it may be a [[contrafactum]] which reuses the music and possibly the lyrical structure of the original, but with different words. Full appreciation of a parody requires familiarity with the original, but appreciation of a contrafactum may not.\n* as a verb:\n** (intransitive) To participate in filk singing, not necessarily as a planned or organized event, as in \"The party guests filked.\"\n** (transitive) To write a filk music parody of an existing song, humorous or otherwise, as in \"I filked '[[Hope Eyrie#Music|Hope Eyrie]]'.\" When used in this way, \"filk\" does not imply that all song parodies are considered filk music, nor does it imply that all filk songs are parodies. Setting satirical or parody lyrics to established tunes is not exclusively the province of science fiction fandom: works of [[parody music]] such as those found in ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' or performed by [[Weird Al Yankovic]] have their own long-established traditions and history.\n\nAs Interfilk's \"What is it?\" page demonstrates, there is no consensus on the definition of filk.<ref>[http://www.interfilk.org/interfilk/filk.htm \"Filk Music: What is it?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231193549/http://www.interfilk.org/interfilk/filk.htm |date=31 December 2005 }}. Last revised: September 23, 2013. Accessed September 16, 2016.</ref>  Attempts have been made to define filk based on various criteria.\n\n===Style and content===\nFilk has been defined as [[folk music]], usually with a science fiction or [[fantasy]] theme, but this definition is not exact. '''Filkers''' have been known to write filk songs about a variety of topics, including but not limited to tangentially related topics such as computers and cats.  In addition, while the majority of filk songs are in the folk style, other styles such as [[blues]], [[calypso music|calypso]], and even [[rock music|rock]] appear from time to time.\n\n===Performer===\nFilk has been defined as what is sung or performed by the network of people who originally gathered to sing at [[science fiction conventions|science fiction/fantasy conventions]].  This definition might be summarized as, <!-- '\"I can't define it, but I can point at it.\"'--> \"We can argue what it is until we're red or green or blue, but when filkers get together it's the thing we do.\"<ref>\"The Definition of Filk\"  [song title], Mark Mandel, ''Consonance 2003 Songbook'', p. 9</ref>\n\n===Sociology===\nYet another definition focuses on filking as a community of those who are interested in filk music and who form part of the social network self-identified with filking. As described later in this article, the origins of filk in science fiction conventions and its current organization emphasizes the social-network aspect of filking.  The social aspect of filk as contrasted with the \"performer vs. audience\" dichotomy of much of modern music was described in a speech by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] [[Barry and Sally Childs-Helton|Dr. Sally Childs-Helton]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hoftribe.html| title= Filk Hall of Fame: This Is My Tribe| publisher= | deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110416044503/http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hoftribe.html| archivedate= 16 April 2011| df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy any of these definitions, filk is a form of music created from within [[science fiction fandom|science fiction and fantasy fandom]], often performed late at night at science fiction conventions, though there are now dedicated filk conventions in Canada, England, Germany, and the USA.  The boundaries of filking are vague. For example, filking overlaps with the singing and music performed by participants in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] or at [[LARP]]s.\n\n==Styles and subjects==\nIn keeping with the folk-culture roots of filk, the musical styles and topics of filk music are eclectic. While a plurality of filk is rooted firmly in acoustic-instrument folk music, other pieces and artists draw inspiration from [[Rock music|rock]], [[a cappella]] vocal groups, or other styles. The hobbyist and itinerant nature of filk events (especially filk circles) gives some advantages to acoustic-vocal soloists and small groups, who need only carry a lightweight instrument or two and whose rehearsals do not need to balance scheduling logistics against regular work and other obligations. One of the few rock-style groups in filk has been [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]], whose studio recordings use techniques common in modern rock.  Some styles of filk rely heavily on sampling the original source material and integrating it into electronica and hip-hop music such as 76's ''Objects in Space'' (an homage to the popular TV show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', which itself featured several filk songs) and [[DJ Qbert]]'s ''[[Wave Twisters]].''\n\nThe range of topics in filk songs stems from its cultural roots in fandom. Many songs honor specific works in science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. Other songs are about science, fantasy, computers, technology in general, or values related to technological change.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/09/68697 |first= Xeni |last= Jardin |title= Filk Music for Nerd People| work= Wired |date=1 September 2005}}</ref>  Yet others are about the culture of fandom, including filk itself (both as a phenomenon within fandom, and as a sub-culture). Many filk songs (such as [[Leslie Fish]]'s \"[[Carmen Miranda|Carmen Miranda's]] Ghost Is Haunting Space Station 3\") are humorous while others treat their subjects seriously (like [[Steve Macdonald (filk musician)|Steve Macdonald's]] \"Journey's Done\").\n\nHowever, some common themes do not fall neatly into filk's science fiction origins. Such topics include songs about cats, popular culture, and politics. These are perhaps best explained as an outgrowth of filk as a folk culture, open in some respects to expansion by individual artists.\n\nA significant number of filk songs are [[Parody music|parodies]], whether in the original sense of simply re-using a tune or in the modern sense of specifically humorous re-use.<ref name=\"Bragg\">{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Bragg |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |title=Filk: Sci-fi meets folk music |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music/Filk_Sci-fi_meets_folk_music_98699099.html?showFullArticle=y |date=18 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref>  Some are parodies of songs from popular culture, others are parodies of existing filk songs. Although parody is not the primary focus of the filk music culture, the proportion of parody songs found in filk is higher than in other musical cultures.\n\nOne subtype of filk songs is the \"ose\" song, one on themes of death and gloom.  The term derives from the word \"morose\", as in \"ose, morose, even-more-ose\".<ref name=Rogow>{{cite book| last=Rogow| first=Roberta| title=Futurespeak: A Fan's Guide to the Language of Science Fiction| date=1991| publisher=[[Paragon House]]| page=238| location=New York| isbn=978-1557783479 | authorlink= Roberta Rogow }}</ref>  A further variant is \"cheeri-ose\": ose songs to cheery tunes, or treating such a subject lightheartedly; cf. [[Tom Lehrer]]'s (non-filk) \"Irish Ballad\".\n\n==History==\nFor the first few decades of the occasional [[science fiction convention]], there had been late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms. Part of this practice may have been rooted in an older folk culture of fans. Some of the oldest filks coming out of fandom were protest songs with original words and music written by a group of New York fans called [[Futurians|The Futurians]], and were written by [[Fred Pohl]] and [[Cyril Kornbluth]] (see [[Damon Knight|Damon Knight's]] book of the same name, which contains the words and music to several of them). With the break up of the city clubs common during the [[Great Depression]], filking moved to science fiction conventions, often in the form of late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms, lobbies, service passages, or wherever else the filkers could find enough room to play/sing music uninterrupted.\n\n{{anchor|etymology}}In the early 1950s, the term ''filk music'' started as a misspelling of ''folk music'' in an essay by Lee Jacobs, \"The Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music\". Wrai Ballard, then editor of the Spectator [[amateur press association|Amateur Press Society]] refused to publish it for fear that the article's bawdy content could get them into trouble with the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|Post Office]] under the [[Comstock Laws]], but found the typo itself amusing, and mentioned it repeatedly;<ref name=Gold97>{{cite web| last1=Gold| first1=Lee| authorlink1=Lee Gold| title=An Egocentric and Convoluted History of Early Filk and Filking| url= http://www.fanac.org/Fan_Histories/filkhist.html| website=The Fanac Fan History Project| accessdate=20 November 2014| quote=Lee Jacobs, a LArea [= Los Angeles area] fan who [...] in the 50s, [had] submitted an essay to SAPS (Spectator Amateur Press Society) entitled \u201cThe Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music\u201d supposedly about science fiction incidents in folk song, but actually a straight-faced analysis of a number of thoroughly filthy \u201cdirty songs,\u201d taking various metaphors in them as if they were meant literally.}} Originally published in the ''[[ConChord]] 12 Songbook'', 1997</ref> thus,  Jacobs' typo became the self-identified term for the genre/subculture while it was still an informal, unrecognized activity at conventions.  Its first documented deliberate use was by [[Karen Anderson (writer)|Karen Anderson]] in ''Die Zeitschrift f\u00fcr vollst\u00e4ndigen Unsinn'' (''The Journal for Utter Nonsense'') #774 (June 1953), for a song written by her husband [[Poul Anderson]].<ref name=\"firstUse\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nightsong.com/filk/twippledop/ |title=Tracking Down The First Deliberate Use Of \"Filk Song\" |accessdate=2006-11-25 |first=Lee |last=Gold |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121206001047/http://www.nightsong.com/filk/twippledop/ |archivedate=6 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s also saw the first formal publication of filksongs, generally as lyric sheets, but occasionally complete with (often original) music.  While many of those original songs faded into obscurity, some remained popular for decades.  By the late 1970s, periodicals such as ''Kantele'' and ''Philk Fee-Nom-Ee-Non'' offered a ready outlet for filk writers.\n\nAt the 1974 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] author [[Robert Asprin|Bob Asprin]] announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the Dorsai Irregulars, and a singing session ensued later that night.<ref name=\"dorsaiHistory\">{{Cite web |url= http://www.di.org/di_f_his.htm |title=Filk Music and the Dorsai Irregulars |accessdate=2006-11-25 |author=John Hall}}</ref> In the 1970s and 1980s, filking slowly became established as an acknowledged activity at science fiction conventions. Some convention organizers allotted hotel function space late at night for filkers, or filking occurred in hallways, bars or any other place that the filkers could find. Some convention organizers in the 1980s began inviting guests specifically for their filking. Some specialized conventions focused entirely on filk, beginning with FilkCon in Chicago in 1979, organized by Margaret Middleton and Curt Clemmer, later joined by BayFilk in Northern California; the [[Ohio Valley Filk Fest]] (OVFF) in Columbus, Ohio; ConChord in Los Angeles and in San Diego,<ref>{{cite web |title=ConChord History Pages |url= http://www.sandiegofilk.com/ConchordMain.html |accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> California; Musicon in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[FilKONtario]] near [[Toronto]], Ontario; a rotating British filkcon, and one (NEFilk) in the northeastern US;<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nefilk.us/| title=The Northeast Filk Convention| publisher=}}</ref> the German FilkCONtinental;<ref>[http://www.filkcontinental.de/fc/home/index.php FilkCONtinental] (in German)</ref> and others.\n\nThese efforts grew to include raising funds for traveling filkers. The first was a British Filk Fund. Then, in the early 1990s, several active organizers in North America created Interfilk, which is now the most active traveling filker fund. Beginning with British filker Mike Whitaker in 1992, 40 filkers were the beneficiaries of Interfilk subsidies in its first decade. OVFF began presenting the [[Pegasus Award]] annually for excellence in filk in 1984, and FilkOntario started the Filk Hall of Fame in 1995, honoring contributions to the community as well as to the music.\n\nAfter years of amateur tape recordings made at filksings, a trickle of studio-produced albums and tapes began to arrive in the 1970s.  These included ''Folk Songs for Folk Who Ain't Been Yet'', featuring Leslie Fish and friends, and ''Children of the Future'' by Karen Willson.\n\n[[Off Centaur Publications]] was one of the first formal attempts to regularly produce and promote filk albums, followed by many others since. As the costs of amateur album production dropped in the 1990s, more filkers created albums and, more recently, audio files available for downloading online.\n\nE-mail and the internet have also fostered the networking of self-identified filkers. In the late 1980s, California filker Kay Shapero created the filk group on the [[Fidonet]] hobbyist network of electronic bulletin boards. The later creation of other electronic forums \u2014 the Usenet group, a United Kingdom e-mail list FILK_UK and the German language list, an IRC channel devoted to filking, and a growing cluster of filkers blogging on [[LiveJournal]] (including a LiveJournal community<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filk.livejournal.com/ |title=The Filk Community |publisher= }}</ref>), to pick a few examples \u2014 have mirrored the growing connections among other self-identified social networks (or subcultures). The availability of several hundred albums labeled filk, the proliferation of specialty filk conventions, and the continued growth of electronic means for community connections have led to an intensification of community building. A few years into the 21st&nbsp;century, filking as an identifiable community exists on at least three continents.\n\nOn the album ''Precious Friend'', [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]] perform \"Old Time Religion\", in a filk version.  Most of the verses of this version were by [[Gordon R. Dickson|Gordon Dickson]]; when Seeger finally discovered this, after the album was issued, he sent royalties on to Dickson.\n\n==Filk Circle==\nFilk music is most commonly performed in a gathering known as a ''Filk Circle''. Similar to the [[drum circle|Drum Circles]] and Bardic Circles found at [[society for creative anachronism|SCA]] events and other [[science fiction fandom|fannish]] events, filk circles can be formed in any location where filkers gather.\n\nFilk circles are different from concert-style musical performances. Although filk music can also be performed in front of an audience, and there are concerts scheduled at filk conventions and science fiction conventions worldwide, filk circles are a more common occurrence. The purpose of a filk circle is for musicians to share songs with other musicians, so performing and listening are given equal emphasis. In a filk circle, there is no stage, there is no audience. Those who participate in a filk circle may choose to perform, to listen, or both. Performers may know only one song, or may know an extensive library of songs. Participants are usually encouraged to join in and sing along or play along on their instruments.\n\nFilk circles can be formalized parts of larger events, such as being assigned a specific time and location on the schedule of a science fiction convention, or they can be completely informal and spontaneous, forming organically in hotel hallways and lobbies. Filk-specific conventions will usually have multiple filk circles happening simultaneously in different rooms, with some circles focused on a single style or topic. Local parties called ''housefilks'' are day-long events in which a single filk circle performs in the host's home.\n\n===Physical layout===\n[[File:2006-05-27 Baycon 2006 Saturday Night Open Filk Circle- Photo by Tony Fabris.jpg|thumb|right|A Filk circle at a science fiction convention.]]\nAs the name implies, a rough circle of chairs is usually formed.<ref name=\"Bragg\"/>  The details depend on the available space and furniture, and it may not even end up being circular, or even have chairs at all. The purpose of the circular formation is both symbolic and functional: By having everyone face each other, it honors all participants as equals, it emphasizes both listening and performing, and it makes each participant visible to every other participant.{{Citation needed|reason=isn't this just - well the obvious way to do it?|date=November 2015}}\n\nA formally organized filk circle can have the chairs set up ahead of time, with the organizers estimating the number of participants and adjusting the size of the circle as best they can. A circle that is too large for the number of participants tends to feel uncomfortably empty, but a circle that is too small must enlarge as the number of participants grows. The disruption that results from attempting to enlarge a filk circle in progress can break up the flow of the songs and change the mood, so enlarging the circle is often avoided in favor of adding extra layers (concentric circles) outside the inner circle, space permitting.\n\n===Time of day===\nTraditionally, filk circles are started in the evening and tend to continue very late into the night.<ref name=\"Bragg\"/>  Of course, this depends upon the location, the participants, and the organizers. Filk circles have been known to continue all night, or at least into the early morning hours. Those organizing formal filk circles at conventions usually make arrangements with the hotel to have space available for the entire night. There are many exceptions to this; it's not uncommon to find a housefilk scheduled to start in the early afternoon and end in the early evening, for example, to allow participants to get home to sleep.\n\n===Musical instruments===\nAt most filk circles, the participants are expected to bring their own musical instruments (if they play an instrument at all), although sometimes you will find organizers or performers bringing a collection of extra instruments so that others may borrow or experiment with them. Most performers who bring instruments such as guitars are usually happy to loan their instruments to someone who comes to the circle without one.\n\nA wide range of instruments can be found in a filk circle, although the most common is the [[acoustic guitar]].<ref name=\"Bragg\"/>  Acoustic instruments are more common than electric instruments, although portable [[electronic keyboard|keyboards]] and even [[theremin]]s are not unheard of.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sutton|first1=Brenda|title=Guest of Honor : Dr. Mary Crowell|url=http://conflikt.org/guestbio.php?name=Dr.+Mary+Crowell&title=Guest+of+Honor&year=2011|website=Conflikt: A Pacific NorthWest Filk Convention|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2011|quote=We watched this beautiful young woman lug her keyboard (not the most portable of filk instruments, mind you) into the filk room with a slight amount of dread and a large measure of anticipation. And then she played her opening measures -- all Gershwiny, bluesy, and fine -- we all relaxed.}}</ref> Small, easily portable instruments are more common than large ones, although larger items such as small drum kits and [[double bass|upright basses]] can be found at some filk circles. A large filk circle might play host to an array of folk and Celtic instruments such as [[fiddle]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimers]], [[banjo]]s, [[flute]]s, [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], [[bodhran|bodhr\u00e1ns]], [[bongo drum|bongos]] and [[goblet drum|darbukas]].<ref>[[Three Weird Sisters (band)]]. \"The group performs filk music (science fiction/fantasy folk music) with harp, double bass, guitar, and bodhran accompaniment.\" Retrieved 18 November 2014</ref>\n\n===Song presentation===\nSongs are presented very informally. They can be given with spoken introductions and explanations, or they can be simply played and allowed to speak for themselves. Songs can be chosen to fit the current mood or theme, or they may be chosen to deliberately change the mood. Songs can be performed by individuals, duos, groups, or groups hastily assembled from other participants. Songs can be accompanied by instruments or be performed [[a cappella]]. Songs can be original songs, [[cover version|covers]], [[parody music|parodies]], [[instrumental]]s, or even spoken-word pieces such as poetry and stories.\n\nAn active and well-attended filk circle, at its peak, will usually be a somewhat continuous stream of songs, with only a small amount of conversation between songs. Filk circles that are just getting started or winding down may have more talking and socializing than music.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Types===\n[[File:Sfcon-music-session-ddb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Filk circle]]\nFilk circles are often given an organizational structure to make it easier for participants to know when it's time to perform or time to listen to other performers. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the most common types of filk circle are listed below.<ref name=Gold:Welcome>{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Lee|authorlink1=Lee Gold|title=Welcome to the Filk Circle|url=http://www.massfilc.org/FilkCircle.pdf|website=MASSFILC: The Filk Music Club of New England|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2004}}</ref>\n\n====Bardic====\nIn a bardic circle, each person in the circle (as well as those sitting in concentric circles around the inner circle, if any) goes in turn, with each turn moving sequentially either clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle. Each participant is given the choice of ''pick, pass, or play''. \"Pick\" means they can request a specific song, a specific performer, a general topic or style, or any other similar request from an individual or from the circle in general. \"Pass\" means they skip their turn and the choice passes on to the next person in sequence. \"Play\" means they can perform any song they choose, either specific to the current topic or mood, or deliberately different from the current topic or mood.\n\nThe advantage of the bardic circle is that it has a clear structure, which enforces politeness. It ensures everyone in the circle gets their turn, so that even shy people can have a chance to request or perform. There are disadvantages, however. A bardic circle with large numbers of participants will take a long time to traverse the entire circle, making people wait too long for their turn. Such a circle was lamented in a filk by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]]: \"I've been here with my song at the ready since day before yesterday night.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptictank.org/files/en003/filk-018.htm|title=Lyrics and Tune Copyright 1983 Suzette Haden Elgin Song at the Ready The Filksing was crow|first=Fredric L. Rice, The Skeptic|last=Tank|website=www.skeptictank.org}}</ref>  There is less spontaneity in a bardic circle than a chaos circle, and the chance of being able to play a good \"follower\" song is reduced.\n\n====Chaos====\nIn a chaos circle, there is no sequential organization. Any performer can simply begin playing a song after the prior song is finished, or any participant can shout out a request. Care must be taken to prevent two songs from starting at the same time. Frequently the word \"follower!\" is shouted in a chaos circle, meaning that a performer believes they have the perfect song to follow the prior song, and they want to play it now.<ref name=\"Gold\">Gold, Lee; http://www.kayshapero.net/filkcirc.htm</ref>\n\nThe chaos circle's advantage is its spontaneity and energy. \"Runs\" of songs will frequently get started, with each new song intended to make some sort of connection to or commentary on the prior song's topic. The disadvantage is that it takes concentration and effort to be polite and respectful in a chaos circle: It's easy to accidentally interrupt another performer who's trying to start up a song of their own, especially in a very large circle where one might not be able to easily hear the other performer on the opposite side of the room. Chaos circles thus have a reputation of favoring bold, loud performers who can command attention. One countermeasure to such conflicts is for someone, generally not one of the current/starting-up performers, to shout \"Filker up!\", possibly pointing to the one being interrupted. This alerts the room, and specifically the (usually unintentional) interrupter, to be quiet and pay attention to the filker who has started performing.<ref name=\"Conflikt_Circle_Etiquette\">{{cite web |title=Concert & Circle Etiquette |author=<!--Not stated--> |url= http://conflikt.org/content/2016/download/ConfliktRules.pdf |website=Conflikt Rules & Policies |publisher=Conflikt Filk Convention |accessdate=14 May 2017 |ref=Conflikt_Circle_Etiquette |page=1 |date=2016}}</ref>\n\n====Token Bardic====\nA token bardic circle, also known as a \"poker-chip\" bardic circle, attempts to combine the enforced politeness of the bardic circle with the freeform nature of the chaos circle. A container full of some type of token such as poker chips is supplied for the circle. Each person participating in the circle is given a fixed number of tokens when they enter the room (frequently two tokens), and can throw a token into the center of the circle at any time to claim a pick or play turn (see ''Bardic'', above). When all the active tokens in the circle are used up, they are scooped up and redistributed for the next round.<ref name=\"Gold\"/>\n\nThe advantage of a token bardic is that there's still a chance for spontaneity and followers, yet it's easy to be polite to other performers because you can easily see when another performer wants a turn. The disadvantage is that, like bardic, in a large circle it may take a long time for you to get another turn after you've used up your existing turns.\n\nThere are variations of these styles, some of the variants involving a person acting as a moderator. A given circle can change its style mid-stream, if the participants agree. It's common to see the participants of a bardic circle \"go chaos\" or vice versa, for example.\n\n===Etiquette===\nThe etiquette of the filk circle begins with a respect for all music, including (and perhaps especially) amateur music and amateur performers. Everyone is encouraged to perform, regardless of their skill level. No one is criticized except to occasionally give tips or suggestions.<ref name=Gold:Welcome />\n\nAlthough singing along and playing along with instruments (including improvisation) is usually encouraged, filk circles are not like [[jam session]]s. Jam sessions are usually focused on extended instrumental improvisation with everyone performing simultaneously, whereas filk circles tend to be more focused on a single performer or group singing an individual song during their turn. Singing along and playing along are expected to be done politely, contributing to the song rather than overshadowing the song's performer. The exception to this rule is when a jam session is specifically scheduled at a filk convention.\n\nDisruptions and distractions are discouraged during a song. This includes walking through the circle, general noise, and conversations. If between-song conversations and noise get out of hand, it's common to hear someone shout \"Filker up!\" as a signal to end the conversations so that the next person can have their turn.\n\n==Cultural perspective==\nThere are several shared values that come from the cultural creation of filk in a social network, even one that spans several continents.\n\nAt a deep level, the folk culture of filk validates creative arts in the midst of an explicitly technological culture. When accepting induction into the Filk Hall of Fame in 2003, ethnomusicologist Sally Childs-Helton said, ''We have taken our right to be creative and to literally \"play\" in the best sense of that word.'' Filk combines folk roots, live music circles, and dominant acoustical instrumentation, on the one hand, with high-tech cultural maintenance, on the other hand\u2014a dense network of filkers' web pages, recordings, sound reinforcement at filk conventions, e-mail lists, and so on. The eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity, especially in connection with technology. (See for example Leslie Fish's [http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/songs/hope-eyrie.html Hope Eyrie].) While there are significant numbers of memorial songs,<ref name=Launius>{{cite web|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|title=Got Filk?

Because these themes cross international boundaries in filk, they are not explainable as a purely American optimism vis-a-vis technology (in contrast to Nye, 1996<ref name=Nye />).\n\nWithin the community, the folk culture of filk acknowledges the legitimacy of music created by artists with a broad range of skills. Those who actively identify themselves as filkers include professional musicians, musical novices, and all ranges in between. The repeat appearances of professional musicians at filk-specific conventions suggests a certain amount of respect given high levels of musical skill within filking, even while the culture is open to less experienced musicians. Whether the occasion is a '''housefilk''' in someone's home or a convention (festival) over a weekend, filk culture encourages respectful listening regardless of the performers' skill level and manifest opportunities for participation from single songs in a musical circle to scheduled concerts.\n\nThat openness to participation is a marked norm in filking,<ref name=Jenkins92 /> which makes it unusual in a larger society that glorifies competition and super-stardom in performance arts.  Mentorship within the filk community includes formal workshops at conventions as well as the informal swapping of advice in various forums.\n\nOccasional discussions over the boundaries of filk indicates the extent to which participants in filking are both aware of and keenly interested in the definition of filk as a community. Newsgroup debates over such topics as [https://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.filk/browse_thread/thread/27e133d9408370ba/ca2d4f0a1b157027?lnk=st&q=filk+'weird+al'&rnum=3&hl=en#ca2d4f0a1b157027 whether 'Weird Al' Yankovic is a filker] suggest the deep feelings involved. In practice, most formal recognition of filkers in various awards are to those who regularly attend self-identified filk events, not to professional artists whose work may be considered '''found filk'''.<ref name=Launius /><ref name=Nye>{{cite book | last = Nye | first = David E. | authorlink = | title = American Technological Sublime | publisher = MIT Press | year = 1994 | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-262-64034-1 | oclc = 36213568}}</ref><ref name=Jenkins92>{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Jenkins | title = Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture | publisher = Routledge | year = 1992 | location = New York | pages = | chapter = 'Strangers No More We Sing': Filk Music, Folk Culture, and the Fan Community | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-415-90571-0 | oclc = 26055104}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm |title=Acceptance Speeches of Barry & Sally Childs-Helton |accessdate=2007-11-29 |last=Childs-Helton |first=Barry |author2=Sally Childs-Helton |date=2003-03-29 |work=Filk Hall of Fame |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023190656/http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-23}}</ref><ref>Solomon H.

These awards are given annually at the Ohio Valley Filk Fest (or OVFF). Anyone with an interest in filk can nominate songs or individuals for the awards, and anyone can vote. It is not necessary to be a member of the convention to be involved in the nomination and voting process.\n\nCurrently awards are given in six categories: Best Song, Best Performer, Best Writer/Composer, Best Classic Song and two topical categories that vary from year to year. Some examples of past categories include: Best Love Song, Best Literature Song, Best Techie Song, Best Sing Along, etc.\n\nThe OVFF convention committee solicits nominations for Finalists for the Pegasus Awards (the Nominating Ballot) during the late spring and summer. There is an opinion poll that runs during the year as well to help interested folk brainstorm ideas for the Nominating Ballot. The Finalist Ballot is distributed in the early fall, and must be returned by the opening night of OVFF. Voting can be done online\u2014either to nominate Finalists, or to vote for the Finalists themselves. The final round of voting happens at OVFF itself, where handwritten ballots are collected after the annual Pegasus concert. The entire process is administered by the OVFF convention committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/index.html|title=Pegasus Awards|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Filk Hall of Fame==\nThe Filk Hall of Fame<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofmain.html|title=Filk Hall of Fame|publisher=}}</ref> was created by David Hayman in 1995 as a complement to the Pegasus Awards.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Judith Hayman|author2=Dave Hayman|title=The Filk Hall of Fame: A Short History|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofhistory.html|website=Filk Hall of Fame|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=March 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028172117/http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofhistory.html|archivedate=28 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  While the Pegasus Awards acknowledge writing and performing, and therefore often reflect who or what is currently popular, the Hall of Fame was intentionally designed to acknowledge long-term or lasting contributions, including those largely behind the scenes.\n\nAnyone may make a nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofnom.html|title=Filk Hall of Fame: Nomination Information|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620094621/http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofnom.html|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A nomination consists of a description of what the nominee has contributed to filk music and the filk community.  Nominations are reviewed annually by a jury consisting of the convention committee of [[FilKONtario]] (with the exception of David Hayman, who serves as administrator) and a representative from the committees of each of that year's other filk conventions.  The jury members vote independently by secret ballot, and thereby select that year's inductees.  Typically, three people are inducted each year, at the banquet at FilKONtario.  A small editorial committee combines and edits the text of the nomination(s) to produce a citation, which is read aloud at the banquet, presented to the inductee along with a plaque, and posted on the Hall of Fame web site.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Science fiction conventions]]\n* [[Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff]]\n* [[Barry and Sally Childs-Helton]]\n* [[Leslie Fish]]\n* [[Lee Gold]]\n* [[Frank Hayes (musician)]]\n* [[Tom Smith (filker)]]\n* [[Banned from Argo]]\n* [[Julia Ecklar]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite news |last=Boros |first=Chris |date=9 January 2010 |title=Science-Fiction Music: Monsters, Aliens in 'Filk' |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122997440 |work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=10 January 2010}}\n* {{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Georgiana |date=20 March 2008 |title=What is Filk? |url=http://thephoenix.com//Boston/Life/58308-What-is-Filk/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906224630/http://thephoenix.com//Boston/Life/58308-What-is-Filk/ |archivedate=6 September 2008 |work=[[The Boston Phoenix]] |accessdate=9 August 2017}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|filk}}\n{{commons category|Filk}}\n* [http://www.kayshapero.net/filkfaq.htm rec.music.filk FAQ]\n* [http://debbieohi.com/ut-filk-faq-index/ Debbie Ohi's Filk FAQ]\n* {{dmoz|Arts/Music/Styles/F/Folk/Filk/}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060427050351/http://www.filk.info/cons/archiv.php?kategorie=0 List of upcoming Filk-Conventions]; also available as [https://web.archive.org/web/20061028030143/http://filk.info/cons/filkcons.ics .ICS/iCalendar]\n* [http://www.massfilc.org/filkindex/ Filk Book Index]\n* [http://www.filk.info/filkdb/ Filk Database]\n* [http://www.filk.co.uk/db/ UK Filk Music Database]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223233/http://www.nightsong.com/filk/eiler/filk/index.html Filk Discography by Justin W.

It is used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, as in [[flying disc games]]. The shape of the disc, an [[airfoil]] in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating [[lift (force)|lift]] as it moves through the air.  Spinning it imparts a stabilizing [[gyroscopic]] force, allowing it to be both aimed and thrown for distance.\n\nA wide range of flying disc variants are available. Those for [[disc golf]] are usually smaller but denser and tailored for particular flight profiles to increase/decrease stability and distance. The longest recorded disc throw is by David Wiggins, Jr. with a distance of 338.0 meters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flying Disc World Records|url=http://wfdf.org/worldrecords/?r_sec=1|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}</ref> [[Disc dog]] sports use relatively slow flying discs made of more pliable material to better resist a dog's bite and prevent injury to the dog. Flying rings are also available; they typically travel significantly farther than any traditional flying disc.  Illuminated discs for play after dark are made of [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] plastic, contain [[chemiluminescence|chemiluminescent]] fluid, or battery-powered [[light-emitting diodes|LEDs]]. Others whistle when they reach a certain velocity in flight.\n\nThe term ''frisbee'' is a registered [[trademark]] of the [[Wham-O]] toy company.

Mustered out, Morrison sketched a design for an [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] improved flying disc that he called the Whirlo-Way. By 1948, after design modifications and experimentation with several prototypes, Morrison and business partner Warren Franscioni began producing the first plastic discs, renaming them the Flyin-Saucer in the wake of reported [[unidentified flying object]]-sightings.\n\n\"We worked fairs, demonstrating it,\" Morrison told the ''Virginian-Pilot''. The two of them once overheard someone saying the pair were using wires to make the discs hover, so they developed a sales pitch: \"The Flyin-Saucer is free, but the invisible wire is $1.\" \"That's where we learned we could sell these things,\" he said, because people were enthusiastic about them.\n\nMorrison and Franscioni ended their partnership in early 1950, and in 1954 Morrison formed his own company, called American Trends, to buy and sell Flyin Saucers, which were by then being made of a flexible polypropylene plastic by Southern California Plastics, the original molder. After learning that he could produce his own disc more cheaply, in 1955 Morrison designed a new model, the Pluto Platter, the archetype of all modern flying discs. He sold the rights to Wham-O on January 23, 1957, and in 1958 Morrison was awarded U.S. [[Design Patent]] D183,626 for his product.\n\nIn June 1957, Wham-O co-founders [[Richard Knerr]] and Arthur \"Spud\" Melin gave the disc the brand name \"Frisbee\" (pronounced \"friz'-bee\") after learning that Northeastern college students were calling the Pluto Platter by that term,<ref name=\"CTV20070616\">{{cite news |title='Frisbee' Marks 50th Anniversary of Name Change |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070616/frisbee_070616/20070616?hub=TopStories |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |date=2007-06-16 |accessdate=2007-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101053740/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070616/frisbee_070616/20070616?hub=TopStories |archivedate=2007-11-01 |df= }}</ref> which derived from the name of the Connecticut-based pie manufacturer, [[Frisbie Pie Company]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/02/12/frisbee.morrison.obit/?hpt=T2 |publisher=CNN |title=Frisbee Inventor Dies at 90 - CNN.com |accessdate=2010-05-02 |date=2010-02-12}}</ref> a supplier of pies to [[Yale University]], where students had independently started a campus craze tossing empty pie tins stamped with the company's logo the way Morrison and his wife had in 1937.\n\nIn 1982, Morrison told ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine that he had received about US$2 million in royalty payments and said: \"I wouldn't change the name of it for the world.\"<ref name=latimes /> By 1994 100 million Frisbees had been sold, yet by 2007 he had changed his tune: \"I thought the name was a horror.

In early 1770 a Spanish commander arrived from Argentina with five ships and 1400 soldiers [[Capture of Port Egmont|forcing the British to leave Port Egmont]]. Britain and Spain almost went to war over the islands, but the British government decided that it should withdraw its presence from many overseas settlements in 1774. Spain, which had a garrison at [[Puerto Soledad]] on East Falklands, administered the garrison from [[Montevideo]] until 1811 when it was compelled to withdraw by pressures resulting from the [[Peninsular War]]. In 1833, the British [[Re-establishment of British rule on the Falklands (1833)|returned]] to the Falkland Islands. [[Argentina]] invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that forced the Argentines to surrender.\n\n== Pre-European discovery ==\n[[File:FalklandIslandFox2.jpg|right|thumb|The extinct [[Falkland Island fox|warrah]] is sometimes taken as evidence of pre-European discovery.]]\n\nWhen the world sea level was lower in the [[Ice Age]], the Falkland Islands may have been joined to the mainland of South America.\n\nWhile [[Amerindian]]s from [[Patagonia]] could have visited the Falklands,<ref>{{cite journal\n| author = G.

It is not known if these are evidence of one-way journeys, but there is no known evidence of pre-Columbian buildings or structures. However, it is not certain that the discovery predates arrival of Europeans. A Patagonian Missionary Society mission station was founded on Keppel Island (off the west coast of West Falkland) in 1856.  Yahgan Indians were at this station from 1856 to 1898 so this may be the source of the artifacts that have been found.\n\nThe presence of the [[Falkland Islands wolf|warrah]], ''Dusicyon australis'', has often been cited as evidence of pre-European occupation of the islands.  However,  in 2009, this hypothesis was disproved when DNA analysis identified the Falkland Island wolf's closest living relative as the [[maned wolf]] (''Chrysocyon brachyurus'') \u2013 an unusually long-legged, fox-like South American canid, from which it separated about 6.7 million years ago.<ref name=\"Httpwwwsciencedailycomreleaseshtm\">{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091102121449.htm | title = New Clues To Extinct Falklands Wolf Mystery | accessdate = 2011-09-03 | date = 2009-11-03 | work = EurekAlert | publisher = Science Daily}}</ref>  It would seem that the lineages of the maned wolf and the Falkland Islands wolf separated in North America; canids did not appear in South America until roughly 3 million years ago in a [[zoogeography|paleozoogeographical]] event called the [[Great American Biotic Interchange]], in which the continents of North and South America were newly connected by the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]].  This means it is likely that the warrah arrived in the islands long before humans.\n\nThe islands had no native trees when discovered but there is some ambiguous evidence of past forestation, that may be due to wood being transported by oceanic currents from Patagonia. All modern trees have been introduced by Europeans.\n\n==European discovery==\n[[File:Richard Hawkins.jpg|right|thumb|200px|upright|[[Richard Hawkins]]]]\n\nAn [[archipelago]] in the region of the Falkland Islands appeared on Portuguese [[map]]s from the early 16th century.

The account given by Pigafetta the Chronicler of Magellan's voyage contradicts attribution to either Gomes or Magellan, since it describes the position of islands close to the Patagonia coast, with the expedition following the mainland coast and the islands visited between a latitude of 49\u00b0 and 51\u00b0S and also refers to meeting \"giants\" (described as Sans\u00f3n or Samsons in the chronicle) who are believed to be the Tehuelche Indians.<ref name=\"Cawkell2001\">{{cite book|author=Mary Cawkell|title=The History of the Falkland Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YG8VAAAACAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Nelson|isbn=978-0-904614-55-8|page=15}}</ref>  Although acknowledging that Pigafetta's account casts doubt upon the claim, the Argentine historian Laurio H.

From this body of water the island group later took its collective name.\n\n== Early colonisation ==\n[[France]] established a colony at [[Port St. Louis]], on [[East Falkland]]'s [[Berkeley Sound]] coast in 1764. The [[French language|French]] name ''\u00celes Malouines'' was given to the islands \u2013 ''malouin'' being the adjective for the [[Brittany|Breton]] [[seaport|port]] of [[Saint-Malo]]. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name ''Islas Malvinas'' is a translation of the [[French language|French]] name of ''\u00celes Malouines''.\n\n[[File:John Byron-Joshua Reynolds-1759.jpg|right|thumb|upright|John Byron, by [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1759.]]\nIn 1765, Capt. [[John Byron]], who was unaware the French had established Port Saint Louis on East Falkland, explored [[Saunders Island (Falkland Islands)|Saunders Island]] around West Falkland. After discovering a natural harbour, he named the area [[Port Egmont]] and claimed the islands for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] on the grounds of prior discovery. The next year [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[John MacBride (Royal Navy officer)|John MacBride]] established a permanent British settlement at Port Egmont.\n\nUnder the alliance established by the [[Pacte de Famille]], in 1766 France agreed to leave after the Spanish complained about French presence in territories they considered their own. Spain agreed to compensate [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Louis de Bougainville]], the French admiral and explorer who had established the settlement on East Falkland at his own expense. In 1767, the Spanish formally assumed control of Port St. Louis and renamed it ''[[Puerto Soledad]]'' (English: Port Solitude).\n\nIn early 1770 Spanish commander, Don Juan Ignacio de Madariaga, briefly visited Port Egmont. On 10 June he returned from Argentina with five armed ships and 1400 soldiers [[Capture of Port Egmont|forcing the British to leave Port Egmont]]. This action sparked the [[Falkland Crisis (1770)|Falkland Crisis]] between 10 July 1770 to 22 January 1771 when Britain and Spain almost went to war over the islands. However conflict was averted when the colony was re-established by Captain John Stott with the ships {{HMS|Juno|1757|6}}, {{HMS|Hound|1745|6}} and HMS ''Florida'' (a mail ship which had already been at the founding of the original settlement). Egmont quickly became an important port-of-call for British ships sailing around [[Cape Horn]].\n\nHowever, with the growing economic pressures stemming from the upcoming [[American War of Independence]], the British government decided that it should withdraw its presence from many overseas settlements in 1774.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/timeline.html |title=Falkland Islands Timeline: A Chronology of events in the history of the Falkland Islands |accessdate=2 October 2007 |publisher=www.falklands.info |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006063014/http://www.falklands.info/history/timeline.html |archivedate=6 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  On 20 May 1776 the British forces under the command of Royal Naval Lieutenant Clayton formally left Port Egmont, while leaving a plaque asserting Britain's continuing sovereignty over the islands.<ref name=\"briefhistory2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/history2.html |title=A brief history of the Falkland Islands Part 2 - Fort St. Louis and Port Egmont |accessdate=19 July 2007 |publisher=www.falklands.info |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006063029/http://www.falklands.info/history/history2.html |archivedate=6 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the next four years, British sealers used Egmont as a base for their activities in the South Atlantic. This ended in 1780 when they were forced to leave by Spanish authorities who then ordered that the British colony be destroyed.\n\nSpain, which had a garrison at [[Puerto Soledad]] on East Falkland, which was administered from [[Montevideo]] until 1811 when it withdrew due to the military pressures created by the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain and the growing calls for [[South American wars of independence|independence by its colonies in South America]]. On departure, the Spanish also left a plaque proclaiming Spain's sovereignty over the islands as the British had done 35 years before.\n\n== Inter-colonial period ==\nFollowing the departure of the Spanish settlers, the [[Falkland Islands]] became the domain of whalers and sealers who used the islands to shelter from the worst of the South Atlantic weather. By merit of their location, the Falkland Islands have often been the last refuge for ships damaged at sea. Most numerous among those using the islands were British and American [[seal hunting|sealers]], where typically between 40 and 50 ships were engaged in exploiting [[fur seal]]s. This represents an itinerant population of up to 1,000 sailors.\n\n===''Isabella''===\nOn 8 February 1813 the British ship ''Isabella'', a ship of 193 tons and a crew of 14, was wrecked off the coast of [[Speedwell Island|Eagle Island]] (now known as Speedwell Island). Captain George Higton and five other men volunteered to make the hazardous voyage to the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]] in one of the ship's longboats. Braving the South Atlantic in a boat little more than {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}, they made landfall a month later. The British gun brig ''Nancy'' was sent to rescue the survivors.<ref>''Australian Shipwrecks - vol 1 1622-1850'', [[Charles Bateson]], AH and AW Reed, Sydney, 1972, {{ISBN|0-589-07112-2}} p48</ref>\n\nOn 5 April [[Charles Barnard (castaway)|Captain Charles Barnard]] of the American [[Seal hunting|sealer]] ''Nanina'' was sailing off the shore of [[Speedwell Island|Eagle Island]], with a discovery boat deployed looking for seals. Having seen smoke and heard gunshots the previous day, he was alert to the possibility of survivors of a ship wreck. This suspicion was heightened, when the crew of the discovery boat came aboard and informed the captain they had come across a new moccasin as well as the partially butchered remains of a seal. At dinner that evening, the crew observed a man approaching the ship who was shortly joined by eight to ten others. Both Barnard and the survivors from the ''Isabella'' had harboured concern the other party was Spanish and were relieved to discover their respective nationalities.\n\nBarnard dined with the ''Isabella'' survivors that evening and finding that the British party were unaware of the [[War of 1812]] informed the survivors that technically they were at war with each other. Nevertheless, Barnard promised to rescue the British party and set about preparations for the voyage to the River Plate. Realising that they had insufficient stores for the voyage he set about hunting wild pigs and otherwise acquiring additional food. However, while Barnard was gathering supplies, the British took the opportunity to seize the ''Nanina'' and departed leaving Barnard and three of his crew marooned. Shortly thereafter the ''Nanina'' encountered {{HMS|Nancy|1808|6}} under Lt D'Aranda, which had sailed from the River Plate in order to rescue the survivors of ''Isabella''. Lt D'Aranda took the ''Nanina'' as a prize.\n\nBarnard and his party survived for eighteen months marooned on the islands until the British ships ''[[Indispensable (1791 ship)|Indispensable]]''<!-- Please don't \"correct\" the spelling of the name of this ship, it is spelled with an \"a\" not an \"i\" --> and ''Asp'' rescued them in November 1814.

He captured ''Carlota'', a Portuguese ship, which was considered an act of piracy. A storm resulted in severe damage to ''Hero\u00edna'' and sank the prize ''Carlota'', forcing Jewett to put into [[Puerto Soledad]] for repairs in October 1820.\n\nCaptain Jewett sought assistance from the British explorer [[James Weddell]]. Weddell reported the letter he received from Jewett as:<ref>Weddell, James, ''A Voyage Towards the South Pole'', London, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, 1827</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Sir, I have the honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a commission from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands on behalf of the country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate ''[[Hero\u00edna (ship)|Hero\u00edna]]''.</blockquote>\n\nMany modern authors report this letter as representing the declaration issued by [[David Jewett|Jewett]].<ref name=\"Destefani\">Laurio H. Dest\u00e9fani, ''The Malvinas, the South Georgias and the South Sandwich Islands, the conflict with Britain'', Buenos Aires, 1982</ref>\n\nJewett's ship received Weddell's assistance in obtaining anchorage off [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]]. Weddell reported only 30 seamen and 40 soldiers fit for duty out of a crew of 200, and how Jewett slept with pistols over his head following the mutiny. On 6 November 1820, Jewett raised the flag of the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] (a predecessor of modern-day [[Argentina]]) and claimed possession of the islands. In the words of Weddell, \"In a few days, he took formal possession of these islands for the patriot government of Buenos Ayres, read a declaration under their colours, planted on a port in ruins, and fired a salute of twenty-one guns.\"<ref name=\"Weddell\">Weddell, James, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&id=tuIBAAAAYAAJ ''A Voyage Towards the South Pole''], London, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, 1827</ref>\n\nJewett departed from the Falkland Islands in April 1821. In total he had spent no more than six months on the island, entirely at Port Luis. In 1822, Jewett was accused of piracy by a Portuguese court, but by that time he was in Brazil.\n\n===Luis Vernet's enterprise===\n[[File:Vernet Luis Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Luis Vernet]]]]\n\nIn 1823, the United Provinces of the River Plate granted [[fishing]] rights to Jorge Pacheco and [[Luis Vernet]]. Travelling to the islands in 1824, the first expedition failed almost as soon as it landed, and Pacheco chose not to continue with the venture. Vernet persisted, but the second attempt, delayed until winter 1826 by a [[Brazil]]ian blockade, was also unsuccessful. The expedition intended to exploit the [[feral]] cattle on the islands but the [[Swamp|boggy]] conditions meant the [[gaucho]]s could not catch cattle in their traditional way. Vernet was by now aware of conflicting British claims to the islands and sought permission from the British [[consulate]] before departing for the islands.\n\nIn 1828, the United Provinces government granted Vernet all of [[East Falkland]] including all its resources, and exempted him from taxation if a colony could be established within three years. He took settlers, including British Captain Matthew Brisbane (who had sailed to the islands earlier with [[James Weddell|Weddell]]), and before leaving once again sought permission from the British Consulate in Buenos Aires. The British asked for a report for the British government on the islands, and Vernet asked for British protection should they return.<ref name=\"briefhistory3\">[http://www.falklands.info/history/history3.html A brief history of the Falkland Islands Part 3 - Louis Vernet: The Great Entrepreneur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401100750/http://www.falklands.info/history/history3.html |date=1 April 2010 }}, Accessed 2007-07-19</ref>\n\nOn 10 June 1829, Vernet was designated as 'civil and military commandant' of the islands (no Governor was ever appointed) and granted a monopoly on [[seal hunting]] rights. A protest was lodged by the British Consulate in [[Buenos Aires]]. By 1831, the colony was successful enough to be advertising for new colonists, although the ''Lexington'''s report suggests that the conditions on the islands were quite miserable.<!--Commenting out as this should be sourced from an external site if there is information not contained in the other reference: <ref>[[User:Apcbg/Duncan-Woodbury|Report by Silas Duncan, Commander U.S.S.

As a reprisal, the [[United States]] consul in Buenos Aires sent Captain [[Silas Duncan]] of the [[USS Lexington (1825)|USS ''Lexington'']] to recover the confiscated property. After finding what he considered proof that at least four American fishing ships had been captured, plundered, and even outfitted for war, Duncan took seven prisoners aboard the ''Lexington'' and charged them with [[piracy]].\n\nAlso taken on board, Duncan reported, \"were the whole of the (Falklands') population consisting of about forty persons, with the exception of some 'gauchos', or cowboys who were encamped in the interior.\" The group, principally [[Germany|German]] citizens from [[Buenos Aires]], \"appeared greatly rejoiced at the opportunity thus presented of removing with their families from a desolate region where the climate is always cold and cheerless and the soil extremely unproductive\". However, about 24 people did remain on the island, mainly gauchos and several [[Charr\u00faa people|Charr\u00faa]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], who continued to trade on Vernet's account.\n\nMeasures were taken against the settlement.

Painted during the survey of [[Tierra del Fuego]], it depicts the ''Beagle'' being hailed by native Fuegians. The ''Beagle'' visited the Falklands in 1834, and a Fuegian \"mission\" was later planted on [[Keppel Island]] in the west of the Falklands]]\n\nThe Argentinian assertions of sovereignty provided the spur for Britain to send a naval task force in order to finally and permanently return to the islands.\n\nOn 3 January 1833, Captain James Onslow, of the brig-sloop [[HMS Clio (1807)|HMS ''Clio'']], arrived at Vernet's settlement at Port Louis to request that the flag of the United Provinces of the River Plate be replaced with the British one, and for the administration to leave the islands. While Major [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pinedo]], commander of the schooner ''Sarand\u00ed'', wanted to resist, his numerical disadvantage was obvious, particularly as a large number of his crew were British mercenaries who were unwilling to fight their own countrymen. Such a situation was not unusual in the newly independent states in Latin America, where land forces were strong, but navies were frequently quite undermanned. As such he protested verbally, but departed without a fight on 5 January. Argentina claims that Vernet's colony was also expelled at this time, though sources from the time appear to dispute this, suggesting that the colonists were encouraged to remain initially under the authority of Vernet's storekeeper, [[William Dickson (Falklands)|William Dickson]] and later his deputy, Matthew Brisbane.<ref name=\"briefhistory3\" />\n\nInitial British plans for the Islands were based upon the continuation of Vernet's settlement at Port Louis. An Argentine immigrant of Irish origin, William Dickson, was appointed as the British representative and provided with a flagpole and flag to be flown whenever ships were in harbour.<ref name=\"briefhistory3\"/> In March 1833, Vernet's Deputy, Matthew Brisbane returned and presented his papers to Captain Fitzroy of HMS ''Beagle'', which coincidentally happened to be in harbour at the time. Fitzroy encouraged Brisbane to continue with Vernet's enterprise with the proviso that whilst private enterprise was encouraged, Argentine assertions of sovereignty would not be welcome.<ref name=\"brisbanefitzroy\"/>\n\nBrisbane reasserted his authority over Vernet's settlement and recommenced the practice of paying employees in promissory notes. Due to Vernet's reduced status, the promissory notes were devalued, which meant that the employees received fewer goods at Vernet's stores for their wages. After months of freedom following the ''Lexington'' raid this accentuated dissatisfaction with the leadership of the settlement. In August 1833, under the leadership of [[Antonio Rivero]], a gang of Creole and Indian gauchos ran amok in the settlement. Armed with muskets obtained from American sealers, the gang killed five members of Vernet's settlement including both Dickson and Brisbane. Shortly afterward the survivors fled Port Louis, seeking refuge on Turf Island in [[Berkeley Sound]] until rescued by the British sealer 'Hopeful' in October 1833.<ref name=\"briefhistory3\"/>\n\nLt Henry Smith was installed as the first British resident in January 1834. One of his first actions was to pursue and arrest Rivero's gang for the murders committed the previous August. The gang was sent for trial in London but could not be tried as the Crown Court did not have jurisdiction over the Falkland Islands. In the British colonial system, colonies had their own, distinct governments, finances, and judicial systems.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/British+colonies] British colonies - Hutchinson encyclopedia article about British colonies</ref><ref>Karsten, Peter, ''Between Law and Custom, \"High\" and \"Low\" Legal Cultures in the Lands of the British Diaspora - The United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, 1600-1900''</ref> Rivero was not tried and sentenced because the British local government and local judiciary had not yet been installed in 1834; these were created later, by the 1841 British [[Letters Patent]].<ref name=\"Destefani\"/>  Subsequently, Rivero has acquired the status of a folk hero in Argentina, where he is portrayed as leading a rebellion against British rule.<ref name=\"Destefani\"/> Ironically it was the actions of Rivero that were responsible for the ultimate demise of Vernet's enterprise on the Falklands.\n\n[[Charles Darwin]] revisited the Falklands in 1834; the settlements [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]] both take their names from this visit.\n\nAfter the arrest of Rivero, Smith set about restoring the settlement at Port Louis, repairing the damage done by the ''Lexington'' raid and renaming it 'Anson's Harbour'. Lt Lowcay succeeded Smith in April 1838, followed by Lt Robinson in September 1839 and Lt Tyssen in December 1839.<ref name=\"briefhistory3\"/>\n\nVernet later attempted to return to the Islands but was refused permission to return. The British Crown reneged on promises and refused to recognise rights granted by Captain Onslow at the time of the reoccupation.

Admiral George Grey, conducting the geographic survey in November 1836 had the following to say about their first view of East Falkland:\n\n{{quote|We anchored a little after sunset off a creek called '[[Johnson's Harbour]]'. The day having been cloudy with occasional showers, these islands at all times dreary enough, looked particularly so on our first view of them, the shores of [[Berkeley Sound|sound]], steep, with bare hills intersected with ravines rising from them, these hills without a tree and the clouds hanging low, gave them exactly the appearance of the [[Cheviots]] or a [[Scotland|Scotch]] moor on a winter's day and considering we were in the May of these latitudes, the first impression of the climate was not favourable, the weather however, was not called, the thermometer was 63 degrees Fahrenheit [17\u00b0C] which is [[Howick, Northumberland|Howick]] mid-summer temperature.}}\n\nPressure to develop the islands as a colony began to build as the result of a campaign mounted by British merchant G.T. Whittington. Whittington formed the Falkland Islands Commercial Fishery and Agricultural Association and (based on information indirectly obtained from Vernet) published a pamphlet entitled \"The Falkland Islands\". Later a petition signed by London merchants was presented to the [[Whig Government 1835-1841|British Government]] demanding the convening of a public meeting to discuss the future development of the Falkland Islands. Whittington petitioned the [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]],  [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], proposing that his association be allowed to colonise the islands. In May 1840, the British Government made the decision to colonise the Falkland Islands.\n\nUnaware of the decision by the [[Whig Government 1835-1841|British Government]] to colonise the islands, Whittington grew impatient and decided to take action of his own initiative.{{when|date=September 2015}} Obtaining two ships, he sent his brother, J.

This post was renamed [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]] in 1843, when he also became Commander-in-Chief of the Falkland Islands. Moody left England for Falkland on 1 October 1841 aboard the ship ''Hebe'' and\narrived in [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Anson's Harbour]] later that month. He was accompanied by twelve sappers and miners and their families; together with Whittington's colonists this brought the population of Anson's Harbour to approximately 50. When Moody arrived, the Falklands was 'almost in a state of anarchy', but he used his powers 'with great wisdom and moderation'<ref name=\"Richard Clement Moody Obituary, ICE\">Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 90, Issue 1887, 1887, pp. 453-455, OBITUARY. MAJOR-GENERAL RICHARD CLEMENT MOODY, R.E., 1813-1887.</ref> to develop the Islands' infrastructure and, commanding detachment of sappers, erected government offices, a school and barracks, residences, ports, and a new road system.\n\nIn 1842, Moody was instructed by [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] the British [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] to report on the potential of the [[Port William, Falkland Islands|Port William]] area as the site of the new capital. Moody assigned the task of surveying the area to [[James Clark Ross|Captain Ross]], leader of the [[List of Antarctic expeditions|Antarctic Expedition]]. Captain Ross delivered his report in 1843, concluding that Port William afforded a good deep-water anchorage for naval vessels, and that the southern shores of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Jackson]] was a suitable location for the proposed settlement. Moody accepted the recommendation of Ross and construction of the new settlement started in July 1843. Inn July 1845, at Moody's suggestion, the new capital of the islands was officially named [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]] after [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]]. Not everyone was enthused with the selection of the location of the new capital, J. B. Whittington famously remarked that \"Of all the miserable bog holes, I believe that Mr Moody has selected one of the worst for the site of his town.\"\n\nThe structure of the Colonial Government was established in 1845 with the formation of the Legislative Council and [[Executive Council of the Falkland Islands|Executive Council]] and work on the construction of [[Government House (Falkland Islands)|Government House]] commenced. The following year, the first officers appointed to the Colonial Government took their posts; by this time a number of residences, a large storage shed, carpenter's shop and blacksmith's shop had been completed and the Government Dockyard laid out. In 1845 Moody introduced tussock grass into Great Britain from Falkland, for which he received the gold medal of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]].<ref name=\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Richard Clement Moody\"/> The [[Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands]] notably includes an image of tussock grass.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wagstaff|first=William|title=Falkland Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBSzvruimFgC&pg=PA18|accessdate=1 February 2013|year=2001|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841620374|page=18}}</ref> Moody returned to England in February 1849.<ref name=\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Richard Clement Moody\"/> [[Moody Brook]] is named after him.<ref name=\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Richard Clement Moody\">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Richard Clement Moody</ref>\n\nWith the establishment of the deep-water anchorage and improvements in port facilities, Stanley saw a dramatic increase in the number of visiting ships in the 1840s in part due to the [[California Gold Rush]]. A boom in ship provisioning and ship-repair resulted, aided by the notoriously bad weather in the South Atlantic and around [[Cape Horn]]. Stanley and the Falkland Islands are famous as the repository of many wrecks of 19th-century ships that reached the islands only to be condemned as unseaworthy and were often employed as floating warehouses by local merchants.\n\nAt one point in the 19th century, Stanley became one of the world's busiest ports. However, the ship-repair trade began to slacken off in 1876 with the establishment of the [[Plimsoll line]], which saw the elimination of the so-called [[coffin ship (insurance)|coffin ships]] and unseaworthy vessels that might otherwise have ended up in Stanley for repair. With the introduction of increasingly reliable iron [[Steamboat|steamships]] in the 1890s the trade declined further and was no longer viable following the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914. Port Stanley continued to be a busy port supporting whaling and sealing activities in the early part of the 20th century, British warships (and garrisons) in the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World War]] and the [[fishing]] and [[cruise ship]] industries in the latter half of the century.\n\n[[File:WhaleboneArchCathedral.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Christ Church Cathedral and Whalebone Arch]]\n\n[[Government House (Falkland Islands)|Government House]] opened as the offices of the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Lieutenant Governor]] in 1847.  [[Government House (Falkland Islands)|Government House]] continued to develop with various additions, formally becoming the Governor's residence in 1859 when [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Governor Moore]] took residence. Government House remains the residence of the Governor.\n\nMany of the colonists begin to move from [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Ansons' Harbour]] to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]]. As the new town expanded, the population grew rapidly, reaching 200 by 1849. The population was further expanded by the arrival of 30 married [[Chelsea pensioner|Chelsea Pensioners]] and their families. The Chelsea Pensioners were to form the permanent garrison and police force, taking over from the Royal Sappers and Miners Regiment who had garrisoned the early colony.\n\nThe Exchange Building opened in 1854; part of the building was later used as a church. 1854 also saw the establishment of Marmont Row, including the Eagle Inn, now known as the [[Falkland Islands Holdings|Upland Goose Hotel]]. In 1887, Jubilee Villas were built to celebrate the [[Golden Jubilee]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. Jubilee Villas are a row of brick built houses that follow a traditional British pattern; positioned on Ross road near the waterfront, they became an iconic image during the [[Falklands War]].\n\n[[Peat]] is common on the islands and has traditionally been exploited as a fuel. Uncontrolled exploitation of this natural resource led to [[Landslide|peat slips]] in 1878 and 1886. The 1878 peat slip resulted in the destruction of several houses, whilst the 1886 peat slip resulted in the deaths of two women and the destruction of the Exchange Building.\n\n[[Christ Church Cathedral (Falkland Islands)|Christ Church Cathedral]] was consecrated in 1892 and completed in 1903. It received its famous [[Baleen|whalebone]] arch, constructed from the jaws of two [[blue whale]]s, in 1933 to commemorate the [[Centennial|centenary]] of continuous British administration. Also consecrated in 1892 was the Tabernacle United Free Church, constructed from an imported timber kit.\n\n=== Development of agriculture and the Camp ===\n{{further|Camp (Falkland Islands)|Patagonian sheep farming boom}}\n[[File:Sapper-Hill-Corral.jpg|thumb|right|One of the remaining historic [[corral]]s at Sapper Hill, near Stanley.]]\n\nA few years after the British had established themselves in the islands, a number of new British settlements were started. Initially many of these settlements were established in order to exploit the [[feral]] cattle on the islands. Following the introduction of the [[Cheviot sheep|Cheviot]] breed of sheep to the islands in 1852, sheep farming became the dominant form of agriculture on the Islands.\n\n[[Salvador Settlement]] was one of the earliest, being started in the 1830s, by a [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] immigrant (hence its other name of \"Gibraltar Settlement\"), and it is still run by his descendants, the Pitalugas.\n\nVernet furnished Samuel Fisher Lafone, a British merchant operating from [[Montevideo]], with details of the Falkland Islands including a map. Sensing that the exploitation of feral cattle on the islands would be a lucrative venture, in 1846 he negotiated a contract with the British Government that gave him exclusive rights to this resource. Until 1846 [[Richard Moody|Moody]] had allotted feral cattle to new settlers and the new agreement not only prevented this but made Stanley dependent upon Lafone for supplies of [[beef]].\n\n[[Cattle]] were concentrated in the southern part of [[East Falkland]], an area that became known as [[Lafonia]]. Lafone was an absentee landlord and never actually set foot on the islands. His activities were not monitored by the British and rather than introducing more British settlers as he promised, he brought large numbers of Spanish and Indian gauchos to hunt cattle. In 1846, they established [[Hope Place]] on the south shores of [[Brenton Loch]] and in 1849 a sod wall (the Boca wall) was built across the isthmus at [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] to control the movement of cattle.\n\n[[File:Falkland-Islands-Company.JPG|thumb|left|Falkland Islands Company's historical building in Stanley]]\nLafone continued to develop his business interests and in 1849 looked to establish a joint stock company with his [[London]] creditors. The company was launched as ''The Royal Falkland Land, Cattle, Seal and Fishery Company'' in 1850 but soon thereafter was incorporated under Royal Charter as [[Falkland Islands Company|The Falkland Islands Company Limited]].  Lafone became a director and his brother-in-law J.P. Dale the company's first manager in the Islands. By 1852, the feral cattle had been hunted virtually to extinction by gauchos and the company switched to sheep farming with the introduction of the [[Cheviot sheep|Cheviot]] breed of sheep. Hope Place proved to be an unsuitable location and the operation moved to [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]]. In 1860, the Lafone Beef contract was terminated but the Falkland Islands Company was given a grant to [[Lafonia]]. Ownership of the remaining cattle outside of Lafonia reverted to the Crown and hunting cattle without permission was banned.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]], [[Goose Green]], [[Fox Bay]] and [[Port Howard]] were established. Port Howard was founded by James Lovegrove Waldron, and his brother in 1866; the Waldron brothers later left for [[Patagonia]], but left the farm under local management.<ref name=\"Wigglesworth\">Wigglesworth, Angela. (1992) ''Falkland People''. Pub. Peter Owen. {{ISBN|0-7206-0850-3}}</ref>\n\nDarwin was initially the haunt of ''[[gaucho]]s'' and cattle farmers, but sheep farming came to dominate the area, and Scottish shepherds were brought in. A few years later, the first large tallow works in the islands (though not the first) was set up by the FIC in 1874. It handled 15,891 sheep in 1880.<ref name = \"Ian_Strange\"/>\n\nFrom the 1880s, until 1972, Darwin and [[Fox Bay]] had their own separate medical officers. Nowadays, most medical care is based in Stanley.<ref name = \"Ian_Strange\"/>\n\n=== Exploitation of maritime resources ===\nThe [[Falkland Islands]] were used as a base for [[Whaler|whaling ships]] hunting the [[southern right whale]] and [[sperm whale]] from the 1770s until British authority was established over the islands and surrounding seas.  [[Whaling]] was briefly revived with the establishment of a whaling station on [[New Island]] from 1909 to 1917 until whaling operations moved to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]].\n\n[[Fur seal]]s had long been exploited for their pelts but numbers entered a drastic decline in the early 19th century. As a result, seal hunting died off, although continuing at a low level. In order to conserve stocks, a ban on the hunting of fur seals during summers months was enacted in 1881, but it was not until 1921 that hunting was banned entirely.\n\n[[Elephant seal]]s were exploited for oil but like the fur seals their numbers declined drastically in the mid-1850s. Sealers instead turned their attention to the [[South American sea lion]] resulting in a dramatic decline in their numbers that made sealing uneconomic. Attempts to revive the trade, including a sealing station at [[Port Albermarle]], were unsuccessful.\n\nEven penguins were exploited for oil. [[Southern rockhopper penguin|Rockhopper]] and [[Gentoo penguin|gentoo]] [[penguin]]s were rendered down in [[Try pot|trypots]] from 1860 until the 1880s.\n\n== Twentieth century ==\n\n===Establishment of communications===\nAlthough the first telephone lines were installed by the Falkland Islands Company in the 1880s, the Falkland Islands Government was slow to embrace telephony. It was not until 1897 that a telephone line was installed between [[Cape Pembroke]] lighthouse and the police station. The islands isolation was broken in 1911 when [[Guglielmo Marconi]] installed a wireless telegraphy station that enabled telegrams to be sent to mainland Uruguay.<ref name=\"CableWireless\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cwfi.co.fk/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427080501/http://www.cwfi.co.fk/history.html |archivedate=27 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }} Cable & Wireless, The Falkland Islands, Our History</ref>\n\nA line was laid between Darwin and Stanley, with the ship ''Consort'' landing poles on the coast. Construction commenced in 1906 and was finished in 1907 (a length of nearly {{convert|50|mi|disp=or}}). The line was initially only for business but the public could make calls occasionally.<ref name = \"Ian_Strange\"/>  Lines continued to be laid to most of the major settlements in the islands, with the Falkland Islands police responsible for their maintenance till 1927. Communications among the settlements relied on the telephone network until radio telephones were introduced in the 1950s, although the telephone network continued until 1982.<ref name =\"CableWireless\"/>  Telecommunications improved dramatically after the [[Falklands War]], when an earth station was installed to allow direct dialling for the first time. In 1997, an Internet service was launched and by 2002 nearly 90% of Falkland homes had Internet access.<ref name =\"CableWireless\"/>\n\n===Economic development===\n[[File:Ajaxbayview.jpg|right|thumb|The freezer plant at [[Ajax Bay]]. Most of the workers' cottages were moved to Stanley]]\n\nA canning factory was opened in 1911 at Goose Green and was initially extremely successful. It absorbed a large proportion of surplus sheep but during the postwar slump it suffered a serious loss and closed in 1921.<ref name = \"Ian_Strange\"/>\n\nDespite this setback, a mere year later, the settlement grew after it became the base for the [[Falkland Islands Company]]'s [[sheep farm]] in [[Lafonia]] in 1922, with improved sheep handling and wool shed being built.<ref name = \"Ian_Strange\"/> In 1927, the settlement's huge sheep shearing shed was built, which is claimed to be the world's largest, with a capacity of five thousand sheep.<ref name=\"Wigglesworth\" /> In 1979, 100,598 sheep were shorn at Goose Green<ref name = \"Ian_Strange\"/>\n\nThe mid-20th century saw a number of abortive attempts to diversify the islands' economy away from large scale sheep ranching.\n\nIn the period just after the Second World War, [[Port Albemarle]], in the south west of [[West Falkland]], was enlarged during the post-WWII period by the [[Colonial Development Company]] and included its own power station, jetty, [[Nissen hut]]s etc.; this was an attempt to revive the old sealing industry which had flourished during the 19th century. However, the project proved to be unviable, not least because seal numbers had declined massively.\n\n[[File:Shovel-Falklands.jpg|thumb|Islanders shovelling [[peat]] (1950s)]]\nSimilarly, [[Ajax Bay]] on [[Falkland Sound]], was developed by the [[Colonial Development Corporation]] in the 1950s, which was also responsible for developing Port Albemarle. It was mainly a refrigeration plant, and was supposed to freeze Falkland [[mutton]], but this was found to be economically unviable, despite the huge expense incurred. Many of the pre-fabricated houses here were moved to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. The site later became a British field hospital during the landings of [[Operation Sutton]].\n\nThe seas around the Falkland Islands were not well policed prior to the Falklands War, and many foreign boats fished off the islands, despite protests that potential revenue was being lost. Fishing licences were only later to be introduced.\n\n===Education===\nIn 1956, J.L. Waldron Ltd built a school at Port Howard, possibly inspired by the \"gift\" of the FIC at Darwin, a few years earlier.<ref name = \"Ian_Strange\">Strange, Ian, ''The Falkland Islands'', 1983</ref>\n\nUp until the 1970s, Goose Green was the site of a boarding school, run by the state. [[Camp (Falklands)|\"Camp\"]] children boarded here, and there were 40 spaces. The boarding school was later transferred to Stanley, although the recent emphasis has been on locally based education. The school itself became an Argentine HQ, and was burnt down. A new (day) school has been built for local children.<ref name=\"Wigglesworth\" />\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:HMS Canopus news mimic.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Canopus''. Canopus Hill in the [[Falkland Islands]] commemorates her role in the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]].]]\n[[File:Falklandschlacht.jpg|right|thumb|The '''[[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]''', 8 December 1914. The German [[armoured cruiser]]s under Admiral von Spee that had been raiding British sealanes were sunk by a British [[battlecruiser]] task force.]]\n{{main|Battle of the Falkland Islands}}\n\nPort Stanley became an important coaling station for the [[Royal Navy]]. This led to ships based there being involved in major naval engagements in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s.\n\nThe strategic significance of the [[Falkland Islands]] was confirmed by the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands|second major naval engagement]] of the [[World War I|First World War]]. [[Admiral]] [[Graf Maximilian von Spee]]'s [[German East Asia Squadron]] called at the islands on its trip from the [[Pacific Ocean]] back to [[Germany]], intending to destroy the [[Royal Navy]] radio relay station and coaling depot there. Unknown to Spee, a British [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]], including two [[battlecruiser]]s considerably more powerful than his forces, had been sent to hunt down his squadron and happened to be in the harbour coaling. In the one-sided battle which followed, most of Spee's squadron was sunk. [[Canopus Hill]], south of Stanley, is named after [[HMS Canopus (1897)|HMS ''Canopus'']], which had fired the first shot in the battle.\n\n===Second World War===\n\nThe [[Falkland Islands Defence Force]] was called out to man gun positions and signalling posts around Stanley as soon as word was received of Britain's declaration of war on 3 September 1939. Mounted patrols were carried out in the Camp, and coast-watching stations were created around the islands to guard against the approach of enemy ships and the landing of enemy forces. The Falkland Islanders experienced much the same kind of war-time privations and restrictions as the British population, including black-outs, travel restrictions, and rationing.<ref name=\"FIMNT - WW2\">{{cite web|title=Falkland Islands Museum & National Trust Website -World War 2|url=http://www.falklands-museum.com/index.php/history/world-war-2|publisher=Falkland Islands Museum & National Trust|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn December, 1939, in the immediate aftermath of the [[Battle of the River Plate]], [[County class cruiser|County class]] heavy cruiser [[HMS Cumberland (C57)|HMS ''Cumberland'']], which had been self-refitting in the [[Falkland Islands]] at the time of the battle, steamed to join ''Ajax'' and ''Achilles'' at the mouth of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]], trapping the [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Graf Spee]]. Convinced by British [[propaganda]] and false intelligence that a major naval task force awaited his ship and short of ammunition, Captain [[Hans Langsdorff|Langsdorf]] of the ''Graf Spee'' chose instead to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship rather than face the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=\"FIMNT - WW2\"/>\n\n[[Operation Tabarin]], an expedition to the Antarctic, was mounted from the islands during the war. The purpose of the expecition was to assert Britain's claims on the continent, as well as gather scientific data. Operation Tabarin was later replaced by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), which was later renamed the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS).<ref name=\"FIMNT - WW2\"/>\n\nIn 1942, in response to the Japanese entry into the war, additional forces were sent to the islands to strengthen their defence against invasion. The largest component of these additional forces was a battalion of the [[West Yorkshire Regiment]]. In 1944, as a result of the reduced threat of invasion from Japan, the West Yorks were replaced by a smaller contingent of the [[Royal Scots]].<ref name=\"FIMNT - WW2\"/>\n\nOver the whole war more than 150 Falkland Islanders out of a population of only 2,300 volunteered for the British armed forces - 6.5% of the entire population - 24 of whom did not return. In July 1944, all volunteers were given the right to be identified by a \"Falkland Islands\" [[shoulder-flash]].<ref name=\"FIMNT - WW2\"/> In addition to these contributions to the British war-effort, the Falkland Islands also donated five [[Supermarine Spitfires]] to the British [[Royal Air Force]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Falklands donated three aircraft to WW1 effort, and the five Spitfires in WW2|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/08/28/falklands-donated-three-aircraft-to-ww1-effort-and-the-five-spitfires-in-ww2|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=Mercopress|date=28 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Argentine incursions===\nWith the exception of an attempt by President [[Juan Peron]] to buy the Falkland Islands in 1953 which was rejected as inconceivable by the British government,<ref name=NYTPeron>{{cite web\n|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/03/world/peron-in-1953-tried-to-buy-the-falklands.html\n|title = Peron in 1953 Tried To Buy the Falklands\n|author = Reuters\n|date = 3 January 1984\n|publisher = The New York Times\n|accessdate = 2013-08-05}}</ref> the immediate post-war period was fairly uneventful. However, a series of incidents in the 1960s marked the intensification of Argentine sovereignty claims.\n\nThe first of these took place in 1964, when a light plane piloted by Miguel Fitzgerald touched down on the racecourse at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. Leaping from the aircraft, he handed a letter claiming sovereignty to a bemused [[Falkland Islanders|islander]] before flying off again. The stunt was timed to coincide with Argentine diplomatic efforts at the UN Decolonisation Committee.\n\n[[File:MiguelLFitzergersald.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Miguel L.

There, they raised seven Argentine flags and took four islanders hostage. The planning had been done during a trip to the islands that one of the leaders, Cristina Verrier, had made as a tourist. Before leaving, twenty plotters had been \"locked up\" for three days at a training camp on a \"spiritual retreat.\" At one point, two of them left the group.<ref name=AviationSafety>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19660928-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas DC-4 LV-AGG Port Stanley|first=Harro|last=Ranter|website=aviation-safety.net}}</ref><ref name=OperativoC\u00f3ndor>[https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-73613-2006-09-27.html \"Operativo C\u00f3ndor en las Malvinas, anticipo de los \u201970,\" Adri\u00e1n Figueroa D\u00edaz, ''P\u00e1gina 12,'' September 27, 2006]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Mary Cawkell 2001 113\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1457899-la-historia-de-18-jovenes-que-secuestraron-un-avion-para-pisar-malvinas | title=La historia de 18 j\u00f3venes que secuestraron un avi\u00f3n para pisar Malvinas | work=La Nacion | accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe airliner left at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. from [[Buenos Aires]], bound for [[Rio Gallegos]] with 48 passengers on board, including Argentine Rear Admiral [[Jose Maria Guzm\u00e1n]], who was on his way to [[Tierra del Fuego]], an Argentine territory of which he was governor.

The 26 passengers were then allowed to disembark and sent to lodge with local families, as the island had no hotel. On being taken past the governor's residence, Guzm\u00e1n laughingly commented: ''\"Mi casa\"'' (\"my house\").<ref name=DailyTelegraph/>\n\nAfter a bitterly cold night in the aircraft, which contained only brandy, wine, orange juice and a few biscuits, the kidnappers surrendered.<ref name=DailyTelegraph>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/5819646/Les-Gleadell.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Les Gleadell | date=13 July 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> They were kept locked up in an annex to St Mary's Church for a week until they were put aboard an Argentine ship, the ''Bahia Buen Suceso,'' which had lingered outside the harbor awaiting conclusion of the affair.

The 12-man team, which landed some {{convert|40|km|mi|0}} from Stanley, was led by Juan Jose Lombardo who later, as Chief of Naval Operations, planned the [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands]].<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/03/31/malvinas.html#prof Malvinas: los secretos de la guerra] {{es icon}}</ref>\n[[File:ARA-Stgo.jpg|left|thumb|The locally upgraded [[Balao class|''Balao'' class]] submarine ARA ''Santiago del Estero'' (S-12), Argentine Naval Base at [[Mar del Plata]], ''circa'' 1969]]\nIn November 1968, Miguel Fitzgerald was hired by the Argentine press to attempt a reprise of his 1964 landing. Accompanied by one of the 1966 hijackers, he flew to Stanley but on arrival found he could not land at the racecourse due to obstacles placed following the hijacking. The plane was forced to crash land on Eliza Cove Road, but the two occupants were unharmed. The stunt was intended to coincide with the visit of [[Alun Jones, Baron Chalfont|Lord Chalfont]] to the islands.\n\nThe latter incident proved counter-productive to the Argentine sovereignty push, as Lord Chalfont had been talking to a public meeting at the time of the plane's arrival. The islanders made it plain to Lord Chalfont that they rejected a Memorandum of Agreement negotiated between Britain and Argentina that August which stated that Britain was prepared to discuss sovereignty provided the islanders' wishes were respected. This spurred the formation of the Falkland Islands Committee by London barrister Bill Hunter-Christie and others. The Emergency Committee, as it became known, proved to be an effective lobbying organisation, constantly undermining Foreign Office initiatives on sovereignty negotiations. In December 1968, the lobbying effort managed to force the British Government to state that the islanders' wishes would be paramount.\n\n===Growing links with Argentina===\nPartly as the result of diplomatic pressure, economic and political links with [[Argentina]] increased in the 1960s and 1970s. These became severed after the end of the Falklands War, but before the war they were not entirely negative, and some islanders sent their children to boarding schools in Argentina.\n\nRealising that any talks on the sovereignty issue would be derailed if it did not meet with the islanders' wishes, the British and Argentine Governments enacted a series of measures designed to encourage dependence on Argentina. In 1971, following secret talks between the two Governments (and without consulting the islanders), the communications agreement was signed. The thrust of the agreement was the establishment of direct air and sea links between the islands and Argentina, together with agreements on postal and telephony services. Following the agreement the subsidised shipping link with [[Montevideo]] ended, a passenger and cargo ship service to the mainland (that would ameliorate any dependence on Argentina) was promised by the British but never provided.\n\n[[LADE|''L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas del Estado'' (LADE)]], the airline operated by the [[Argentine Air Force|Argentine Air Force (''Fuerza A\u00e9rea Argentina'' or FAA)]], began an air link to the islands. Initially this service operated [[amphibious aircraft]] between [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] and Stanley using [[HU-16 Albatross|Grumman HU-16 Albatross]] aircraft.<ref>[http://web.sion.com/s.alaimo/malvinas.html] Commemorative Stamps of first flights {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030154615/http://web.sion.com/s.alaimo/malvinas.html |date=30 October 2009 }}</ref>  The inauguration of the service was commemorated by a series of stamps issued by both the Argentine and Falkland Island postal services. In 1972, a temporary airstrip was constructed by Argentina near [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. Britain constructed a small permanent airstrip in 1976 suitable only for short haul flights.\n\nAs part of the agreement, islanders had to travel via Argentina and were forced to carry Argentine Identity Cards issued in [[Buenos Aires]]. The ''Tarjeta Provisoria'' or \"white card\" as they were known were hated by the islanders, who felt they were a ''[[de facto]]'' Argentine [[passport]], since only islanders were required to use them and not other temporary residents of the islands. Tensions were raised further with the agreement that male [[Falkland Islander]]s would not have to undertake conscription into the [[Argentine Army]], since this carried the implication that [[Falkland Islander]]s were Argentine citizens.\n\n[[LADE]] set up an office in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] and mail was routed through Argentina. Medical treatments unavailable in the islands were provided in Argentina and scholarships were made available for study in [[Buenos Aires]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and other Argentine cities.  [[Spanish language]] teachers were provided by Argentina.  [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] officials in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] were instructed to do everything possible to foster good relations between the Islands and Argentina.\n\nThe islands became more dependent upon Argentina, when the British and Argentine governments agreed that the islands would be supplied with petrol, diesel and oil by [[Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales|YPF]], the Argentine national oil and gas company.\n\n[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|right|thumb|upright|[[Prime Minister]] [[James Callaghan|Jim Callaghan]] sent a naval task force in response to Argentine pressure in 1976.]]\n\nDespite these tensions relationships between the islanders and the Argentines operating the new services in the islands were cordial. Although there was apprehension, politics were generally avoided and on a one-to-one basis there was never any real hostility.\n\nOn the international level, relations began to sour in 1975 when Argentine delegates at the London meeting of the International Parliamentary Union condemned Britain's \"act of international piracy\" in establishing a colony in the Falkland Islands. Diplomatic relations between Britain and Argentina were broken but resumed in 1976.\n\nIn October 1975, the British Government tasked [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]] (son of the Antarctic explorer [[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton]]) with an economic survey of the [[Falkland Islands]]. The Argentine Government reacted furiously and refused permission for [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]] to travel via Argentina. Later the ship transporting Shackleton to the islands, the [[RRS Shackleton|RRS ''Shackleton'']], was fired upon by the Argentine [[destroyer]] [[USS Cowell (DD-547)|ARA ''Almirante Storni'']].\n\nIn 1976, after a military ''[[military junta|junta]]'' took control of the country, Argentina covertly established a [[Corbeta Uruguay|military base]] on [[Southern Thule]]. It was discovered by the [[British Antarctic Survey]] ship [[RRS Bransfield|RRS ''Bransfield'']] in 1977. The British protested but restricted their response to a diplomatic protest. Backing up the diplomatic efforts, the British Prime Minister [[James Callaghan|Jim Callaghan]] sent a naval task force consisting of surface ships and a [[Submarine|nuclear submarine]]. Nevertheless, Argentine aircraft and warships harassed ships fishing in Falkland waters.\n\n[[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]]'s report was delivered in 1977 and documented the economic stagnation in the islands. It nevertheless concluded that the islands made a net contribution to the British economy and had economic potential for development. Recommendations included oil exploration, exploitation of the fisheries, extension of the Stanley runway, the creation of a development agency, the expansion of the road network, expansion of the facilities at Stanley harbour and the breakdown of absentee landlord owned farms into family units. The report was largely ignored at the time, as it was felt that acting upon it would sour relations with Argentina. A reprise of the report by [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]] in 1982 following the [[Falklands War]] became the blueprint for subsequent economic development of the islands.\n\n===Falklands War===\n{{main|Events leading to the Falklands War|1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Occupation of the Falkland Islands|Falklands War}}[[File:Military Government message from the Falklands War (5612267360).jpg|thumb|225px|left|A message issued by the Argentine Military Governor during the occupation warning the Islanders against attempts to sabotage Argentine military equipment.]]\n[[Argentina]] invaded the islands on 2 April 1982, using special forces, which landed at [[Mullet Creek]] and advanced on Government House in Stanley, with a secondary force coming in from [[Yorke Bay]]. They encountered little opposition, there being only a small force of fifty-seven British marines and eleven sailors, in addition to the [[Falkland Islands Defence Force]] (who were later sent to [[Fox Bay]]). There was only one Argentine fatality. The event garnered international attention at a level which the islands had never experienced before, and made them a household name in the UK.\n\nFor a brief period, the Falkland Islands found themselves under Argentine control. This included [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] signage, and attempts to make the islanders [[drive on the right]] (although few roads in the Falklands at the time actually had two lanes). In many parts of the [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]], such as [[Goose Green]] and [[Pebble Island]], the islanders found themselves under [[house arrest]].\n\nThe British responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and, after fierce fighting, forced the Argentine garrison to surrender on 14 June 1982. The war proved to be an anomaly in a number of different respects, not least that it proved that small arms still had a role to play. It also had major consequences for the ''Junta'', which was toppled soon afterwards.\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s general political legacy remains controversial and divisive within the UK and within the context of the Falklands her government's withdrawal of HMS ''Endurance'' is a stated contributing factor to the causes of the conflict because it gave the wrong signals about the UK attitude towards maintaining its possession.   However, within the Falklands, she is considered a heroine because of the determination of her response to the Argentine invasion.  The islands celebrate ''Margaret Thatcher Day'' on every 10 January, and named a street ''Thatcher Drive'' after her, in Stanley.\n\n== Post-war ==\n[[File:Kirchner-UN General Assembly (2007).jpg|right|thumb|President [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] continued to pursue Argentine claims to the islands. His wife [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] is the incumbent.]]\n\nFollowing the war, Britain focused on improving its facilities on the islands. It increased its military presence significantly, building a large base at [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] and its port at [[Mare Harbour]]. It also invested heavily in improving facilities in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] and transportation and infrastructure around the islands, tarmacking the Stanley - Mount Pleasant road and many roads within Stanley.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/south-america/falkland-islands\n|title = Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory)\n|publisher= [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]\n|year = 2011\n|accessdate = 22 September 2011}}</ref> The population has risen due to the growth of Stanley, but has declined in ''[[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]]'' (the countryside).\nSince November 2008, a regular [[ferry]] service has linked [[East Falkland|East]] and [[West Falkland|West]], carrying cars, passengers and cargo serviced by MV ''Concordia Bay'', a 42.45&nbsp;m twin-screw shallow draft (2.59&nbsp;m) landing craft.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.holyheadtowing.co.uk/vessels/concordia-bay/\n|title = Concordia Bay\n|publisher = Holyhead Towing Company Ltd\n|year = 2010\n|accessdate = 2010-12-29}}</ref>\n\nA major change to the way the Falkland Islands are governed was introduced by the 1985 constitution. Under the 1985 constitution the Falkland Islands Government (FIG) became a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, with the governor as head of government and representative of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]]. Members of the FIG are democratically elected; the Governor is purely a figurehead with no [[Executive (government)|executive powers]]. Effectively under this constitution, the Falkland Islands are self-governing with the exception of foreign policy, although the FIG represents itself at the [[United Nations Special Committee on Decolonisation]] as the British Government no longer attends.\n\nLinks with Argentina became severed during the post-war period, with laws being introduced to forbid Argentine citizens from buying land. An alternative trading partner was found in [[Chile]], and over the years, the islands found themselves with closer links to that country, with flights being introduced to [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], in the far south of [[Patagonia]]n Chile, near [[Tierra del Fuego]]. In recent years, Argentines have been allowed to visit the islands again, often to visit the military cemeteries where their friends and loved ones are buried.\n\n[[File:Falklands-Minefield.JPG|thumb|An Argentine minefield at Port William]]\n\nMines continue to be a persistent problem, and though some areas have been cleared, massive [[minefield]]s are still to be found on both the main islands and elsewhere, particularly in the areas immediately around Stanley. Because [[peat]] moves over time, the mines themselves have shifted location.\n\nAs well as the military build-up, the UK also passed the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]] which granted full [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] to the islanders. High-profile British dignitaries also visited to show British commitment to the islands, including [[Margaret Thatcher]], the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]]. In 1985, the Falkland Islands Dependency was split into the Falkland Islands proper and a new separate territory of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nRelations between the UK and Argentina remained hostile following 1982, and diplomatic relations were restored in 1989. Although the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution calling for the UK and Argentina to return to negotiations over the Islands' future,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r009.htm|title=A/RES/37/9.  Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)|website=www.un.org}}</ref> the UK ruled out any further talks over the Islands' sovereignty. The UK also maintained an arms [[embargo]] against Argentina that was initiated during the 1982 war, which forced Argentine armed forces, a traditional UK buyer, switch to other markets.\n\n<!--Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:203301 queen and menem shake hands300.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] greets [[Carlos Menem]] at [[Buckingham Palace]], [[London]] in October 1998.]]-->\nRelations between the [[English settlement in Argentina|UK and Argentina]] improved further in the 1990s. In 1998, [[Carlos Menem]], the [[President of Argentina]] visited London, where he reaffirmed his country's claims to the Islands, although he stated that Argentina would use only peaceful means for their recovery. In 2001, [[Tony Blair]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] visited Argentina where he stated that he hoped the UK and Argentina could resolve their differences that led to the 1982 war. However, no talks on sovereignty took place during the visit. His reception in Argentina was more welcoming than that of the Princess of Wales ([[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana Spencer]]) in 1995, who was heckled by the mother of an Argentine soldier killed in the war.\n\n===Increased British military presence and new bases===\n{{main|RAF Mount Pleasant|Mare Harbour}}\nAfter the war ended, the British still faced the problem of potential Argentine aggression in the future, so an aircraft carrier had to remain on station to guard the islands with its [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] of Sea Harriers until the local airfield was prepared for jet aircraft. {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} was the first to take guard duty, whilst {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} went north to change a gearbox that had broken while departing the mainland UK, the Argentines claimed the aircraft carrier was hit on 30 May, and needed repairs. ''Invincible'' then returned to relieve ''Hermes'' which urgently needed to return to the UK to have its boilers cleaned. ''Invincible'' returned until the ship was relieved by {{HMS|Illustrious|R06|6}}, which was quickly rushed south and commissioned during the journey. Once the Port Stanley runway was available for jets, ''Illustrious'' was relieved by several RAF [[F-4 Phantom]]s.\n\nThe islands lacked barracks for a permanent garrison, so the Ministry of defence chartered two former car ferries as [[barracks ship]]s: {{ship|TEV|Rangatira|1971|2}} from the [[Union Company]] of New Zealand and {{MV|Saint Edmund||2}} from [[Sealink]] in Britain.<ref name=NZMaritime>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzmaritime.co.nz/r4.htm |last=Castell |first=Marcus |title=The Turbo Electric Vessel Rangatira of 1971 |publisher=The New Zealand Maritime Record |date=2003\u20132005 |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> ''Rangatira'' arrived in Port Stanley on 11 July 1982 and stayed until 26 September 1983.<ref name=NZMaritime/>\n\nThe British government later decided to construct a new RAF base as the centrepiece of plans to considerably strengthen the island's defences. This was intended to deter any future Argentine attempts to take the islands by force again. It was a massive undertaking, requiring the construction of the world's longest corridor, a half-mile long, linking barracks, messes and recreational and the welfare areas of the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/|title=News|date=15 March 2016|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> The base is occasionally referred to by its residents as the [[Death Star]] because of its vast size, and sometimes confusing layout.\n\n[[File:Mount-Pleasant.JPG|thumb|RAF Mount Pleasant]]\n[[RAF Mount Pleasant|Mount Pleasant]], to the west of Stanley, was chosen as the site for the new base.

Executive power is exercised on behalf of [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] by an appointed Governor, who primarily acts on the advice of the [[Executive Council of the Falkland Islands|Executive Council]]. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]]. The [[Independence of the judiciary|judiciary is independent]] of the executive and the legislature. The [[Military of the Falkland Islands|military defence]] and [[foreign policy]] of the islands is the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]]. Politics in the [[Falkland Islands]] is minimal as no political parties exist on the islands, and the governmental and legal proceedings very closely resemble British standards.\n\nFollowing the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]] published a report on the [[economy of the Falkland Islands]] which recommended many modernisations. On 1 January 1983 the [[Falkland Islanders]] gained [[British citizenship]] under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], and on 3 October 1985 the [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands]] was established. A new constitution came into force on 1 January 2009 which modernised the Chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual, embedding [[self-determination]] in the main body of the constitution. The new constitution also replaced the Legislative Council with the Legislative Assembly, and better explained the role of the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Governor]] and the [[Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands|Chief Executive]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New Falklands constitution agreed |first= |last= |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date= 2008-11-06 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7713948.stm |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Sovereignty issues==\n{{see also|Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute}}\nThe [[Argentina|Argentine Republic]] claims the Falkland Islands (known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as ''Islas Malvinas'') to be part of its territory. This claim is disputed by the [[Falkland Islanders]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1982 the islands were [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded]] and [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|occupied]] by the [[Argentine military junta]], starting the [[Falklands War]]. The islands were subsequently [[Argentine surrender in the Falklands War|liberated by British forces]] just 74 days after the start of the war, which led to the collapse of the military dictatorship in Argentina.\n\nThe sovereignty of the Falklands remains in dispute, with Argentina claiming the islands are an [[Territorial integrity|integral and indivisible part of its territory]], 'illegally occupied by an occupying power'.<ref>{{cite news |title=Malvinas and the Bicentennial: the Rule of Law Shadowed by the Logics of Power |first= |last= |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |date=  26 April 2010 |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/04/26/malvinas-and-the-bicentennial-the-rule-of-law-shadowed-by-the-logics-of-power|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> The United Kingdom and the [[Government of the Falkland Islands]] maintains that the [[Falkland Islanders|Islanders]] have the [[Self-determination|right to determine the sovereignty]] of their birthplace.<ref>{{cite news |title=Falklands diplomatic offensive puts UK on back foot |first= |last= |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date= 24 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8534901.stm |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> In a [[Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum, 2013|referendum in 2013]] the people of the Falkland Islands soundly rejected Argentina's claim to the islands, with 99.8% of voters supporting the Falklands remaining an [[British Overseas Territory|Overseas Territory]] of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=6491&source=3 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225071801/http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=6491&source=3 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=25 December 2013 | title=Falklands Vote 98.8% Yes | work=Falkland Islands News Network | date=12 March 2013 | accessdate=17 April 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Executive==\n[[File:Falkland Islands Office Westminster.jpg|thumb|right|Falkland House, the representative office for the Falkland Islands Government in [[Westminster]], [[London]]]]\n{{see also|Governor of the Falkland Islands|Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands|Executive Council of the Falkland Islands}}\n[[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] on the Falkland Islands is vested in [[Elizabeth II]], who has been the [[head of state]] since her accession to the British throne on 6 February 1952. As the Queen is absent from the islands for most of the time, executive authority is exercised \"in Her Majesty's name and on Her Majesty's behalf\" by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]].

The constitution does permit the Governor to act without the consulting the Executive Council and even go against its instructions, but in both cases the Governor must immediately inform the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] in the United Kingdom, who can overrule the Governor's actions.\n\nGovernment policy and the execution thereof is primarily decided by the [[Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands]] who is the head of the public service, responsible for the efficient and effective management of the executive, acting as the islands' [[head of government]]. The Chief Executive is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council. [[Barry Rowland]] has been Chief Executive since October 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2016/10/13/falklands-new-chief-executive-has-30-years-experience-in-england-s-public-sector |title=Falklands' new Chief Executive has 30 years experience in England's public sector |date=13 October 2016 |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |publisher= |accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Legislature==\n{{see also|Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands}}\nThe [[legislature|legislative]] branch consists of a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]]. [[General election]]s must take place at least once every four years, in which the islanders elect eight members to the Legislative Assembly (five from [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] and three from [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]]) through [[universal suffrage]] using [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]. There are also two [[ex officio member]]s of the Assembly (the [[Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands|Chief Executive]] and the [[Director of Finance of the Falkland Islands|Director of Finance]]) who take part in proceedings but are not permitted to vote in the Assembly.\n\nThe following major conventions apply to the Falkland Islands and should be taken into account during the drafting of legislation:<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/south-america/falkland-islands/?profile=politics\n |title       = Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory\n |work        = Travel & living abroad: South America and South Atlantic Islands\n |publisher   = [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]\n |date        = 7 March 2012\n |accessdate  = 28 June 2012\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121212135632/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/south-america/falkland-islands/?profile=politics\n |archivedate = 12 December 2012\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n*[[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR)\n*[[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR)\n*[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR)\n*[[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] (UNCAT)\n*[[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (UNCRC)\n*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|UN Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD)\n*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW).\n\nUntil 2009, when the new constitution came into force and created the Legislative Assembly, the legislature of the islands was the Legislative Council, which had existed since the 19th century.\n\n==Judiciary==\nThe [[judiciary|judicial]] branch consists of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the Summary Court and the Magistrates' Court. The judiciary is strictly independent of the executive and legislature, although it has links with the other branches of the government through the [[#Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy|Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy]]. The government also employs six lawyers (the Attorney General, Law Commissilner, two Crown Counsels and two Legislative Drafters), a Policy Adviser and one Policy Officer.\n\n===Courts===\nThe court system of the Falklands is set out by [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands#Chapter VIII: The Administration of Justice|Chapter VIII of the Constitution]] and closely resembles the [[Courts of England and Wales|system in England and Wales]]. The Supreme Court of the Falkland Islands has unlimited jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil or criminal proceedings, and consists of the [[Chief Justice]] (CJ) who is generally a senior barrister or solicitor with a good amount of judicial experience in the United Kingdom. The CJ is not resident in the Falkland Islands but travels to the islands if and when necessary to hear cases. The most serious criminal and civil matters are reserved for the Supreme Court. In civil matters, generally there is no jury however, in criminal matters, the defendant can elect trial by judge and jury or judge alone. There are only a few criminal cases which must be heard before the Supreme Court; these are murder, manslaughter, rape, piracy, treason and arson with the intent to endanger life. The CJ also hears appeals from the Magistrates' Court.\n\nFrom the Supreme Court, appeals are sent to the Falkland Islands Court of Appeal, which is based on the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]]. The Court of Appeal consists of a President and two Justices of Appeal, as well as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who serves as an [[ex officio member]]. The President and Justices of Appeal are normally from the UK and are Judges of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]]. Appeals from the Court of Appeal are sent to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].\n\nThe Falkland Islands does not have its own [[bar (law)|bar]] or [[law society]], but has a \"Falkland Islands Legal Community\". There is no differentiation between being a [[barrister]] or a [[solicitor]]; the private practitioners being called legal practitioners. The Legal Practitioners Ordinance defines who can hold themselves out as being a legal practitioner and therefore have rights of audience before the Falkland Islands courts.  Only the Chief Justice of the Falkland Islands can prohibit a legal practitioner from practising.\n\nIn the court system on the islands, there is a panel of [[Justices of the Peace]] (JPs) who sit in the [[Summary Court of the Falkland Islands|Summary Court]], which has no [[jury]]. JPs are all non-lawyers and are made up of \"upstanding members of the community\". They hear the most simple of criminal cases (or sit when the Senior Magistrate is not in the Islands) and they also act as the Licensing Justices who deal with alcohol-related applications, such as extended opening hours, special occasion licences, etc.\n\nThe Senior Magistrate (SM) is appointed by the Governor and presides over the Magistrates' Court, which again has no [[jury]]. The SM is usually a UK qualified lawyer, with at least 10 years experience as an [[advocate]] and, usually, with some judicial experience.  The SM holds office for a maximum of three years and is then replaced. The SM is resident in the Islands and hears the majority of cases from simple criminal and civil matters right up to very serious criminal matters or complex civil cases.  The SM also hears appeals from the Summary Court.\n\n===Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy===\nThe Governor has the power to grant a [[pardon]] to any person concerned in or convicted of an offence, but the Governor can only use this power after consultation with the Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy. The Committee consist of two elected members of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falklands|Legislative Assembly]] (appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Legislative Assembly), the Chief Executive, the Attorney General and the Chief Medical Officer.\n\n===Attorney General===\nThe [[Attorney General]] (AG), appointed by the Governor, is the main legal adviser to the Falkland Islands Government. The AG's primary role is to determine the legality of government proceedings and action, and has the power to institute and undertake criminal proceedings before any court of law, to take over and continue any criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by another person or authority and to discontinue at any stage before judgment any criminal proceedings instituted or undertaken another person or authority. In the exercise of his or her powers, the AG is not subject to the direction or control of any other person or authority.\n\nThe Attorney General is also a member of the [[Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy]] and acts as [[Chairman|presiding officer]] during Speaker elections in the Legislative Assembly, and has a constitutional right to attend all meetings of the Assembly and all meetings of the Executive Council.\n\nThe current Attorney General is Simon Young, who took office in December 2017.\n\n==Finances==\n{{see also|Economy of the Falkland Islands}}\nThe Director of Finance of the Falkland Islands is responsible for government expenditure on the islands, acting with authorisation from the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]]. The Director is also an [[ex officio member]] of both the Legislative Assembly and the [[Executive Council of the Falkland Islands|Executive Council]].\n\nThere is also a Public Accounts Committee consisting of a chairman and two other members appointed by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Governor]] (in consultation with the elected MLAs) and two elected members of the Legislative Assembly. Reporting to the Legislative Assembly, the Committee overseas the economy, government expenditure, all public accounts and audit reports on the islands. The Director of Finance is not permitted to be a member of the Public Accounts Committee.\n\n==Elections and parties==\n{{see also|Falkland Islands general election, 2017}}\n[[File:Falkland Islands constituency map.svg|thumb|Map of constituencies of the Falkland Islands]]\nAs in many [[parliamentary democracies]], there are no direct elections for the executive branch of the Falkland Islands Government. Instead the people elect the legislature which then advises and forms part of the executive. [[General election]]s, which elect the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]], must take place at least once every four years. [[Suffrage]] is universal in the Falklands, with the minimum voting age at eighteen. The Legislative Assembly has ten members, eight of which are elected using [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] (five from the [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley constituency]] and three from the [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp constituency]]) and two ''ex officio'' members (the [[Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands|Chief Executive]] and the [[Director of Finance of the Falkland Islands|Director of Finance]]).\n\nIn the [[Falkland Islands general election, 2017|last general election]], which took place on 9 November 2017, only non-partisans were elected as there are no active political parties in the Falkland Islands. The [[Next Falkland Islands general election|next elections]] is must take place on or before 21 January 2022.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Falkland Islands Gazette]]'' Official journal of the Falkland Islands Government.\n\n==References and sources==\n;References\n{{Reflist}}\n;Sources\n* L.L.

It then diversified and now has income from tourism, [[commercial fishing]], and servicing the fishing industry as well as agriculture. The islands use the [[Falkland pound]], which is backed by [[Pound sterling|sterling]].\n\n==Historical development==\n[[File:Port-William.JPG|left|thumb|240px|A squid trawler, and a cruise ship in [[Port William, Falkland Islands|Port William]] representing two trends in recent economic development]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the supply and maintenance depot for ships at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] developed into a port serving ships rounding [[Cape Horn]]. There was also trade in cow hides from the wild descendants of cattle introduced by French settlers in the late 18th century. Sheep farming was then introduced, taking over from the cattle trade in the 1870s and becoming self-supporting by 1885. The islands also provided a base for [[whaling]] and [[Seal hunting|sealing]], with factories being built on [[East Falkland]] and [[South Georgia Island]], but these industries ended.\n\nBy the [[Falklands War]] of 1982 sheep farming was the islands' only industry{{r|browne20020317}} and their economic viability was in doubt, but after the war there was a new commitment from the [[United Kingdom]] government. The [[Falkland Islands Development Corporation]] was formed in mid 1984 and in its annual report at the end of that year it set out to increase employment opportunities by encouraging diversification, to increase population levels through selective immigration, to aim for long-term self-sufficiency and to improve community facilities. To achieve this, the Corporation identified agricultural improvements, [[tourism]], self-sufficiency in energy, development of the industrial and service sector, fisheries, and land subdivision as areas to tackle.\n\nThe largest company in the islands used to be the [[Falkland Islands Company]] (FIC), a publicly quoted company on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. The company was responsible for the majority of the economic activity on the islands, though its farms were sold in 1991 to the [[Falkland Islands Government]]. The company now operates several retail outlets in Stanley and is involved in port services and shipping operations.\n\nBy 2002 the Falklands' economy was booming, with income from tourism and the sale of squid fishing licences as well as from indigenous fishing companies with locally registered boats. Fishing boats visit the islands from Spain, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, and obtain supplies and services from the islands.{{r|browne20020317}} An islander told the [[BBC]] that \"we were the luckiest people that was ever mixed up in a war\".<ref name=\"adams20020318\">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1879050.stm | title=The Falklands: 20 years on | work=BBC News | date=18 March 2002 | accessdate=10 August 2012 | author=Adams, Paul}}</ref> In 2007, Argentina withdrew<ref>{{Cite news|first=Sophie |last=Arie |title=Argentina snubs UK over oil deal as anniversary nears |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1547024/Argentina-snubs-UK-over-oil-deal-as-anniversary-nears.html|publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=20 October 2007 | location=London}}</ref> from a 1995 agreement<ref>{{Cite news\n|first=Calvin |last=Sims |title=Britain and Argentina Reach an Accord on Falkland Oil Rights\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/20/world/britain-and-argentina-reach-an-accord-on-falkland-oil-rights.html?pagewanted=1\n|publisher=The New York Times\n|date=20 September 1995\n|accessdate=10 May 2010\n|location=New York}}</ref> that set terms for exploitation of offshore resources.

Initially there were seven classes of licence, but as of the 2009 season, this was increased to ten classes of licence.  Each class of licence has its own characteristics \u2013 species or combination of species that may be taken, net sizes that may be used and seasons when the licence is valid. The main fishing areas are in waters that are up to {{convert|200|m}} deep with principal concentrations close to the confluence of the FOCZ, FICZ and EEZ to the north west of the Islands and also on the Burwood Bank \u2013 a shallow water to the south of the Islands.<ref name=FishReport/>\nInitially licences were issued on a total allowable effort (TAE) but in 2007, the toothfish longline fishery became the first fishery in the Falkland Islands to be issued on a total allowable catch (TAC) basis.<ref name=FishReport/>\nApart from the Islander\u2019s own fleet, the principal fishing fleets come from [[Spain]], [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]].  When the Falkland Islands first opened up her waters, the [[Poland|Polish]] fishing fleet had a presence as did the [[Japan]]ese, but the Poles stopped fishing in the area in the mid-1990s and the Japanese in the middle of the first decade of the twenty-first century.<ref name=FishReport/> By 2002 the license revenue was so great that the island government had no debt and had built up more than \u00a380 million in savings.{{r|browne20020317}}\n\nSince 1993, the principal licence classes have been:\n*A licence \u2014 Permits the taking of unrestricted fin fish during the first season\n*B licence \u2014 Permits the taking of ''Illex'' squid.\n*X licence \u2014 Permits the taking of Patagonian squid during the second season (''Loligo'').\n*Y licence \u2014 Permits the taking of unrestricted fin fish during the second season (The Southern blue whitting and the Hoki in particular are classed as restricted finship).\n\n'''Revenue from licence fees (\u00a3 millions)'''<ref name=FishReport/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!Licence type\n!1989\u20131993<br>(Average)\n!1994\u20131998<br>(Average)\n!1999\u20132003<br>(Average)\n!2004\u20132008<br>(Average)\n!2009\n!Average<br>1989\u20132009\n|-\n|B\n|19.91\n|12.45\n|13.60\n|4.09\n|0.00\n|11.92\n|-\n|X\n|3.77\n|3.58\n|3.67\n|1.70\n|1.94\n|3.12\n|-\n|Y\n|0.80\n|2.08\n|1.80\n|3.07\n|4.24\n|2.05\n|-\n|Others\n|1.70\n|3.67\n|4.87\n|4.65\n|4.67\n|3.76\n|-\n|Total\n|26.18\n|21.78\n|23.93\n|13.51\n|10.85\n|20.85\n|}\n\n===International cooperation===\nThe [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] was signed by both the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1959.

He saw an 'Island of Sheep' and a 'Paradise of Birds,' which some say could be the Faroes with its dense bird population and sheep. This does suggest however that other sailors had got there before him, to bring the sheep. [[Norsemen]] settled the Faroe Islands in the [[9th century]] or [[10th century]]. The islands were officially converted to Christianity around the year 1000, and became a part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. Norwegian rule on the islands continued until 1380, when the islands became part of the dual Denmark\u2013Norway kingdom, under king [[Olaf II of Denmark]]. \n\nFollowing the 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] that ended the dual [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] kingdom, the Faroe Islands remained under the administration of Denmark as a [[Amt (country subdivision)|county]]. During World War II, after Denmark was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]], the British [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands|invaded and occupied]] the Faroe Islands until shortly after the end of the war. Following an, unrecognized by Denmark, [[Faroese independence referendum, 1946|independence referendum]] in 1946, the Faroe Islands were given extended self-governance with the [[Danish Realm]] in 1948 with the signing of the ''Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands''.\n\n==Early Gaelic and Norse settlements==\n{{further|Norse settlement in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[Image:Faroe stamp 252 Europe and the Discoveries.jpg|right|thumb|Faroese stamp depicting [[Saint Brendan]] discovering the Faroe Islands]]\nArchaeological evidence has been found  of settlers living on the Faroe Islands in two successive periods prior to the arrival of the Norse, the first between 400\u2013600 AD and the second between 600\u2013800 AD.<ref>\"The Vikings were not the first colonizers of the Faroe Islands\", Church M.J., et al, published in Quaternary Science Reviews (2013), {{DOI|10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.06.011}}</ref> Scientists from [[Aberdeen University]] have also found early cereal pollen from domesticated plants, which further suggests people may have lived on the islands before the Vikings arrived.<ref>[http://www.sciencenordic.com/new-signs-pre-viking-life-faroe-islands New signs of pre-Viking life on the Faroe Islands], Science Nordic 28 January 2013</ref> Archaeologist Mike Church noted that [[Dicuil]] (see below) mentioned what may have been the Faroes.

Portions of the tale were inscribed in three other sagas: such as [[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]], [[\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta|Saga of \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason]], and AM 62 fol. Similar to other sagas, the historical credibility of the F\u00e6reyinga saga is highly questioned. \n\nBoth the Saga of \u00d3lafr Tryggvason and Flateyjarb\u00f3k claim that [[Gr\u00edmur Kamban]] was the first man to discover the Faroe Islands. The two sources disagree, however, on the year in which he left and the circumstances of his departure. Flateyjarb\u00f3k details the emigration of Gr\u00edmur Kamban as sometime during the reign of [[Harald H\u00e5rfagre]], between 872\u2013930 CE.<ref>Flateyjarb\u00f3k</ref> The Saga of \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason indicates that Kamban was residing in the Faroes long before the rule of Harald H\u00e5rfagre, and that other Norse were driven to the Faroe Islands due to his chaotic rule.<ref>The Saga of \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason</ref> This mass migration to the Faroe Islands shows a prior knowledge of the Viking settlements' locations, furthering the claim of Gr\u00edmur Kamban's settlement much earlier. While Kamban is recognized as the first Viking settler of the Faroe Islands, his surname is of [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] origin. Writings from the [[Papar]], an order of Irish monks, show that they left the Faroe Islands due to ongoing Viking raids.<ref>Schei, Liv Kj\u00f8rsvik & Moberg, Gunnie (2003) The Faroe Islands. Berlin.</ref>\n\n== Pre-14th century ==\n\n{{anchor|Name}}\nThe name of the islands is first recorded on the [[Hereford mappa mundi|Hereford ''mappa mundi'']] (1280), where they are labelled ''farei''.\nThe name has long been understood as based on Old Norse ''f\u00e1r'' \"livestock\", thus ''f\u00e6r-\u00f8er'' \"sheep islands\".\n\nThe main historical source for this period is the 13th-century work ''[[F\u00e6reyinga saga]]'' (''Saga of the Faroese''), though it is disputed as to how much of this work is historical fact.\n''F\u00e6reyinga saga'' only exists today as copies in other sagas, in particular the manuscripts called ''[[\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta|Saga of \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason]]'', ''[[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]]'' and one registered as AM 62 fol.\n\nAccording to Flateyjarb\u00f3k, [[Gr\u00edmr Kamban]] settled in Faroe when [[Harald I of Norway|Harald H\u00e5rfagre]] was king of Norway (872\u2013930). A slightly different account is found in the version of ''F\u00e6reyinga saga'' in \u00d3lafs Saga Tryggvasonar:\n\n{{quote|''Ma\u00f0ur er nefndur Gr\u00edmur kamban; hann bygg\u00f0i fyrstur manna F\u00e6reyjar.

But in the days of Harold Fairhair many men fled before the king's overbearing. Some settled in Faroe and began to dwell there, and others sought to other waste lands.''\n\nThe text suggests that Gr\u00edmr Kamban settled in the Faroes some time before the flight from [[Harald I of Norway|Harald H\u00e5rfagre]], perhaps even hundreds of years before. His first name, ''Gr\u00edmr'', is Norse, but his last, ''Kamban'', suggests a Gaelic origin (''Camb\u00e1n''). He may have been of mixed Norse and Irish origin and have come from a settlement in the [[British Isles]]: a so-called [[Norse-Gael]]. The Norse-Gaels had intermarried with speakers of [[Irish language|Irish]], a language also spoken at the time in Scotland (being the ancestor of [[Scottish Gaelic]]). Evidence of a mixed cultural background in later settlers may be found in the Norse-Irish ring pins found in the Faroe Islands,<ref>https://www.academia.edu/2531097/The_nature_of_the_Viking_Age_settlement_of_the_Faroe_Islands 'The nature of the Viking Age settlement of the Faroe Islands' by Jamie Barnes, pp. 9\u201310.</ref> and in features of Faroese vocabulary.

Indirect support for this theory has been found in genetic research showing that many Norse settler women in the Faroe Islands had Celtic forebears.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/3123925/The_Leirvik_bonhustoftin_and_the_Early_Christianity_of_the_Faroe_Islands_and_beyond \u2018The Leirv\u00edk \"B\u00f8nh\u00fastoftin\" and the early Christianity of the Faroe Islands, and beyond\u2019 by Steffen Stumman Hansen and John Sheehan, pp. 37\u201341</ref>\n\nIf there was settlement in the Faroes in the reign of Harald H\u00e5rfagre, it is possible that people already knew about the Faroes because of previous visitors or settlers.\n\nThe fact that immigrants from Norway also settled in the Faroe Islands is proven by a [[runestone]] (''see [[Sandav\u00e1gur stone]]'') found in the village of [[Sandav\u00e1gur]] on [[V\u00e1goy]] Island. It says: {{quote|''\u00deorkil Onundsson, austma\u00fer af Hrua-lande, bygg\u00fee \u00fee(n)a sta\u00fe fyrst''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abdn.ac.uk/skaldic/db.php?if=srdb&table=mss&id=21252|title=Samnordisk runtextdatabas|author=|date=|website=abdn.ac.uk}}</ref>}}  \n:''Thorkil Onundsson, eastman (Norwegian) from Rogaland, settled first in this place (Sandav\u00e1gur)''\n\nThis description \"eastman\" (from Norway) has to be seen together with the description \"westman\" (from Ireland/Scotland), which is to be found in local place-names such as \"[[Vestmanna]]-havn\" i.e. \"Irishmen's harbour\" in the Faroe Isles, and \"[[Vestmannaeyjar]]\" i.e. \"Irishmen's islands\" in [[Iceland]].\n[[Image:Faroe stamp 360 arrival of christianity.jpg|right|thumb|Faroese stamp depicting [[Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu]] raising [[Mj\u00f6lnir|the hammer of Thor]] against Christianity]]\nAccording to ''F\u00e6reyinga saga'' there was an ancient institution on the headland called [[Tinganes]] in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] on the island of [[Streymoy]]. This was an ''Al\u00feing'' or Althing (All-council.) This was the place where laws were made and disputes solved. All free men had the right to meet in the Al\u00feing. It was a parliament and law court for all, thus the name. Historians estimate the Al\u00feing to have been established from 800 to 900.<ref>http://www.logting.fo/files/File/Faldari%202012/faldari_EN_2012%20smal.pdf</ref>\n\nThe islands were officially converted to [[Christianity]] around the year 1000, with the [[Diocese of the Faroe Islands]] based at [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]], southern [[Streymoy]], of which there were 33 Catholic bishops.\n\nThe Faroes became a part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. Early in the 11th century Sigmund or [[Sigmundur Brestisson]], whose family had flourished in the southern islands but had been almost exterminated by invaders from the islands of the north, was sent from Norway, to where he had escaped, to take possession of the islands for [[Olaf Tryggvason]], king of Norway. He introduced Christianity, and, though he was subsequently murdered, Norwegian supremacy was upheld and continued.\n\nKing [[Sverre of Norway]] was brought up in the Faroes, being stepson of a Faroese man, and relative to Roe, bishop of the islands.\n\n== Foreign commercial interest: 14th century to Second World War ==\nThe 14th century saw the start of what would prove to be a long era of foreign encroachment on the Faroese economy. At this time trading regulations were set up so that all Faroese commerce had to pass through [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], Norway in order to collect customs tax. Meanwhile, the [[Hanseatic League]] was gaining in power, threatening Scandinavian commerce. Though Norway tried to halt this, it was forced to desist after the [[Black Death]] decimated its population.\n\nNorwegian supremacy continued until 1380, when the islands became part of the dual monarchy [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. The islands were still a possession of the Norwegian crown since the crowns had not been joined. In 1380 the Al\u00feting was renamed the [[L\u00f8gting]], though it was by now little more than a law court.\n\nIn 1390s, [[Henry Sinclair I, Earl of Orkney]], took possession of the islands (as vassal of Norway, however) and for some time they were part of the Sinclair principality in the North Atlantic.\n\nArchaeological excavations on the islands indicate sustained pig keeping up to and beyond the 13th century, a unique situation when compared to [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. The Faroese at Junkarinsfl\u00f8tti remained dependent upon bird resources, especially puffins, far longer and to a greater degree than with any of the other Viking Age settlers of the [[North Atlantic]] islands.\n\nEnglish adventurers gave great trouble to the inhabitants in the 16th century, and the name of [[Magnus Heinason]], a native of [[Streymoy]], who was sent by [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] to clear the seas, is still celebrated in many songs and stories.\n\nIn 1535 [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], the deposed monarch, tried to regain power from King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] who had just succeeded his father Frederick I. Several of the powerful German companies backed Christian II, but he eventually lost. The new King Christian III gave the German trader Thomas K\u00f6ppen exclusive trading rights in the [[Faroes]]. These rights were subject to the following conditions: only good quality goods were to be supplied by the Faroese and were to be made in numbers proportionate to the rest of the market; the goods were to be bought at their market value; and the traders were to deal fairly and honestly with the Faroese.\n\nChristian III also introduced [[Lutheranism]] to the Faroes, to replace [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. This process took five years to complete, in which time Danish was used instead of [[Latin]] and church property was transferred to the state. The bishopric at Kirkjub\u00f8ur, south of [[T\u00f3rshavn]], where remains of the cathedral may be seen, was also abolished.\n\nAfter K\u00f6ppen, others took over the trading monopoly, though the economy suffered as a result of the war between Denmark and Sweden. During this period of the monopoly most Faroese goods ([[wool]] products, fish, meat) were taken to the Netherlands, where they were sold at pre-determined prices. The guidelines of the trading agreement, however, were often ignored or corrupted. This caused delays and shortages in the supply of Faroese goods and a reduction in quality. With the trading monopoly nearing collapse smuggling and piracy were rife.\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, 1767, as seen by Yves de Kerguelen Tr\u00e9marec.PNG|thumb|left|280px|The Faroe Islands as seen by the French navigator [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec]] in 1767.]]\nDenmark tried to solve the problem by giving the Faroes to the courtier [[Christoffer Gabel]] (and later on his son, Frederick) as a personal feudal estate. However, the Gabel rule was harsh and repressive, breeding much resentment in the Faroese. This caused Denmark, in 1708, to entrust the islands and trading monopoly once more to the central government. However, they too struggled to keep the economy going, and many merchants were trading at a loss. Finally, on 1 January 1856 the trading monopoly was abolished.\n\nDenmark retained possession of the [[Faroes]] at the [[Peace of Kiel]] in 1814, but lost continental Norway.\n\nIn 1816 the [[L\u00f8gting]] (the Faroese parliament) was officially abolished and replaced by a Danish judiciary. Danish was introduced as the main language, whilst [[Faroese language|Faroese]] was discouraged. In 1849 a new constitution came into use in Denmark and was promulgated in the Faroes in 1850, giving the Faroese two seats in the [[Rigsdag]] (Danish parliament). The Faroese, however, managed in 1852 to re-establish the [[L\u00f8gting]] as a county council with an advisory role, with many people hoping for eventual independence. The late 19th century saw increasing support for the home rule/independence movement, though not all were in favour. Meanwhile, the Faroese economy was growing with the introduction of large-scale fishing. The Faroese were allowed access to the large Danish waters in the North Atlantic. Living standards subsequently improved and there was a population increase. Faroese became a standardised written language in 1890, but it was not allowed to be used in the Faroese public schools until 1938,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snar.fo/uploads/tx_tcresources/Foroyskir_rithovundar.pdf|title=snar.fo, F\u00f8royskar b\u00f3kmentir, page 4 (in Faroese)|author=|date=|website=snar.fo}}</ref> and in the church (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) until 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folkakirkjan.fo/default.aspx?pageid=6235&sectionid=207|title=F\u00f8royska kirkjan|author=|date=|website=F\u00f3lkakirkjan}}</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n{{main|British occupation of the Faroe Islands}}\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]] Denmark was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[Great Britain|British]] subsequently made a pre-emptive (but friendly) invasion and occupation of the Faroes to prevent a German invasion. Given their strategic location in the [[North Atlantic]], the Faroes could have proved useful to Germany in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], possibly as a [[submarine]] base. Instead, the British forces built an airbase on [[V\u00e1gar]], which is still in use as [[V\u00e1gar Airport]]. Faroese fishing boats also provided a large amount of fish to the UK, which was crucial given [[food rationing]].<ref>James Miller, ''The North Atlantic Front: Orkney, Shetland, Faroe and Iceland at War'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThe [[L\u00f8gting]] gained legislative powers, with the Danish prefect [[Carl Aage Hilbert]] retaining executive power. The [[Flag of the Faroe Islands|Faroese flag]] was recognized by British authorities. There were some attempts to declare complete independence in this period, but the UK had given an undertaking not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Faroe Islands nor to act without the permission of a liberated Denmark. The experience of wartime self-government was crucial in paving the way for formal autonomy in 1948.\n\nThe British presence was broadly popular (particularly given the alternative of a German occupation). Approximately 150 marriages took place between British soldiers and Faroese women, although the scale of the British presence on [[V\u00e1gar]] did lead to some local tensions. The British presence also left a lasting popularity for British chocolate and sweets, which is readily available in Faroese shops but uncommon in Denmark.\n\n== Post-World War II: Home Rule ==\nFollowing the liberation of Denmark and the end of World War II, the last British troops left in September 1945. Until 1948 the Faroes had the official status of a Danish [[Amt (subnational entity)|amt]] (county). A referendum on full independence was held in 1946, which produced a majority in favour. This was, however, not recognised by the Danish Government or king due to only 2/3 of the population participating in the referendum, so the Danish king abolished the government of the Faroes. The subsequent elections [[L\u00f8gting]] were won by an anti-independence majority and instead a high degree of self-governance was attained in 1948 with the passing of the Act of Faroese Home Rule. Faroese was now an official language, though Danish is still taught as a second language in schools. The Faroese [[Merki\u00f0|flag]] was also officially recognised by Danish authorities.\n\nIn 1973 Denmark joined the [[European Community]] (now European Union). The Faroes refused to join, mainly over the issue of fishing limits.\n\nThe 1980s saw an increase in support for Faroese independence. Unemployment was very low, and the Faroese were enjoying one of the world's highest standards of living, but the Faroese economy was almost entirely reliant on fishing. The early 1990s saw a dramatic slump in fish stocks, which were being overfished with new high-tech equipment. During the same period the government was also engaged in massive overspending. National debt was now at 9.4 billion Danish krones ([[Danish krone|DKK]]). Finally, in October 1992, the Faroese national bank (Sj\u00f3vinnurbankin) called in receivers and was forced to ask Denmark for a huge financial bailout. The initial sum was 500 million DKK, though this eventually grew to 1.8 billion DKK (this was in addition to the annual grant of 1 billion DKK). Austerity measures were introduced: public spending was cut, there was a [[tax]] and [[VAT]] increase and public employees were given a 10% wage-cut. Much of the fishing industry was put into receivership, with talk of cutting down the number of fish-farms and ships.\n\nIt was during this period that many Faroese (6%) decided to emigrate, mainly to Denmark. Unemployment rose, up to as much as 20% in [[T\u00f3rshavn]], with it being higher in the outlying islands.\nIn 1993 the Sj\u00f3vinnurbankin merged with the Faroes Islands' second largest bank, F\u00f8roya Banki. A third was declared bankrupt. Meanwhile, there was a growing international boycott of Faroese produce because of the [[grindadr\u00e1p]] (whaling) issue. The independence movement dissolved on the one hand while Denmark found itself left with the Faroe Islands' unpaid bills on the other.\n\nRecuperative measures were put in place and largely worked. Unemployment peaked in January 1994 at 26%, since which it fell (10% in mid-1996, 5% in April 2000). The fishing industry survived largely intact. Fish stocks also rose, with the annual catch being 100,000 in 1994, rising to 150,000 in 1995. In 1998 it was 375,000. Emigration also fell to 1% in 1995, and there was a small population increase in 1996. In addition, oil was discovered nearby. By the early 21st century weaknesses in the Faroese economy had been eliminated and, accordingly, many minds turned once again to the possibility of independence from Denmark. However, a  planned referendum in 2001 on first steps towards independence was called off following Danish Prime Minister [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]] saying that Danish money grants would be phased out within four years if there were a 'yes' vote.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timeline of Faroese history]]\n* [[Faroese language conflict]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Church, MJ, Arge, SV, Brewington, S, McGovern, TH, Woollett, JM, Perdikaris, S, Lawson, IT, Cook, GT, Amundsen, C.

There are 1,117 kilometres of coastline, and no land boundaries with any other country.\n\nThe Faroe Islands generally have cool summers and mild winters, with a usually overcast sky and frequent fog and strong winds. Although at a high latitude, due to the [[Gulf Stream]] their climate is ameliorated. The islands are rugged and rocky with some low peaks; the coasts are mostly bordered by cliffs. The Faroe Islands are notable for having the highest sea cliffs in Europe, and some of the highest in the world otherwise. The lowest point is at sea level, and the highest is at [[Sl\u00e6ttaratindur]], which is 882 metres above sea level.

The airport, at which data is recorded, is also located at a higher altitude on the island (84 meters above sea level<ref name=DMI />), which might result in lower temperatures and higher precipitation than lower-lying areas on the island.

By birthplace one can derive the following origins of the inhabitants: born on the Faroes 91.7%, in [[Denmark]] 5.8%, and in [[Greenland]] 0.3%. The largest group of foreigners are [[Icelanders]] comprising 0.4% of the population, followed by [[Norwegians]] and [[Polish people|Poles]], each comprising 0.2%. Altogether, on the Faroe Islands there are people from 77 different nationalities. The Faroe Islands have the highest rate of adoption in the world, despite a relatively high fertility rate of 2.6 children.

It is not possible to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language. \n\nThe 2011 census, called Manntal, shows that 10% were not born in the Faroe Islands, but of these only 3% were born outside the Kingdom of Denmark. 6.5% of people older than 15 did not speak Faroese as their mother tongue. 33 persons said that they did not understand Faroese at all.<ref>[http://www.sandportal.fo/latest-news/5-200-utlendingar-bugva-i-foroyum/ Sandportal.fo]</ref> According to the 2011 census, 45 361 Faroese people (people living in the Faroes) spoke Faroese as their first language and 1546 spoke Danish as their first language.\n\nThe Faroese language is one of the smallest of the [[Germanic languages]]. It is most similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. In the twentieth century Faroese became the official language and since the Faroes are a part of the Danish realm [[Danish language|Danish]] is taught in schools as a compulsory second language.\n\nFaroese language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in Faroese suitable for modern life.\n\n==Vital statistics since 1900

[[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[L\u00f8gting]].

However, if he or she fails, the Chairman of the parliament asks all chairmen of the parties elected to the parliament, and asks them to point to another chairman who they feel can rightly form a new coalition. The chairman with the most votes is then handed the initiative. After forming the coalition, the [[l\u00f8gma\u00f0ur]] leads the [[landsst\u00fdri]]. The landsst\u00fdri will often consist of around 7 members. The coalition parties divide the various ministries among themselves and after this, the parties elect their representative to these ministries. Any other member of the cabinet is called a ''[[landsst\u00fdrisma\u00f0ur]]'' if the person is a man, or ''landsst\u00fdriskvinna'' if the person is a woman. The word ''r\u00e1\u00f0harri'' is also used for a member of the cabinet, i.e. ''mentam\u00e1lar\u00e1\u00f0harri'' (minister of culture) or ''heilsum\u00e1lar\u00e1\u00f0harri'' (minister of health).\n\n=== Current government ===\n\nFollowing the [[Faroese general election, 2015]], a new government, consisting of three parties ([[Javna\u00f0arflokkurin|Social Democratic Party]], [[Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi|Republic]], and [[Progress (Faroe Islands)|Progress]]) under Prime Minister [[Aksel V.

As of the 1970s, the majority of the population centres of the Faroe Islands have been joined to a single road network, connected by bridges and tunnels.\n\nInternational transport, both for passengers and freight, remains difficult due to high costs, long distances, and bad weather, especially during the winter. Exporting domestically produced goods is thus expensive; this limits the development of a commodity-based economy.\n\n== History ==\nThe general history of the Faroese transportation system can be divided into four periods:\n\n===Before 1900===\nDuring this first period, transportation was rather primitive; it consisted of row boats, walking, and, in certain places, horse transport (for the upper class).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===1900 to the end of World War II===\nThe second period commenced in the late-19th century, when ferry connections began to emerge. The ferries were largely private initiatives, but they increasingly came to be operated by the public sector. This was supplemented by an emerging culture of automobiles. After [[World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], a large part of the Faroe Islands was accessible via ferries and automobiles; private buses and taxis operated as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===The end of World War II to the 1970s===\nThe third period was characterized by modernization. The introduction of the car ferry made it possible to drive between the various city centres of the country. It became possible to drive from the capital [[T\u00f3rshavn]] to [[V\u00e1gur]] and [[Tv\u00f8royri]] in the south, to [[Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur]] and [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in the north, and to the airport at [[S\u00f8rv\u00e1gur]] in the west. [[V\u00e1gar Airport]] was built by the [[The British occupation of the Faroe Islands 1940-1945|British during World War&nbsp;II]]; it was reopened as a civilian international airport in&nbsp;1963. Additionally, the road network was further developed. Tunnels to distant valleys and [[firth]]s such as [[Hvalba]], [[Sandv\u00edk]], and [[Nor\u00f0depil]] were constructed in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===1970s onwards===\n[[Image:Nor\u00f0oyatunnilin Leirv\u00edk - Klaksv\u00edk.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the [[Nor\u00f0oyatunnilin]] at [[Leirv\u00edk]] on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe fourth period saw the emergence of a \"mainland\" thanks to tunnels and bridges. In&nbsp;1973 the first bridge between two islands was established between [[Nor\u00f0sk\u00e1li]] on [[Eysturoy]] and [[Nesv\u00edk]] on [[Streymoy]]; in&nbsp;1976 the new tunnel between Nor\u00f0sk\u00e1li and Eysturoy was completed. The Faroes' two largest islands were connected into what is now referred to as \"Meginlandi\u00f0\", the Mainland. In&nbsp;1975 the [[causeway]] between [[Vi\u00f0oy]] and [[Bor\u00f0oy]] was constructed, in&nbsp;1986 a similar one between Bor\u00f0oy and [[Kunoy]] was established, and in&nbsp;1992 the capital T\u00f3rshavn was granted a first-class connection to the northern parts of the islands, creating the infrastructural prerequisites for a mobile society on the mainland.\n\nThe newest developments of the Faroese transportation network are the [[Tunnels of the Faroes|sub-sea tunnels]]. In&nbsp;2002 the tunnel between Streymoy and [[V\u00e1gar]]\u2014the latter is the airport island\u2014was finished, and in&nbsp;2006 the [[Nor\u00f0oyatunnilin]] between Eysturoy and Bor\u00f0oy was finished.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/underwater-tunnels-revolutionize-the-faroes#gs.nuZbfLM|title=Underwater Tunnels Revolutionize the Faroes|work=The Maritime Executive|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref> A toll, payable at petrol stations, of 170&nbsp;DKK (130&nbsp;DKK in June 2013) is charged to drive through these two tunnels; the others are free.

The combined cost of the project is estimated at almost 2 billion DKK, and will be the most expensive construction project in Faroese history. Eysturoyartunnilin is intended to have a [[roundabout]] under the sea, and possibly an airport [[Artificial island|made from tunnel excavation]].<ref>[http://joannes.dk/joas_ark/da/works/airport-19/ Airport 19]</ref> The three tubes will be 7,1&nbsp;km, 2,1&nbsp;km and 1,8&nbsp;km long joined together by the roundabout.

The tunnel would be around 20\u201325&nbsp;km long. If completed this would mean that 99% of the Faroes would be connected by road.\n\n== Railways == <!-- This section is linked from [[Rail transport in the Faroe Islands]] -->\n\nThere are no passenger railways on the Faroe Islands due to the difficult landscape, small population, and relatively short distances.\n\nTwo railways have operated on the islands. A tunnel and rail system supplied a NATO radar installation, now decommissioned, which previously existed on a mountaintop in the southern part of Streymoy Island. The [[Gj\u00f3gv#Gj\u00f3gv incline railway|Gj\u00f3gv incline railway]] operates a freight service between the harbour and the village of Gj\u00f3gv on Eysturoy island.\n\n== Roads ==\n[[Image:Inside Nor\u00f0oyatunnilin 1.jpg|thumb|right|\"Light Art\" inside the Nor\u00f0oyatunnilin]]\n{{see also|List of tunnels of the Faroe Islands}}\nRoads have become the main method of transportation on the islands.

Most buses are modern and were built by the [[Volvo]] company.\n\nThe network of blue Bygdalei\u00f0ir rural buses (as well as the ferries) is operated by Strandfaraskip Landsins on behalf of the Faroese government, which provides subsidies. The principal route is T\u00f3rshavn-[[Klaksv\u00edk]] (via the new [[Nor\u00f0oyatunnilin]] tunnel), but other bus routes also serve most villages. Although individual buses are generally owned by individuals or small companies, the timetables, fares, and levels of service are set by [[Strandfaraskip Landsins]] and the government.\n\nBusslei\u00f0in is the name of the urban bus services, active in and around T\u00f3rshavn in red colours and in and around Klaksv\u00edk in yellow. T\u00f3rshavn's Busslei\u00f0in has five routes and is operated by the T\u00f3rshavn municipality. Buses within T\u00f3rshavn have been completely free of charge since&nbsp;2007. This is a green initiative intended to persuade people to use public transportation rather than drive their cars. Like Bygdalei\u00f0ir, the actual buses are privately owned, but contracted to Busslei\u00f0in.

Another ferry, Teistin, a roll-on-off ferry maintains the link between the island [[Sandoy]] and the main area, the ferry port on Streymoy is near [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]] and [[Velbasta\u00f0ur]] on the South-West coast of Streymoy. A sub-sea tunnel is planned between Sandoy and Streymoy, it will open in 2021 according to the plan. After that there will not be need of a ferry between the two islands.\n\nSince the early 1980s, [[Smyril Line (international ferry service)|Smyril Line]] has operated a regular international passenger, car and freight service using a large, modern, multipurpose ferry, the Norr\u00f6na.

Trade between Fiji and neighbouring archipelagos long before European contact is testified by the [[canoe]]s made from native Fijian trees found in Tonga and Tongan words being part of the language of the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] group of islands. Pots made in Fiji have been found in Samoa and even the [[Marquesas Islands]].\n\nIn the 10th century, the [[Tu'i Tonga Empire]] was established in [[Tonga]], and Fiji came within its sphere of influence. The Tongan influence brought [[Polynesia]]n customs and language into Fiji. The empire began to decline in the 13th century.\n\nAcross {{convert|1000|km}} from east to west, Fiji has been a nation of many languages. Fiji's history was one of settlement but also of mobility and over the centuries, a unique Fijian culture developed. Large elegant watercraft with rigged sails called ''[[drua]]'' were constructed in Fiji, some being exported to Tonga. Distinctive village architecture evolved consisting of communal and individual [[Bure (Fiji)|''bure'']] and ''vale'' housing with an advanced system of rampants and moats usually being constructed around the more important settlements. Pigs were domesticated for food and a variety of agricultural plantations such as bananas existed from an early stage. Villages would also be supplied with water brought in by constructed wooden aqueducts. Fijians lived in societies that were led by chiefs, elders and notable warriors. Spiritual leaders, often called ''bete'', were also important cultural figures and the production and consumption of [[kava|''yaqona'']] was part of their ceremonial and community rites. Fijians developed a monetary system where the polished teeth of the [[sperm whale]], called ''tambua'', became an active currency. A type of writing also existed which can be seen today in various petroglyphs around the islands.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|publisher=Fiji Times|location=Suva}}</ref> They also produced a refined [[Tapa cloth|''masi'' cloth]] textile industry with the material being used to make sails and clothes such as the ''malo'' and the ''liku''. As with most other human civilisations, warfare was an important part of everyday life in pre-colonial Fiji and the Fijians were noted for their use of weapons such as decorative war-clubs and poisoned arrows.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Adolph|title=The hill tribes of Fiji|date=1922|publisher=Seeley|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/hilltribesoffiji00brew}}</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of Europeans and colonialism in the late 1700s, many elements of Fijian culture were either repressed or modified to ensure European, namely British, control. This was especially the case concerning traditional Fijian spiritual beliefs. Early colonists and missionaries utilised and conflated the concept of [[cannibalism]] in Fiji to give a moral imperative for colonial intrusion. By labelling native Fijian customs as \"debased and primitive\", they were able to promote a narrative that Fiji was a \"paradise wasted on savage cannibals\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Banivanua-Mar|first1=Tracey|title=Cannibalism and Colonialism: Charting colonies and frontiers in 19th century Fiji|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=2010|volume=52|issue=2|pages=255\u2013281|jstor=40603087}}</ref> Extravagant stories made during the 19th century, such as that regarding [[Ratu Udre Udre]] who is said to have consumed 872 people and to have made a pile of stones to record his achievement,<ref>Sanday, Peggy Reeves (1986) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SYW6EzB9rYkC&pg=PA166 Divine hunger: cannibalism as a cultural system]'', Cambridge University Press, p. 166, IBNS 0521311144.</ref> permitted an enduring racial typecast of the \"uncivilised\" Fijian.

In the Jones 2015 study, isotopic analysis of bone collagen provided evidence that human flesh had been consumed by Fijians, although it was likely a small and not necessarily regular part of the diet.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, these archaeological accounts indicate that cannibalistic practices were likely more varied and less ubiquitous than European settlers originally described. Exocannibalism, or cannibalism of members of outsider tribes, and cannibalism practiced as a means of violence or revenge probably play a significantly smaller role than European accounts suggested, with nonviolent and ritualistic practices being more likely.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Early interaction with Europeans ===\n[[File:Urville-Viti-Lebouka2.jpg|thumb|Levuka, 1842]]\n\n[[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Abel Tasman]] was the first known [[Europe]]an visitor to Fiji, sighting the northern island of [[Vanua Levu]] and the North [[Taveuni]] archipelago in 1643 while looking for the Great Southern Continent.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery;jsessionid=ch285bg7t494l?method=4&dsid=2222&dekey=Abel+Tasman&gwp=8&curtab=2222_1&sbid=lc05b&linktext=Abel%20Tasman Abel Janszoon Tasman Biography], ''www.answers.com''.</ref>\n\n[[James Cook]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] navigator, visited one of the southern [[Lau Islands|Lau]] islands in 1774.  It was not until 1789, however, that the islands were charted and plotted, when [[William Bligh]], the castaway captain of {{HMS|Bounty}}, passed [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]] and sailed between the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu en route to [[Jakarta|Batavia]], in what is now Indonesia.  [[Bligh Water]], the strait between the two main islands, is named after him, and for a time, the Fiji Islands were known as the ''Bligh Islands.''\n\nThe first Europeans to maintain substantial contact with the Fijians were [[sandalwood]] merchants, whalers and [[sea cucumber|\"beche-de-mer\"]] (sea cucumber) traders. Some of the Europeans who came to Fiji in this period were accepted by the locals and were allowed to stay as residents. Probably the most famous of these was a Swede by the name of Kalle Svenson, better known as [[Charles Savage (beachcomber)|Charlie Savage]]. Charlie was permitted to take wives and establish himself in a high rank in [[Bau (island)|Bau]] society in exchange for helping defeat local adversaries. In 1813, however, Charlie became a victim of this lifestyle and was killed in a botched raid.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|publisher=Fiji Times|location=Suva|pages=29\u201342}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1820s, [[Levuka]] was established as the first European-style town in Fiji, on the island of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]].  The market for \"beche-de-mer\" in China was lucrative and British and American merchants set up processing stations on various islands. Local Fijians were utilised to collect, prepare and pack the product which would then be shipped to Asia. A good cargo would result in a half-yearly profit of around $25,000 for the dealer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition.

Some Fijian chiefs soon felt confident enough with their new weapons to forcibly obtain more destructive weaponry from the Europeans. In 1834, men from Viwa and Bau were able to take control of the French ship ''L'amiable Josephine'' and use its cannon against their enemies on the [[Rewa River]], although they later ran it aground.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=47\u201350}}</ref>\n\nChristian missionaries like David Cargill also arrived in the 1830s from recently converted regions such as [[Tonga]] and [[Tahiti]], and by 1840 the European settlement at Levuka had grown to about 40 houses with former whaler, [[David Whippey]], being a notable resident. The religious conversion of the Fijians was a gradual process which was observed first-hand by Captain [[Charles Wilkes]] of the United States Exploring Expedition. Wilkes wrote that \"all the chiefs seemed to look upon Christianity as a change in which they had much to lose and little to gain\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition Vol. 3|date=1849|page=155|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gvAKAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> Christianised Fijians, in addition to forsaking their spiritual beliefs, were pressured into cutting their hair short, adopting the [[Sulu (skirt)|sulu]] form of dress from Tonga and fundamentally changing their marriage and funeral traditions.

He ordered an attack with rockets which acted as makeshift incendiary devices. The village, with the occupants trapped inside, quickly became an inferno with Wilkes himself noting that the \"shouts of men were intermingled with the cries and shrieks of the women and children\" as they burnt to death. Wilkes demanded the survivors should \"sue for mercy\" and if not \"they must expect to be exterminated\". Around 57 to 87 Maloloan people were killed in this encounter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition Vol 3|date=1849|page=278|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gvAKAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>\n\n=== Cakobau and the wars against Christian infiltration ===\n[[File:Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa.jpg|thumb|Ratu [[Tanoa Visawaqa]].]]\n[[File:Cakobau, died February 1883, photograph by Francis H. Dufty.jpg|thumb|Ratu [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], ''Tui Viti'']]\nThe 1840s was a time of conflict where various Fiji clans attempted to assert dominance over each other. Eventually, a warlord by the name of [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] of [[Bau Island (Fiji)|Bau Island]] was able to become a powerful influence in the region. His father was [[Ratu]] [[Tanoa Visawaqa]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau|Vunivalu]] (a chiefly title meaning ''Warlord,'' often translated also as ''Paramount Chief'') who had previously defeated the much larger [[Burebasaga]] confederacy and succeeded in subduing much of western Fiji. Cakobau, following on from his father, became so dominant that he was able to expel the Europeans from Levuka for five years over a dispute about their giving of weapons to his local enemies. In the early 1850s, Cakobau went one step further and decided to declare war on all Christians. His plans were thwarted after the missionaries in Fiji received support from the already converted Tongans and the presence of a British warship. The Tongan Prince [[Enele Ma'afu]], a Christian, had established himself on the Island of [[Lakeba]] in the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] archipelago in 1848, forcibly converting the local people to the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].  Cakobau and other chiefs in the west of Fiji regarded Ma'afu as a threat to their power and resisted his attempts to expand Tonga's dominion. Cakobau's influence, however, began to wane and his heavy imposition of taxes on other Fijian chiefs, who saw him at best as [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]], caused them to defect from him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=67\u201380}}</ref>\n\nAround this time the [[United States]] also became interested in asserting their power in the region and they threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul in the Fiji islands, [[John Brown Williams]].  In 1849, Williams had his trading store looted following an accidental fire, caused by stray cannon fire during a [[Fourth of July]] celebration, and in 1853 the European settlement of Levuka was burnt to the ground. Williams blamed Cakobau for both these incidents and the US representative wanted Cakobau's capital at Bau destroyed in retaliation. A naval blockade was instead set up around the island which put further pressure on Cakobau to give up on his warfare against the foreigners and their Christian allies. Finally, on April 30, 1854, Cakobau offered his ''soro'' (supplication) and yielded to these forces. He underwent the \"lotu\" and converted to Christianity. The traditional Fijian temples in Bau were destroyed and the sacred ''nokonoko'' trees were cut down. Cakobau and his remaining men were then compelled to join with the Tongans, backed by the Americans and British, to subjugate the remaining chiefs in the region who still refused to convert. These chiefs were soon defeated with Qaraniqio of the [[Rewa Province|Rewa]] being poisoned and Ratu Mara of Kaba being hanged in 1855. After these wars, most regions of Fiji, except for the interior highland areas, had been forced into giving up much of their traditional systems and were now vassals of Western interest. Cakobau was retained as a largely symbolic representative of the Fijian people and was allowed to take the ironic title of \"Tui Viti\" (\"King of Fiji\"), but the overarching control now lay with foreign powers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=76\u201397}}</ref>\n\n=== Cotton, confederacies and the Kai Colo ===\n[[File:Tui Namosi, Kai Colo.jpg|thumb|left|Kai Colo warrior]]\nThe rising price of cotton in the wake of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) saw a flood of hundreds of settlers come to Fiji in the 1860s from [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] in order to obtain land and grow cotton. Since there was still a lack functioning government in Fiji, these planters were often able to get the land in violent or fraudulent ways such as exchanging weapons or alcohol with Fijians who may or may not have been the true owners. Although this made for cheap land acquisition, competing land claims between the planters became problematic with no unified government to resolve the disputes. In 1865, the settlers proposed a confederacy of the seven main native kingdoms in Fiji to establish some sort of government. This was initially successful and Cakobau was elected as the first president of the confederacy.<ref>Gravelle, pg.102</ref>\n[[File:Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Fiji.svg|thumb|Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Fiji, 1865\u20131867]]\n\nWith the demand for land high, the white planters started to push into the hilly interior of [[Viti Levu]], the largest island in the archipelago. This put them into direct confrontation with the Kai Colo, which was a general term to describe the various Fijian clans resident to these inland districts. The Kai Colo were still living a mostly traditional lifestyle, they were not Christianised and they were not under the rule of Cakobau or the confederacy. In 1867, a travelling missionary named [[Thomas Baker (missionary)|Thomas Baker]] was killed by Kai Colo in the mountains at the headwaters of the [[Sigatoka River]]. The acting British consul, [[John Bates Thurston]], demanded that Cakobau lead a force of Fijians from coastal areas to suppress the Kai Colo. Cakobau eventually led a campaign into the mountains but suffered a humiliating loss with 61 of his fighters being killed.<ref>Gravelle, pp.102\u2013107</ref> Settlers also came into conflict with the local eastern Kai Colo people called the Wainimala. [[John Bates Thurston]] called in the [[Australia Station]] section of the [[Royal Navy]] for assistance. The Navy duly sent Commander [[Rowley Lambert]] and {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} to conduct a punitive mission against the Wainimala. An armed force of 87 men shelled and burnt the village of Deoka and a skirmish ensued which resulted in the deaths of over forty Wainimala.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166803071 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Sydney Mail]] |volume=IX, |issue=429 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 September 1868 |accessdate=9 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== Kingdom of Fiji (1871\u20131874) ===\n{{main|Kingdom of Fiji}}\n[[File:Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Fiji_(1871-1874).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of Fiji]], 1871\u20131874]]\nAfter the collapse of the confederacy, [[Enele Ma'afu|Ma'afu]] established a stable administration in the [[Lau Islands]] and the Tongans, therefore, were again becoming influential. Other foreign powers such as the United States were also considering the possibility of annexing Fiji. This situation was not appealing to many settlers, almost all of whom were British subjects from [[Australia]]. Britain, however, still refused to annex the country and subsequently a compromise was needed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63106962 |title=The Empire. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=5767 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=11 May 1870 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1871, [[George Austin Woods]], an ex-lieutenant of the Royal Navy, managed to influence [[Cakobau]] and organise a group of like-minded settlers and chiefs into forming a governing administration. Cakobau was declared the monarch (''Tui Viti'') and the Kingdom of Fiji was established. Most Fijian chiefs agreed to participate and even Ma'afu chose to recognise Cakobau and participate in the [[constitutional monarchy]]. However, many of the settlers had come from British colonies like [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]] where negotiation with the [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous people]] almost universally involved the barrel of a gun. As a result, several aggressive, racially motivated opposition groups, such as the British Subjects Mutual Protection Society, sprouted up. One group called themselves the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a homage to the [[white supremacist]] group in America.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article191569882 |title=No title |newspaper=[[The Ballarat Courier]] |issue=1538 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=22 May 1872 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> However, when respected individuals such as [[Charles St Julian]], Robert Sherson Swanston and John Bates Thurston were appointed by Cakobau, a degree of authority was established.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60446405 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=Illustrated Australian News For Home Readers |issue=187 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=16 July 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=154 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three kai colo, ca. 1873, carte de visite by Francis Herbert Dufty.jpg|thumb|left|Three Kai Colo men in traditional Fijian attire]]\nWith the rapid increase in white settlers into the country, the desire for land acquisition also intensified. Once again, conflict with the Kai Colo in the interior of [[Viti Levu]] ensued. In 1871, the killing of two settlers named Spiers and Mackintosh near the [[Ba River (Fiji)]] in the north-west of the island prompted a large [[punitive expedition]] of white farmers, imported slave labourers and coastal Fijians to be organised. This group of around 400 armed vigilantes, including veterans of the [[US Civil War]], had a battle with the Kai Colo near the village of Cubu in which both sides had to withdraw. The village was destroyed and the Kai Colo, despite being armed with muskets, received numerous casualties.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158947917 |title=FIJIAN EXPERIENCES. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |volume=XXVIII, |issue=1576 |location=South Australia |date=16 December 1871 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> The Kai Colo responded by making frequent raids on the settlements of the whites and Christian Fijians throughout the [[Ba (province)|district of Ba]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170155477 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Advocate]] |volume=IV, |issue=160 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=3 February 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Likewise, in the east of the island on the upper reaches of the [[Rewa River]], villages were burnt and a \"great many\" Kai Colo were shot by the vigilante settler squad called the Rewa Rifles.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170157875 |title=MASSACRE OF NATIVES BY SETTLERS IN FIJI. |newspaper=[[Advocate]] |volume=IV, |issue=196 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=12 October 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Cakobau government did not approve of the settlers taking justice into their own hands, it did want the Kai Colo subjugated and their land sold off. The solution was to form an army. Robert S. Swanston, the minister for Native Affairs in the Kingdom, organised the training and arming of suitable Fijian volunteers and prisoners to become soldiers in what was invariably called the King's Troops or the Native Regiment. In a similar system to the [[Native Police]] that was present in the colonies of [[Australia]], two white settlers, James Harding and W. Fitzgerald, were appointed as the head officers of this paramilitary brigade.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article194847556 |title=LETTER FROM FIJI. |newspaper=[[Hamilton Spectator]] |issue=1083 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=14 August 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The formation of this force did not sit well with many of the white plantation owners as they did not trust an army of Fijians to protect their interests.\n\nThe situation intensified further in early 1873 when the Burns family were killed by a Kai Colo raid in the Ba River area. The Cakobau government deployed 50 King's Troopers to the region under the command of Major Fitzgerald to restore order. The local whites, with their own large force under the leadership of Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland, refused their posting and a further deployment of another 50 troops under Captain Harding was sent to emphasise the government's authority. To prove the worth of the Native Regiment, this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about 170 Kai Colo people at Na Korowaiwai. Upon returning to the coast, the force were met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat. A skirmish between the government's troops and the white settlers' brigade was only prevented by the timely intervention of Captain William Cox Chapman of {{HMS|Dido|1869|6}} who promptly detained Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland, forcing the group to disband. The authority of the King's Troops and the Cakobau government to crush the Kai Colo was now total.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5851961 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=8 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=16 April 1873 |accessdate=12 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nFrom March to October 1873, a force of about 200 King's Troops under the general administration of R.S.

Thurston (the brother of [[John Bates Thurston]]) led a two pronged attack throughout the region. The combined forces of the different clans of the Kai Colo made a stand at the village of Na Culi. The Kai Colo were defeated with dynamite and fire being used to flush them out from their defensive positions amongst the mountain caves. Many Kai Colo were killed and one of the main leaders of the hill clans, Ratu Dradra, was forced to surrender with around 2000 men, women and children being taken prisoner and sent to the coast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63234385 |title=LATEST FROM FIJI. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=668 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=29 August 1873 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In the months after this defeat, the only main resistance was from the clans around the village of Nibutautau.

The [[American Civil War]] had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market when the Union blockaded southern ports. Cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business. Thousands of European planters flocked to Fiji to establish plantations but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans. They sought labour from the [[Melanesia]]n islands. On 5 July 1865 [[Ben Pease]] received the first licence to provide 40 labourers from the [[New Hebrides]] to Fiji.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janesoceania.com/oceania_blackbirding1/index.htm |title=The Story of Blackbirding in the South Seas \u2013 Part 2 |author=Jane Resture| publisher=Janesoceania.com |date= |accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Queensland]] governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour. Melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued with basic clothing and given access to the company store for supplies. Most Melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. The living and working conditions for them in Fiji were worse than those suffered by the later [[Demographics of India|Indian]] [[indenture]]d labourers. In 1875, the chief medical officer in Fiji, Sir [[William MacGregor]], listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1000 labourers. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the Fiji waters. The British sent warships to enforce the law (Pacific Islanders' Protection Act of 1872) but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.\n\n[[File:Seizure of blackbirder Daphne.jpg|thumb|left|Seizure of the blackbirder ''Daphne'']]\nA notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the [[brig]] ''Carl'', organised by Dr James Patrick Murray,<ref name=\"G.

Elmslie, 'The Colonial Career of James Patrick Murray', ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Surgery'', (1979) 49(1):154-62</ref> to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of Fiji.  Murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, so to appear to be church [[missionaries]].  When islanders were enticed to a religious service, Murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats.  During the voyage Murray shot about 60 islanders.  He was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">James A. Michener & A.

As the white settler backed Cakobau government, and later the British colonial government, subjugated areas in Fiji under its power, the resultant prisoners of war were regularly sold at auction to the planters. This not only provided a source of revenue for the government, but also dispersed the rebels to different, often isolated islands where the plantations were located. The land that was occupied by these people before they became slaves was then also sold off for additional revenue. An example of this is the Lovoni people of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau island]], who after being defeated in a war with the Cakobau government in 1871, were rounded up and sold off to the settlers at \u20a46 per head. Two thousand Lovoni men, women and children were sold and their period of slavery lasted five years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60865675 |title=A FIJIAN PLANTER'S CONFESSION. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6379 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 September 1872 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Likewise, after the Kai Colo wars in 1873, thousands of people from the hill tribes of [[Viti Levu]] were sent to [[Levuka]] and sold into slavery.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article198499905 |title=GENERAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[Leader]] |volume=XXVII, |issue=940 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=3 January 1874 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Warnings from the [[Royal Navy]] stationed in the area that buying these people was illegal were largely given without enforcement and the British consul in Fiji, Edward Bernard Marsh, regularly turned a blind eye to this type of labour trade.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60874042 |title=NINE MONTHS IN FIJI AND OTHER ISLANDS. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6014 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=13 July 1871 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== British colony ===\n==== Annexation by the British in 1874 ====\nDespite achieving military victories over the Kai Colo, the Cakobau government was faced with problems of legitimacy and economic viability. Indigenous Fijians and white settlers refused to pay taxes and the cotton price had collapsed. With these major issues in mind, [[John Bates Thurston]] approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands.  The newly elected [[Tory]] British government under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] encouraged expansion of the empire and was therefore much more sympathetic to annexing Fiji than it had been previously.\nThe murder of Bishop [[John Coleridge Patteson]] of the [[Melanesian Mission]] at [[Nukapu]] in the [[Reef Islands]] had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150 Fijians on board the brig ''Carl.''  Two British commissioners were sent to Fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation.  The question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between Cakobau and his old rival, [[Enele Ma'afu|Ma'afu]], with both men vacillating for many months. On 21 March 1874, Cakobau made a final offer, which the British accepted.  On 23 September, [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]], soon to be appointed the [[British Empire|British]] [[Governor of Fiji]], arrived on [[HMS Dido (1869)|HMS ''Dido'']] and received Cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. After some vacillation, Cakobau agreed to renounce his ''[[Tui Viti]]'' title, retaining the title of ''Vunivalu'', or Protector. The formal cession took place on 10 October 1874, when Cakobau, Ma'afu, and some of the senior Chiefs of Fiji signed two copies of the [[Deed of Cession (Fiji)|Deed of Cession]].  Thus the [[Colony of Fiji]] was founded; 96 years of British rule followed.\n\n==== Measles epidemic of 1875 ====\nTo celebrate the annexation of Fiji, Hercules Robinson, who was [[Governor of New South Wales]] at the time, took Cakobau and his two sons to [[Sydney]].

On returning to Fiji, the colonial administrators decided not to quarantine the ship that the convalescents travelled in. This was despite the British having a very extensive knowledge of the devastating effect of infectious disease on an unexposed population.

Gordon was immediately faced with an insurgency of the Qalimari and Kai Colo people. In early 1875, colonial administrator [[Edgar Leopold Layard]], had met with thousands of highland clans at Navuso in [[Viti Levu]] to formalise their subjugation to British rule and the Christian religion. Layard and his delegation managed to spread the [[measles]] epidemic to the highlanders, causing mass deaths in this population. As a result, anger at the British colonists flared throughout the region and a widespread uprising quickly took hold. Villages along the [[Sigatoka River]] and in the highlands above this area refused British control and Gordon was tasked with quashing this rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes written during the disturbances in the highlands of Viti Levu, 1876|date=1879|publisher=R&R Clark|location=Edinburgh|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes01stangoog}}</ref>\n\nIn what Gordon himself termed the \"Little War\", the suppression of this uprising took the form of two co-ordinated military campaigns in the western half of Viti Levu. The first was conducted by Gordon's second cousin, Arthur John Lewis Gordon, against the Qalimari insurgents along the Sigatoka River. The second campaign was led by [[Louis Knollys]] against the Kai Colo in the mountains to the north of the river. Governor Gordon invoked a type of martial law in the area where A.J.L. Gordon and Knollys had absolute power to conduct their missions outside of any restrictions of legislation. The two groups of rebels were kept isolated from each other by a force led by Walter Carew and [[George Le Hunte]] who were stationed at Nasaucoko. Carew also ensured the rebellion did not spread east by securing the loyalty of the Wainimala people of the eastern highlands. The war involved the use of the soldiers of the old Native Regiment of Cakobau supported by around 1500 Christian Fijian volunteers from other areas of Viti Levu. The colonial [[Government of New Zealand]] provided most of the advanced weapons for the army including one hundred [[Snider Rifle|Snider rifles]].\n\nThe campaign along the Sigatoka River was conducted under a [[scorched earth]] policy whereby numerous rebel villages were burnt and their fields ransacked. After the capture and destruction of the main fortified towns of Koroivatuma, Bukutia and Matanavatu, the Qalimari surrendered ''en masse''. Those who weren't killed in the fighting were taken prisoner and sent to the coastal town of Cuvu. This included 827 men, women and children as well as the leader of the insurgents, a man named Mudu. The women and children were distributed to places like [[Nadi]] and [[Nadroga-Navosa Province|Nadroga]]. Of the men, 15 were sentenced to death at a hastily conducted trial at [[Sigatoka]]. Governor Gordon was present, but chose to leave the judicial responsibility to his relative, A.J.L. Gordon. Four were hanged and ten, including Mudu, were shot with one prisoner managing to escape. By the end of proceedings the Governor noted that \"my feet were literally stained with the blood that I had shed\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes Vol. 1|date=1879|page=441|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes01stangoog}}</ref>\n\nThe northern campaign against the Kai Colo in the highlands was similar but involved removing the rebels from large, well protected caves in the region. Knollys managed to clear the caves \"after some considerable time and large expenditure of ammunition\". The occupants of these caves included whole communities and as a result many men, women and children were either killed or wounded in these operations. The rest were taken prisoner and sent to the towns on the northern coast. The chief medical officer in British Fiji, [[William MacGregor]], also took part both in killing Kai Colo and tending to their wounded. After the caves were taken, the Kai Colo surrendered and their leader, Bisiki, was captured. Various trials were held, mostly at Nasaucoko under Le Hunte, and 32 men were either hanged or shot including Bisiki, who was killed trying to escape.<ref name=\"Letters and Notes Vol. 2\">{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes Vol. 2|date=1879|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes00stangoog}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of October 1876, the \"Little War\" was over and Gordon had succeeded in vanquishing the rebels in the interior of Viti Levu. Those insurgents who weren't killed or executed were sent into exile with hard labour for up to 10 years. Some non-combatants were allowed to return to rebuild their villages, but many areas in the highlands were ordered by Gordon to remain depopulated and in ruins. Gordon also constructed a military fortress, Fort Canarvon, at the headwaters of the Sigatoka River where a large contingent of soldiers were based to maintain British control. He renamed the Native Regiment, the [[Armed Native Constabulary]] to lessen its appearance of being a military force.<ref name=\"Letters and Notes Vol. 2\"/>\n \nIn order to further consolidate social control throughout the colony, Governor Gordon introduced a system of appointed chiefs and village constables in the various districts to both enact his orders and report any disobedience from the populace. Gordon adopted the chiefly titles ''Roko'' and ''Buli'' to describe these deputies and established a [[Great Council of Chiefs]] which was directly subject to his authority as Supreme Chief.  This body remained in existence until being suspended by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government in 2007 and only abolished in 2012.\nGordon also extinguished the ability of Fijians to own, buy or sell land as individuals, the control being transferred to colonial authorities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=France|first1=Peter|title=The founding of an orthodoxy: Sir Arthur Gordon and the doctrine of the Fijian way of life|journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society|date=1968|volume=77|issue=1|pages=6\u201332|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_77_1968/Volume_77%2C_No._1/The_founding_of_an_orthodoxy%3A_Sir_Arthur_Gordon_and_the_doctrine_of_the_Fijian_way_of_life%2C_by_Peter_France%2C_p_6_-_32|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Indian indenture system in Fiji====\n{{main|Indian indenture system|Indian indenture ships to Fiji|Repatriation of indentured Indians from Fiji}}\nGordon decided in 1878 to import indentured labourers from [[India]] to work on the [[sugarcane]] fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations.  The 463 Indians arrived on 14 May 1879 \u2013 the first of some 61,000 that were to come before the scheme ended in 1916.  The plan involved bringing the Indian workers to Fiji on a five-year contract, after which they could return to India at their own expense; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term, they would be given the option of returning to India at the government's expense, or remaining in Fiji.  The great majority chose to stay.  The [[Queensland Act]], which regulated indentured labour in Queensland, was made law in Fiji also.\n\nBetween 1879 and 1916, tens of thousands of Indians moved to Fiji to work as [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]], especially on [[sugarcane]] [[plantation]]s. A total of 42 ships made 87 voyages, carrying Indian [[indenture]]d labourers to Fiji. Initially the ships brought labourers from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], but from 1903 all ships except two also brought labourers from [[Madras]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]]. A total of 60,965 passengers left India but only 60,553 (including births at sea) arrived in Fiji. A total of 45,439 boarded ships in Calcutta and 15,114 in Madras. [[Sailing ship]]s took, on average, seventy-three days for the trip while steamers took 30 days. The shipping companies associated with the labour trade were [[Nourse Line]] and [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]].\n\n[[Repatriation of indentured Indians from Fiji]] began on 3 May 1892, when the ''[[British Peer (ship)|British Peer]]'' brought 464 repatriated Indians to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. Various ships made similar journeys to Calcutta and [[Chennai|Madras]], concluding with ''Sirsa''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 1951 voyage. In 1955 and 1956, three ships brought Indian labourers from Fiji to Sydney, from where the labourers flew to [[Mumbai|Bombay]].\nIndentured Indians wishing to return to India were given two options. One was travel at their own expense and the other free of charge but subject to certain conditions. To obtain free passage back to India, labourers had to have been above age twelve upon arrival, completed at least five years of service and lived in Fiji for a total of ten consecutive years. A child born to these labourers in Fiji could accompany his or her parents or guardian back to India if he or she was under twelve.\nDue to the high cost of returning at their own expense, most indentured immigrants returning to India left Fiji around ten to twelve years after arrival. Indeed, just over twelve years passed between the voyage of the first ship carrying indentured Indians to Fiji (the ''[[Leonidas (ship)|Leonidas]]'', in 1879) and the first ship to take Indians back (the ''[[British Peer (ship)|British Peer]]'', in 1892).\nGiven the steady influx of ships carrying indentured Indians to Fiji up until 1916, repatriated Indians generally boarded these same ships on their return voyage. The total number of repatriates under the Fiji indenture system is recorded as 39,261, while the number of arrivals is said to have been 60,553. Because the return figure includes children born in Fiji, many of the indentured Indians never returned to India.\nDirect return voyages by ship ceased after 1951. Instead, arrangements were made for flights from Sydney to Bombay, the first of which departed in July 1955. Labourers still travelled to Sydney by ship.\n\n==== The Tuka rebellions ====\nWith almost all aspects of indigenous Fijian social life being controlled by British authorities, a number of charismatic individuals preaching dissent and return to pre-colonial culture were able to forge a following amongst the disenfranchised. These movements were called Tuka, which roughly translates as \"those who stand up\". The first Tuka movement, was led by Ndoongumoy, better known as Navosavakandua which means \"he who speaks only once\". He told his followers that if they returned to traditional ways and worshipped traditional deities such as Degei and Rokola, their current condition would be transformed with the whites and their puppet Fijian chiefs being subservient to them. Navosavakandua was previously exiled from the [[Viti Levu]] highlands in 1878 for disturbing the peace and the British quickly arrested him and his followers after this open display of rebellion. He was again exiled, this time to [[Rotuma]] where he died soon after his 10-year sentence ended.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Adolph|title=Hill tribes of Fiji|date=1922|page=236|url=https://archive.org/details/hilltribesoffiji00brew}}</ref>\n\nOther Tuka organisations, however, soon appeared. The British were ruthless in their suppression of both the leaders and followers with figureheads such as Sailose being banished to an asylum for 12 years. In 1891, entire populations of villages who were sympathetic to the Tuka ideology were deported as punishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Martha|title=Neither Cargo nor Cult|date=1995|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=100\u2013118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ey0ms3khaAC|isbn=978-0822315933}}</ref> Three years later in the highlands of [[Vanua Levu]], where locals had re-engaged in traditional religion, the [[Governor of Fiji]], [[John Bates Thurston]], ordered in the Armed Native Constabulary to destroy the towns and the religious relics.

The company was called the Viti Kabani and it was a hugely successful. The British and their proxy Council of Chiefs were not able to prevent the Viti Kabani's rise and again the colonists were forced to send in the Armed Native Constabulary. Apolosi and his followers were arrested in 1915 and the company collapsed in 1917. Over the next 30 years, Apolosi was re-arrested, jailed and exiled, with the British viewing him as a threat right up to his death in 1946.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=179\u2013183}}</ref>\n\n====Fiji in World War I and II====\nFiji was only peripherally involved in [[World War I]].  One memorable incident occurred in September 1917 when [[Count]] [[Felix von Luckner]] arrived at [[Wakaya Island]], off the eastern coast of Viti Levu, after his raider, {{SMS|Seeadler|1888|6}}, had [[Ship grounding|run aground]] in the [[Cook Islands]] following the shelling of [[Papeete]] in the French territory of [[Tahiti]].  On 21 September, the district police inspector took a number of Fijians to Wakaya, and von Luckner, not realizing that they were unarmed, unwittingly surrendered.\n\nCiting unwillingness to exploit the Fijian people, the [[British Empire|colonial authorities]] did not permit Fijians to enlist.  One Fijian of chiefly rank, a greatgrandson of Cakobau's, did join the [[French Foreign Legion]], however, and received [[France]]'s highest military decoration, the [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]].  After going on to complete a [[LLB|Law]] degree at [[Oxford University]], this same chief returned to Fiji in 1921 as both a war hero and the country's first-ever university graduate.  In the years that followed, [[Lala Sukuna|Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna]], as he was later known, established himself as the most powerful chief in Fiji and forged embryonic institutions for what would later become the modern Fijian nation.\n\n[[File:Flag of Fiji (1924-1970).svg|thumb|Flag of Fiji 1924\u20131970]]\nBy the time of [[World War II]], the United Kingdom had reversed its policy of not enlisting natives, and many thousands of Fijians volunteered for the [[Fiji Infantry Regiment]], which was under the command of [[Edward Cakobau|Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau]], another greatgrandson of Seru Epenisa Cakobau. The regiment was attached to New Zealand and Australian army units during the war.\n\nBecause of its central location, Fiji was selected as a training base for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  An airstrip was built at [[Nadi]] (later to become an international airport), and gun emplacements studded the coast.  Fijians gained a reputation for bravery in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], with one war correspondent describing their ambush tactics as \"death with velvet gloves\". Corporal [[Sefanaia Sukanaivalu]], of [[Yucata]], was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], as a result of his bravery in the [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Battle of Bougainville]].\n\n====Responsible government====\n[[File:Kamisese Mara.jpg|thumb|[[Kamisese Mara]]]]\nA constitutional conference was held in [[London]] in July 1965, to discuss constitutional changes with a view to introducing responsible government.  Indo-Fijians, led by [[A. D. Patel]], demanded the immediate introduction of full self-government, with a fully elected legislature, to be elected by universal suffrage on a common voters' roll.  These demands were vigorously rejected by the [[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] delegation, who still feared loss of control over natively owned land and resources should an Indo-Fijian dominated government come to power.  The British made it clear, however, that they were determined to bring Fiji to self-government and eventual independence.  Realizing that they had no choice, Fiji's chiefs decided to negotiate for the best deal they could get.\n\nA series of compromises led to the establishment of a cabinet system of government in 1967, with [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Kamisese Mara]] as the first [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]].  Ongoing negotiations between Mara and [[Sidiq Koya]], who had taken over the leadership of the mainly Indo-Fijian [[National Federation Party]] on Patel's death in 1969, led to a second constitutional conference in London, in April 1970, at which Fiji's Legislative Council agreed on a compromise electoral formula and a timetable for independence as a fully sovereign and independent nation with the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].  The Legislative Council would be replaced with a bicameral [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], with a [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]] dominated by Fijian chiefs and a popularly elected [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]].  In the 52-member House, Native Fijians and Indo-Fijians would each be allocated 22 seats, of which 12 would represent ''[[Communal constituencies]]'' comprising voters registered on strictly ethnic roles, and another 10 representing ''[[National constituencies]]'' to which members were allocated by ethnicity but elected by [[universal suffrage]].  A further 8 seats were reserved for \"[[General electors]]\" \u2013 [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Banaba Island|Banaban Islanders]], and other minorities; 3 of these were \"communal\" and 5 \"national\".  With this compromise, Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970.\n\n=== Independence (1970) ===\nThe British granted Fiji independence in 1970. Democratic rule was interrupted by two [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|military coups]] in 1987 precipitated by a growing perception that the government was dominated by the [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] (Indian) community. The second 1987 coup saw both the Fijian monarchy and the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor General]] replaced by a non-executive president and the name of the country changed from ''[[British Dominions|Dominion]] of Fiji'' to ''Republic of Fiji'' and then in 1997 to ''Republic of the Fiji Islands''. The two coups and the accompanying civil unrest contributed to heavy Indo-Fijian emigration; the resulting population loss resulted in economic difficulties and ensured that Melanesians became the majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=110|title=Fiji Islands: From Immigration to Emigration |last=Lal|first=Brij V|date=April 2003|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|accessdate=14 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the new constitution institutionalised ethnic Fijian domination of the political system. The [[Group Against Racial Discrimination]] (GARD) was formed to oppose the unilaterally imposed constitution and to restore the 1970 constitution. In 1992 [[Sitiveni Rabuka]], the Lieutenant Colonel who had carried out the 1987 coup, became Prime Minister following elections held under the new constitution. Three years later, Rabuka established the [[Constitutional Review Commission (Fiji)|Constitutional Review Commission]], which in 1997 wrote a new constitution which was supported by most leaders of the indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian communities. Fiji was re-admitted to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThe year 2000 brought along [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|another coup]], instigated by [[George Speight]], which effectively toppled the government of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], who in 1997 had become the country's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister following the adoption of the new constitution. Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama]] assumed executive power after the resignation, possibly forced, of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Later in 2000, Fiji was rocked by [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|two mutinies]] when rebel soldiers went on a rampage at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. The [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] ordered the reinstatement of the constitution, and in September 2001, to restore democracy, a general election was held which was won by interim Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]]'s [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lal|first=Brij V.|date=2002|title=In George Speight's Shadow: Fiji General Elections of 2001|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|volume=37|issue=1|pages=87\u2013101|jstor=25169576}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Qarase government amid much controversy proposed a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]] with power to recommend compensation for victims of the 2000 coup and amnesty for its perpetrators. However, the military, especially the nation's top military commander, Frank Bainimarama, strongly opposed this bill. Bainimarama agreed with detractors who said that to grant amnesty to supporters of the present government who had played a role in the violent coup was a sham. His attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout May and into June and July, further strained his already tense relationship with the government.\n\nIn late November and early December 2006, Bainimarama was instrumental in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Bainimarama handed down a list of demands to Qarase after a bill was put forward to parliament, part of which would have offered pardons to participants in the 2000 coup attempt. He gave Qarase an ultimatum date of 4 December to accede to these demands or to resign from his post. Qarase adamantly refused either to concede or resign, and on 5 December the president, Ratu [[Josefa Iloilo]], was said to have signed a legal order dissolving the parliament after meeting with Bainimarama.\n\nIn April 2009, the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Fiji Court of Appeal]] ruled that the 2006 coup had been illegal. This began the [[2009 Fijian constitutional crisis]]. President Iloilo abrogated the constitution, removed all office holders under the constitution including all judges and the governor of the Central Bank. He then reappointed Bainimarama under his \"New Order\" as interim Prime Minister and imposed a \"Public Emergency Regulation\" limiting internal travel and allowing press censorship.\n\nFor a country of its size, Fiji has fairly large armed forces, and has been a [[Fiji and the United Nations|major contributor]] to [[UN peacekeeping]] missions in various parts of the world. In addition, a significant number of former military personnel have served in the lucrative security sector in [[Iraq]] following the 2003 [[United States|US]]-led invasion.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Hermione Gee|title=Fijian peacekeepers in Iraq aren't just a battalion \u2014 they're a choir|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-05/fijian-peacekeepers-iraq-arent-just-battalion-theyre-choir|website=Public Radio International}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Fiji}}\n{{See also|Flora and fauna of Fiji}}\n\n[[File:Fiji and oceania.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Fiji's location in Oceania.]]\n[[File:Fiji map.png|thumb|upright=1.15|A map of Fiji]]\n[[File:Fiji topo.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Topography of Fiji]]\n[[File:The Point (Fiji).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Coconut]] palms line the beaches of Fiji]]\n\nFiji covers a total area of some {{convert|194000|km2}} of which around 10% is land.\n\nFiji is the hub of the South West Pacific, midway between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Tonga]].

The coup was the culmination of weeks of speculation following conflict between the elected prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, and Commodore Bainimarama. Bainimarama had repeatedly issued demands and deadlines to the prime minister. A particular issue was previously pending legislation to pardon those involved in the 2000 coup.

The Fiji national side did not match that feat again until the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] when they upset [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] 38\u201334 to progress to the quarter-finals where they lost to the eventual Rugby World Cup winners, [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]. Fiji also defeated the British and Irish Lions in 1977.\n\nFiji competes in the [[Pacific Tri-Nations]] and the [[IRB Pacific Nations Cup]]. The sport is governed by the [[Fiji Rugby Union]] which is a member of the [[Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance]], and contributes to the [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team]]. At the club level there are the [[Skipper Cup]] and [[Farebrother Trophy Challenge]].\n\nThe Fiji national rugby union team is a member of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) formerly along with Samoa and Tonga. In 2009, Samoa announced their departure from the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance, leaving just Fiji and Tonga in the union. Fiji is currently ranked eleventh in the world by the IRB (as of 28 December 2015).\n\nFiji is one of the few countries where rugby union is the main sport. There are about 80,000 registered players from a total population of around 900,000. One of the problems for Fiji is simply getting their players to play for their home country, as many have contracts in Europe with the French [[Top 14]] and the English [[Aviva Premiership]] or with [[Super Rugby]] teams, where monetary compensation is far more rewarding. The repatriated salaries of its overseas stars have become an important part of some local economies. In addition, a significant number of players eligible to play for Fiji end up representing Australia or New Zealand; notable examples are Fiji-born cousins and former [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]], Joe Rokocoko and Sitiveni Sivivatu, current All Blacks [[Waisake Naholo]] and Seta Tamanivalu as well as [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian Wallabies]] former winger, Lote Tuqiri and current Wallabies [[Tevita Kuridrani]], Samu Kerevi and [[Henry Speight]]. Fiji has won the most [[Pacific Tri-Nations]] Championships of the three participating teams.\n\n==== Rugby league ====\n{{Main|Rugby league in Fiji}}\n\nThe [[Fiji national rugby league team]], nicknamed the Bati (pronounced [m\u02c8bat\u0283i]), represents Fiji in the sport of rugby league football and has been participating in international competition since 1992. It has competed in the [[Rugby League World Cup]] on three occasions, with their best results coming when they made consecutive semi-final appearances in the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]] and [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]]. The team also competes in the [[Pacific Cup]].\n\nMembers of the team are selected from a domestic Fijian competition, as well as from competitions held in New Zealand and Australia. For the 2000, 2008 and 2013 World Cups, the Bati were captained by Lote Tuqiri, [[Wes Naiqama]] and the legendary [[Petero Civoniceva]] respectively. Fiji have also produced stars like [[Akuila Uate]], [[Jarryd Hayne]], [[Kevin Naiqama]], [[Semi Tadulala]], [[Marika Koroibete]], [[Apisai Koroisau]], [[Sisa Waqa]] and the Sims brothers [[Ashton Sims]], [[Tariq Sims]] and [[Korbin Sims]].\n\n==== Rugby war dance (Cibi and Bole) and Fijian hymn ====\nThe [[Cibi]] (pronounced ''Thimbi'') war dance was traditionally performed by the Fiji rugby team before each match. It was replaced in 2012 with the new \"Bole\" (pronounced ''mBolay'') war cry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rudgard|first1=Olivia|last2=Rothwell|first2=James|title=Never mind the haka \u2013 here's the Bole|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/rugby-world-cup/11871886/Never-mind-the-haka-heres-the-Bole.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=elegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=4 November 2016|date=18 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nTradition holds that the original Cibi was first performed on the rugby field back in 1939 during a tour of New Zealand, when then Fijian captain Ratu Sir George Cakobau felt that his team should have something to match the [[Haka]] of the All Blacks. The 'Cibi' had perhaps been used incorrectly though, as the word actually means \"a celebration of victory by warriors,\" whereas 'Bole' is the acceptance of a challenge.\n\nThe Fiji Bati rugby league team also gather in a huddle and perform the hymn 'Noqu Masu' before each match.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/video/league/rugby-league/fiji-emotional-pre-game-hymn!520818 ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Association football ====\n[[Association football]] was traditionally a minor sport in Fiji, popular largely amongst the Indo-Fijian community, but with international funding from [[FIFA]] and sound local management over the past decade, the sport has grown in popularity in the wider Fijian community. It is now the second most-popular sport in Fiji, after rugby (union 15's and union 7's) for men, and after netball for women.\n\nThe [[Fiji Football Association]] is a member of the [[Oceania Football Confederation]]. The [[Fiji national football team|national football team]] defeated [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] 2\u20130 in the 2008 [[OFC Nations Cup]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Oceanian Nations Cup 2008 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/08oc.html | accessdate=6 September 2009}}</ref> on their way to a joint-record third-place finish. However, they have never reached a [[FIFA World Cup]] to date. Fiji won the [[Pacific Games]] football tournament in [[Football at the 1991 South Pacific Games|1991]] and [[Football at the 2003 South Pacific Games|2003]]. Fiji qualified for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] men's tournament for the first time in history.\n\n==== Basketball ====\nDue to the success of Fiji's national basketball teams, the popularity of basketball in Fiji has experienced rapid growth in recent years. In the past, the country only had few basketball courts, which severely limited [[Fijians]] who desired to practice the sport more frequently. Due to recent efforts by the national federation ''Basketball Fiji'' and with the support of the Australian government, many schools have been able to construct courts and provide their students with basketball equipment such as shoes, etc.<ref>[https://www.fiba.com/news/basketball-fiji-bringing-the-sport-to-all Basketball Fiji bringing the sport to all], FIBA.com, 13 May 2016.

Finland can be divided into three areas: archipelagoes and coastal lowlands, a slightly higher [[Finnish Lakeland|central lake plateau]] and uplands to north and northeast. Bordering the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Gulf of Bothnia]], and [[Gulf of Finland]], as well as [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Russia]], Finland is the northernmost country in the [[European Union]]. Most of the population and agricultural resources are concentrated in the south. Northern and eastern Finland are sparsely populated containing vast wilderness areas. [[taiga|Taiga forest]] is the dominant vegetation type. \n\n== Size and external boundaries==\nFinland's total area is {{convert|337030|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.  Of this area 10% is water, 69% forest, 8% cultivated land and 13% other. Finland is the eighth largest country in Europe after Russia, France, Ukraine, Spain, Sweden, Norway and Germany.\n\nAs a whole, the shape of Finland's boundaries resembles a figure of a one-armed human. In Finnish, parallels are drawn between the figure and the [[national personification]] of Finland \u2013 [[Finnish Maiden]] (''Suomi-neito'') \u2013 and the country as a whole can be referred in the Finnish language by her name. Even in official context the area around [[Enonteki\u00f6]] in northwestern part of the country between [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] can be referred to as the \"Arm\" (''k\u00e4sivarsi''). After the [[Continuation War]] Finland lost major land areas to Russia in the [[Moscow Armistice]] of 1944, and the figure was said to have lost the other of her arms, as well as a [[wiktionary:hem|hem]] of her \"skirt\".\n\n== Relief and geology ==\n===Geology===\n{{main|Geology of Finland}}\n[[File:Ice-age glacial striation in Finland.jpg|thumb|200px|Effects of the last ice age: [[glacial striation]]s in a country without glaciers.]]\nThe [[bedrock]] of Finland belong to the [[Baltic Shield]]<ref name=Natenterrang/> and was formed by a succession of [[orogeny|orogenies]] in [[Precambrian]] time.<ref name=UppslagsFiBERG/> The oldest rocks of Finland, those of [[Archean]] age, are found in the east and north.

Because of Finland's northern location, winter is the longest season. Only in the south coast is summer as long as winter. On the average, winter lasts from early December to mid March in the archipelago and the southwestern coast and from early October to early May in Lapland. This means that southern portions of the country are snow-covered about three to four months of the year and the northern, about seven months. The long winter causes about half of the annual {{convert|500|to|600|mm|in|1}} of precipitation in the north to fall as snow. Precipitation in the south amounts to about {{convert|600|to|700|mm|in|1}} annually. Like that of the north, it occurs all through the year, though not so much of it is snow.\n[[File:Finland K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|240px|Finland map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nThe [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and the [[Eurasia|Eurasian continent]] to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. The warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]] and the [[North Atlantic current|North Atlantic Drift Current]], which warm Norway and Sweden, also warm Finland. Westerly winds bring the warm air currents into the Baltic areas and to the country's shores, moderating winter temperatures, especially in the south. These winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. By contrast, the continental high pressure system situated over the Eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and high temperatures in the summer.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature is {{convert|37.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[Liperi]], 29 July 2010).<ref name=\"yle.fi_20100729\">{{Cite web |url= http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/07/mercury_hits_all_time_record_of_372_degrees_1863179.html |title= Mercury Hits All Time Record of 37.2 Degrees |accessdate=29 July 2010 |date= 29 July 2010 |work= YLE Uutiset |publisher= Yleisradio Oy |location= Helsinki }}</ref> The lowest, {{convert|\u221251.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[Kittil\u00e4]], 28 January 1999).

There are 4,500 of them living in Finland today and they are recognised as a minority and speak three distinct languages: [[Northern Sami]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]]. They have been living north of the [[Arctic Circle]] for more than 7,000 years now, but today are a 5% minority in their native Lapland Province.

Families became smaller, dropping from an average of 3.6 persons in 1950 to an average of 2.7 by 1975. Family composition did not change much in that quarter of a century, however, and in 1975 the percentage of families that consisted of a man and a woman was 24.4; of a couple and children, 61.9; of a woman with offspring, 11.8; of a man and offspring, 1.9. These percentages are not markedly different from those of 1950. Change was seen in the number of children per family, which fell from an average of 2.24 in 1950 to an average of 1.7 in the mid-1980s, and large families were rare. Only 2 percent of families had four or more children, while 51 percent had one child; 38 percent, two children; and 9 percent, three children. The number of Finns under the age of 18 dropped from 1.5 million in 1960 to 1.2 million in 1980.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>\n\n===[[Total Fertility Rate]] from 1776 to 1899===\nThe [[Total fertility rate|total fertility rate]] is the number of children born per woman.

Most obvious was the declining marriage rate, which dropped from 8.5 marriages per 1,000 Finns in 1950 to 5.8, in 1984, a decline great enough to mean a drop also in absolute numbers. In 1950 there were 34,000 marriages, while in 1984 only 28,500 were registered, despite a growth in population of 800,000. An explanation for the decline was that there was an unprecedented number of unmarried couples. Since the late 1960s, the practice of cohabitation had become increasingly common, so much so that by the late 1970s most marriages in urban areas grew out of what Finns called \"open unions.\" In the 1980s, it was estimated that about 8 percent of couples who lived together, approximately 200,000 people, did so without benefit of marriage. Partners of such unions usually married because of the arrival of offspring or the acquisition of property. A result of the frequency of cohabitation was that marriages were postponed, and the average age for marriage, which had been falling, began to rise in the 1970s. By 1982 the average marriage age was 24.8 years for women and 26.8 years for men, several years higher for both sexes than had been true a decade earlier.<ref name=\"MARLO\">{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/finland/39.htm |title=Marriage |last=Solsten |first=Eric (ed.) |date=1988 |website=Finland: A Country Study.  |publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress |access-date=21 January 2017 }}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Finns did marry, however. About 90 percent of the women had been married by the age of forty, and spinsterhood was rare. A shortage of women in rural regions, however, meant that some farmers were forced into bachelorhood.<ref name=\"MARLO\"/>\n\nWhile the number of marriages was declining, divorce became more common, increasing 250 percent between 1950 and 1980. In 1952 there were 3,500 divorces. The 1960s saw a steady increase in this rate, which averaged about 5,000 divorces a year. A high of 10,191 was reached in 1979; afterwards the divorce rate stabilized at about 9,500 per year during the first half of the 1980s.<ref name=\"MARLO\"/>\n\nA number of factors caused the increased frequency of divorce. One was that an increasingly secularized society viewed marriage, more often than before, as an arrangement that could be ended if it did not satisfy its partners. Another reason was that a gradually expanding welfare system could manage an ever-greater portion of the family's traditional tasks, and it made couples less dependent on the institution of marriage. Government provisions for parental leave, child allowances, child care programs, and much improved health and pension plans meant that the family was no longer essential for the care of children and aged relatives. A further cause for weakened family and marital ties was seen in the unsettling effects of the Great Migration and in the economic transformation Finland experienced during the 1960s and the 1970s. The rupture of established social patterns brought uncertainty and an increased potential for conflict into personal relationships.<ref name=\"LOC\"/><ref name=\"MARLO\"/>\n\n==Demographic statistics==\nRecorded Finland population figures date back to 1750 and have been faithfully updated ever since. They would clearly appear to have been rounded either up or down too and in 1750, it is shown that there were 421,000 people living here.<ref name=WPR2018/>\n\nTen years later, those numbers had climbed to 490,000 \u2013 a rise of just over sixteen per cent and similar increases through the rest of the 1700\u2019s took the population of Finland to 837,000 at the start of the 19th century.<ref name=WPR2018/>\n\nThe population of Finland climbed above one million for the first time by 1820 and as the 20th century began, figures within the country had increased to 2,655,900. This pattern of steady increases has continued ever since to the point where the Finland population in 2012 is rapidly approaching 5.5 million.<ref name=WPR2018/>\n\nIt is reported that population growth slowed in Finland after World War Two with average family sizes falling from 3.6 in 1950 to 2.7 by 1975. Therefore, while there is still growth here, it is considerably slower than it has been in the past.<ref name=WPR2018/>\n\nFinland is very ethnically homogeneous. Most of the population is ethnic Finnish. The earliest inhabitants of the area were hunter-gatherers, most closely related to the modern-day Sami people of Finland. There are about 4,500 Sami left in Finland who are officially recognized as a minority. The Sami people have been living north of the Arctic Circle for over 7,000 years and account for a 5% minority in the Lapland Province.

However, statistics of the Finnish population according to language, citizenship and country of birth are available. According to international census recommendations an ethnic group is defined by the perception of its members of historical and regional or national origin, and data or ethnic status should always be based on a person's own statement.

standing.\n\n=== Finland Swedes ===\n{{Details|Finland Swedes}}\nThe largest minority group in Finland is the Swedish- speaking Finns, who in 2015 numbered about 290,000 or 5.3% of the total population.<ref name=\"POP2015\"/> The Finland Swedes are not of Swedish nationality, but Finns who speak a Swedish dialect unique to Finland. However, Finland Swedish can be considered its own nationality, separate from both Finns and Swedes. Municipalities are classified as either unilingual or bilingual with a majority language. Majority of Swedish-speakers live in unilingual Swedish-speaking or bilingual municipalities. These municipalities are found in coastal areas, from Ostrobothnia to the southern coast, and in the archipelago of [[\u00c5land]].<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n===Sami===\n{{Details|Sami people}}\nThe Sami are related to the Finns, both speak non-Indo-European languages belonging to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic family of languages]]. Once present throughout the country, the Sami gradually moved northward under the pressure of the advancing Finns. As they were a nomadic people in a sparsely settled land, the Sami were always able to find new and open territory in which to follow their traditional activities of hunting, fishing, and slash-and-burn agriculture. By the 16th century, most Sami lived in the northern half of the country, and it was during this period that they converted to Christianity. By the 19th century, most of them lived in the parts of Lapland that were still their home in the 1980s. The last major shift in Sami settlement was the migration westward of 600 [[Skolts|Skolt Sami]] from the [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] region after it was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944. A reminder of their eastern origin was their Orthodox faith; the remaining 85 percent of Finland's Sami were Lutheran.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nAs of 1988, about 90 percent of Finland's 4,400 Sami lived in the municipalities of [[Enonteki\u00f6]], [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], and [[Utsjoki]], and in the reindeer herding-area of [[Sodankyl\u00e4]]. According to Finnish regulations, anyone who spoke one of the [[Sami languages]], or who had a relative who was a Sami, was registered as a Sami in census records. Finnish Sami spoke three distinct [[Sami languages]], but by the late 1980s perhaps only a minority actually had Sami as their first language. Sami children had the right to instruction in Sami, but there were few qualified instructors or textbooks available. One reason for the scarcity of written material in Sami is that the three languages spoken in Finland made agreement about a common orthography difficult. Perhaps these shortcomings explained why a 1979 study found the educational level of Sami to be considerably lower than that of other Finns.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nFew Finnish Sami actually led the traditional nomadic life pictured in school geography texts and in travel brochures. Although many Sami living in rural regions of Lapland earned some of their livelihood from reindeer herding, it was estimated that Sami owned no more than one-third of Finland's 200,000 reindeer. Only 5 percent of Finnish Sami had the herds of 250 to 300 reindeer needed to live entirely from this kind of work. Most Sami worked at more routine activities, including farming, construction, and service industries such as tourism. Often a variety of jobs and sources of income supported Sami families, which were, on the average, twice the size of a typical Finnish family. Sami also were aided by old-age pensions and by government welfare, which provided a greater share of their income than it did for Finns as a whole.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nThere have been many efforts over the years by Finnish authorities to safeguard the Sami' culture and way of life and to ease their entry into modern society. Officials created bodies that dealt with the Sami minority, or formed committees that studied their situation. An early body was the Society for the Promotion of Lapp Culture, formed in 1932. In 1960 the government created the Advisory Commission on Lapp Affairs. The Sami themselves formed the Saami-liitto in 1945 and the Johti Sabmelazzat, a more aggressive organization, in 1968. In 1973 the government arranged for elections every four years to a twenty-member Sami Parliaments that was to advise authorities. On the international level, there was the Nordic Sami Council of 1956, and there has been a regularly occurring regional conference since then that represented\u2014in addition to Finland's Sami\u2014Norway's 20,000 Sami, Sweden's 10,000 Sami, and the 1,000 to 2,000 Sami who remained in the Kola Peninsula in Russia.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nSami languages have an official status  in the municipalities of [[Enonteki\u00f6]], [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], and [[Utsjoki]], and in the northern part of [[Sodankyl\u00e4]] since 1992.<ref name=\"KOTUSSAAME\"/> In 2009, 55% of the 9 350 Sami in Finland lived outside of this area.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.eduskunta.fi/faktatmp/utatmp/akxtmp/kk_20_2009_p.shtml |title=Eduskunta \u2014 Kirjallinen kysymys 20/2009 |publisher=Parliament |place=FI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602201021/http://www.eduskunta.fi/faktatmp/utatmp/akxtmp/kk_20_2009_p.shtml |archivedate=June 2, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Russians===\n[[Russians in Finland]] had come from two major waves.

With their unusual dress, unique customs, and specialized trades for earning their livelihood, Roma have stood out, and their stay in the country has not been an easy one. They have suffered periodic harassment from the hands of both private citizens and public officials, and the last of the special laws directed against them was repealed only in 1883. Even in the second half of the 1980s, Finland's 5,000 to 6,000 Romani remained a distinct group, separated from the general population both by their own choice and by the fears and the prejudices many Finns felt toward them.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nFinnish Roma, like Roma elsewhere, chose to live apart from the dominant societal groups. A Roma's loyalty was to his or her family and to Gypsies in general. Marriages with non-Roma were uncommon, and the Roma's own language, spoken as a first language only by a few in the 1980s, was used to keep outsiders away. An individual's place within Roma society was largely determined by age and by sex, old males having authority. A highly developed system of values and a code of conduct governed a Roma's behavior, and when Roma sanctions, violent or not, were imposed, for example via \"blood feuds,\" they had far more meaning than any legal or social sanctions of Finnish society.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nUnlike the Lapps, who lived concentrated in a single region, the Romani lived throughout Finland. While most Lapps wore ordinary clothing in their everyday life, Romani could be identified by their dress; the men generally wore high boots and the women almost always dressed in very full, long velvet skirts. Like most Lapps, however, Roma also had largely abandoned a nomadic way of life and had permanent residences. Romani men had for centuries worked as horse traders, but they had adapted themselves to postwar Finland by being active as horse breeders and as dealers in cars and scrap metal. Women continued their traditional trades of fortune telling and handicrafts.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nSince the 1960s, Finnish authorities have undertaken measures to improve the Romani's standard of life. Generous state financial arrangements have improved their housing. Their low educational level (an estimated 20 percent of adult Romani could not read) was raised, in part, through more vocational training. A permanent Advisory Commission on Gypsy Affairs was set up in 1968, and in 1970 racial discrimination was outlawed through an addition to the penal code. The law punished blatant acts such as barring Romani from restaurants or shops or subjecting them to unusual surveillance by shopkeepers or the police.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== Jews ===\n{{Details|History of the Jews in Finland}}\n\nThere are about 1,300 [[Jews]] in Finland, 800 of whom live in Helsinki and most of the remainder live in Turku. During the period of Swedish rule, Jews had been forbidden to live in Finland. Once the country became part of the Russian Empire, however, Jewish veterans of the Tsarist army had the right to settle anywhere they wished within the empire. Although constrained by law to follow certain occupations, mainly those connected with the sale of clothes, the Jewish community in Finland was able to prosper, and by 1890 it numbered around 1,000. Finnish independence brought complete civil rights, and during the interwar period there were some 2,000 Jews in Finland, most of them living in urban areas in the south. During World War II, Finnish authorities refused to deliver Jews to the Third Reich, and the country's Jewish community survived the war virtually intact. By the 1980s, assimilation and emigration had significantly reduced the size of the community, and it was only with some difficulty that it maintained synagogues, schools, libraries, and other pertinent institutions.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\n=== Tatars ===\nThe  community of [[Finnish Tatars]] numbers only about 800.  The Tatars first came to Finland from the Russian Volga region near Nizni Novgorod's Tatar villages in the mid-19th century and have remained there ever since, active in commerce. The Tatars in Finland fully integrated into the Finnish society at the same time they preserved their religion, mother tongue and ethnic culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ylioppilaslehti.fi/2004/09/tavismuslimit/ |title=Tavismuslimit |date=2004 |website=Ylioppilaslehti |access-date=21 January 2017 |language=fi}}</ref>\n\n== Migration ==\n\n=== Emigration ===\n\nMany Finnish natives have emigrated abroad, sometimes running away of war, eg. to Sweden, sometimes for economical reasons, eg. to US and Canada. Current numbers of emigration are not very well discussed in public, but lowering standard of living in Finland has forced many persons and families to look for living. Also political emigrants have been identified, relocating to Russia, US, London and even to Donbass, Ukraine.\n\n=== External migration ===\n[[Image:Finland residency by country of birth 2006.PNG|right|500px|thumb]]\n\nDemographic movement in Finland did not end with the appearance of immigrants from Sweden in the Middle Ages. Finns who left to work in Swedish mines in the 16th century began a national tradition, which continued up through the 1970s, of settling in their neighboring country. During the period of tsarist rule, some 100,000 Finns went to Russia, mainly to the St. Petersburg area. Emigration on a large scale began in the second half of the 19th century when Finns, along with millions of other Europeans, set out for the United States and Canada. By 1980 Finland had lost an estimated 400,000 of its citizens to these two countries.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nA great number of Finns emigrated to Sweden after World War II, drawn by that country's prosperity and proximity. Emigration began slowly, but, during the 1960s and the second half of the 1970s, tens of thousands left each year for their western neighbor. The peak emigration year was 1970, when 41,000 Finns settled in Sweden, which caused Finland's population actually to fall that year. Because many of the migrants later returned to Finland, definite figures cannot be calculated, but all told, an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 Finns became permanent residents of Sweden in the postwar period. The overall youthfulness of these emigrants meant that the quality of the work force available to Finnish employers was diminished and that the national birth rate slowed. At one point, every eighth Finnish child was born in Sweden. Finland's Swedish-speaking minority was hard hit by this westward migration; its numbers dropped from 350,000 to about 300,000 between 1950 and 1980. By the 1980s, a strong Finnish economy had brought an end to large-scale migration to Sweden. In fact, the overall population flow was reversed because each year several thousand more Finns returned from Sweden than left for it.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== Internal migration ===\nHowever significant the long-term effects of external migration on Finnish society may have been, migration within the country had a greater impact\u2014especially the migration which took place between the end of World War II and the mid-1970s, when half the population moved from one part of the country to another. Before World War II, internal migration had first been a centuries-long process of forming settlements ever farther to the north. Later, however, beginning in the second half of the 19th century with the coming of Finland's tardy industrialization, there was a slow movement from rural regions toward areas in the south where employment could be found.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nPostwar internal migration began with the resettlement within Finland of virtually all the inhabitants of the parts of Karelia ceded to the Soviet Union. Somewhat more than 400,000 persons, more than 10 percent of the nation's population, found new homes elsewhere in Finland, often in the less settled regions of the east and the north. In these regions, new land, which they cleared for farming, was provided for the refugees; in more populated areas, property was requisitioned. The sudden influx of these settlers was successfully dealt with in just a few years. One of the effects of rural resettlement was an increase in the number of farms during the postwar years, a unique occurrence for industrialized nations of this period.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nIt was, however, the postwar economic transformation that caused an even larger movement of people within Finland, a movement known to Finns as the Great Migration. It was a massive population shift from rural areas, especially those of eastern and northeastern Finland, to the urban, industrialized south. People left rural regions because the mechanization of agriculture and the forestry industry had eliminated jobs. The displaced work force went to areas where employment in the expanding industrial and service sectors was available. This movement began in the 1950s, but it was most intense during the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, assuming proportions that in relative terms were unprecedented for a country outside the Third World. The Great Migration left behind rural areas of abandoned farms with reduced and aging populations, and it allowed the creation of a densely populated postindustrial society in the country's south.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nThe extent of the demographic shift to the south can be shown by the following figures. Between 1951 and 1975, the population registered an increase of 655,000. During this period, the small province of Uusimaa increased its population by 412,000, growing from 670,000 to 1,092,000; three-quarters of this growth was caused by settlers from other provinces. The population increase experienced by four other southern provinces, the Aland Islands, Turku ja Pori, Hame, and Kymi, taken together with that of Uusimaa amounted to 97 percent of the country's total population increase for these years. The population increase of the central and the northern provinces accounted for the remaining 3 percent. Provinces that experienced an actual population loss during these years were in the east and the northeast-Pohjois-Karjala, Mikkeli, and Kuopio.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nOne way of visualizing the shift to the south would be to draw a line, bowing slightly to the north, between the port cities of Kotka on the Gulf of Finland and Kaskinen on the Gulf of Bothnia. In 1975 the territory to the south of this line would have contained half of Finland's population. Ten years earlier, such a line, drawn farther to the north to mark off perhaps 20 percent more area, would have encompassed half the population.

During the era Finland had an autonomous position within the Russian Empire with its own legislative powers. However, all bills had to be signed into law by the Russian Emperor who was the Grand Duke of Finland. Also, military power was firmly in Russian hands. Previously Finland had been a part of Sweden and did not have any political institutions of its own, rather people of Finnish ethnicity participated in Swedish politics.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-USGov PD] source: US Library of Congress: ''[https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/fi/finlandcountryst00sols/finlandcountryst00sols.pdf A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990. {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Russian rule, political activism gradually grew demanding more autonomy and eventually independence for Finland. However, several generations of struggle were needed before the Finnish nationalist movement realized its objectives. One form of activism was the underscoring of Finnish language, also at the expense of the primacy of Swedish language that was still widely spoken and the official language of the country. Numerous members of the Swedish-speaking community entered the campaign, adopting Finnish as their language and exchanging their Swedish family names for Finnish ones. Finnish journals were founded, and Finnish became an official language in 1863. By the end of the century, there was a slight majority of Finnish-speaking students at the University of Helsinki, and Finnish-speakers made up sizable portions of the professions.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n[[File:Schauman shoots Bobrikov.jpg|thumb|A culmination of the activism of the militant wing of the Fennomans was the assassination of General Governor [[Bobrikov]] by [[Eugen Schauman]].]] Finland's first political parties grew out of the language struggle. Those advocating full rights for Finnish-speakers formed the so-called [[Fennoman]] group that by the 1890s had split into the Old Finns and the Young Finns, the former mainly concerned with the language question, the latter urging the introduction of political liberalism. The Swedish-speaking community formed a short-lived Liberal Party. As the century drew to a close and the Fennoman movement had achieved its principal goals, economic issues and relations with the tsarist empire came to dominate politics.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nOver time Finland's modernizing economy encouraged the formation of social groups with specific, and sometimes opposing, interests. In addition to the Finnish movement's Old and Young Finns, other political organizations came into being. Because the existing political groups did not adequately represent labor's interests, a workers' party was formed at the end of the century. In 1903 it became the Finnish Social Democratic Party ([[Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue]] or SDP). At the same time labor was organizing itself, the farmers began a cooperative movement; in 1907 they formed the Agrarian Party ([[Maalaisliitto]]). The Swedish People's Party ([[Svenska Folkpartiet]] or SFP), also dating from this period, was formed to serve the entire Swedish-speaking population.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nThe Grand Duchy's relationship with St. Petersburg began to deteriorate in the 1890s. The nervousness of tsarist officials about Finnish loyalty in wartime prompted measures to bind Finland more closely to the empire. The campaign of \"Russification\" ended only with Finland's independence in 1917. In retrospect, the campaign can be seen as a failure, but for several decades it caused much turmoil within Finland, reaching its most extreme point with the assassination of the governor general in 1904. The first Russian revolution, that of 1905, allowed Finns to discard their antiquated Diet and to replace it with a unicameral legislature, the Eduskunta, elected through universal suffrage. Finland became the first European nation in which women had the franchise. The first national election, that of 1907, yielded Europe's largest social democratic parliamentary faction. In a single step, Finland went from being one of Europe's most politically backward countries to being one of its most advanced. Nonetheless, frequent dissolutions at the hands of the tsar permitted the Eduskunta to achieve little before independence.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== Independence and the inter-war period ===\n\n[[File:Tampere_destroyed_in_Civil_War.jpg|thumb|[[Tampere]] in ruins. The Civil War brought destruction and suffering to the country.]] The second Russian revolution allowed Finland to break away from the Russian empire, and independence was declared on December 6, 1917. Within weeks, domestic political differences led to a [[Finnish Civil War]] that lasted until May 1918, when right-wing forces, with some German assistance, were able to claim victory. As a consequence, Finland began its existence as an independent state with a considerable segment of its people estranged from the holders of power, a circumstance that caused much strife in Finnish politics.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nAfter right-wing dreams of a monarchy based on the coronation of German prince as the king of Finland came crumbling down with the German defeat in the World War, a republic was formed. In mid-1919, Finns agreed on a new Constitution, one that constructed a modern parliamentary system of government from existing political institutions and traditions. The 200-seat unicameral parliament, the Eduskunta, was retained. A cabinet, the Council \nof State, was fashioned from the Senate of the tsarist period. A powerful presidency, derived, in part at least, from the office of governor general, was created and provided with a mixture of powers and duties that, in other countries, might be shared by such figures as king, president, and prime minister. Also included in the new governmental system was an independent judiciary. The powers of the three branches of government were controlled through \nan overlapping of powers, rather than a strict separation of powers.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nFinland faced numerous political and economic difficulties in the interwar years, but it surmounted them better than many other European countries. Despite the instability of many short-lived governments, the political system held together during the first decades of independence. While other countries succumbed to right-wing forces, Finland had only a brush with fascism. Communist organizations were banned, and their representatives in the Eduskunta arrested, but the SDP was able to recover from wounds sustained during the Civil War and was returned to power. In 1937 the party formed the first of the so-called Red-Earth coalitions with the Agrarian League, the most common party combination of the next fifty years, one that brought together the parties representing the two largest social groups. The language problem was largely resolved by provisions in the Constitution that protected the rights of the Swedish-speaking minority.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== World War II and the Cold War period ===\n\nFinland's official foreign policy of neutrality in the interwar period could not offset the strategic importance of the country's territory to Nazi Germany and to the Soviet Union. The latter was convinced that it had a defensive \nneed to ensure that Finland would not be used as an avenue for attack on its northwestern areas, especially on Leningrad. Moreover, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] to divide the countries of Central Europe between themselves. Accordingly, the Soviet Union launched an attack of Finland in November 1939. A valiant Finnish defense slowed the invaders, but in March 1940 the Winter War ended when Finland agreed to cede to the Soviets about 10 percent of Finnish territory and to permit a Soviet military base on Finnish soil. In June 1941 Finland joined Germany as cobelligerent in its attack on the Soviet Union. In what Finns call the Continuation War, Finland confined its military actions to areas near its prewar borders. In the fall of 1944, Finland made a separate peace with the Soviet Union, one that was conditional on its ceding territory, granting basing rights, agreeing to onerous reparation payments, and expelling German forces from its territory. Nevertheless, Finland succeeded in being one of only two belligerents in Europe that stayed never occupied, independent and with its democracy intact throughout the war, the other being the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBy the early 1950s, the patterns of postwar Finnish politics were established. No one group was dominant, but the Agrarian League held the presidency under [[Urho Kekkonen]] for a quarter century. Kekkonen first became president in 1956, and secured a place for the conservative Agrarian League as almost a permanent governing party until the late 1980s. In 1966 it changed its name to the Center Party ([[Keskustapuolue]] or Keskusta) in an attempt to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate, but it still was not successful in penetrating southern coastal Finland. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party historically the largest party, still remained strong but it was often riven by dissension. In addition, it had to share the leftist vote with the Communist Party of Finland ([[Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue]] or SKP). As a consequence, right-wing parties never had to face a united left. In the 1980s, the communists had severe problems adjusting to new social conditions, and they split into several warring groups. As a result, their movement had a marginal position in Finnish politics. The SFP, a moderate centrist party with liberal and conservative wings, had a slightly declining number of seats in the parliament [[Eduskunta]], but its position in the middle of the political spectrum often made it indispensable for coalition governments. The National Coalition Party (Kansallinen Kokoomuspuolue or Kokoomus), rigidly conservative in the interwar period, gradually became more moderate and grew stronger, surpassing the Center Party in the number of parliamentary seats in 1979. Excluded from a role in government for decades, possibly because it had been more right-wing earlier, the Kokoomus participated in the government formed after the national elections of 1987, supplying the prime minister, [[Harri Holkeri]]. The Liberal Party of the postwar period was never strong, and it had a negligible role by the 1980s and eventually was dissolved.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n[[File:ETYK-Finland-delegation-1975.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Finnish delegation to the [[OSCE]] included both prime minister Sorsa on the left and president Kekkonen on the right. Sorsa came from the SDP which was the largest party for most of the post-war era but through the presidency the Center Party nevertheless held a dominant role.]]\n\nA number of smaller parties, protest parties, and parties representing quite distinct groups filled out the list of about a dozen organizations that regularly vied for public office. Pensioners and activist Christians each had their own party, and environmentalists won several seats in the 1983 and the 1987 national elections \u2014 a movement which later grew to the modern Green Party during the 1990s. The most active of the protest parties was the Finnish Rural Party ([[Suomen Maaseudun Puolue]] or SMP), which managed to take votes from both the Center Party and leftist parties. It scored its first big successes in the 1970 national elections. Since then its electoral results \nhave varied considerably. By late 1980s, it seemed a spent force, but arose again as a populist right-wing party after changing its name to Perussuomalaiset or [[True Finns]].<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nAfter the 1966 national elections President Kekkonen succeeded in forming a popular front coalition government that contained communists, socialists, and members of the Center Party. Although this government lasted only two years and was succeeded for another decade by short-lived coalition and caretaker civil service governments, it was the beginning of what Finns call the politics of consensus. By the 1980s, consensus politics had become so dominant that some observers claimed that Finnish politics, long so bitter and contentious, had become the most boring in Western Europe. Although the larger parties differed on specific issues, and personal rivalries could be poisonous, there was broad agreement about domestic and foreign policy. The cabinet put in place after the 1983 elections, consisting mainly of social democrats and members of the Center Party, completed its whole term of office, the first government to do so in the postwar period. This ushered in an era of relatively long lasting governments where leadership changes took place mainly through regular elections.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nA foundation of the politics of consensus was the success of the system of broad incomes agreements that has characterized Finland's employee-employer relations in recent decades. The first of these, the [[Liinamaa Agreement]], dated from 1968. By the 1980s, the process was so regular as to seem institutionalized. With about 80 percent of the work force as members, unions negotiated incomes agreements with employers' organizations. The government often helped in the talks and subsequently proposed legislation embodying social welfare measures or financial measures that underpinned the agreements. The process was successful at increasing labor peace in a country that had been \nracked by strikes for the first decades after World War II. Although there were complaints that the agreements bypassed political channels or excluded minority opinion, the obvious prosperity they had helped bring about made the incomes policy system and the politics of consensus highly popular.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n==Constitution==\n{{main|Constitution of Finland}}\nThe current version of the constitution of Finland was written on March 1, 2000.

In principle, the constitutionality of laws in Finland is verified by a simple vote by Parliament (see ''[[parliamentary sovereignty]]''). However, the Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee reviews any doubtful bills and recommends changes, if needed. In practice, the Constitutional Law Committee fulfils the duties of a constitutional court. A Finnish peculiarity is the possibility of making exceptions to the constitution in ordinary laws that are enacted in the same procedure as constitutional amendments. An example of such a law is the State of Preparedness Act, which gives the Government certain exceptional powers in cases of national emergency. As these powers, which correspond to US executive orders, affect constitutional basic rights, the law was enacted in the same manner as a constitutional amendment. However, it can be repealed in the same manner as an ordinary law. In addition to preview by the Constitutional Law Committee, all Finnish courts are obligated to give precedence to the constitution when there is an obvious conflict between the constitution and a regular law. Such a case is, however, very rare.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nSome matters are decided by the [[President of Finland]], the Head of State, in plenary meetings with the government, echoing the constitutional history of a [[privy council]]. The President is otherwise not present in the government, but decides on issues such as personal appointments and pardons on the advice of the relevant [[Political minister|minister]].

The final legislative power is vested in Parliament, in conjunction with the President of the Republic, according to the Finnish Constitution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lainvalmistelu.finlex.fi/en/|title=Law Drafting|website=Finlex|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere are 12 ministries in Finland.<ref name=\"ministries-gov.fi\">{{Cite web|url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/ministeriot/en.jsp|title=Ministries|publisher=Finnish Government|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610175707/http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/ministeriot/en.jsp|archivedate=2011-06-10|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-06-22|df=}}</ref> As the government tends to have more ministers than ministries, some ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance, are associated with multiple ministers.\n* [[Prime Minister's Office (Finland)|Prime Minister's Office]]\n* [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]]\n* [[Ministry of Justice (Finland)|Ministry of Justice]]\n* [[Ministry of the Interior (Finland)|Ministry of the Interior]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (Finland)|Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Ministry of Finance (Finland)|Ministry of Finance]]\n* [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Finland)|Ministry of Education and Culture]]\n* [[Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Finland)|Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry]]\n* [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]]\n* [[Ministry of Employment and the Economy]]\n* [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]]\n* [[Ministry of the Environment (Finland)|Ministry of the Environment]]\n\n==Parliament==\n{{main|Parliament of Finland}}\n\nThe 200-member [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of Finland]] (''Eduskunta'' (Finnish), ''Riksdag'' (Swedish)). It is the supreme legislative authority in Finland. The parliament may alter the [[Constitution of Finland]], bring about the resignation of the Government, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review. [[Legislation]] may be initiated by the Government, or one of members of Parliament, who are elected for a four-year term on the basis of proportional representation through [[open list]] multi-member districts. Persons 18 or older, except military personnel on active duty and a few high judicial officials, are eligible for election. The regular parliamentary term is four years; however, the president may dissolve the eduskunta and order new elections at the request of the prime minister and after consulting the speaker of parliament.\n\nThe parliament has, since [[equal and common suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, been dominated by [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|secular Conservatives]], [[Centre Party of Finland|the Centre Party (former Agrarian Union)]], and [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. Nevertheless, none of these has held a single-party majority, with the notable exception of [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1916|1916 elections]] where Social Democrats gained 103 of the 200 seats. After 1944, [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a factor to consider for a few decades, and the [[Finnish People's Democratic League]], formed by Communists and others to the left of Social Democrats, was the largest party after [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1958|1958 elections]]. Support for Communists decreased sharply in the early 1980s, while later on the same decade environmentalists formed the [[Green League]], which is now one of the largest parties. The [[Swedish People's Party in Finland|Swedish People's Party]] represents the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finland-Swedes]], especially in [[language politics]]. The relative strengths of the parties vary only slightly in the elections due to the proportional election from multi-member districts, but there are some visible long-term trends.\n\nThere is no [[constitutional court]]; matters concerning constitutional rights or constitutional law are processed by the Constitutional Committee of the Parliament (''perustuslakivaliokunta''). Additionally, the Constitutional Committee has the sole power to refer a case to the [[High Court of Impeachment]] (''valtakunnanoikeus'') and to authorize police investigations for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to the parliament, the Cabinet and President may produce [[regulation]]s (''asetus'') through a [[rulemaking]] process. These give more specific instructions on how to apply statutes, which often explicitly [[Delegated legislation|delegate regulation of specific details]] to the government. Regulations must be based on an existing law, and they can clarify and specify, but not contradict the statute. Furthermore, the rights of an individual must always be based on a statute, not a regulation. Often the statute and the regulation come in similarly named pairs. For example, the law on primary education lists the subjects to the taught, and the regulation specifies the required number of teaching hours. Most of regulations are given by the Cabinet, but the President may give regulations concerning national security. Before 2000, the President had the right to enact regulations on matters not governed by parliamentary law, but this power was removed, and existing regulations were converted into regular statutes by the Parliament.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{main|Finnish presidential election, 2018|Finnish parliamentary election, 2015}}\n{{elect|List of political parties in Finland|Elections in Finland}}\n\nFinland's proportional representation system encourages a multitude of [[political party|political parties]] and has resulted in many coalition-cabinets. Formerly the life expectancy of the coalition governments has been short, but since about 1980 the trend has been that the same coalition rules for the whole period between elections.\n\nFinland elects on national level a [[head of state]]\u2014the [[president]]\u2014and a [[legislature]]. The president is elected for a six-year term by the people. The [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]] has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]] in multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. Finland has a [[multi-party]] system, with multiple strong parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and [[political parties|parties]] must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.\n\nIn addition to the presidential and parliamentary elections, there are [[Elections in the European Union|European Parliament elections]] every five years, and local municipal elections (held simultaneously in every [[municipalities of Finland|municipality]]) every four years.\n\n==Judiciary==\n{{main|Judicial system of Finland}}\n\nFinland has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is based on Swedish law, with the judiciary exercising limited powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oikeus.fi/en/index/esitteet/olauspetrintuomarinohjeet.html |title= 450-year-old judicial instructions  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 2013 |website=oikeus.fi |publisher=Ministry of Justice |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref> Proceedings are [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]], where judges preside, conduct finding of fact, adjudication and giving of sanctions such as sentences; no juries are used. In e.g. criminal and family-related proceedings in local courts, the panel of judges may include both [[lay judge]]s and professional judges, while all appeals courts and administrative courts consist only of professional judges. Precedent is not binding, with the exception of Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court decisions.\n\nThe judicial system of Finland is divided between [[court (judicial)|courts]] with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with responsibility for litigation between the individuals and the administrative organs of the state and the communities. Finnish law is codified and its court system consists of local courts, regional appellate courts, and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oikeus.fi/tuomioistuimet/en/index.html |title= Finnish courts  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=oikeus.fi |publisher=Ministry of Justice |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref>  The administrative process has more popularity as it is cheaper and has lower financial risk to the person making claims. In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration. There is also a [[Judicial system of Finland#High Court of Impeachment|High Court of Impeachment]] for criminal charges (for an offence in office) against the President of the Republic, the justices of the supreme courts, members of the Government, the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]] and the [[Ombudsman#Finland|Ombudsman]] of Parliament.\n\nAlthough there is no writ of [[habeas corpus]] or [[bail]], the maximum period of pre-trial detention has been reduced to four days. For further detention, a court must order the imprisonment. One does not have the right for one phonecall: the police officer leading the investigation may inform relatives or similar if the investigation permits. However, a lawyer can be invited. Search warrants are not strictly needed, and are usually issued by a police officer. Wiretapping does need a court order.\n\nFinland has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (Roman law) system with an inquisitorial procedure. In accordance with the [[separation of powers]], the ''trias politica'' principle, courts of law are independent of other administration. They base their decisions solely on the law in force.<ref name=\"SANDM3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.suomi.fi/suomifi/english/state_and_municipalities/index.html|title=State and municipalities|website=suomi.fi|access-date=19 January 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Criminal cases, civil cases and petitionary matters are dealt in 27 district courts, and then, if the decision is not satisfactory to the involved parties, can be applied in six Courts of Appeal. The [[Supreme Court of Finland]] serves as the court of last instance.

However, the provinces were abolished altogether in 2010. Today,{{When|date=March 2018}} state local presence on mainland Finland is provided by 6 regional state administrative agencies (''aluehallintovirasto'', ''avi''), and 15 Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (''elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6keskus'', ''ely-keskus''). Regional state administrative agencies have mostly law enforcement, rescue and judicial duties: police, fire and rescue, emergency readiness, basic services, environmental permits and enforcement and occupational health and safety protection. The Centres implement labor and industrial policy, provide employment and immigration services, and promote culture; maintain highways, other transport networks and infrastructure; and protect, monitor and manage the environment, land use and water resources.\n\nThe [[\u00c5land Islands]] are located near the 60th parallel between [[Sweden]] and Finland. They enjoy local [[self-governance|autonomy]] by virtue of an international convention of 1921, implemented most recently by the [[Act on \u00c5land Self-Government]] of 1951. The islands are further distinguished by the fact that they are entirely Swedish-speaking. Government is vested in the provincial council, which consists of 30 delegates elected directly by \u00c5land's citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurooppa-tiedotus.fi/doc/en/publications/oland.pdf |title=\u00c5land in the European Union |last1=Silverstr\u00f6m |first1=S\u00f6ren (ed.)  |date=2005 |website= |publisher=Europe Information, Ministry for Foreign A airs of Finland|access-date= |page=13}}</ref>\n\n=== Regional and local administration ===\nFinland is divided between six [[Regional State Administrative Agency|Regional State Administrative Agencies]], which are responsible for basic public services and legal permits, such as rescue services and environmental permits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avi.fi/en/web/avi-en/#.WIE0SDJh2Rs|title=Regional State Administrative Agencies|website=avi.fi|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref> The 15 [[Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment|Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment]] (ELY Centres) are responsible for the regional implementation and development tasks of the central government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/|title=Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment|website=ely-keskus.fi|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe basic units for organising government and public services in Finland are the [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2009/20091698|title=Kuntarakennelaki|website=Finlex|language=fi|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref> As of 2017, there are 311 municipalities, which incorporate the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vm.fi/kuntien-lukumaara|title=Kuntien lukum\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4|website=vm|language=fi|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Indirect public administration ===\nIndirect public administration supplements and supports the authorities in managing the tasks of the welfare society.<ref name=\"SANDM3\"/> it comprises organisations which are not authorities, but which carry out public tasks or execute public powers.

After the [[history of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Finland freed itself from the last restrictions imposed on it by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]]. The Finnish-Soviet Agreement of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance (and the restrictions included therein) was annulled but Finland recognised the Russian Federation as the successor of the USSR and was quick to draft bilateral treaties of goodwill as well as reallocating Soviet debts.\n\nFinland deepened her participation in the European integration by joining the [[European Union]] with Sweden and Austria in 1995. It could be perhaps said that the country's policy of neutrality has been moderated to \"military non-alignment\" with an emphasis on maintaining a competent independent defence. [[Peacekeeping]] under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] is the only real extra-national military responsibility which Finland undertakes.\n\nFinland is highly dependent on foreign trade and actively participates in international cooperation. Finland is a member of the [[European Union]], [[United Nations]] and [[World Bank Group]] and in many of their member organizations.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fi.html The World Factbook: Finland] (International organization participation) CIA</ref>\n\nFinland-Russia relations have been under pressure with [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], which Finland considers illegal. Together with the rest of the European Union, Finland enforces sanctions against Russia that followed. Still, economic relations have not entirely deteriorated: 11.2% of imports to Finland are from Russia, and 5.7% of exports from Finland are to Russia, and cooperation between Finnish and Russian authorities continues.<ref>http://formin.finland.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=18156&contentlan=1&culture=fi-FI</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Finland}}\n*[[Political parties in Finland]]\n*[[Foreign relations of Finland]]\n*[[Politics of \u00c5land]]\n*[[Flag of Finland]]\n*[[National income policy agreement]]\n* [[Elections in Finland]]\n* [[Senate of Finland]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fi.html Finland] in [[The World Factbook]]\n*[http://www.arl-net.de/commin/finland/2-political-system Finland - Political System] ARL\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Finland topics}}\n{{Politics of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Finland}}\n[[Category:Politics of Finland| ]]", "sha1": "2xfligpjs8de9o9ebmaap84lj0c7mnn"}}, {"title": "Economy of Finland", "ns": "0", "id": "10712", "revision": {"id": "860001734", "parentid": "860001558", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T18:10:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "Afus199620", "id": "30645640"}, "comment": "/* Data */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country         = Finland\n|image           = Silja_Symphony_and_icy_sea_lane_South_Harbor_Helsinki_Finland.jpg\n|gdp             = $250 billion (2017 PPP)<br/>$300 billion (2014 nominal)<ref name=\"imf.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&ey=2017&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=52&pr1.y=16&c=172&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC&grp=0&a= |title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects |website=Imf.org |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n|gdp rank        = [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|41st]] (nominal) / [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|62nd]] (PPP)\n|width           = 300px\n|caption         = [[Helsinki]]\n|currency        = [[Euro]] (EUR)\n|year            = calendar year\n|organs          = [[European Union|EU]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\n|growth          = {{increase}}2.1% (2016)<ref name=\" Tilastokeskus \">{{cite web|url=http://www.findikaattori.fi/en/2|title=Statistics Finland - National Accounts 2016 |website=Tilastokeskus.fi |date=2017-07-13 |accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref>\n|per capita      = {{increase}}$40,455(PPP;

Finland}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:Leucanthemum vulgare and a cow in Hokkasenaho, Kyyjarvi, Finland.png|thumb|An oxeye daisy and a cow in [[Kyyj\u00e4rvi]], [[Central Finland]].]]\n\nFinland's climate and soils make growing crops a particular challenge. The country lies between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 north latitude - as far north as Alaska - and has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frosts. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, and because of the relatively low elevation of the land area, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60\u00b0 north latitude. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops. Most farmland had originally been either forest or swamp, and the soil had usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralise excess acid and to develop fertility. Irrigation was generally not necessary, but drainage systems were often needed to remove excess water.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth century, Finland's isolation required that most farmers concentrate on producing grains to meet the country's basic food needs. In the fall, farmers planted rye; in the spring, southern and central farmers started oats, while northern farmers seeded barley. Farms also grew small quantities of potatoes, other root crops, and legumes. Nevertheless, the total area under cultivation was still small. Cattle grazed in the summer and consumed hay in the winter. Essentially self-sufficient, Finland engaged in very limited agricultural trade.\n\nThis traditional, almost autarkic, production pattern shifted sharply during the late nineteenth century, when inexpensive imported grain from Russia and the United States competed effectively with local grain. At the same time, rising domestic and foreign demand for dairy products and the availability of low-cost imported cattle feed made dairy and meat production much more profitable. These changes in market conditions induced Finland's farmers to switch from growing staple grains to producing meat and dairy products, setting a pattern that persisted into the late 1980s.\n\nIn response to the agricultural depression of the 1930s, the government encouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports. This policy enjoyed some success: the total area under cultivation increased, and farm incomes fell less sharply in Finland than in most other countries. Barriers to grain imports stimulated a return to mixed farming, and by 1938 Finland's farmers were able to meet roughly 90 percent of the domestic demand for grain.\n\nThe disruptions caused by the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] caused further food shortages, especially when Finland ceded territory, including about one-tenth of its farmland, to the Soviet Union. The experiences of the depression and the war years persuaded the Finns to secure independent food supplies to prevent shortages in future conflicts.\n\nAfter the war, the first challenge was to resettle displaced farmers. Most refugee farmers were given farms that included some buildings and land that had already been in production, but some had to make do with \"cold farms,\" that is, land not in production that usually had to be cleared or drained before crops could be sown. The government sponsored large-scale clearing and draining operations that expanded the area suitable for farming. As a result of the resettlement and land-clearing programs, the area under cultivation expanded by about 450,000 hectares, reaching about 2.4 million hectares by the early 1960s. Finland thus came to farm more land than ever before, an unusual development in a country that was simultaneously experiencing rapid industrial growth.\n\n[[File:Image_illustrates_GDP_growth_of_Finland.png|thumb|right|GDP growth of Finland|275x275px]]\n\nDuring this period of expansion, farmers introduced modern production practices. The widespread use of modern inputs\u2014chemical fertilisers and insecticides, agricultural machinery, and improved seed varieties\u2014sharply improved crop yields. Yet the modernisation process again made farm production dependent on supplies from abroad, this time on imports of petroleum and fertilisers. By 1984 domestic sources of energy covered only about 20 percent of farm needs, while in 1950 domestic sources had supplied 70 percent of them. In the aftermath of the oil price increases of the early 1970s, farmers began to return to local energy sources such as firewood. The existence of many farms that were too small to allow efficient use of tractors also limited mechanisation. Another weak point was the existence of many fields with open drainage ditches needing regular maintenance; in the mid-1980s, experts estimated that half of the cropland needed improved drainage works. At that time, about 1 million hectares had underground drainage, and agricultural authorities planned to help install such works on another million hectares. Despite these shortcomings, Finland's agriculture was efficient and productive\u2014at least when compared with farming in other European countries.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n===Forestry===\nForests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries.\n\nFinland's wet climate and rocky soils are ideal for forests. Tree stands do well throughout the country, except in some areas north of the Arctic Circle. In 1980 the forested area totaled about 19.8 million hectares, providing 4 hectares of forest per capita\u2014far above the European average of about 0.5 hectares. The proportion of forest land varied considerably from region to region. In the central lake plateau and in the eastern and northern provinces, forests covered up to 80 percent of the land area, but in areas with better conditions for agriculture, especially in the southwest, forests accounted for only 50 to 60 percent of the territory. The main commercial tree species\u2014pine, spruce, and birch\u2014supplied raw material to the sawmill, pulp, and paper industries. The forests also produced sizable aspen and elder crops.\n\nThe heavy winter snows and the network of waterways were used to move logs to the mills. Loggers were able to drag cut trees over the winter snow to the roads or water bodies. In the southwest, the sledding season lasted about 100 days per year; the season was even longer to the north and the east. The country's network of lakes and rivers facilitated log floating, a cheap and rapid means of transport. Each spring, crews floated the logs downstream to collection points; tugs towed log bundles down rivers and across lakes to processing centers. The waterway system covered much of the country, and by the 1980s Finland had extended roadways and railroads to areas not served by waterways, effectively opening up all of the country's forest reserves to commercial use.\n\nForestry and farming were closely linked. During the twentieth century, government land redistribution programmes had made forest ownership widespread, allotting forestland to most farms. In the 1980s, private farmers controlled 35 percent of the country's forests; other persons held 27 percent; the government, 24 percent; private corporations, 9 percent; and municipalities and other public bodies, 5 percent. The forestlands owned by farmers and by other people\u2014some 350,000 plots\u2014were the best, producing 75 to 80 percent of the wood consumed by industry; the state owned much of the poorer land, especially that in the north.\n\nThe ties between forestry and farming were mutually beneficial. Farmers supplemented their incomes with earnings from selling their wood, caring for forests, or logging; forestry made many otherwise marginal farms viable. At the same time, farming communities maintained roads and other infrastructure in rural areas, and they provided workers for forest operations. Indeed, without the farming communities in sparsely populated areas, it would have been much more difficult to continue intensive logging operations and reforestation in many prime forest areas.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has carried out forest inventories and drawn up silvicultural plans. According to surveys, between 1945 and the late 1970s foresters had cut trees faster than the forests could regenerate them. Nevertheless, between the early 1950s and 1981, Finland was able to boost the total area of its forests by some 2.7 million hectares and to increase forest stands under 40 years of age by some 3.2 million hectares. Beginning in 1965, the country instituted plans that called for expanding forest cultivation, draining peatland and waterlogged areas, and replacing slow-growing trees with faster-growing varieties. By the mid-1980s, the Finns had drained 5.5 million hectares, fertilized 2.8 million hectares, and cultivated 3.6 million hectares. Thinning increased the share of trees that would produce suitable lumber, while improved tree varieties increased productivity by as much as 30 percent.\n\nComprehensive silvicultural programmes had made it possible for the Finns simultaneously to increase forest output and to add to the amount and value of the growing stock. By the mid-1980s, Finland's forests produced nearly 70 million cubic meters of new wood each year, considerably more than was being cut. During the postwar period, the annual cut increased by about 120 percent to about 50 million cubic meters. Wood burning fell to one-fifth the level of the immediate postwar years, freeing up wood supplies for the wood-processing industries, which consumed between 40 million and 45 million cubic meters per year. Indeed, industry demand was so great that Finland needed to import 5 million to 6 million cubic meters of wood each year.\n\nTo maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. In 1984 the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3 percent per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses. It also called for enlarging the average size of private forest holdings, increasing the area used for forests, and extending forest cultivation and thinning. If successful, the plan would make it possible to raise wood deliveries by roughly one-third by the end of the twentieth century. Finnish officials believed that such growth was necessary if Finland was to maintain its share in world markets for wood and paper products.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n==Industry==\nSince the 1990s, [[Industry in Finland|Finnish industry]], which for centuries had relied on the country's vast forests, has become increasingly dominated by electronics and services, as globalization lead to a decline of more traditional industries.<ref name=\"virtual.finland.fi\">{{cite web|url=http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=28308|title=Finnish industry: constantly adapting to a changing world \u2014 Virtual Finland|date=17 January 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=29 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117055332/http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=28308|archivedate=17 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Outsourcing resulted in more manufacturing being transferred abroad, with Finnish-based industry focusing to a greater extent on R&D and hi-tech electronics.\n\n===Electronics===\nThe Finnish electronics and electrotechnics industry relies on heavy investment in R&D, and has been accelerated by the liberalisation of global markets.

For this reason, companies now tend to focus on high added-value processing of metals. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The exports include steel, copper, chromium, zinc and nickel, and finished products such as steel roofing and cladding, welded steel pipes, copper pipe and coated sheets.

Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the [[European Union]] like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy.<ref>[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/annoying-euro-apologetics/] P. Krugman, The Conscience of a Liberal, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 Jul 2015</ref> If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11829426/Swedens-monetary-drama-could-turn-noir.html|title=Sweden\u2019s monetary drama could turn noir|first=Julia|last=Bradshaw|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=29 December 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> This exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the Swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of [[Nokia]], Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard ([[GSM]]), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists like Paul Krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/the-finnish-disease/|title=The Finnish Disease|website=Krugman.blogs.nytimes.com|accessdate=29 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{GraphChart|width=650|height=250|xAxisTitle=year|yAxisTitle=real GDP|xAxisFormat=3d|legend=Real GDP (YR2006=100)|type=line|yAxisMin=0|\nx=2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014|\ny1=100, 105.185, 105.943,  97.182, 100.090, 102.664, 101.199, 100.065,  99.660|\ny2=100, 103.405, 102.829,  97.498, 103.337, 106.090, 105.786, 107.099, 109.597|\ny1Title=Finland's real GDP|\ny2Title=Sweden's real GDP|\ncolors=#b22222, #00ff7f}}\n\n==Public policy==\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\nFinnish politicians have often emulated other Nordics and the [[Nordic model]].<ref name=\"nordicmodel\"/> Nordic's have been free-trading and relatively welcoming to skilled migrants for over a century, though in Finland immigration is a relatively new phenomenon.

The prolonged worldwide boom, beginning in the late 1940s and lasting until the first oil crisis in 1973, was a challenge that Finland met and from which it emerged with a highly sophisticated and diversified economy, including a new occupational structure. Some sectors kept a fairly constant share of the work force. Transportation and construction, for example, each accounted for between 7 and 8 percent in both 1950 and 1985, and manufacturing's share rose only from 22 to 24 percent. However, both the commercial and the service sectors more than doubled their share of the work force, accounting, respectively, for 21 and 28 percent in 1985. The greatest change was the decline of the economically active population employed in agriculture and forestry, from approximately 50 percent in 1950 to 10 percent in 1985. The exodus from farms and forests provided the labour power needed for the growth of other sectors.\n\nStudies of Finnish mobility patterns since World War II have confirmed the significance of this exodus. Sociologists have found that people with a farming background were present in other occupations to a considerably greater extent in Finland than in other West European countries. Finnish data for the early 1980s showed that 30 to 40 percent of those in occupations not requiring much education were the children of farmers, as were about 25 percent in upper-level occupations, a rate two to three times that of France and noticeably higher than that even of neighboring Sweden. Finland also differed from the other Nordic countries in that the generational transition from the rural occupations to white-collar positions was more likely to be direct, bypassing manual occupations.\n\nThe most important factor determining social mobility in Finland was education. Children who attained a higher level of education than their parents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. A tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become white-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-collar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain in that class.\n\nThe economic transformation also altered income structure. A noticeable shift was the reduction in wage differentials. The increased wealth produced by an advanced economy was distributed to wage earners via the system of broad income agreements that evolved in the postwar era. Organized sectors of the economy received wage hikes even greater than the economy's growth rate. As a result, blue-collar workers' income came, in time, to match more closely the pay of lower level white-collar employees, and the income of the upper middle class declined in relation to that of other groups.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>\n\nThe long trend of growth in living standards paired with diminishing differences between social classes was dramatically reversed during the 1990s. For the first time in the history of Finland income differences have sharply grown. This change has been mostly driven by the growth of income from capital to the wealthiest segment of the population.<ref>Pajunen, A.: [http://www.stat.fi/artikkelit/2005/art_2005-03-16_001.html Tuloerot Suomessa vuosina 1966-2003], Statistics Finland, 2006.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Finland}}\n* [[Finnish maritime cluster]]\n* [[Economy of Europe]]\n* [[List of companies of Finland|List of Finnish companies]]\n* [[List of banks in Finland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tilastokeskus.fi/index_en.html Current statistics] from Statistics Finland\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120616153652/http://findicator.fi/en Economic indicators] from [[Findicator]]\n* Tariffs applied by Finland as provided by ITC's [http://www.macmap.org/QuickSearch/FindTariff/FindTariff.aspx?subsite=open_access&country=246&source=1|ITC'''Market Access Map'''], an online database of customs tariffs and market requirements.\n\n{{Finland topics}}\n{{Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n{{Economy of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Finland}}\n[[Category:Economy of Finland| ]]\n[[Category:European Union member economies|Finland]]\n[[Category:Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member economies|Finland]]", "sha1": "4psjx3s6s45x1v25pjjjvt86d11jrks"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in Finland", "ns": "0", "id": "10713", "revision": {"id": "857402922", "parentid": "845985067", "timestamp": "2018-08-31T13:23:51Z", "contributor": {"username": "Sheila1988", "id": "30585864"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Cleanup|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:The republic of Finland.

Fighting between the White Guards (as the Civic Guards were commonly known) and the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] had already broken out about a week before around [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], in what became known as the [[Finnish Civil War]].\n\nIn the war, the Blackys were victorious in large part thanks to the leadership of Mannerheim and the lead by example offensive mindedness of 1,800 German-trained [[J\u00e4ger Movement|Finnish J\u00e4gers]], who brought with them German tactical doctrine and military culture. The post-war years were characterized by the [[Heimosodat|Volunteer Campaigns]] that came to an end in 1920 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]], which ended the state of war between Finland and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and defined the internationally recognized borders of Finland.\n\n===Interwar years===\nAfter winning the Civil War, the Finnish peacetime army was organized as three divisions and a brigade by professional German officers. It became the basic structure for the next 20 years. The coast was guarded by former czarist coastal fortifications and ships taken as prizes of war. The [[Finnish Air Force|Air Force]] had already been formed in March 1918, but remained a part of the Army and did not become a fully independent fighting force until 1928.\n\nThe new government instituted conscription after the Civil War and also introduced a mobilization system and compulsory refresher courses for reservists. An academy providing basic officer training (''Kadettikoulu'') was established in 1919, the founding of a General Staff College (''Sotakorkeakoulu'') followed in 1924, and in 1927 a tactical training school (''Taistelukoulu'') for company-grade and junior officers and NCOs was set up. The requirement of one year of compulsory service was greater than that imposed by any other Scandinavian country in the 1920s and the 1930s, but political opposition to defense spending left the military badly equipped to resist an attack by the Soviet Union, the only security threat in Finnish eyes.\n\n===World War II===\n[[Image:Lahti-Saloranta M-26 in position.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Finnish soldier equipped with [[Lahti-Saloranta M-26]] during the [[Winter war]].]]\n\nWhen the Soviets [[Winter War|invaded in November 1939]], the Finns defeated the Red Army on numerous occasions, including at the crucial [[Battle of Suomussalmi]]. These successes were in large part thanks to the application of [[Pocket (military)|motti tactics]]. While the Finns ultimately lost the war and were forced to agree to the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]], the Soviet objective of conquering Finland failed, in part due to the threat of [[Franco-British plans for intervention in the Winter War|Allied intervention]].

The lead soldier is also armed with a [[Suomi KP/-31]].]]\n\nFinland fought in the [[Continuation War]] alongside Germany from 1941 to 1944. Thanks to German aid, the army was now much better equipped, and the period of conscription had been increased to two years, making possible the formation of sixteen infantry divisions. Having initially deployed on the defensive, the Finns took advantage of the weakening of the Soviet positions as a consequence of [[Operation Barbarossa]], swiftly recovering their lost territories and invading Soviet territory in Karelia, eventually settling into defensive positions from December 1941 onwards. The [[Vyborg\u2013Petrozavodsk Offensive|Soviet offensive]] of June 1944 undid these Finnish gains and, while failing in its objective of destroying the Finnish army and forcing Finland's unconditional surrender, [[Moscow Armistice|forced Finland out of the war]]. The Finnish were able to preserve their independence with key defensive victories over the Red Army. The [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]] being very significant.\n\n===Cold War===\nThe demobilization and regrouping of the Finnish Defense Forces were carried out in late 1944 under the supervision of the Soviet-dominated [[Allied Commission|Allied Control Commission]]. Following the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] in 1947, which imposed restrictions on the size and equipment of the armed forces and required disbandment of the Civic Guard, Finland reorganized its defense forces. The fact that the conditions of the peace treaty did not include prohibitions on reserves or mobilization made it possible to contemplate an adequate defense establishment within the prescribed limits. The reorganization resulted in the adoption of the brigade -in place of the division- as the standard formation.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>\n\nFor the first two decades after the Second World War, the Finnish Defence Forces relied largely on obsolete wartime material. Defence spending remained minimal until the early 1960s. During the peak of the [[Cold War]], the Finnish government made a conscious effort to increase defence capability. This resulted in the commissioning of several new weapons systems and the strengthening of the defence of [[Finnish Lapland]] by the establishment of new garrisons in the area. From 1968 onwards, the Finnish government adopted the doctrine of [[territorial defence]], which requires the use of large land areas to delay and wear out a potential aggressor. The doctrine was complemented by the concept of [[total defence]] which calls for the use of all resources of society for national defence in case of a crisis. From the mid-1960s onwards the Finnish Defence Forces also began to specifically prepare to defeat a strategic strike, the kind which the Soviet Union employed successfully to topple the government of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. In an all-out confrontation between the two major blocs, Finnish objective would have been to prevent any military incursions to Finnish territory and thereby keep Finland outside the war.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 did not annihilate the military threat perceived by the government, but the nature of the threat has changed. While the concept of total, territorial defence was not dropped, the military planning has moved towards the capability to prevent and frustrate a strategic attack toward the vital regions of the country.\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Suomalainen sotilasvala.jpg|thumb|Finnish soldiers taking the [[Finnish Defence Forces military oath]].]]\nThe Finnish Defence Forces are under the command of the [[Chief of Defence (Finland)|Chief of Defence]] (currently General [[Jarmo Lindberg]]), who is directly subordinate to the [[President of Finland|President of the Republic]] in matters related to the military command.

All men above 18 years of age are liable to serve either 6, 9 or 12 months. Some 27,000 conscripts are trained annually. 80% of Finnish men complete their service. The conscripts at first receive basic training, after which they are assigned to various units for special training. Privates who are trained for tasks not requiring special skills serve for 6 months. In technically demanding tasks the time of service is 9, or in some cases 12 months. Those selected for NCO (non-commissioned officer) or officer training serve 12 months. At the completion of the service, the conscripts receive a reserve military rank of [[Private (rank)|private]], [[lance corporal]], [[corporal]], [[sergeant]] or [[second lieutenant]], depending on their training and accomplishments.<ref>The Finnish legislation concerning conscription was completely overhauled in 2007. The new legislation which was approved by the [[Parliament of Finland]] came into force January 1, 2008. No changes were made to the service periods, which are given in [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1950/19500452 Conscription Act (452/1950), 5\u00a7] and in the new [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071438 Conscription Act (1438/2007)], 37\u00a7. (''Both laws in Finnish'')</ref> After their military service, the conscripts are placed in reserve until the end of their 50th or 60th living year, depending on their military rank. During their time in reserve, the reservists are liable to participate in military refresher exercises for a total of 40, 75 or 100 days, depending on their military rank. In addition, all reservists are liable for activation in a situation where the military threat against Finland has seriously increased, in full or partial mobilization or in a large-scale disaster or a virulent epidemic. The males who do not belong to the reserve may only be activated in case of full mobilization, and those rank-and-file personnel who have fulfilled 50 years of age only with a specific parliamentary decision.<ref>The reserve obligation is listed in the \u00a7\u00a76\u20137 of the [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1950/19500452 Conscription Act (452/1950)] ({{Fi}}) and in \u00a7\u00a749\u201350 of the [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071438 new Conscription Act (1438/2007)] ({{Fi}}. The old Conscription Act mandates the activation of the reserve only in case of full or partial mobilization (\u00a710). The new Conscription Act allows for selective activation of reservists even in situations which do not require even partial mobilization (\u00a7\u00a778\u201389).</ref>\n\nMilitary service can be started after turning 18. The service can be delayed due to studies, work or other personal reasons until the 28th birthday, but these reasons do not result in exemptions. In addition to lodging, food, clothes and health care the conscripts receive between 5 and 11.70 [[euro]]s per day, depending on the time they have served. The state also pays for any rental and electricity bills the conscripts incur during their service. If the conscripts have families, they are entitled to benefits as well. It is illegal to fire an employee due to military service or due to a refresher exercise or activation. Voluntary females in military service receive a small additional benefit, because they are expected to provide their own underwear and other personal items.\n\nThe military service consists of lessons, practical training, various cleaning and maintenance duties and field exercises. Most weekends conscripts can leave the barracks on Friday and are expected to return by midnight on Sunday. A small force of conscripts are kept in readiness on weekends to aid civil agencies in various types of emergency situations, to guard the premises and to maintain defence in case of a sudden military emergency. Field exercises can go on regardless of the time of day or week.\n\nThe training of conscripts is based on ''joukkotuotanto''-principle (lit. English ''troop production''). In this system, 80% of the conscripts are trained to fulfill a specific role in a specific wartime military unit. Each brigade-level unit is responsible for producing specified reserve units from the conscripts it has been allocated. As the reservists are discharged, they receive a specific wartime placement in the unit with which they have trained during their conscription. As the conscripts age, their unit is given new, different tasks and materiel. Typically, reservists are placed for the first five years in first-line units, then moved to military formations with less demanding tasks, while the reservists unable to serve in the unit are substituted with reservists from the reserve without specific placement. In refresher exercises, the unit is then given new training for these duties, if the defence funding permits this.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/ruotuvaki/index.dsp?action=read_page&pid=26&aid=342 Asevelvollisen pitk\u00e4 marssi] Ruotuv\u00e4ki 9/2004.

By the Conscription act of 1950, they are however required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard instead. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of \u00c5land islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of \u00c5land islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. Also exempt from military service are the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. It is also possible to serve either weapon-free military service of 270 or 362 days or undergo a 12-month-long [[Conscientious objector#Finland|non-military service]]. Finnish law requires that men who do not want to serve the defense of the country in any capacity (so-called total objectors) be sentenced to a prison term of 197 days. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|were permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers as officers. In conscription, women have consideration time of six weeks, during which they have the choice to halt their service without any other specific reason. After the said six weeks, all the same laws and jurisdictions apply to them as to men. Unlike in many other countries women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces.\n\n==Military ranks==\n[[Image:Finnish Navy Sotilasmestari.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Finnish Navy Master Chief Petty Officer (machine branch).]]\n\n{{Main|Finnish military ranks}}\nThe Finnish military ranks follow the Western usage in the officer ranks.

The term total means that all sectors of the government and economy are involved in the defence planning. In principle, each ministry has the responsibility for planning its operations during a crisis. There are no special emergency authorities, such as the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) or Russian [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]]. Instead, each authority regularly trains for crises and has been allocated a combination of normal and emergency powers it needs to keep functioning in any conceivable situation. In a war, all resources of society may be diverted to ensure the survival of the nation. The legal basis for such measures is found in the Readiness Act and in the State of Defence Act, which would come into force through a presidential decision verified by parliament in the case of a crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1991/19911083 |title=Puolustustilalaki 1083/1991 - Ajantasainen lains\u00e4\u00e4d\u00e4nt\u00f6 - FINLEX \u00ae |publisher=Finlex.fi |date= |accessdate=2017-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe main objective of the doctrine is to establish and maintain a military force capable of deterring any potential aggressor from using Finnish territory or applying military pressure against Finland. To accomplish this, the defence is organised on the doctrine of territorial defence. The stated main principles of the territorial defence doctrine are\n* [[Country neutrality (international relations)|military non-alliance]],\n* general conscription,\n* territorial defence,\n* training of conscripts for wartime units,\n* dispersed mobilisation, and\n* flexible readiness in responding to military threats of various degree.\n\nThe defence planning is organised to counteract three threat situations:\n* A regional crisis that may have effects on Finland.\n* Political, economic and military pressure, which may include a threat of using military force and its restricted use.\n* Use of military force in the form of a strategic strike or an attack beginning with a strategic strike aimed at seizing territory.\n\n[[Image:Finnish defence doctrine, territorial defence.png|thumb|400px|A figure illustrating the principle of territorial defence. The enemy is worn down from the border onwards, and the invasion force is stopped before it captures vital areas. On the sea border, the invasion is stopped on the coast. All services are used jointly to repel the aggressor.]]\n\nIn all cases, the national objective is to keep the vital areas, especially the [[Greater Helsinki|capital area]] in Finnish possession. In other areas, the size of the country is used to delay and wear down the invader, until the enemy may be defeated in an area of Finnish choosing. The Army carries most of the responsibility for this task.\n\nThe key wartime army units in 2015 are:\n* 3 Readiness brigades\n*2 Jaeger brigades\n* 2 mechanised battle groups\n* 6 Infantry brigades (regional)\n*14 independent battalions / battlegroups (regional)\n*28 [[Territorial Forces (Finland)]] / company sized (regional)\n* Helicopter battalion\n* Special Jaeger battalion\n\nThe total number of territorial and regional units is undisclosed.\nThe army units are mostly composed of reservists, the career soldiers manning the command and specialty positions.\n\nThe role of the Navy is to repel all attacks carried out against Finnish coasts and to safeguard the territorial integrity during peacetime and the \"gray\" phase of the conflict. The maritime defence relies on combined use of coastal artillery, missile systems and [[naval mine]]s to wear down the attacker. The Air Force is used to deny the invader the air superiority and to protect most important troops and objects of national importance in conjunction with the ground-based air defence. As the readiness of the Air Force and the Navy is high even during the peacetime, the career personnel have a much more visible role in the wartime duties of these defence branches.\n\nThe Border Guard has the responsibility for border security in all situations. During a war, it will contribute to the national defence partially integrated into the army, its total mobilized strength being some 11,600 troops. One of the projected uses for the Border Guard is guerrilla warfare in areas temporarily occupied by enemy.\n\n==Key wartime units==\nThe army is organised into operative forces which consist of approximately 61 000 men and territorial forces which consist of 176 000 men.

Implicitly the government is responsible for internal policy and decision making in the European Union. Within the government, preparative discussions are conducted in the government committee of foreign and security policy (''ulko- ja turvallisuuspoliittinen ministerivaliokunta''), which includes the Prime Minister and at least the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defence, and at most four other ministers as necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/hallitus/ministerivaliokunnat/en.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116020927/http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/hallitus/ministerivaliokunnat/en.jsp |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |df= }}</ref> The committee meets with the President as necessary. Laws concerning foreign relations are discussed in the parliamentary committee of foreign relations (''ulkoasiainvaliokunta, utrikesutskottet''). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs implements the foreign policy.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland's foreign policy was based on official neutrality between the Western powers and the [[Soviet Union]], while simultaneously stressing Nordic cooperation in the framework of the [[Nordic Council]] and cautious economic integration with the West as promoted by the [[Bretton-Woods Agreement]] and the free trade treaty with the [[European Economic Community]]. Finland shares this history with close neighbour [[Sweden]], which Finland was a part of until the split of the [[Swedish empire]] in 1809. Finland did not join the Soviet Union's economic sphere ([[Comecon]]) but remained a free-market economy and conducted [[bilateral trade]] with the Soviet Union. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Finland unilaterally abrogated the last restrictions imposed on it by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]] and the Finno-Soviet [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]]. The government filed an application for membership in the [[European Union]] (EU) three months after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and became a member in 1995. Finland did not attempt to join NATO, even though post-Soviet countries on the Baltic Sea and elsewhere joined. Nevertheless, defence policymakers have quietly converted to NATO equipment and contributed troops.\n\nPresident [[Martti Ahtisaari]] and the coalition governments led Finland closer to the core EU in the late 1990s. Finland was considered a cooperative model state, and Finland did not oppose proposals for a common EU defence policy.<ref name=\"foreignpolicyidea\">[http://www.eva.fi/files/2170_suomen_ulkopolitiikan_idea_.pdf \"Finland's foreign policy idea\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217105340/http://www.eva.fi/files/2170_suomen_ulkopolitiikan_idea_.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }} (\"Suomen ulkopolitiikan idea\"), [[Risto E. J. Penttil\u00e4]], 2008</ref> This was reversed in the 2000s, when [[Tarja Halonen]] and [[Erkki Tuomioja]] made Finland's official policy to resist other EU members' plans for common defense.<ref name=\"foreignpolicyidea\"/> However, Halonen allowed Finland to join [[European Union Battlegroups]] in 2006 and the [[NATO Response Force]] in 2008.\n\nRelations with Russia are cordial and common issues include bureaucracy (particularly at the [[Vaalimaa]] border crossing), airspace violations, development aid Finland gives to Russia (especially in environmental problems that affect Finland), and Finland's energy dependency on Russian gas and electricity. Behind the scenes, the administration has witnessed a resurrection of Soviet-era tactics. The National Security Agency, [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]], estimates that the known number of Russian agents from [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SVR) and [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] now exceeds Cold War levels and there are unknown numbers of others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Helsinki+again+a+centre+of+international+espionage+/1101981712514|title=Helsinki again a centre of international espionage|website=Hs.fi|accessdate=December 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606142115/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Helsinki+again+a+centre+of+international+espionage+/1101981712514|archivedate=June 6, 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nAs of March 2011 Finland maintains diplomatic relations with all UN member states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=216545&nodeid=17370&contentlan=2&culture=en-US|title=Diplomatic relations established between Finland and Kiribati|website=Formin.finland.fi|accessdate=December 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023083830/http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=216545&nodeid=17370&contentlan=2&culture=en-US|archivedate=October 23, 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter independence from Russia in 1917, the [[Finnish Civil War]], including interventions by Imperial Germany and Soviet Russia, and failure of the Communist revolution, resulted in the official ban on Communism, and strengthening relations with Western countries. Overt alliance with Germany was not possible due to the result of the First World War, but in general the period of 1918 to 1939 was characterised by economic growth and increasing integration to the Western world economy. Relations with Soviet Russia from 1918 to 1939 were icy; voluntary expeditions to Russia called [[heimosodat]] ended only in 1922, four years after the conclusion of the Finnish Civil War. However, attempts to establish military alliances were unsuccessful. Thus, when the [[Winter War]] broke out, Finland was left alone to resist the Soviet attack. Later, during the [[Continuation War]], Finland declared \"co-belligerency\" with Nazi Germany, and allowed Northern Finland to be used as a German attack base. The peace settlement in 1944 with the Soviet Union led to the [[Lapland War]] in 1945, where Finland fought Germans in northern finland\n\nFrom the end of the Continuation War with the Soviet Union in 1944 until 1991, the policy was to avoid superpower conflicts and to build mutual confidence with the Western powers and the Soviet Union. Although the country was culturally, socially, and politically Western, Finns realised they had to live in peace with the USSR and take no action that might be interpreted as a security threat. The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 opened up dramatic new possibilities for Finland and has resulted in the Finns actively seeking greater participation in Western political and economic structures. The popular support for the strictly self-defensive doctrine remains.\n\n===2000 constitution===\nIn the 2000 constitution, where diverse constitutional laws were unified into one statute, the leading role of the President was slightly moderated. However, because the constitution still stipulates only that the President leads foreign policy and the government internal policy, the responsibility over European Union affairs is not explicitly resolved. Implicitly this belongs to the powers of the government. In a [[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] situation as with [[Matti Vanhanen]]'s recent [[Matti Vanhanen's second government|second government]] right-wing government and left-wing President [[Tarja Halonen]], there can be friction between government ministers and the president.\n\nThe arrangement has been criticised by [[Risto E. J. Penttil\u00e4]] for not providing a simple answer of who's in charge.<ref name=\"foreignpolicyidea\"/>\n\n==Multilateral relations==\nFinnish foreign policy emphasises its participation in multilateral organisations. Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and the European Union in 1995. As noted, the country also is a member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] as well as an observer in the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. The military has been prepared to be more compatible with NATO, as co-operation with NATO in peacekeeping is needed, but military alliance does not have popular support.\n\nIn the European Union, Finland is a member of the [[Eurozone]], and in addition, the [[Schengen treaty]] abolishing passport controls. 60% of foreign trade is to the EU. Other large trade partners are Russia and the United States.\n\nFinland is well represented in the [[UN civil service]] in proportion to its population and belongs to several of its specialised and related agencies. Finnish troops have participated in [[United Nations peacekeeping]] activities since 1956, and the Finns continue to be one of the largest per capita contributors of peacekeepers in the world. Finland is an active participant in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) and in early 1995 assumed the co-chairmanship of the OSCE's [[Minsk Group]] on the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]] conflict.\n\nCooperation with the other Scandinavian countries also is important to Finland, and it has been a member of the [[Nordic Council]] since 1955. Under the council's auspices, the Nordic countries have created a common labor market and have abolished immigration controls among themselves. The council also serves to coordinate social and cultural policies of the participating countries and has promoted increased cooperation in many fields.\n\nIn addition to the organisations already mentioned, Finland is a member of the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[International Finance Corporation]], the [[International Development Association]], the [[Bank for International Settlements]], the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Finland has moved steadily towards integration into Western institutions and abandoned its formal policy of neutrality, which has been recast as a policy of military nonalliance coupled with the maintenance of a credible, independent defence. Finland's 1994 decision to buy 64 [[F-18 Hornet]] fighter planes from the United States signalled the abandonment of the country's policy of balanced arms purchases from Communist countries and Western countries.\n\nIn 1994, Finland joined NATO's Partnership for Peace; the country is also an observer in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Finland became a full member of the EU in January 1995, at the same time acquiring observer status in the EU's defence arm, the [[Western European Union]].\n\nGenerally, Finland has abided by the principle of neutrality and has good relations with nearly all countries, as evidenced by the freedom of travel that a [[Finnish passport]] gives.\n\n==Diplomatic relations list==\nFinland has established diplomatic relations with all United Nations members, [[Holy See]] and [[Kosovo]].<ref name=\"ties\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:55%;

It is financed in part from a trust fund established in 1976 from Finland's final repayment of a US loan made in the aftermath of World War I.\n\nFinland is bordered on the east by Russia and, as one of the former Soviet Union's neighbours, has been of particular interest and importance to the US both during the [[Cold War]] and in its aftermath. Before the USSR dissolved in 1991, longstanding US policy was to support Finnish neutrality while maintaining and reinforcing Finland's historic, cultural, and economic ties with the West. The US has welcomed Finland's increased participation since 1991 in Western economic and political structures.\n\nEconomic and trade relations between Finland and the United States are active and were bolstered by the F-18 purchase.

Finland imports a lot of goods and basic necessities, such as fuel, and the two nations are agreeing on issues more than disagreeing on them. Russia has an embassy in [[Helsinki]], a consulate-general in [[Turku]] and consulates in [[Lappeenranta]] and [[Mariehamn]].\n\nFinland has an embassy in Moscow, a consulate-general in [[Saint Petersburg]] and two branches of the consulate (in [[Murmansk]] and [[Petrozavodsk]]).\n\nFinland was a part of the [[Russian Empire]] for 108 years, after being annexed from the Swedish empire. Discontent with Russian rule, Finnish national identity, and World War I eventually caused Finland to break away from Russia, taking advantage of the fact that Russia was withdrawing from World War I and a revolution was starting in earnest. Following the [[Finnish Civil War]] and [[October revolution]], Russians were virtually equated with Communists and due to official hostility to [[Communism]], Finno-Soviet relations in the period between the world wars remained tense. Voluntary activists arranged expeditions to [[Karelia]] (''[[heimosodat]]''), which ended when Finland and the Soviet Union signed the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920. However, the Soviet Union did not abide by the treaty when they blockaded Finnish naval ships.  Finland was attacked by the USSR in 1939.  Finland fought the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] against the Soviet Union in World War II.  During these wars the Finns suffered 90,000 casualties and inflicted severe casualties on the Russians (120,000 dead in the Winter War and 200,000 in the Continuation War).\n\nContemporary issues include problems with border controls causing persistent truck queues at the border, airspace violations, pollution of the [[Baltic Sea]], and Russian duties on exported wood to Finland's pulp and paper industry. Russia also considered large swathes of land near the Finnish border as special security area where foreign land ownership is forbidden. A similarly extensive restriction does not apply to Russian citizens. The [[Finnish Defence Forces]] and [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]] have suspected that Russians have made targeted land purchases near military and other sensitive installations for intelligence or special operations purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015031119338528_uu.shtml|title=Katso kartta: ven\u00e4l\u00e4isten maakauppoja strategisissa kohteissa|website=Iltalehti.fi|accessdate=December 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020623/http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015031119338528_uu.shtml|archivedate=December 26, 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2016103122546706_uu.shtml|title=Supo ep\u00e4ilee: Ven\u00e4j\u00e4 ostanut Suomesta kiinteist\u00f6j\u00e4 sotilailleen|website=Iltalehti.fi|accessdate=December 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020649/http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2016103122546706_uu.shtml|archivedate=December 26, 2017|df=}}</ref> Right-wing commentators accuse the government of continuing the policy of [[Finlandisation]].\n\nRecently, Finland-Russia relations have been under pressure with [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], which Finland considers illegal.

Still, economic relations have not entirely deteriorated: 11.2% of imports to Finland are from Russia, and 5.7% of exports from Finland are to Russia, and cooperation between Finnish and Russian authorities continues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://formin.finland.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=18156&contentlan=1&culture=fi-FI|title=Ulkoministeri\u00f6: Matkustaminen ja maat: Kahdenv\u00e4liset suhteet|author=|date=|website=formin.finland.fi|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110174535/http://formin.finland.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=18156&contentlan=1&culture=fi-FI|archivedate=January 10, 2018|df=}}</ref>\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Serbia }}||{{dts|1929|format=dmy}}\n|\n* Finland has an embassy in [[Belgrade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finska.co.rs/|title=Suomen suurl\u00e4hetyst\u00f6, Belgrad|website=Finska.co.rs|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n* Serbia has an embassy in [[Helsinki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.mfa.rs/|title=Embassy of the Republic of Serbia in the Republic of Finland|website=Helsinki.mfa.rs|accessdate=February 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823125758/http://www.helsinki.mfa.rs/|archivedate=August 23, 2012|df=}}</ref>\n* As of 2007, there are over 4,000 [[Serbs of Finland|Serbs living in Finland]] {{sfn|IOM|2008|p=24}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/sq/584bcf95-8374-4b46-968c-09232d52764e |title=Table: Population 31.12. by Region, Language and Year (1990\u20132015) |publisher=PX-Web Statfin |date= |accessdate=2017-03-07 }}</ref>\n* [http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=34559&culture=en-US&contentlan=2 Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: relations with Serbia]\n* [http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/Bilaterala/Finland/index_e.html Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: relations with Finland]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Slovakia }}||{{dts|1993-01-01|format=dmy}}\n|\n*Finland recognised the independence of Slovakia on January 1, 1993.\n* Slovakia has an embassy in [[Helsinki]].\n* Finland has an embassy and an honorary consulate in [[Bratislava]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlandembassy.sk/Public/Default.aspx|title=Suomen suurl\u00e4hetyst\u00f6, Bratislava|website=Finlandembassy.sk|accessdate=February 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102093454/http://www.finlandembassy.sk/public/default.aspx|archivedate=January 2, 2015|df=}}</ref>\n* Both countries are full members of [[the European Union]].\n* [http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=17327&culture=en-US&contentlan=2 Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs: relations with Slovakia]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Slovenia }}||{{dts|1992-02-17|format=dmy}}\n|\n* Finland recognised Slovenia on January 17, 1992.\n* Finland has an embassy and an honorary consulate in [[Ljubljana]].\n* Slovenia has an embassy in [[Helsinki]].\n* Both countries are full members of the [[European Union]].\n\nTensions between the countries rose in late 2008 when a news program on Finland's national broadcasting company station [[YLE]] accused Finnish weapons manufacturer Patria of bribing Slovenian officials to secure an arms deal.

France is served by an extensive system of automatic [[telephone exchange]]s connected by modern networks of [[fiber-optic]] cable, [[coaxial cable]], [[microwave radio relay]], and a domestic satellite system; cellular telephone service is widely available, expanding rapidly, and includes [[roaming]] service to foreign countries.\n\n==Fixed-line telephony==\nThe telephony system employs an extensive system of modern network elements such as digital [[telephone exchange]]s, [[mobile switching centre]]s, [[media gateway]]s and [[signalling gateway]]s at the core, interconnected by a wide variety of transmission systems using [[fibre-optics]] or [[Microwave transmission|Microwave radio relay]] networks. The [[access network]], which connects the subscriber to the core, is highly diversified with different copper-pair, optic-fibre and wireless technologies. The fixed-line telecommunications market is dominated by the former state-owned monopoly [[France Telecom]].\n\n'''[[Telephone]]s - main lines in use:''' 36.441 million; 35.5 million (metropolitan France) (2009)\n\n'''Telephones - mobile cellular:''' 60.95 million; 59.543 million (metropolitan France) (2009)\n\n===International connection===\nsatellite [[ground station|earth station]]s - 2 [[Intelsat]] (with total of 5 antennas - 2 for [[Indian Ocean]] and 3 for [[Atlantic Ocean]]), NA [[Eutelsat]], 1 [[Inmarsat]] (Atlantic Ocean region); HF radiotelephone communications with more than 20 countries\n\n==Radio==\n'''[[Radio]] broadcast stations:''' AM 41, FM about 3,500 (this figure is an approximation and includes many repeaters), shortwave 2 (1998)\n\n'''Radios:''' 55.3 million (1997)\n\n==Television==\n{{main|Television in France}}\n'''[[Television]] broadcast stations:''' 584 (plus 9,676 repeaters) (1995)\n\n'''Televisions:''' 34.8 million (1997)\n\n==Internet==\n{{main|Internet in France|Broadband Internet access in France}}\n\n'''[[Country code top-level domain|Internet country code]]:''' .fr\n\n'''[[Internet service provider|Internet Service Provider]]s (ISPs):''' 62 (2000)\n\n'''[[Host (network)|Internet host]]s:''' 15,182,001; 15.161 million (metropolitan France) (2010)\n\n'''[[Internaut|Internet user]]s:''' 45.262 million; 44.625 million (metropolitan France) (2009)\n\n== Mobile networks ==\nFrance currently has 4 mobile networks, [[Orange S.A.|Orange]], [[SFR]], [[Bouygues Telecom]] and [[Free Mobile|Free]] all of which are licensed for GSM and UMTS.

Transport became slow and awkward to use. The early modern period saw great improvements. There was a very quick production of canals connecting rivers. It also saw great changes in oceanic shipping. Rather than expensive galleys, wind powered ships that were much faster and had more room for cargo became popular for coastal trade. Transatlantic shipping with the [[New World]] turned cities such as [[Nantes]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville]] and [[Le Havre]] into major ports.\n\n== Railways ==\n[[File:TGV double decker DSC00132.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A high-speed [[SNCF TGV Duplex|double-decker TGV train]] in [[Toulon]]]]\n[[File:Carte TGV.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[TGV]] Network:<br /> \u2022 red and blue: high-speed lines <br /> \u2022 black: normal lines used by TGVs <br /> \u2022 dotted lines: planned for 2009]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in France}}\n\nThere is a total of {{convert|29,901|km|mi}} of railway in France, mostly operated by [[SNCF]], the French national railway company.

In 1994, the [[Channel Tunnel]] opened, connecting France and [[Great Britain]] by rail under the [[English Channel]].

Metro and tramway services are not thought of as trains and usually follow road traffic in driving on the right (except the Lyon Metro).\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\nSix cities in France currently have a [[rapid transit]] service (frequently known as a 'metro'). Full metro systems are in operation in [[Paris M\u00e9tro|Paris]] ([[Paris M\u00e9tro|16 lines]]), [[Lyon Metro|Lyon]] ([[Lyon Metro|4 lines]]) and [[Marseille Metro|Marseille]] ([[Marseille Metro|2 lines]]).

According to the British historian [[Niall Ferguson]], France has participated in 50 of the 125 major European wars fought since 1495, and in 168 battles fought since 387 BC, they have won 109, drawn 10 and lost 49: this makes France the most successful military power in European history\u2014in terms of number of fought and won.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/8080884/Quite-Interesting-the-QI-cabinet-of-curiosity.html | title = Quite Interesting: the QI cabinet of curiosity | newspaper = The Telegraph | date = 2010-10-22 | accessdate = 2012-11-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe Gallo-Roman conflict predominated from 60 BC to 50 BC, with the Romans emerging victorious in the [[Gallic Wars|conquest of Gaul]] by [[Julius Caesar]]. After the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] known as the [[Franks]] took control of [[Gaul]] by defeating competing tribes. The \"land of Francia,\" from which France gets its name, had high points of expansion under kings [[Clovis I]] and [[Charlemagne]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], rivalries with England and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] prompted major conflicts such as the [[Norman Conquest]] and the [[Hundred Years' War]]. With an increasingly centralized monarchy, the first standing army since Roman times, and the use of artillery, France expelled the English from its territory and came out of the Middle Ages as the most powerful nation in Europe, only to lose that status to Spain following defeat in the [[Italian Wars]]. The [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] crippled France in the late 16th century, but a major victory over Spain in the [[Thirty Years' War]] made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more. In parallel, France developed its [[French colonial empire|first colonial empire]] in Asia, Africa, and in the Americas. Under [[Louis XIV]], France achieved military supremacy over its rivals, but escalating conflicts against increasingly powerful enemy coalitions [[War of the Spanish Succession|checked French ambitions]] and left the kingdom bankrupt at the opening of the 18th century.\n[[File:Free French Foreign Legionnairs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Free French Forces|Free French]] [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legionnaires]] at the [[Battle of Bir Hakeim]] (1942).]]\nResurgent French armies secured victories in dynastic conflicts against the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Spanish]], [[War of the Polish Succession|Polish]], and [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian]] crowns. At the same time, France was [[French and Indian Wars|fending off attacks]] on its colonies. As the 18th century advanced, global competition with Great Britain led to the [[Seven Years' War]], where France lost its [[New France|North American holdings]]. Consolation came in the form of dominance in Europe and the [[American Revolutionary War]], where [[France in the American Revolutionary War|extensive French aid]] in the form of money and arms, and the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u201383)|direct participation of its army and navy]] led to America's independence.{{ref|aid}} Internal political upheaval eventually led to 23 years of nearly continuous conflict in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. France reached the zenith of its power during this period, dominating the European continent in an unprecedented fashion under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], but by 1815 it had been restored to its pre-Revolutionary borders. The rest of the 19th century witnessed the growth of the [[Second French colonial empire]] as well as French interventions in [[Ten Days' Campaign|Belgium]], [[First Carlist War|Spain]], and [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]]. Other major wars were fought against [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the [[Crimean War|Crimea]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]], and [[Prussia]] within France itself.\n\nFollowing defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], [[French\u2013German enmity|Franco-German rivalry]] erupted again in the First World War. France  and its allies were victorious this time. Social, political, and economic upheaval in the wake of the conflict led to the Second World War, in which the Allies were defeated in the [[Battle of France]] and the French government surrendered and was replaced with an [[Vichy France|authoritarian regime]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], including the government in exile's [[Free French Forces]] and later a liberated French nation, eventually emerged victorious over the [[Axis powers]]. As a result, France secured an [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zone in Germany]] and a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The imperative of avoiding a third Franco-German conflict on the scale of those of two world wars paved the way for [[European integration]] starting in the 1950s. France became a [[Force de Frappe|nuclear power]] and since the 1990s its military action is most often seen in cooperation with [[NATO]] and its European partners.\n\n==International stance today==\n{{see also|France and weapons of mass destruction}}\n\nToday, French military doctrine is based on the concepts of national independence, nuclear deterrence (''see [[Force de frappe]]''), and military self-sufficiency. [[France]] is a charter member of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]], and has worked actively with its allies to adapt NATO\u2014internally and externally\u2014to the post-[[Cold War]] environment. In December 1995, France announced that it would increase its participation in NATO's military wing, including the Military Committee (France withdrew from NATO's military bodies in 1966 whilst remaining full participants in the Organisation's political Councils). France remains a firm supporter of the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and other cooperative efforts. [[Paris]] hosted the May 1997 NATO-Russia [[Summit (meeting)|Summit]] which sought the signing of the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security. Outside of NATO, France has actively and heavily participated in both coalition and unilateral peacekeeping efforts in [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Balkans]], frequently taking a lead role in these operations. France has undertaken a major restructuring to develop a professional military that will be smaller, more rapidly deployable, and better tailored for operations outside of mainland France. Key elements of the restructuring include: reducing personnel, bases and headquarters, and rationalistion of equipment and the armaments industry.\n\nSince the end of the [[Cold War]], France has placed a high priority on arms control and non-proliferation. French Nuclear testing in the [[Pacific]], and the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'']] strained French relations with its Allies, South Pacific states (namely [[New Zealand]]), and world opinion. France agreed to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992 and supported its indefinite extension in 1995. After conducting a controversial final series of six nuclear tests on [[Mururoa]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], the French signed the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996. Since then, France has implemented a moratorium on the production, export, and use of anti-personnel [[land mine|landmines]] and supports negotiations leading toward a universal ban. The French are key players in the adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe to the new strategic environment. France remains an active participant in: the major programs to restrict the transfer of technologies that could lead to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the [[Australia Group]] (for chemical and biological weapons), and the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]]. France has also signed and ratified the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]].\n\n===2008 White Paper===\n{{main|2008 French White Paper on Defence and National Security}}\n\nOn 31 July 2007, President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] ordered M. Jean-Claude Mallet, a member of the Council of State, to head up a thirty-five member commission charged with a wide-ranging review of French defence.

In keeping with post-[[Cold War]] changes in European politics and power structures, the French military's traditional focus on territorial defence will be redirected to meet the challenges of a  global threat environment. Under the reorganisation, the identification and destruction of [[terrorist]] networks both in metropolitan France and in [[francophone Africa]] will be the primary task of the French military. Redundant military bases will be closed and new weapons systems projects put on hold to finance the restructuring and global deployment of intervention forces. In a historic change, Sarkozy furthermore has declared that France \"will now participate fully in [[NATO]],\" four decades after former French president General [[Charles de Gaulle]] withdrew from the alliance's command structure and ordered American troops off French soil.<ref>Jim Hoagland, \"France's Whirlwind of Change\", Real Clear Politics, 18 June 2008 [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/06/sarkozy_on_the_move.html]</ref>\n\n===Recent operations===\n[[File:Op\u00e9rations ext\u00e9rieures depuis 2001.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|\n{{Legend|#0000FF|France}}\n{{Legend|#F0002B|French military interventions since 2001: [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|Afghanistan]]; [[2004 French\u2013Ivorian clashes|Ivory Coast]];  [[Chadian Civil War (2005\u201310)|Chad]]; [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya]]; [[Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Horn of Africa|Somalia]]; [[Northern Mali conflict|Mali]]; [[Central African Republic conflict under the Djotodia administration|Central African Republic]]; [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]]; [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|Iraq]].}}\n]]\nThere are currently 36,000 French troops [[Deployments of the French military|deployed]] in foreign territories\u2014such operations are known as \"OPEX\" for ''Op\u00e9rations Ext\u00e9rieures'' (\"External Operations\").

France has sent troops, especially [[special forces]], into [[Afghanistan]] to help the United States and NATO forces fight the remains of the [[Taliban]] and [[Al Qaeda]]. In [[Op\u00e9ration Licorne]] a force of a few thousand French soldiers is stationed in [[Ivory Coast]] on a UN peacekeeping mission. These troops were initially sent under the terms of a mutual protection pact between France and the Ivory Coast, but the mission has since evolved into the current UN peacekeeping operation. The French Armed Forces have also played a leading role in the ongoing UN peacekeeping mission along the [[Lebanon]]-[[Israel]] border as part of the cease-fire agreement that brought the [[2006 Lebanon War]] to an end. Currently, France has 2,000 army personnel deployed along the border, including infantry, armour, artillery and air defence.

However, the Constitution puts civil and military government forces at the disposal of the ''[[Cabinet of France|gouvernement]]'' (the executive cabinet of ministers chaired by the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], who are not necessarily of the same political side as the president). The [[Minister of the Armed Forces (France)|Minister of the Armed Forces]] (as of 2017, the incumbent [[Florence Parly]]) oversees the military's funding, procurement and operations. Historically, France relied a great deal on [[conscription]] to provide manpower for its military, in addition to a minority of professional career soldiers. Following the [[Algerian War]], the use of non-volunteer draftees in foreign operations was ended; if their unit was called up for duty in war zones, draftees were offered the choice between requesting a transfer to another unit or volunteering for the active mission. In 1996, President [[Jacques Chirac]]'s government announced the end of conscription and in 2001, conscription formally was ended. Young people must still, however, register for possible conscription (should the situation call for it). As of 2017 the French Armed Forces have a reported strength of 265,458 active personnel.<ref name=\"Key figures in 2017\">{{cite web |url=https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/chiffres-cles-de-la-defense-2017 |title=Chiffres cl\u00e9s de la D\u00e9fense - 2017 |language=French |publisher=Defense.gouv.fr |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090228/https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/chiffres-cles-de-la-defense-2017 |archive-date=2018-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }})</ref>\n\nIt breaks down as follows (2015):<ref name=\"Key figures in 2017\"/>\n* The [[French Army]]; 111,628 personnel.\n* The [[French Air Force]]; 43,597 personnel.\n* The [[French Navy]]; 36,044 personnel.\n* Tri-service [[French Defence Health service|DHS]], [[Military Fuel Service (France)|SEA]], and [[D\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour l'armement|DGA]]; 17,647 personnel in medical, support and administrative roles, and in the acquisition of weapon systems.\n\nThe [[Military reserve forces of France|reserve element]] of the French Armed Forces consists of two structures; the Operational Reserve and the Citizens Reserve.

It was humiliated in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371, which marked the rise of Germany to dominance in Europe. France was on the winning side of the First World War, but fared poorly in the Second World War. It fought losing wars in Indochina (ending in 1954) and Algeria (ending in 1958).  The Fourth Republic collapsed and the Fifth Republic began in 1958 to the present. Under [[Charles De Gaulle]] it tried to block American and British influence on the European community.  Since 1945 France has been a founding member of the United Nations, of [[NATO]], and of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (the European Union's predecessor). As a charter member of the United Nations, France holds one of the permanent seats in the [[Security Council]] and is a member of most of its specialized and related agencies.\n\nFrance is also a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] and the [[La Francophonie]] and plays a key role, both in regional and in international affairs.\n\n==Fifth Republic since 1981==\n\n\n===Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: 1981\u20131995===\n{{Main article|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], a Socialist, emphasized European unity<ref>Simon J.

By the 1990s, the country had become, in the words of [[Stanley Hoffmann]], an \u201cordinary power, neither a basket case nor a challenger.\u201d Public opinion, especially in the United States, no longer sees France as an essential power.

In 1869 Egyptian workers -under the supervision of France- completed the [[Suez Canal]]. A rivalry emerged between France and Britain for control of Egypt, and eventually Britain emerged victorious by buying out the Egyptian [[share (finance)|share]]s of the company before the French had time to act.<ref>F. Robert Hunter, ''Egypt under the khedives, 1805\u20131879: from household government to modern bureaucracy'' (American Univ in Cairo Press, 1999)</ref>\n\nAfter the unification of Germany in 1871, Germany successfully attempted to co-op France's relations with the Ottomans. In [[World War I]] the Ottoman Empire joined the [[Central Powers]], and was defeated by France and Britain. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire France and Britain divided the Middle East between themselves. France received Syria and Lebanon.<ref>Jan Karl Tanenbaum,  \"France and the Arab Middle East, 1914\u20131920.\" ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1978): 1\u201350.

Relationships with Syria are more strained, due to the policies of that country. In 2005, France, along with the United States, pressured Syria to evacuate Lebanon.<ref>N. M\u00e9ouchy et al. ''The British and French mandates in comparative perspectives'' (Brill, 2004)</ref>\nIn the post-World War II era French relations with the Arab Middle East reached a very low point. The [[Algerian War of Independence|war in Algeria]] between Muslim fighters and French colonists deeply concerned the rest of the Muslim world. The Algerian fighters received much of their supplies and funding from Egypt and other Arab powers, much to France's displeasure.<ref>Martin Alexander, and John FV Keiger. \"France and the Algerian War: strategy, operations and diplomacy.\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 25.2 (2002): 1\u201332. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390412331302635 Online]</ref>\n\nMost damaging to Franco-Arab relations, however, was the [[Suez Crisis]]. It greatly diminished France's reputation in the region. France openly supported the Israeli attack on the [[Sinai peninsula]], and was working against [[Nasser]], then a popular figure in the Middle East. The Suez Crisis also made France and the United Kingdom look again like imperialist powers attempting to impose their will upon weaker nations.<ref>Edward E. Azar,  \"Conflict escalation and conflict reduction in an international crisis: Suez, 1956\". ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' (1972): 183\u2013201. {{jstor|173313}}.</ref> Another hindrance to France's relations with the Arab Middle East was its close alliance with Israel during the 1950s.\n\n===De Gaulle's policies===\nThis all changed with the coming of [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power. De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered around an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, and at the same time increase France's international prestige.  De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to becoming the leading nation of a large group of non-aligned countries. The nations de Gaulle looked at as potential participants in this group were those in France's traditional spheres of influence: Africa and the Middle East. The former French colonies in eastern and northern Africa were quite agreeable to these close relations with France.  These nations had close economic and cultural ties to France, and they also had few other suitors amongst the major powers. This new orientation of French foreign policy also appealed strongly to the leaders of the Arab nations. None of them wanted to be dominated by either of the superpowers, and they supported France's policy of trying to balance the US and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and to prevent either from becoming dominant in the region. The Middle Eastern leaders wanted to be free to pursue their own goals and objectives, and did not want to be chained to either alliance block. De Gaulle hoped to use this common foundation to build strong relations between the nations. He also hoped that good relations would improve France's trade with the region. De Gaulle also imagined that these allies would look up to the more powerful French nation, and would look to it in leadership in matters of foreign policy.<ref>Alfred Grosser, ''French Foreign Policy under De Gaulle'' (Greenwood Press, 1977)</ref>\n\nThe end of the Algerian conflict in 1962 accomplished much in this regard. France could not portray itself as a leader of the oppressed nations of the world if it still was enforcing its colonial rule upon another nation. The battle against the Muslim separatists that France waged in favour of the minority of white settlers was an extremely unpopular one throughout the Muslim world. With the conflict raging it would have been close to impossible for France to have had positive relations with the nations of the Middle East. The Middle Eastern support for the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] guerillas was another strain on relations that the end of the conflict removed. Most of the financial and material support for the FLN had come from the nations of the Middle East and North Africa. This was especially true of Nasser's Egypt, which had long supported the separatists. Egypt is also the most direct example of improved relations after the end of hostilities. The end of the war brought an immediate thaw to Franco-Egyptian relations, Egypt ended the trial of four French officers accused of espionage, and France ended its [[trade embargo]] against Egypt.\n\nIn 1967 de Gaulle completely overturned France's Israel policy. De Gaulle and his ministers reacted very harshly to Israel's actions in the [[Six-Day War]]. The French government and de Gaulle condemned Israel's treatment of refugees, warned that it was a mistake to occupy the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], and also refused to recognize the Israeli control of [[Jerusalem]]. The French government continued to criticize Israel after the war and de Gaulle spoke out against other Israeli actions, such as the operations against the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in Lebanon. France began to use its veto power to oppose Israel in the UN, and France sided with the Arab states on almost all issues brought to the international body. Most importantly of all, however, de Gaulle's government imposed an arms embargo on the Israeli state. The embargo was in fact applied to all the combatants, but very soon France began selling weaponry to the Arab states again. As early as 1970 France sold Libya a hundred [[Dassault Mirage]] fighter jets. However, after 1967 France continued to support Israel's [[right to exist]], as well as Israel's many preferential agreements with France and the [[European Economic Community]].\n\n===Foreign aid===\nIn the second half of the 20th century, France increased its expenditures in foreign aid greatly, to become second only to the United States in total aid amongst the Western powers and first on a per capita basis. By 1968 France was paying out $855&nbsp;million per year in aid far more than either West Germany or the United Kingdom. The vast majority of French aid was directed towards Africa and the Middle East, usually either as a lever to promote French interests or to help with the sale of French products (e.g. arms sales). France also increased its expenditures on other forms of aid sending out skilled individuals to developing countries to provide technical and cultural expertise.<ref>Robert D. McKinlay, \"The Aid Relationship A Foreign Policy Model and Interpretation of the Distributions of Official Bilateral Economic Aid of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, 1960\u20131970.\" ''Comparative Political Studies'' (1979) 11#4 pp: 411\u2013464.</ref>\n\nThe combination of aid money, arms sales, and diplomatic alignments helped to erase the memory of the Suez Crisis and the Algerian War in the Arab world and France successfully developed amicable relationships with the governments of many of the Middle Eastern states. Nasser and de Gaulle, who shared many similarities, cooperated on limiting American power in the region. Nasser proclaimed France as the only friend of Egypt in the West. France and Iraq also developed a close relationship with business ties, joint military training exercises, and French assistance in Iraq's nuclear program in the 1970s. France improved relations with its former colony Syria, and eroded cultural links were partially restored.\n\nIn terms of trade France did receive some benefits from the improved relations with the Middle East. French trade with the Middle East increased by over fifty percent after de Gaulle's reforms. The weaponry industries benefited most as France soon had lucrative contracts with many of the regimes in the Middle East and North Africa, though these contracts account for a negligible part of France's economy.\n\nDe Gaulle had hoped that by taking a moderate path and not strongly supporting either side France could take part in the Middle East peace process between Israel and the Arab nations. Instead it has been excluded from any major role.\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n===Africa===\n{{Main article|France\u2013Africa relations}}\nFrance plays a significant role in Africa, especially in its former [[French colonial empires|colonies]], through extensive aid programs, commercial activities, military agreements, and cultural impact. In those former colonies where the French presence remains important, France contributes to political, military, and social stability.  Many think that French policy in Africa \u2013 particularly where British interests are also involved \u2013 is susceptible to what is known as '[[Fashoda syndrome]]'. Others have criticized the relationship as [[neocolonialism]] under the name ''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'', stressing France's support of various dictatorships, among others: [[Omar Bongo]], [[Idriss D\u00e9by]], and [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Algeria }}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Algeria\u2013France relations]]\n\nRelations between post-colonial Algeria and France have remained close throughout the years, although sometimes difficult. In 1962, the [[Evian Accords]] peace treaty laid the foundations of a new Franco-Algerian relationship. In exchange for a generous ''coop\u00e9ration'' regime (massive financial, technical and cultural aid), France secured a number of economic and military privileges. Economically, France enjoyed a preferential treatment vis-\u00e0-vis the Saharan wealth of hydrocarbons. Militarily, it could keep the Mers-el-K\u00e9bir base for 15 years and use the Saharan nuclear test-sites for another five years. France had used these sites to carry out its first nuclear tests (''[[Gerboise bleue]]'') in 1960. 90% or more of the Europeans established in Algeria (''[[pieds-noirs]]'') left the country in a massive exodus creating a difficult void in the bureaucratic, economic and educational structure of Algeria. On the other hand, the issue of the ''[[harki]]s'', the Arabs who had fought on the French side during the war, was still to be solved at the turn of the 21st century, being somehow ignored by the French while seen as outright traitors by the Algerian people. On the economical level, Algeria remained for some time the fourth largest importer of French goods, conducting all its transactions with France in the Franc zone. Many Algerians were encouraged by French authorities and businessmen to migrate to France in order to provide workforce during the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (Thirty Glorious) growth. Relations between France and Algeria have remained closely intertwined, and France could not entirely escape from the chaos which threatened Algeria during the [[Algerian Civil War|civil war in the nineties]].\n\n[[Ahmed Ben Bella]], the first President of Algeria was reported in a 2001 interview as saying that \"The Algerian people have lived with blood. We brought [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to his knees. We struggled against [[French rule in Algeria|French rule]] for 15 years under the leadership of [[Emir Abdel-Kader Al-Jazairi]]. The Algerian population was then four million. French repression cost us two million lives. It was genocide. We survived as a people.

The law created a public uproar and opposition from the whole of the left-wing, and was finally repealed by president [[Jacques Chirac]] (UMP) at the beginning of 2006, after accusations of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] from various teachers and historians.\n\nAlgerians feared that the French law on colonialism would hinder the task the French confronting the dark side of their colonial rule in Algeria because article 4 of the law decreed among other things that \"School programmes are to recognise in particular the positive role of the French presence overseas, especially in North Africa, ...\"<ref name=HS-050516>{{cite news\n|title=Colonial abuses haunt France\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4552473.stm\n|publisher=BBC News\n|author=Hugh Schofiel\n|date=16 May 2005 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> [[Benjamin Stora]] a leading specialist on French Algerian history and an opponent of the French law on colonialism, said \"France has never taken on its colonial history.

From the [[Middle Ages]] onwards, France and England were often enemies, and occasionally allies. However, in the beginning of the 20th century a policy of ''[[entente cordiale]]'' (cordial agreement) was started. France and the United Kingdom became allies, and despite occasional tensions (such as: the perception among ''some'' in France that the British abandoned France in 1940; see [[Battle of France]] and [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]]), remain so to the present day.\n\nA chronic point of contention is the future of the [[European Union]]. Under French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] France opposed on several occasions the UK joining the European Economic Community (as the EU was then called).  De Gaulle argued that the UK had extensive alliances outside Europe, especially with the United States, and was famously suspicious of its European neighbours. After the UK joined the EEC, British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] argued for and won a reduction of its contributions to the EEC budget.  As Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]] expressed scepticism at French economic policies, but forged an alliance with President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].\n|}\n\n===Oceania===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Australia }}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Australia\u2013France relations]]\n\nIn August 2009, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] became the first serving French leader to visit Australia.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6360837.ece \"President Sarkozy to make history on visit to Australia\"], ''The Times'', 26 May 2009</ref> The ''[[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]]'' reported that \"serious bilateral issues\" for Sarkozy and [[Kevin Rudd]] to discuss included \"the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war in Afghanistan]] and [[global warming]]\".<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25529329-954,00.html \"French President Nicolas Sarkozy to visit Australia\"], ''Courier Mail'', 24 May 2009</ref>\n* Australia has an embassy in Paris.\n* France has an embassy in [[Canberra]] and a consulate-general in [[Sydney]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Fiji }}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Fiji\u2013France relations]]\n\nRelations between the France| and the Fiji are currently strained, due to France's condemnation of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat in Fiji in December 2006]].

France also provides Fiji with translations into English of French scientific documents pertaining to the Pacific area.

Its borders, while changed over time, were in 1958 those of the current independent nation of [[Guinea]].\n\nFrench Guinea was established by France in 1891, within the same borders as its previous colony known as [[Rivi\u00e8res du Sud]] (1882\u20131891). Prior to 1882, the coastal portions of French Guinea were part of the French colony of [[History of Senegal|Senegal]].\n\nIn 1891, Rivi\u00e8res du Sud was placed under the colonial lieutenant governor at [[Dakar]], who had authority over the French coastal regions east to [[Porto-Novo]] (modern [[Benin]]). In 1894 Rivi\u00e8res du Sud, [[Cote d'Ivoire]] and [[Dahomey]] were separated into 'independent' colonies, with Rivi\u00e8res du Sud being renamed as the '''Colony of French Guinea'''. In 1895, French Guinea was made one of several dependent colonies and its Governor became one of several Lieutenant Governors who reported to a [[French West Africa#History|Governor-General]] in [[Dakar]]. In 1904, this federation of colonies was formalised as [[French West Africa]]. French Guinea, Senegal, Dahomey, Cote d'Ivoire and [[Upper Senegal and Niger]], were each ruled by a lieutenant governor, under the Governor General in Dakar.\n\n==Colonial history==\n{{Main|History of Guinea}}\nGuinea was ruled by France until 1958. It became independent from [[France]] in 1958 following its voters' rejection of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Constitution of France|Constitution of 1958]]. At the time French Guinea was the only colony <!-- of French West Africa? of any colony of France? -->to reject the new constitution.

Its total land area is {{convert|4167|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nFrench Polynesia is divided into five groups of islands: the [[Society Islands]] archipelago, composed of the [[Windward Islands (Society Islands)|Windward Islands]] and the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]]; the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Archipelago]]; the [[Gambier Islands]]; the [[Marquesas Islands]]; and the [[Austral Islands]]. Among its 118 islands and atolls, 67 are inhabited. [[Tahiti]], which is located within the Society Islands, is the most populous island, having close to 69% of the population of French Polynesia {{As of|2017|lc=y}}. [[Papeete]], located on Tahiti, is the capital. Although not an integral part of its territory, [[Clipperton Island]] was administered from French Polynesia until 2007.\n\nFollowing the [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|Great Polynesian Migration]], European explorers visited the islands of French Polynesia on several occasions. Traders and whaling ships also visited. In 1842, the French took over the islands and established a French [[protectorate]] they called ''{{lang|fr|Etablissements des fran\u00e7ais en Oc\u00e9anie (EFO)}}'' (French Establishments/Settlements in Oceania).\n\nIn 1946, the ''{{lang|fr|EFOs}}'' became an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] under the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic]], and Polynesians were granted the right to vote through citizenship. In 1957, the ''{{lang|fr|EFOs}}'' were renamed French Polynesia. Since 28 March 2003, French Polynesia has been an overseas collectivity of the French Republic under the constitutional revision of article 74, and later gained, with law 2004-192 of 27 February 2004, an administrative autonomy, two symbolic manifestations of which are the title of the [[President of French Polynesia]] and its additional designation as an overseas country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/statuts-nouvelle-caledonie-et-polynesie#statut_pol_fcse|title=Les statuts de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie et de la Polyn\u00e9sie|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Floreal-Bora-Bora.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The French frigate ''[[Flor\u00e9al (F 730)|Flor\u00e9al]]'' in November 2002, stationed in [[Bora Bora]] lagoon.]]\n\nFrench Polynesia was one of the last places on Earth to be settled by humans.

Many observers doubted that the alliance between the anti-independence Gaston Flosse and the pro-independence Oscar Temaru, designed to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia, could last very long.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304152635/http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |archivedate=4 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAt the [[French municipal elections, 2008|French municipal elections held in March 2008]], several prominent mayors who are member of the Flosse-Temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of French Polynesia, which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way Gaston Tong Sang, whose party French Polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before, had been prevented from becoming president of French Polynesia by the last minute alliance between Flosse and Temaru's parties. Eventually, on 15 April 2008 the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] in the territorial assembly when two members of the Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party. Gaston Tong Sang was elected president of French Polynesia as a result of this constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow. He offered posts in his cabinet to Flosse and Temaru's parties which they both refused. Gaston Tong Sang has called all parties to help end the instability in local politics, a prerequisite to attract foreign investors needed to develop the local economy.\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Bora Bora, French Polynesia.jpg|thumb|[[Bora Bora]]]]\nBetween 1946 and 2003, French Polynesia had the status of an overseas territory (''{{lang|fr|[[territoire d'outre-mer]]}}'', or ''TOM''). In 2003, it became an overseas collectivity (''{{lang|fr|[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer]]}}'', or COM). Its statutory law of 27 February 2004 gives it the particular designation of ''[[overseas country of France|overseas country inside the Republic]]'' (''{{lang|fr|pays d'outre-mer au sein de la R\u00e9publique}}'', or POM), but without legal modification of its status.\n\n=== Relations with mainland France ===\n[[File:Haut Commissariat \u00e0 Papeete.JPG|thumb|High Commission of the [[French Fifth Republic]].]]\nDespite a local assembly and government, French Polynesia is not in a [[Associated state|free association]] with France, like the [[Cook Islands]] with [[New Zealand]]. As a French overseas collectivity, the local government has no competence in justice, university education, security and defense. Services in these areas are directly provided and administered by the Government of France, including the [[National Gendarmerie]] (which also polices rural and border areas in European France), and [[French Armed Forces|French military forces]].

The [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita is around $22,000, one of the highest in the Pacific area.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Past economy ===\nBefore French colonisation, the Polynesian islands that constitute nowadays French Polynesia, relied on a subsistence economy. Work was heavily organised and performed by the community as a whole under the direction of the Arii ruling class and the priests. Mountains were terraced for agriculture production, river banks were contained by stone walls, artificial soil was created on atolls in large trenches, and large systems made out of coral stone walls trapped and stocked live fish. Production outputs were divided by the ruling class between the population.\n\nAfter the contact was established with European ships, foreign diseases killed large portions of the populations, and Christian beliefs and clergy produced a huge shift in the culture of those islands. With fewer population to feed, more land per capita was available, and the land use switched toward the limited production required by a family to live. Habitations moved toward seashores as the population relied more on the lagoon and sea trade. European ships stopped in those islands to purchase water, salt pork meat, dried fish and fresh fruits.\n\nAs French, English and Americans settled, part of the agriculture moved towards exports of oranges, coprah, coffee, cotton, and vanilla. They also exported Tahitian black pearls and sandalwood. Santal wood nearly disappeared, cotton production was short lived as the USA's south recovered from the secession war, and coffee and orange trees suffered from imported diseases that stopped those exports. Coprah and vanilla prices and competition worldwide impacted heavily those productions in the second half of the 20th century, although they still exist. The [[guano]] mining at Makatea started in 1917 and stopped in 1966 when the stocks were depleted.\n\nIn 1962, [[France]] stationed [[military]] personnel in the region and started nuclear experimentations in Moruroa. [[French Polynesia]]'s economy switched to services to support the military and the growing [[tourism|tourist]] industry.\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nTourism accounts nowadays for about 13% of the GDP, and is a primary source of foreign [[currency]] earnings. The tourist industry was heavily impacted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 economic crises, and never really recovered since. There are around 160,000 tourists per year. The local government mostly focuses its action at developing a high-end market with luxurious hotels built with foreign investment and French tax cut incentives, but many of these investments close after a few years. The subsidized air company Air Tahiti Nui brings tourists from France, Los Angeles, Japan and China. Other companies also operate, like Air France and Air New Zealand.\n\nThe small [[manufacturing]] sector primarily processes [[agriculture|agricultural]] products. Vanilla and pearls are its main exports.\n\nThe public administration is an important part of the GDP and a provider of stable employment. The French republic finances the functionaries working in education, justice, hospitals, gendarmerie (military police), and military. The local government controls its own administration, like the ministry of agriculture, and oversees the administration and buildings of some sectors like schools. The local government also influence a large part of the economy through subsidies and development programs.\n\nSome parts of the economy involve quasi-monopolistic groups due to the small economy size, the challenges of a country of small islands spread in a huge oceanic space, and the action of the government through subsidies and public companies. Some sectors show an important horizontal and vertical integration trend. Recently, the local government tries to maintain a healthy competition and regulate the growth of the biggest groups, but face many challenges. For example, it was unable to prevent a major supermarket group to develop its own vegetable production, ending its supplying contracts with local farmers. But it blocked the merger of two local shipping companies to avoid a monopoly on some trade routes. The price of shipping goods between islands is fixed by the government, and subsidies are provided for transporting some items like farming products or construction materials.\n\nSome products' price margins are controlled by the local government to reduce the disparity of prices between the different archipelagos. Import taxes and VAT are fixed and collected by the local government that also control what imports are allowed to protect its agriculture and nature from diseases and invasive species.\n\nThe majority of the population is of mixed Polynesian and European origin. Around 5% of the population is of Asian origin, descending from farm workers imported in the 19th century to work in the cotton fields. They are present in the administration and trading sector of the economy. The recent metropolitan population is mostly involved in the state administration and in small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n== Agriculture ==\n\nMost Polynesians in agriculture farm traditional products like taro, ufi, casava and sweet potato to feed themselves and small surplus are sold for monetary income alongside a small fishing activity. Farmers of Asian origin tends to produce European and Asian vegetables for the local market.\n\nThe Moorea island developed pineapple production for local market and supplying the juice factory. Maupiti and Huahine produce watermelons. Tahiti and Tahaa have a small production of sugarcane for rum distillery.\n\nTahiti produces a small quantity of fresh milk, mostly for the local yogurt factory, as most of the population is used to drinking UHT and powdered milk from France and New Zealand. French Polynesia has a single slaughterhouse treating beef, pork, and chickens. The local beef meat production is very limited and mostly used to supply the local corned beef factory. Most of the meat comes from New Zealand, amounting to around 10% of the exports of fresh meat of this country. Two charcuteries produce ham, sausages, and p\u00e2t\u00e9s from local and imported pork.\n\nThe copra production is heavily subsidized as the local government treats it as a form of social support for the remote islands with a limited range of economic activities possibilities like Tuamotu atolls. The copra is milled by the Huilerie de Tahiti to produce coconut oil mostly used for the monoi. The coconut cake residue is used as a cattle and pork feed, and surplus used to be exported to New Zealand. \n\nVanilla production depends heavily on the situation in Madagascar. When a typhoon hit this main supplier of vanilla, the market price increased worldwide and the local Polynesian government started a heavy program of subsidies and loans to develop vanilla farms. As the Polynesian production increased and Madagascar recovered, prices dropped and a lot of Polynesian farmers stopped caring for their vanilla plants. The plants are fragile and require regular care of experienced farmers. Diseases and insects can heavily reduce the production, and the cost of chemical products used impact the farmer harder when the vanilla prices are low. As the vanilla production falls, the price increase and the government started a new program of development, starting a new cycle. Despite the high price of Tahitian dried vanilla on the international market, it usually still finds buyers in the high-end market because of the specificities of its cultivar and quality.\n\nIn the 1990s, the commercial production of Noni started because of the supposed benefits of the juice of this fruit. Exports were mostly directed toward the North American market. But this production was short-lived, falling quickly from 7000 tonnes in 2005 down to 2000 tonnes in 2008, as the plant can be easily farmed in any tropical climate, especially in countries with lower labor costs and more land.\n\nA small vineyard production exists in Rangiroa atoll and is aimed at the high-end market, capitalizing on its rarity and specificity of a vine grown on coral soil in a tropical island.\n\n== Electricity ==\nFrench Polynesia's [[electricity]] production in 2004 was 477 GWh. In 1998 59.72% of French Polynesia's electricity came from [[fossil fuel]] with the remainder from [[hydropower]].\n\n== Currency ==\nFrench Polynesia uses the [[CFP franc|Comptoirs Francais du Pacifique franc]] (CFPF), with 1 CFP franc subdivided into 100 centimes. The CFP franc was formerly linked at the exact official rate of 0.055 [[French franc]]s to one Pacifique franc. When France switched its currency to the [[euro]] in 1999 this static link remained true, so that the rate is now about 119.26 Pacifique franc to one euro (1 euro being exactly 6.55957 French francs). In 2016 the exchange rate was 110.2 CFP francs per US dollar.<ref>{{cite web |title=French Polynesia |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/fp.html |publisher=[[CIA World Factbook]] |year=2018 |accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|France|French Polynesia|Economy}}\n* Economy of France in: [[Economy of French Guiana|French Guiana]], French Polynesia, [[Economy of Guadeloupe|Guadeloupe]], [[Economy of Martinique|Martinique]], [[Economy of Mayotte|Mayotte]], [[Economy of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[Economy of R\u00e9union|R\u00e9union]], [[Economy of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Economy of Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]], [[Economy of Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Economy of Wallis and Futuna|Wallis and Futuna]]\n* [[Taxation in France]]\n* [[Economic history of France]]\n* [[Poverty in France]]\n\n{{Oceania in topic|Economy of}}\n{{EU Dependent economies|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of French Polynesia}}\n[[Category:Economy of French Polynesia| ]]\n[[Category:Economy of France by region|*French Polynesia]]\n[[Category:Economies by country|French Polynesia]]", "sha1": "io24kjdl21h7flkozejxk93n83876w3"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in French Polynesia", "ns": "0", "id": "10743", "revision": {"id": "857841022", "parentid": "798124153", "timestamp": "2018-09-03T11:00:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "Hindb\u00e6rbrus", "id": "34448393"}, "comment": "/* Telephone */ Telephone numbers in French Polynesia", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "This article is about [[communication]]s systems in [[French Polynesia]]. \n\nThe [[Honotua]] fiber optic cable connected Tahiti to [[Hawaii]] in 2010,<ref>[http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2010/June/06-29-18.htm TAHITI TO ACCESS BROADBAND INTERNET IN SEPTEMBER -
