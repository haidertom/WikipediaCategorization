He emigrated with his family to the United States in 1921. He earned a BA from [[City College of New York]] in 1931. Although nearing ordination at the [[Yeshiva University]]'s [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]], he transferred to the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTSA), where he was ordained in 1934 and received the advanced Jewish legal degree of ''Hattarat Hora\u2019ah'' under the great talmudic scholar Rabbi Professor [[Louis Ginzberg]]. He was one of only three people, along with Boaz Cohen and [[Louis Finkelstein]], to ever to receive this degree from JTSA. Klein subsequently earned a PhD from [[Harvard]] under the pioneering academic of Judaic studies [[Harry Wolfson]]. \n\nHe married the former Henriette Levine in 1932 and had three daughters, Hannah, Miriam, and Rivke. Devoted to his family, he dedicated his major work, ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice'' to his children, sons-in-law and 13 grandchildren listing each by name.  \n\nKlein served as rabbi at Kadimoh Congregation in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] from 1934\u20131953; Temple Emanu-El, [[Buffalo, New York]], 1953\u20131968; Temple Shaarey Zedek, Buffalo, (which was created from the merger of Emanu-El with Temple Beth David in 1968), 1968-1972. A beloved Rabbi, he influenced generations of congregants and visiting students and, together with his wife who was an educator, founded Jewish day schools in both Springfield and Buffalo.\n\nDespite the difficulties facing a congregational Rabbi raising a family, Klein volunteered for the U.S. Army during [[World War II]] as a chaplain, motivated by a cause he saw as clearly right with important implications for the Jewish People. He served over 4 years, rising to the rank of Major and was an advisor to the high commissioner of the Occupation government. He also served on special assignments for Jewish soldiers in the U.S. Army in the 1950s, receiving the simulated rank of Brigadier General for these missions. His experiences in the war are described in his book ''The Anguish and the Ecstasy of a Jewish Chaplain''.\n\n== Role within Conservative Judaism ==\n\nKlein was a leader of the right-wing of the Conservative movement. He was president of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], 1958\u20131960, and a member of its Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, 1948-1979. He was the author of several books, notably, ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice''. One of the outstanding halakhists of the movement, he served as a leading member of the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] from 1948 until his death in 1979.\n\nAs a leading authority on [[halakha]] he authored many important [[Responsa|teshuvot (responsa)]], many of which were published in his influential \"[[Responsa]] and Halakhic Studies\".  From the 1950s to 1970s, he wrote a comprehensive guide to [[halakha|Jewish law]] that was used to teach halakha at the JTSA.  In 1979 he assembled this into ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice'', which is used widely by laypeople and rabbis within [[Conservative Judaism]].\n\n== Rabbinic thought ==\n\nThe philosophy upon which ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice'' is written is stated in the foreword: \"The premise on which Torah is based is that all aspects of life - leisure no less than business, worship or rites of passage (birth, bar mitzvah, marriage, divorce, death) - are part of the covenant and mandate under which every Jew is to serve God in everything he does. In the eyes of Torah there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as the purely private domain, for even in solitude - be it the privacy of the bath or the unconsciousness of sleep - one has the capacity and the duty to serve God.\" This message, of life seen in consonance with the dictates of Judaism, permeates many pages of the book. Rabbi [[Louis Finkelstein]], scholar of the JTSA, wrote: \"There are those who would think that we have but two alternatives, to reject or to accept the law, but in either case to treat it as a dead letter. Both of these alternatives are repugnant to the whole tradition of Judaism. Jewish law must be preserved but it is subject to interpretation by those who have mastered it, and the interpretation placed upon it by duly authorized masters in every generation must be accepted with as much reverence as those which were given in previous generations.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} \n\nThis understanding of traditional preservation of the law through its continuous interpretation lies at the heart of Klein's extensive study of Jewish law. \n\nKlein's papers are located at the University Archives, [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] (see [http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/units/archives/ead/ms149/ms149.frame.html finding aid]). The archives include fifteen reels of microfilm. The collection consists of extensive writings by Klein on traditional Jewish practice and law. This includes manuscript material for his books ''Guide to Jewish Religious Practice'' (1979), ''The Ten Commandments in a Changing World '' (1963), ''The Anguish and the Ecstasy of a Jewish Chaplain'' (1974), and his translation of ''The Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah): Book 7, The Book of Agriculture'' (1979). The collection also contains speeches, sermons, articles, and remarks from the Conservative Jewish viewpoint on subjects such as [[Jewish medical ethics]], [[kashrut|dietary laws]], adoption, and marriage and divorce. Meeting minutes, annual reports, bulletins, and sermons relating to Klein's rabbinical vocations in Springfield, Massachusetts and Buffalo, New York are also included. The papers contain photographs, wartime letters, and military records of Klein documenting his service in World War II as a director of Jewish religious affairs in Germany.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://emanuelnyc.org/bulletin/archive/05.html About Klein's \"A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice\"]\n* [http://learn.jtsa.edu/topics/diduknow/jrpguide/ Excerpts from \"A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice\"]\n* [http://www.jbuff.com/ikle.htm Isaac Klein]\n* [http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/units/archives/ead/ms149/ms149.frame.html Finding Aid for the Rabbi Isaac Klein Papers, 1925-1979.

When proteins are generated from intron-containing genes, RNA splicing takes place as part of the RNA processing pathway that follows [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and precedes [[Translation (biology)|translation]].\n\nThe word ''intron'' is derived from the term ''intragenic region'', i.e. a region inside a gene. Although introns are sometimes called ''intervening sequences'', the term \"intervening sequence\" can refer to any of several families of internal nucleic acid sequences that are not present in the final gene product, including [[inteins]], untranslated sequences ([[Untranslated region|UTR]]), and nucleotides removed by [[RNA editing]], in addition to introns.\n\n==Introduction==\nIntrons were first discovered in protein-coding genes of [[adenovirus]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chow LT, Gelinas RE, Broker TR, Roberts RJ |title=An amazing sequence arrangement at the 5' ends of adenovirus 2 messenger RNA |journal=Cell |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20138 |date=September 1977 |pmid=902310 |doi= 10.1016/0092-8674(77)90180-5|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berget SM, Moore C, Sharp PA |title=Spliced segments at the 5' terminus of adenovirus 2 late mRNA |journal=Proc.

These complex architectures allow some group I and group II introns to be ''self-splicing'', that is, the intron-containing RNA molecule can rearrange its own covalent structure so as to precisely remove the intron and link the exons together in the correct order. In some cases, particular intron-binding proteins are involved in splicing, acting in such a way that they assist the intron in folding into the three-dimensional structure that is necessary for self-splicing activity. Group I and group II introns are distinguished by different sets of internal conserved sequences and folded structures, and by the fact that splicing of RNA molecules containing group II introns generates branched introns (like those of spliceosomal RNAs), while group I introns use a non-encoded guanosine nucleotide (typically GTP) to initiate splicing, adding it on to the 5'-end of the excised intron.\n\n==Biological functions and evolution==\nWhile introns do not encode protein products, they are integral to gene expression regulation.

The control of alternative RNA splicing is performed by a complex network of signaling molecules that respond to a wide range of intracellular and extracellular signals.\n\nIntrons contain several short sequences that are important for efficient splicing, such as acceptor and donor sites at either end of the intron as well as a branch point site, which are required for proper splicing by the [[spliceosome]]. Some introns are known to enhance the expression of the gene that they are contained in by a process known as [[Intron Mediated Enhancement|intron-mediated enhancement]] (IME).\n\nActively transcribed regions of [[DNA]] frequently form [[R-loop]]s that are vulnerable to [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].

At least seven mechanisms of intron gain have been reported thus far: Intron Transposition, Transposon Insertion, Tandem Genomic Duplication, Intron Transfer, Intron Gain during Double-Strand Break Repair (DSBR), Insertion of a Group II Intron, and Intronization.  In theory it should be easiest to deduce the origin of recently gained introns due to the lack of host-induced mutations, yet even introns gained recently did not arise from any of the aforementioned mechanisms. These findings thus raise the question of whether or not the proposed mechanisms of intron gain fail to describe the mechanistic origin of many novel introns because they are not accurate mechanisms of intron gain, or if there are other, yet to be discovered, processes generating novel introns.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Yenerall | first1 = P. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-7-29 | title = Identifying the mechanisms of intron gain: Progress and trends | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 7 | pages = 29 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22963364| pmc =3443670 }}</ref>\n\nIn intron transposition, the most commonly purported intron gain mechanism, a spliced intron is thought to reverse splice into either its own mRNA or another mRNA at a previously intron-less position. This intron-containing mRNA is then reverse transcribed and the resulting intron-containing cDNA may then cause intron gain via complete or partial recombination with its original genomic locus. Transposon insertions can also result in intron creation. Such an insertion could intronize the transposon without disrupting the coding sequence when a transposon inserts into the sequence AGGT, resulting in the duplication of this sequence on each side of the transposon. It is not yet understood why these elements are spliced, whether by chance, or by some preferential action by the transposon. In tandem genomic duplication, due to the similarity between consensus donor and acceptor splice sites, which both closely resemble AGGT, the tandem genomic duplication of an exonic segment harboring an AGGT sequence generates two potential splice sites. When recognized by the spliceosome, the sequence between the original and duplicated AGGT will be spliced, resulting in the creation of an intron without alteration of the coding sequence of the gene. Double-stranded break repair via non-homologous end joining was recently identified as a source of intron gain when researchers identified short direct repeats flanking 43% of gained introns in Daphnia.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/> These numbers must be compared to the number of conserved introns flanked by repeats in other organisms, though, for statistical relevance. For group II intron insertion, the retrohoming of a group II intron into a nuclear gene was proposed to cause recent spliceosomal intron gain.\n\nIntron transfer has been hypothesized to result in intron gain when a paralog or pseudogene gains an intron and then transfers this intron via recombination to an intron-absent location in its sister paralog. Intronization is the process by which mutations create novel introns from formerly exonic sequence. Thus, unlike other proposed mechanisms of intron gain, this mechanism does not require the insertion or generation of DNA to create a novel intron.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\nThe only hypothesized mechanism of recent intron gain lacking any direct evidence is that of group II intron insertion, which when demonstrated in vivo, abolishes gene expression.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Chalamcharla | first1 = V.

The testing of other proposed mechanisms in vivo, particularly intron gain during DSBR, intron transfer, and intronization, is possible, although these mechanisms must be demonstrated in vivo to solidify them as actual mechanisms of intron gain. Further genomic analyses, especially when executed at the population level, may then quantify the relative contribution of each mechanism, possibly identifying species-specific biases that may shed light on varied rates of intron gain amongst different species.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\n==See also==\n'''Structure:'''\n*[[Exon]]\n*[[mRNA]]\n*[[Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure]]\n*[[Small t intron]]\n'''Splicing:'''\n*[[Alternative splicing]]\n*[[Exitron]]\n*[[Minor spliceosome]]\n'''Function'''\n*[[MicroRNA]]\n'''Others:'''\n*[[Intein]]\n*[[Interrupted gene]]\n*[[Noncoding DNA]]\n*[[Noncoding RNA]]\n*[[Selfish DNA]]\n*[[Twintron]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.mybioinfo.info/exon_search_symbol.php A search engine for exon/intron sequences defined by NCBI]\n* Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, and Peter Walter ''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-4105-5}}.

Statistics]]}}\n\n'''Identical particles''', also called '''indistinguishable''' or '''indiscernible particles''', are [[particle]]s that cannot be distinguished from one another, even in principle. Species of identical particles include, but are not limited to [[elementary particle]]s such as [[electron]]s, composite [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[atomic nuclei]], as well as [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s. [[Quasiparticle]]s also behave in this way. Although all known indistinguishable particles are [[quantum realm|\"tiny\"]], there is no exhaustive list of all possible sorts of particles nor a clear-cut limit of applicability, as explored in [[particle statistics #Quantum statistics |quantum statistics]].\n\nThere are two main categories of identical particles: [[boson]]s, which can share [[quantum state]]s, and [[fermion]]s, which do not share quantum states as described by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].  Examples of bosons are [[photon]]s, [[gluon]]s, [[phonon]]s, [[helium-4]] nuclei and all [[meson]]s. Examples of fermions are [[electron]]s, [[neutrino]]s, [[quark]]s, [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[helium-3]] nuclei.\n\nThe fact that particles can be identical has important consequences in [[statistical mechanics]]. Calculations in statistical mechanics rely on [[probability theory|probabilistic]] arguments, which are sensitive to whether or not the objects being studied are identical. As a result, identical particles exhibit markedly different statistical behaviour from distinguishable particles. For example, the indistinguishability of particles has been proposed as a solution to Gibbs' [[Gibbs paradox|mixing paradox]].\n\n== Distinguishing between particles ==\n\nThere are two methods for distinguishing between particles. The first method relies on differences in the intrinsic physical properties of the particles, such as [[mass]], [[electric charge]], and [[spin (physics)|spin]]. If differences exist, it is possible to distinguish between the particles by measuring the relevant properties. However, it is an empirical fact that microscopic particles of the same species have completely equivalent physical properties. For instance, every electron in the universe has exactly the same electric charge; this is why it is possible to speak of such a thing as \"[[Elementary charge|the charge of the electron]]\".\n\nEven if the particles have equivalent physical properties, there remains a second method for distinguishing between particles, which is to track the trajectory of each particle. As long as the position of each particle can be measured with infinite precision (even when the particles collide), then there would be no ambiguity about which particle is which.\n\nThe problem with the second approach is that it contradicts the principles of [[quantum mechanics]]. According to quantum theory, the particles do not possess definite positions during the periods between measurements. Instead, they are governed by [[wavefunction]]s that give the probability of finding a particle at each position. As time passes, the wavefunctions tend to spread out and overlap. Once this happens, it becomes impossible to determine, in a subsequent measurement, which of the particle positions correspond to those measured earlier. The particles are then said to be indistinguishable.\n\n== Quantum mechanical description of identical particles ==\n\n=== Symmetrical and antisymmetrical states ===\n[[Image:Asymmetricwave2.png|right|thumb|Antisymmetric wavefunction for a (fermionic) 2-particle state in an infinite square well potential.]]\n[[Image:Symmetricwave2.png|right|thumb|Symmetric wavefunction for a (bosonic) 2-particle state in an infinite square well potential.]]\n\nWhat follows is an example to make the above discussion concrete, using the formalism developed in the article on the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]].\n\nLet ''n'' denote a complete set of (discrete) quantum numbers for specifying single-particle states (for example, for the [[particle in a box]] problem, take ''n'' to be the quantized [[wave vector]] of the wavefunction.) For simplicity, consider a system composed of two identical particles. Suppose that one particle is in the state ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and another is in the state ''n''<sub>2</sub>. Intuitively, the quantum state of the system should be\n\n:<math> | n_1 \\rang | n_2 \\rang </math>\n\nThis is simply the canonical way of constructing a basis for a [[tensor product]] space <math>H \\otimes H</math> of the combined system from the individual spaces. However, this expression implies the ability to identify the particle with ''n''<sub>1</sub> as \"particle 1\" and the particle with ''n''<sub>2</sub> as \"particle 2\". If the particles are indistinguishable, this is impossible by definition, because <math> |n_1\\rang |n_2\\rang</math> and <math>|n_2\\rang |n_1\\rang </math> are two different states. Two states are physically only equivalent if they differ by a complex phase factor. Requiring this condition leads to the conclusion that the states are given by the following two possibilities:<ref>http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~pdh1001/thesis/node14.html</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Tuckerman|2010|p=385}}</ref>\n\n:<math> |n_1\\rang |n_2\\rang \\pm |n_2\\rang |n_1\\rang </math>\n\nTo see this, imagine a two identical particle system. Suppose it is known that one of the particles is in state <math>n_1</math> and the other is in state <math>n_2</math>. Prior to the measurement, there is no way to know if particle 1 is in state <math>n_1</math> and particle 2 is in state <math>n_2</math>, or the other way around because the particles are indistinguishable. So, there are equal probabilities for each of the states to occur - meaning that the system is in superposition of both states prior to the measurement.        \n   \nStates where this is a sum are known as '''symmetric'''; states involving the difference are called '''antisymmetric'''. More completely, symmetric states have the form\n\n:<math> |n_1, n_2; S\\rang \\equiv \\mbox{constant} \\times \\bigg( |n_1\\rang |n_2\\rang + |n_2\\rang |n_1\\rang \\bigg) </math>\n\nwhile antisymmetric states have the form\n\n:<math> |n_1, n_2; A\\rang \\equiv \\mbox{constant} \\times \\bigg( |n_1\\rang |n_2\\rang - |n_2\\rang |n_1\\rang \\bigg) </math>\n\nNote that if ''n''<sub>1</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub> are the same, the antisymmetric expression gives zero, which cannot be a state vector as it cannot be normalized. In other words, in an antisymmetric state two identical particles cannot occupy the same single-particle states. This is known as the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], and it is the fundamental reason behind the [[chemistry|chemical]] properties of atoms and the stability of [[matter]].\n\n=== Exchange symmetry ===\n\nThe importance of symmetric and antisymmetric states is ultimately based on empirical evidence. It appears to be a fact of nature that identical particles do not occupy states of a mixed symmetry, such as\n\n:<math> |n_1, n_2; ?\\rang = \\mbox{constant} \\times \\bigg( |n_1\\rang |n_2\\rang + i |n_2\\rang |n_1\\rang \\bigg) </math>\n\nThere is actually an exception to this rule, which will be discussed later. On the other hand, it can be shown that the symmetric and antisymmetric states are in a sense special, by examining a particular symmetry of the multiple-particle states known as '''exchange symmetry'''.\n\nDefine a linear operator ''P'', called the exchange operator. When it acts on a tensor product of two state vectors, it exchanges the values of the state vectors:\n\n:<math>P \\bigg(|\\psi\\rang |\\phi\\rang \\bigg) \\equiv |\\phi\\rang |\\psi\\rang </math>\n\n''P'' is both [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]] and [[Unitary operator|unitary]]. Because it is unitary, it can be regarded as a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry operator]]. This symmetry may be described as the symmetry under the exchange of labels attached to the particles (i.e., to the single-particle Hilbert spaces).\n\nClearly, <math>P^2 = 1</math> (the identity operator), so the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''P'' are +1 and &minus;1. The corresponding [[eigenvector]]s are the symmetric and antisymmetric states:\n\n:<math>P|n_1, n_2; S\\rang = + |n_1, n_2; S\\rang</math>\n:<math>P|n_1, n_2; A\\rang = - |n_1, n_2; A\\rang</math>\n\nIn other words, symmetric and antisymmetric states are essentially unchanged under the exchange of particle labels: they are only multiplied by a factor of +1 or &minus;1, rather than being \"rotated\" somewhere else in the Hilbert space. This indicates that the particle labels have no physical meaning, in agreement with the earlier discussion on indistinguishability.\n\nIt will be recalled that ''P'' is Hermitian. As a result, it can be regarded as an observable of the system, which means that, in principle, a measurement can be performed to find out if a state is symmetric or antisymmetric. Furthermore, the equivalence of the particles indicates that the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] can be written in a symmetrical form, such as\n\n:<math>H = \\frac{p_1^2}{2m} + \\frac{p_2^2}{2m} + U(|x_1 - x_2|) + V(x_1) + V(x_2) </math>\n\nIt is possible to show that such Hamiltonians satisfy the [[Commutator|commutation relation]]\n\n:<math>\\left[P, H\\right] = 0</math>\n\nAccording to the [[Heisenberg picture|Heisenberg equation]], this means that the value of ''P'' is a constant of motion. If the quantum state is initially symmetric (antisymmetric), it will remain symmetric (antisymmetric) as the system evolves. Mathematically, this says that the state vector is confined to one of the two eigenspaces of ''P'', and is not allowed to range over the entire Hilbert space. Thus, that eigenspace might as well be treated as the actual Hilbert space of the system. This is the idea behind the definition of [[Fock space]].\n\n=== Fermions and bosons ===\n\nThe choice of symmetry or antisymmetry is determined by the species of particle. For example, symmetric states must always be used when describing [[photon]]s or [[helium-4]] atoms, and antisymmetric states when describing [[electron]]s or [[proton]]s.\n\nParticles which exhibit symmetric states are called [[boson]]s. The nature of symmetric states has important consequences for the statistical properties of systems composed of many identical bosons. These statistical properties are described as [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]].\n\nParticles which exhibit antisymmetric states are called [[fermion]]s. Antisymmetry gives rise to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which forbids identical fermions from sharing the same quantum state. Systems of many identical fermions are described by [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]].\n\n[[Parastatistics]] are also possible.\n\nIn certain two-dimensional systems, mixed symmetry can occur. These exotic particles are known as [[anyon]]s, and they obey [[fractional statistics]]. Experimental evidence for the existence of anyons exists in the [[quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall effect]], a phenomenon observed in the two-dimensional electron gases that form the inversion layer of [[MOSFET]]s. There is another type of statistic, known as [[braid statistics]], which are associated with particles known as [[plekton]]s.\n\nThe [[spin-statistics theorem]] relates the exchange symmetry of identical particles to their [[spin (physics)|spin]]. It states that bosons have integer spin, and fermions have half-integer spin. Anyons possess fractional spin.\n\n=== ''N'' particles ===\n\nThe above discussion generalizes readily to the case of ''N'' particles. Suppose there are ''N'' particles with quantum numbers ''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>, ..., n<sub>N</sub>. If the particles are bosons, they occupy a '''totally symmetric state''', which is symmetric under the exchange of ''any two'' particle labels:\n\n:<math>|n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; S\\rang = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N!\\prod_n m_n!}} \\sum_p |n_{p(1)}\\rang |n_{p(2)}\\rang \\cdots |n_{p(N)}\\rang </math>\n\nHere, the sum is taken over all different states under [[permutation]]s ''p'' acting on ''N'' elements. The square root left to the sum is a [[normalizing constant]]. The quantity ''m<sub>n</sub>'' stands for the number of times each of the single-particle states ''n'' appears in the ''N''-particle state. Note that ''\u2211<sub>n</sub> m<sub>n</sub> = N''.\n\nIn the same vein, fermions occupy '''totally antisymmetric states''':\n\n:<math>|n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; A\\rang = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}} \\sum_p \\operatorname{sgn}(p) |n_{p(1)}\\rang |n_{p(2)}\\rang \\cdots |n_{p(N)}\\rang\\ </math>\n\nHere, {{math|sgn(''p'')}} is the [[parity of a permutation|sign]] of each permutation (i.e.<math>+1</math> if <math>p</math> is composed of an even number of transpositions, and <math>-1</math> if odd). Note that there is no <math>\\Pi_n m_n</math> term, because each single-particle state can appear only once in a fermionic state. Otherwise the sum would again be zero due to the antisymmetry, thus representing a physically impossible state. This is the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for many particles.\n\nThese states have been normalized so that\n\n:<math> \\lang n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; S | n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; S\\rang = 1, \\qquad \\lang n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; A | n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; A\\rang = 1. </math>\n\n=== Measurements of identical particles ===\n\nSuppose there is a system of ''N'' bosons (fermions) in the symmetric (antisymmetric) state\n\n:<math>|n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; S/A \\rang</math>\n\nand a measurement is performed on some other set of discrete observables, ''m''. In general, this yields some result ''m<sub>1</sub>'' for one particle, ''m<sub>2</sub>'' for another particle, and so forth. If the particles are bosons (fermions), the state after the measurement must remain symmetric (antisymmetric), i.e.\n\n:<math>|m_1 m_2 \\cdots m_N; S/A \\rang</math>\n\nThe probability of obtaining a particular result for the ''m'' measurement is\n\n:<math>P_{S/A}(n_1, \\cdots n_N \\rightarrow m_1, \\cdots m_N) \\equiv \\bigg|\\lang m_1 \\cdots m_N; S/A \\,|\\, n_1 \\cdots n_N; S/A \\rang \\bigg|^2 </math>\n\nIt can be shown that \n\n:<math> \\sum_{m_1 \\le m_2 \\le \\dots \\le m_N} P_{S/A}(n_1, \\cdots n_N \\rightarrow m_1, \\cdots m_N) = 1 </math>\n\nwhich verifies that the total probability is 1.  The sum has to be restricted to ''ordered'' values of ''m<sub>1</sub>'', ..., ''m<sub>N</sub>'' to ensure that each multi-particle state is not counted more than once.\n\n=== Wavefunction representation ===\n\nSo far, the discussion has included only discrete observables. It can be extended to continuous observables, such as the [[position (vector)|position]]&nbsp;''x''.\n\nRecall that an eigenstate of a continuous observable represents an infinitesimal ''range'' of values of the observable, not a single value as with discrete observables. For instance, if a particle is in a state |''\u03c8''\u27e9, the probability of finding it in a region of volume ''d''<sup>3</sup>''x'' surrounding some position ''x'' is\n\n:<math> |\\lang x | \\psi \\rang|^2 \\; d^3 x </math>\n\nAs a result, the continuous eigenstates |''x''\u27e9 are normalized to the [[dirac delta function|delta function]] instead of unity:\n\n:<math> \\lang x | x' \\rang = \\delta^3 (x - x') </math>\n\nSymmetric and antisymmetric multi-particle states can be constructed from continuous eigenstates in the same way as before. However, it is customary to use a different normalizing constant:\n\n:<math>|x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_N; S\\rang = \\frac{\\prod_j n_j!}{N!} \\sum_p |x_{p(1)}\\rang |x_{p(2)}\\rang \\cdots |x_{p(N)}\\rang </math>\n:<math>|x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_N; A\\rang = \\frac{1}{N!} \\sum_p \\mathrm{sgn}(p) |x_{p(1)}\\rang |x_{p(2)}\\rang \\cdots |x_{p(N)}\\rang </math>\n\nA many-body [[wavefunction]] can be written,\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Psi^{(S)}_{n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N} (x_1, x_2, \\cdots x_N) & \\equiv \\lang x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_N; S | n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; S \\rang \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\prod_j n_j!}{N!}} \\sum_p \\psi_{p(1)}(x_1) \\psi_{p(2)}(x_2) \\cdots \\psi_{p(N)}(x_N)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Psi^{(A)}_{n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N} (x_1, x_2, \\cdots x_N) & \\equiv \\lang x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_N; A | n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N; A \\rang \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}} \\sum_p \\mathrm{sgn}(p) \\psi_{p(1)}(x_1) \\psi_{p(2)}(x_2) \\cdots \\psi_{p(N)}(x_N)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere the single-particle wavefunctions are defined, as usual, by\n\n:<math>\\psi_n(x) \\equiv \\lang x | n \\rang </math>\n\nThe most important property of these wavefunctions is that exchanging any two of the coordinate variables changes the wavefunction by only a plus or minus sign. This is the manifestation of symmetry and antisymmetry in the wavefunction representation:\n\n:<math>\n\\Psi^{(S)}_{n_1 \\cdots n_N} (\\cdots x_i \\cdots x_j\\cdots) =\n\\Psi^{(S)}_{n_1 \\cdots n_N} (\\cdots x_j \\cdots x_i \\cdots)\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\Psi^{(A)}_{n_1 \\cdots n_N} (\\cdots x_i \\cdots x_j\\cdots) = -\n\\Psi^{(A)}_{n_1 \\cdots n_N} (\\cdots x_j \\cdots x_i \\cdots)\n</math>\n\nThe many-body wavefunction has the following significance: if the system is initially in a state with quantum numbers ''n''<sub>1</sub>, ..., n<sub>N</sub>, and a position measurement is performed, the probability of finding particles in infinitesimal volumes near ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>N</sub> is\n\n:<math> N! \\; \\left|\\Psi^{(S/A)}_{n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N} (x_1, x_2, \\cdots x_N) \\right|^2 \\; d^{3N}\\!x </math>\n\nThe factor of ''N''! comes from our normalizing constant, which has been chosen so that, by analogy with single-particle wavefunctions,\n\n:<math> \\int\\!\\int\\!\\cdots\\!\\int\\; \\left|\\Psi^{(S/A)}_{n_1 n_2 \\cdots n_N} (x_1, x_2, \\cdots x_N)\\right|^2 d^3\\!x_1 d^3\\!x_2 \\cdots d^3\\!x_N = 1 </math>\n\nBecause each integral runs over all possible values of ''x'', each multi-particle state appears ''N''! times in the integral. In other words, the probability associated with each event is evenly distributed across ''N''! equivalent points in the integral space. Because it is usually more convenient to work with unrestricted integrals than restricted ones, the normalizing constant has been chosen to reflect this.\n\nFinally, antisymmetric wavefunction can be written as the [[determinant]] of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], known as a [[Slater determinant]]:\n\n:<math>\\Psi^{(A)}_{n_1 \\cdots n_N} (x_1, \\cdots x_N)\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}} \\left|\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\psi_{n_1}(x_1) & \\psi_{n_1}(x_2) & \\cdots & \\psi_{n_1}(x_N) \\\\\n\\psi_{n_2}(x_1) & \\psi_{n_2}(x_2) & \\cdots & \\psi_{n_2}(x_N) \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\psi_{n_N}(x_1) & \\psi_{n_N}(x_2) & \\cdots & \\psi_{n_N}(x_N) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right|\n</math>\n===  The operator approach and parastatistics ===\n\nThe Hilbert space for <math>n</math> particles is given by the tensor product <math> \\otimes_n H </math>. The permutation group of <math> S_n </math> acts on this space by permuting the entries. By definition the expectation values for an observable <math>a</math> of <math>n</math> indistinguishable particles should be invariant under these permutation. This means that for all <math> \\psi \\in H </math> and <math> \\sigma \\in S_n </math>\n:<math>\n (\\sigma \\Psi )^t a  ( \\sigma \\Psi)   = \\Psi^t a \\Psi,\n</math>\nor equivalently for each <math> \\sigma \\in S_n </math>\n:<math>\n \\sigma^t a \\sigma = a \n</math>.\nTwo states are equivalent whenever their expectation values coincide for all observables. If we restrict to observables of  <math>n </math> identical particles, and hence observables satisfying the equation above, we find that the following states (after normalization) are equivalent\n:<math>\n \\Psi \\sim  \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\lambda_{\\sigma} \\sigma \\Psi\n</math>.\nThe equivalence classes are in [[bijective relation]] with irreducible subspaces of <math> \\otimes_n H </math> under <math> S_n </math>.\n\nTwo obvious irreducible subspaces are the one dimensional symmetric/bosonic subspace and anti-symmetric/fermionic subspace. There are however more types of irreducible subspaces. States associated with these other irreducible subspaces are called [[Parastatistics|parastatistic states]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bach|first=Alexaner|date=1993|title=Classification of Indistinguishable Particles|url=|journal=[[Europhysics Letters]]|volume=21|pages=515|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/21/5/002|via=|bibcode=1993EL.....21..515B}}</ref>  [[Young tableau#Applications in representation theory|Young tableaux]] provide a way to classify all of these irreducible subspaces.\n\n== Statistical properties ==\n\n\n=== Statistical effects of indistinguishability ===\n\nThe indistinguishability of particles has a profound effect on their statistical properties. To illustrate this, consider a system of ''N'' distinguishable, non-interacting particles. Once again, let ''n''<sub>''j''</sub> denote the state (i.e. quantum numbers) of particle ''j''. If the particles have the same physical properties, the ''n''<sub>''j''</sub>'s run over the same range of values. Let ''\u03b5''(''n'') denote the [[energy]] of a particle in state ''n''. As the particles do not interact, the total energy of the system is the sum of the single-particle energies. The [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system is\n\n:<math> Z = \\sum_{n_1, n_2, \\cdots n_N} \\exp\\left\\{ -\\frac{1}{kT} \\left[ \\varepsilon(n_1) + \\varepsilon(n_2) + \\cdots + \\varepsilon(n_N) \\right] \\right\\} </math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]].  This expression can be [[factorization|factored]] to obtain\n\n:<math> Z = \\xi^N </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\xi = \\sum_n \\exp\\left[ - \\frac{\\varepsilon(n)}{kT} \\right].</math>\n\nIf the particles are identical, this equation is incorrect. Consider a state of the system, described by the single particle states [''n''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''n''<sub>''N''</sub>]. In the equation for ''Z'', every possible permutation of the ''n'''s occurs once in the sum, even though each of these permutations is describing the same multi-particle state.  Thus, the number of states has been over-counted.\n\nIf the possibility of overlapping states is neglected, which is valid if the temperature is high, then the number of times each state is counted is approximately ''N''<nowiki>!</nowiki>. The correct partition function is\n\n:<math> Z = \\frac{\\xi^N}{N!}.</math>\n\nNote that this \"high temperature\" approximation does not distinguish between fermions and bosons.\n\nThe discrepancy in the partition functions of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles was known as far back as the 19th century, before the advent of quantum mechanics. It leads to a difficulty known as the [[Gibbs paradox]]. [[Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] showed that in the equation ''Z'' = ''\u03be''<sup>''N''</sup>, the [[entropy (thermodynamics)|entropy]] of a classical [[ideal gas]] is\n\n:<math>S = N k \\ln \\left(V\\right) + N f(T)</math>\n\nwhere ''V'' is the [[volume]] of the gas and ''f'' is some function of ''T'' alone. The problem with this result is that ''S'' is not [[Extensive variable|extensive]] \u2013 if ''N'' and ''V'' are doubled, ''S'' does not double accordingly. Such a system does not obey the postulates of [[thermodynamics]].\n\nGibbs also showed that using ''Z'' = ''\u03be''<sup>''N''</sup>/''N''! alters the result to\n\n:<math>S = N k \\ln \\left(\\frac{V}{N}\\right) + N f(T)</math>\n\nwhich is perfectly extensive. However, the reason for this correction to the partition function remained obscure until the discovery of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\n=== Statistical properties of bosons and fermions ===\n\nThere are important differences between the statistical behavior of bosons and fermions, which are described by [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] and [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] respectively. Roughly speaking, bosons have a tendency to clump into the same quantum state, which underlies phenomena such as the [[laser]], [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]], and [[superfluid]]ity. Fermions, on the other hand, are forbidden from sharing quantum states, giving rise to systems such as the [[Fermi gas]].  This is known as the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and is responsible for much of chemistry, since the electrons in an atom (fermions) successively fill the many states within [[Electron shell|shells]] rather than all lying in the same lowest energy state.\n\nThe differences between the statistical behavior of fermions, bosons, and distinguishable particles can be illustrated using a system of two particles. The particles are designated A and B. Each particle can exist in two possible states, labelled <math>|0\\rangle</math> and <math>|1\\rangle</math>, which have the same energy.\n\nThe composite system can evolve in time, interacting with a noisy environment. Because the <math>|0\\rangle</math> and <math>|1\\rangle</math> states are energetically equivalent, neither state is favored, so this process has the effect of randomizing the states. (This is discussed in the article on [[quantum entanglement]].) After some time, the composite system will have an equal probability of occupying each of the states available to it. The particle states are then measured.\n\nIf A and B are distinguishable particles, then the composite system has four distinct states: <math>|0\\rangle|0\\rangle</math>, <math>|1\\rangle|1\\rangle</math>, <math>|0\\rangle|1\\rangle</math>, and <math>|1\\rangle|0\\rangle</math>. The probability of obtaining two particles in the <math>|0\\rangle</math> state is 0.25; the probability of obtaining two particles in the <math>|1\\rangle</math> state is 0.25; and the probability of obtaining one particle in the <math>|0\\rangle</math> state and the other in the <math>|1\\rangle</math> state is 0.5.\n\nIf A and B are identical bosons, then the composite system has only three distinct states: <math>|0\\rangle|0\\rangle</math>, <math>|1\\rangle|1\\rangle</math>, and <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle|1\\rangle + |1\\rangle|0\\rangle)</math>. When the experiment is performed, the probability of obtaining two particles in the <math>|0\\rangle</math> state is now 0.33; the probability of obtaining two particles in the <math>|1\\rangle</math> state is 0.33; and the probability of obtaining one particle in the <math>|0\\rangle</math> state and the other in the <math>|1\\rangle</math> state is 0.33. Note that the probability of finding particles in the same state is relatively larger than in the distinguishable case. This demonstrates the tendency of bosons to \"clump.\"\n\nIf A and B are identical fermions, there is only one state available to the composite system: the totally antisymmetric state <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle|1\\rangle - |1\\rangle|0\\rangle)</math>. When the experiment is performed, one particle is always in the <math>|0\\rangle</math> state and the other is in the <math>|1\\rangle</math> state.\n\nThe results are summarized in Table 1:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\"\n|+ Table 1: Statistics of two particles\n|-\n! Particles!!Both 0!!Both 1!!One 0 and one 1\n|-\n| Distinguishable|| align=center |0.25|| align=center |0.25|| align=center |0.5\n|-\n| Bosons|| align=center |0.33|| align=center |0.33|| align=center |0.33\n|-\n| Fermions|| align=center |0|| align=center |0|| align=center |1\n|} \n\nAs can be seen, even a system of two particles exhibits different statistical behaviors between distinguishable particles, bosons, and fermions. In the articles on [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]], these principles are extended to large number of particles, with qualitatively similar results.\n\n==The homotopy class==\n{{See also|Homotopy|Braid statistics}}\n\nTo understand why particle statistics work the way that they do, note first that particles are point-localized excitations and that particles that are spacelike separated do not interact. In a flat ''d''-dimensional space ''M'', at any given time, the configuration of two identical particles can be specified as an element of ''M'' &times; ''M''. If there is no overlap between the particles, so that they do not interact directly, then their locations must belong to the space {{nobreak|[''M'' &times; ''M'']/{coincident points},}} the subspace with coincident points removed. The element {{nobreak|(<var>x</var>,\u2009<var>y</var>)}} describes the configuration with particle I at <var>x</var> and particle II at <var>y</var>, while {{nobreak|(<var>y</var>,\u2009<var>x</var>)}} describes the interchanged configuration. With identical particles, the state described by {{nobreak|(<var>x</var>,\u2009<var>y</var>)}} ought to be indistinguishable from the state described by {{nobreak|(<var>y</var>,\u2009<var>x</var>)}}. Now consider the [[homotopy class]] of continuous paths from {{nobreak|(<var>x</var>,\u2009<var>y</var>)}} to {{nobreak|(<var>y</var>,\u2009<var>x</var>)}}, within the space {{nobreak|[''M'' &times; ''M'']/{coincident points} }}. If ''M'' is '''R'''<sup>''d''</sup> where {{nobreak|''d'' \u2265 3}}, then this homotopy class only has one element. If ''M'' is '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, then this homotopy class has countably many elements (i.e. a counterclockwise interchange by half a turn, a counterclockwise interchange by one and a half turns, two and a half turns, etc., a clockwise interchange by half a turn, etc.). In particular, a counterclockwise interchange by half a turn is ''not'' [[homotopic]] to a clockwise interchange by half a turn. Lastly, if ''M'' is '''R''', then this homotopy class is empty.\n\nSuppose first that {{nobreak|''d'' \u2265 3}}. The [[universal covering space]] of {{nobreak|[''M'' &times; ''M'']/{coincident points},}} which is none other than {{nobreak|[''M'' &times; ''M'']/{coincident points} }} itself, only has two points which are physically indistinguishable from {{nobreak|(<var>x</var>,\u2009<var>y</var>)}}, namely {{nobreak|(<var>x</var>,\u2009<var>y</var>)}} itself and {{nobreak|(<var>y</var>,\u2009<var>x</var>)}}. So, the only permissible interchange is to swap both particles. This interchange is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], so its only effect is to multiply the phase by a square root of 1. If the root is +1, then the points have Bose statistics, and if the root is &minus;1, the points have Fermi statistics.\n\nIn the case ''M'' = '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, the universal covering space of {{nobreak|[''M'' &times; ''M'']/{coincident points} }} has infinitely many points that are physically indistinguishable from {{nobreak|(<var>x</var>,\u2009<var>y</var>)}}. This is described by the infinite [[cyclic group]] generated by making a counterclockwise half-turn interchange. Unlike the previous case, performing this interchange twice in a row does not recover the original state; so such an interchange can generically result in a multiplication by exp(''i\u03b8'') for any real ''\u03b8'' (by [[unitarity]], the absolute value of the multiplication must be 1). This is called [[anyon]]ic statistics. In fact, even with two ''distinguishable'' particles, even though {{nobreak|(<var>x</var>,\u2009<var>y</var>)}} is now physically distinguishable from {{nobreak|(<var>y</var>,\u2009<var>x</var>)}}, the universal covering space still contains infinitely many points which are physically indistinguishable from the original point, now generated by a counterclockwise rotation by one full turn. This generator, then, results in a multiplication by exp(''i\u03c6''). This phase factor here is called the [[mutual statistics]].\n\nFinally, in the case ''M'' = '''R''', the space {{nobreak|[''M'' &times; ''M'']/{coincident points} }} is not connected, so even if particle I and particle II are identical, they can still be distinguished via labels such as \"the particle on the left\" and \"the particle on the right\". There is no interchange symmetry here.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Quasi-set theory]]\n* [[DeBroglie hypothesis]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Tuckerman|first=Mark|title=Statistical Mechanics|year=2010|isbn=978-0198525264}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.av8n.com/physics/exchange.htm Exchange of Identical and Possibly Indistinguishable Particles] by John S.

Researchers, however, determined that this visual examination of the bladder wall after stretching the bladder was not specific for IC/BPS<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacDiarmid |first1=SA |last2=Sand |first2=PK |title=Diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome in Patients With Overactive Bladder Symptoms |journal=Reviews in Urology |volume=9 |issue=1|pages=9\u201316 |year=2007|pmid=17396167 |pmc=1832106}}</ref> and that the test, itself, can contribute to the development of small [[glomerulation]]s ([[petechia]]l hemorrhages) often found in IC/BPS. Thus, a diagnosis of IC/BPS is one of exclusion, as well as a review of clinical symptoms.\n\nIn 2006, the ESSIC society proposed more rigorous and demanding diagnostic methods with specific classification criteria so that it cannot be confused with other, similar conditions. Specifically, they require that a patient must have pain associated with the bladder, accompanied by one other urinary symptom. Thus, a patient with just frequency or urgency would be excluded from a diagnosis. Secondly, they strongly encourage the exclusion of confusable diseases through an extensive and expensive series of tests including (A) a [[medical history]] and [[Physical examination|physical exam]], (B) a dipstick [[urinalysis]], various urine cultures, and a serum [[Prostate-specific antigen|PSA]] in men over 40, (C) flowmetry and post-void residual urine volume by [[ultrasound scan]]ning and (D) cystoscopy. A diagnosis of IC/BPS would be confirmed with a hydrodistention during cystoscopy with biopsy.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nThey also propose a ranking system based upon the physical findings in the bladder.<ref name=pmid19808225/> Patients would receive a numeric and letter based score based upon the severity of their disease as found during the hydrodistention. A score of 1\u20133 would relate to the severity of the disease and a rating of A\u2013C represents biopsy findings. Thus, a patient with 1A would have very mild symptoms and disease while a patient with 3C would have the worst possible symptoms.

For many years it was known as ICI Mond Division but later became part of the ICI Chemicals and Polymers Division. The Runcorn site was also responsible for the development of the HiGEE and Spinning Disc Reactor concepts. These were originated by Professor Colin Ramshaw and led to the concept of [[Micro process engineering|Process Intensification]]; research into these novel technologies is now being pursued by the Process Intensification Group at [[Newcastle University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccdcindia.com/index2.php?act=service&sub=1 |title=Process Intensification |publisher=Ccdcindia.com |accessdate=27 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AUncqceC?url=http://www.ccdcindia.com/index2.php?act=service |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Winnington and Wallerscote (in [[Northwich]], Cheshire): It was here that ICI manufactured [[sodium carbonate]] (soda ash) and its various by-products such as [[sodium bicarbonate]] (bicarbonate of soda), and [[sodium sesquicarbonate]]. The Winnington site, built in 1873 by the entrepreneurs [[John Tomlinson Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]], was also the base for the former company Brunner, Mond & Co. Ltd. and, after the merger which created ICI, the powerful and influential Alkali Division.

The laboratory where polythene was discovered was sold off and the building became home to a variety of businesses including a go-kart track and paintballing, and the Winnington Works were divested to the newly formed company, [[Brunner Mond]], in 1991. It was again sold in 2006, to Tata (an Indian-based company) and in 2011 was re branded as Tata Chemicals Europe. The Winnington plant closed in February 2014, with the last shift on 2 February bringing to a close 140 years of soda ash production in this Northwich site.{{citation needed |date=April 2014}}\n* [[Ardeer, Scotland|Ardeer]] (in [[Stevenston]], Ayrshire): ICI Nobel used the site to manufacture [[dynamite]] and other explosives and [[nitrocellulose]]-based products.

The launch of the airline followed a burst of air route surveying in the [[British Empire]] after the [[First World War]], and after some experimental (and often dangerous) long-distance flying to the margins of Empire.<ref name=\"Pirie\">Pirie, 2009</ref>\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Tanken van een vliegtuig Airplane provided with fuel.jpg|thumb|Handley Page W.8b inherited from [[Handley Page Transport]] when Imperial Airways was formed]]\nImperial Airways was created against a background of stiff competition from French and German airlines that enjoyed heavy government subsidies and following the advice of the government's Hambling Committee (formally known as the C.A.T Subsidies Committee) under [[Herbert Hambling|Sir Herbert Hambling]].<ref name=Ord-Hume1>Ord-Hume, 2010, pp.7\u20139</ref> The committee, set up on 2 January 1923, produced a report on 15 February 1923 recommending that four of the largest existing airlines, the [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], owned by shipping magnate [[Samuel Instone]], [[Noel Pemberton Billing]]'s [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigatio]]n (part of the [[Supermarine]] flying-boat company), the [[Daimler Airway]], under the management of George Edward Woods, and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], should be merged.<ref name=Ord-Hume2>Ord-Hume, 2010, p.10</ref><ref name=bluffield>{{cite book|title=Over Empires and Oceans: Pioneers, Aviators and Adventurers - Forging the International Air Routes 1918-1939|last=Bluffield|first=Robert|publisher=Tattered Flag|date=19 November 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JaPBQAAQBAJ}}</ref>\nIt was hoped that this would create a company which could compete against French and German competition and would be strong enough to develop Britain's external air services while minimizing government subsidies for duplicated services. With this in view, a \u00a31m subsidy over ten years was offered to encourage the merger. Agreement was made between the President of the [[Air Council]] and the British, Foreign and Colonial Corporation on 3 December 1923 for the company, under the title of the 'Imperial Air Transport Company' to acquire existing air transport services in the UK. The agreement set out the government subsidies for the new company: \u00a3137,000 in the first year diminishing to \u00a332,000 in the tenth year as well as minimum mileages to be achieved and penalties if these weren't met.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1924/1924%20-%200005.html Terms of Agreement Published] ''Flight'', 1924.</ref>\n\nImperial Airways Limited was formed on 31 March 1924 with equipment from each contributing concern: British Marine Air Navigation Company Ltd, the Daimler Airway, Handley Page Transport Ltd and the Instone Air Line Ltd.  [[Eric Campbell Geddes|Sir Eric Geddes]] was appointed the chairman of the board with one director from each of the merged companies. The government had appointed two directors, [[Herbert Hambling|Hambling]] (who was also President of the [[Institute of Bankers]]) and Major [[John Hills (politician)|John Hills]], a former Treasury Financial Secretary.<ref name=bluffield/>\n\nThe land operations were based at [[Croydon Airport]] to the south of [[London]]. IAL immediately discontinued its predecessors' service to points north of London, the airline being focused on international and imperial service rather than domestic. Thereafter the only IAL aircraft operating  'North of Watford' were charter flights.\n\nIndustrial troubles with the pilots delayed the start of services until 26 April 1924, when a daily London\u2013Paris route was opened with a [[de Havilland DH.34]].<ref name=DH34>Stroud, June 1984, pp. 315\u201319</ref> Thereafter the task of expanding the routes between England and the Continent began, with Southampton\u2013Guernsey on 1 May 1924, London-Brussels\u2013Cologne on 3 May, London\u2013Amsterdam on 2 June 1924, and a summer service from London\u2013Paris\u2013Basel\u2013Z\u00fcrich on 17 June 1924. The first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the [[Handley Page W8f]] ''City of Washington'', delivered on 3 November 1924.<ref>http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/imperial%20airways.htm</ref> In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.\n\n==Empire services==\n\n===Route proving===\nBetween 16 November 1925 and 13 March 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] made an Imperial Airways' route survey flight from the UK to Cape Town and back in the [[Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar]]\u2013powered [[de Havilland DH.50|de Havilland DH.50J]] floatplane ''G-EBFO''.

The flight reached Karachi on 6 January 1927 and Delhi on 8 January 1927. The aircraft was named by Lady Irwin, wife of the Viceroy, on 10 January 1927. The return flight left on 1 February 1927 and arrived at Heliopolis, Cairo on 7 February 1927.

The route was extended as far as Delhi on 29 December 1929. The route across Europe and the Mediterranean changed many times over the next few years but almost always involved a rail journey.\n[[File:Imperial_Airways_Ad_1936.jpg|thumb|left|A 1936 advertisement]]\nIn April 1931 an experimental London-[[Australia]] air mail flight took place; the mail was transferred at the [[Dutch East Indies]], and took 26 days in total to reach [[Sydney]]. For the passenger flight leaving London on 1 October 1932, the Eastern route was switched from the Persian to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, and [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners were introduced on the Cairo to Karachi sector. The move saw the establishment of an airport and rest house, [[Al Mahatta Fort]], in the [[Trucial States|Trucial State]] of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] now part of the [[United Arab Emirates]].\n\nOn 29 May 1933 an England to Australia survey flight took off, operated by Imperial Airways [[Armstrong Whitworth Atalanta]] G-ABTL ''Astraea''. Major H G Brackley, Imperial Airways' Air Superintendent, was in charge of the flight. ''Astraea'' flew [[Croydon Airport|Croydon]]-[[Paris]]-[[Lyon]]-[[Rome]]-[[Brindisi]]-[[Athens]]-[[Alexandria]]-[[Cairo]] where it followed the normal route to [[Karachi]] then onwards to [[Jodhpur]]-[[Delhi]]-[[Kolkata|Calcutta]]-[[Sittwe|Akyab]]-[[Yangon|Rangoon]]-[[Bangkok]]-[[Prachuap Khiri Khan|Prachuab]]-[[Alor Setar]]-[[Singapore]]-[[Palembang]]-[[Jakarta|Batavia]]-[[Surabaya|Sourabaya]]-[[Bima]]-[[Kupang|Koepang]]-[[Bathurst Island Airport|Bathurst Island]]-[[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]-[[Newcastle Waters]]-[[Camooweal]]-[[Cloncurry]]-[[Longreach]]-[[Roma, Queensland|Roma]]-[[Toowoomba]] reaching [[Eagle Farm Airport|Eagle Farm, Brisbane]] on 23 June. Sydney was visited on 26 June, Canberra on 28 June and Melbourne on 29 June.\n\nThere followed a rapid eastern extension. The first London to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] service departed on 1 July 1933, the first London to [[Rangoon]] service on 23 September 1933, the first London to [[Singapore]] service on 9 December 1933, and the first London to [[Brisbane]] service on 8 December 1934, with [[Qantas]] responsible for the Singapore to Brisbane sector. (The 1934 start was for mail; passenger flights to Brisbane began the following April.) The first London to [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.\n\n===The Africa Route===\n[[File:De Havilland Hercules.jpg|thumb|right|de Havilland Hercules ''City of Cairo'']]\nOn 28 February 1931 a weekly service began between London and Mwanza on Lake Victoria in [[Tanganyika]] as part of the proposed route to [[Cape Town]]. On 9 December 1931 the Imperial Airways' service for Central Africa was extended experimentally to Cape Town for the carriage of Christmas mail. The aircraft used on the last sector, DH66 G-AARY ''City of Karachi'' arrived in Cape Town on 21 December 1931. On 20 January 1932 a mail-only route to London to Cape Town was opened. On 27 April this route was opened to passengers and took 10 days. In early 1933 [[Armstrong Whitworth Atalanta|Atalanta]]s replaced the DH.66s on the Kisumu to Cape Town sector of the London to Cape Town route.<ref name=Atalanta>Stroud, June 1986, pp.321\u2013326</ref> On 9 February 1936 the trans-Africa route was opened by Imperial Airways between Khartoum and [[Kano]] in Nigeria.

The journey to the Cape was via [[Marseille]], [[Rome]], [[Brindisi]], [[Athens]], [[Alexandria]], [[Khartoum]], [[Port Bell]], [[Kisumu]] and onwards by land-based craft to [[Nairobi]], [[Mbeya]] and eventually [[Cape Town]]. Survey flights were also made across the [[Atlantic]] and to [[New Zealand]]. By mid-1937 Imperial had completed its thousandth service to the Empire. Starting in 1938 Empire flying boats also flew between Britain and Australia via India and the Middle East.\n\nIn March 1939 three Shorts a week left Southampton for Australia, reaching Sydney after ten days of flying and nine overnight stops. Three more left for South Africa, taking six flying days to Durban.\n\n===Passengers===\nImperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers; about 50,000 passengers used Imperial Airways in the 1930s. Most passengers on intercontinental routes or on services within and between British colonies were men doing colonial administration, business or research. To begin with only the wealthy could afford to fly, but passenger lists gradually diversified. Travel experiences related to flying low and slow, and were reported enthusiastically in newspapers, magazines and books.<ref name=Cultures>Pirie, 2012</ref> There was opportunity for sightseeing from the air and at stops.<ref>Pirie, G.H. Incidental tourism: British imperial air travel in the 1930s.

Specialist engineers and inspectors \u2013 and ground crew on rotation or leave \u2013 travelled on the airline without generating any seat revenue. Several air crew lost their lives in accidents. At the end of the 1930s crew numbers approximated 3,000. All crew were expected to be ambassadors for Britain and the British Empire.<ref name=Cultures>Pirie, 2012</ref>\n\n===Air Mail===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:FAM 18 Round the World 1939.jpg|thumb|right|Flown cover carried around the world on PAA Boeing 314 Clippers and Imperial Airways Short S23 flying boats 24 June-28 July 1939]]\nIn 1934 the Government began negotiations with Imperial Airways to establish a service ([[Empire Air Mail Scheme]]) to carry mail by air on routes served by the airline. Indirectly these negotiations led to the dismissal in 1936 of Sir [[Christopher Bullock]], the [[Permanent Secretary|Permanent Under-Secretary]] at the [[Air Ministry]], who was found by a [[Board of Inquiry]] to have abused his position in seeking a position on the board of the company while these negotiations were in train. The Government, including the Prime Minister, regretted the decision to dismiss him, later finding that, in fact, no corruption was alleged and sought [[Christopher Bullock|Bullock's]] reinstatement which he declined.\n\nThe Empire [[Air Mail]] Programme started in July 1937, delivering anywhere for 1{{sfrac|1|2}} d./oz. By mid-1938 a hundred tons of mail had been delivered to India and a similar amount to Africa. In the same year, construction was started on the Empire Terminal in [[Victoria Station (London)|Victoria, London]], designed by A. Lakeman and with a statue by Eric Broadbent, ''Speed Wings Over the World'' gracing the portal above the main entrance. From the terminal there were train connections to Imperial's flying boats at [[Southampton]] and coaches to its landplane base at [[Croydon Airport]].

Pan American provided service from New York to Foynes (departing 24 June, via the first flight of Northern FAM 18) and Hong Kong to [[San Francisco]] (via FAM 14), and [[United Airlines]] carried it on the final leg from San Francisco to New York, arriving on 28 July.\n\nCaptain H.W.C.

Their testimony guides the jury, but they are not allowed to testify to the accused's criminal responsibility, as this is a matter for the jury to decide. Similarly, mental health practitioners are restrained from making a judgment on the issue of whether the defendant is or is not insane or what is known as the \"ultimate issue\".<ref name=\"shapirointer\">{{cite book\n|first=David L.\n|last=Shapiro\n|year=1991\n|title=Forensic Psychological Assessment: An Integrative Approach\n|edition=\n|publisher=Simon & Schuster\n|location=Needham Heights, MA\n|page=69\n|isbn= 0-205-12521-2}}</ref>\n\nSome jurisdictions require the evaluation to address the defendant's ability to control their behavior at the time of the offense (the volitional limb). A defendant claiming the defense is pleading \"'''not guilty by reason of insanity'''\" ('''NGRI''') or \"'''guilty but insane or mentally ill'''\" in some jurisdictions which, if successful, may result in the defendant being committed to a psychiatric facility for an indeterminate period.\n\n==Mitigating factors and diminished capacity==\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]] (in ''[[Penry v. Lynaugh]]'') and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] (in ''[[Bigby v. Dretke]]'') have been clear in their decisions that [[jury instructions]] in death penalty cases that do not ask about [[mitigating factor]]s regarding the defendant's [[mental health]] violate the defendant's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] rights, saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating factors.\n\nDiminished responsibility or diminished capacity can be employed as a mitigating factor or [[partial defense]] to crimes and, in the United States, is applicable to more circumstances than the insanity defense. The Homicide Act 1957 is the statutory basis for the defense of diminished responsibility in England and Wales, whereas in Scotland it is a product of case law. The number of findings of diminished responsibility has been matched by a fall in unfitness to plead and insanity findings (Walker, 1968). A plea of diminished capacity is different from a plea of insanity in that \"reason of insanity\" is a full defense while \"diminished capacity\" is merely a plea to a lesser crime.<ref name=Cornell>{{cite web|title=Diminished capacity, as opposed to not guilty by reason of insanity|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/insane/capacity.html|work=Legal Information Institute: Federal Law|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=19 December 2011|author=Legal Information Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008212843/http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/insane/capacity.html|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Non compos mentis==\n''Non compos mentis'' (Latin) is a legal term meaning \"not of sound mind\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/non+compos+mentis|title=I found great synonyms for \"non compos mentis\" on the new Thesaurus.com!|website=www.thesaurus.com|accessdate=2 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202190351/http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/non+compos+mentis|archivedate=2 February 2018|df=}}</ref> ''Non compos mentis'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''non'' meaning \"not\", ''compos'' meaning \"having command\" or \"composed\", and ''mentis'' ([[genitive]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] of ''[[mens]]''), meaning \"of mind\".

When trial by jury replaced this, the jury members were expected to find the insane guilty but then refer the case to the King for a Royal Pardon. From 1500 onwards, juries could acquit the insane, and detention required a separate civil procedure (Walker, 1985).<!--This citation needs to be in wiki format, not APA--> The [[Criminal Lunatics Act 1800]], passed with retrospective effect following the acquittal of [[James Hadfield]], mandated detention at the regent's pleasure (indefinitely) even for those who, although insane at the time of the offence, were now sane.\n\nThe [[M'Naghten Rules]] of 1843 were not a codification or definition of insanity but rather the responses of a panel of judges to hypothetical questions posed by Parliament in the wake of [[Daniel M'Naghten]]'s acquittal for the homicide of Edward Drummond, whom he mistook for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]].

The test, also called the Product Test, is broader than either the M'Naghten test or the [[irresistible impulse test]]. The test has more lenient guidelines for the insanity defense, but it addressed the issue of convicting mentally ill defendants, which was allowed under the M'Naghten Rule.<ref name=\"M'Naghten's case\"/> However, the Durham standard drew much criticism because of its expansive definition of legal insanity.\n\n====Model Penal Code test====\nThe [[Model Penal Code]], published by the American Law Institute, provides a standard for legal insanity that serves as a compromise between the strict M'Naghten Rule, the lenient Durham ruling, and the irresistible impulse test. Under the MPC standard, which represents the modern trend, a defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct \"if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks ''substantial capacity'' either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The test thus takes into account both the cognitive and volitional capacity of insanity.\n\n====Federal courts====\nAfter the [[John Hinckley, Jr.|perpetrator]] of [[Reagan assassination attempt|President Reagan's assassination attempt]] was found not guilty by reason of insanity, Congress passed the [[Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984]].  Under this act, the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] was shifted from the prosecution to the defense and the standard of evidence in federal trials was increased from a [[preponderance of the evidence|preponderance of evidence]] to [[clear and convincing evidence]].  The ALI test was discarded in favor of a new test that more closely resembled M'Naghten's. Under this new test only perpetrators suffering from severe mental illnesses at the time of the crime could successfully employ the insanity defense. The defendant's ability to control himself or herself was no longer a consideration.\n\nThe Act also curbed the scope of expert psychiatric testimony and adopted stricter procedures regarding the hospitalization and release of those found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\n====Guilty but mentally ill====\nAs an alternative to the insanity defense, some jurisdictions permit a defendant to plead guilty but mentally ill.<ref name=\"posthink\"/> A defendant who is found guilty but mentally ill may be sentenced to mental health treatment, at the conclusion of which the defendant will serve the remainder of his or her sentence in the same manner as any other defendant.<ref name=\"el\"/>\n\n===Burden of proof===\nIn a majority of states, the burden of proving insanity is placed on the defendant, who must prove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources (State Codes?) needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn a minority of states, the burden is placed on the prosecution, who must prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources (State Codes?) needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn federal court, and in Arizona, the burden is placed on the defendant, who must prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Attorneys' Manual, Criminal Resource Manual Sec. 638.

A Review Board is established under Part XX.1 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] and is composed of at least three members, a person who is a judge or eligible to be a judge, a psychiatrist and another expert in a relevant field, such as social work, criminology or psychology. Parties at a Review Board hearing are usually the accused, the Crown and the hospital responsible for the supervision or assessment of the accused. A Review Board is responsible for both accused persons found NCR or accused persons found unfit to stand trial on account of mental disorder. A Review Board dealing with an NCR offender must consider two questions: whether the accused is a \"significant threat to the safety of the public\" and, if so, what the \"least onerous and least restrictive\" restrictions on the liberty of the accused should be in order to mitigate such a threat. Proceedings before a Review Board are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Often the Review Board will be active in conducting an inquiry. Where the Review Board is unable to conclude that the accused is a significant threat to the safety of the public, the review board must grant the accused an absolute discharge, an order essentially terminating the jurisdiction of the criminal law over the accused. Otherwise the Review Board must order that the accused be either discharged subject to conditions or detained in a hospital, both subject to conditions. The conditions imposed must be the least onerous and least restrictive necessary to mitigate any danger the accused may pose to others.\n\nSince the Review Board is empowered under criminal law powers under s. 91(27) of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] the sole justification for its jurisdiction is public safety. Therefore, the nature of the inquiry is the danger the accused may pose to the public safety rather than whether the accused is \"cured.\" For instance, many \"sick\" accused persons are discharged absolutely on the basis that they are not a danger to the public while many \"sane\" accused are detained on the basis that they are dangerous. Moreover, the notion of \"significant threat to the safety of the public\" is a \"criminal threat.\" This means that the Review Board must find that the threat posed by the accused is of a criminal nature.\n\nWhile proceedings before a Review Board are less formal than in court, there are many procedural safe-guards available to the accused given the potential indefinite nature of Part XX.1. Any party may appeal against the decision of a Review Board.\n\nIn 1992 when the new mental disorder provisions were enacted, Parliament included \"capping\" provisions which were to be enacted at a later date. These capping provisions limited the jurisdiction of a Review Board over an accused based on the maximum potential sentence had the accused been convicted (e.g. there would be a cap of 5 years if the maximum penalty for the index offence is 5 years). However, these provisions were never proclaimed into force and were subsequently repealed.\n\nA Review Board must hold a hearing every 12 months (unless extended to 24 months) until the accused is discharged absolutely.\n\n===Accused unfit to stand trial===\nThe issue of mental disorder may also come into play before a trial even begins, if the accused's mental state prevents the accused from being able to appreciate the nature of a trial and to conduct a defence.\n\nAn accused who is found to be unfit to stand trial is subject to the jurisdiction a Review Board. While the considerations are essentially the same, there are a few provisions which apply only to unfit accused. A Review Board must determine whether the accused is fit to stand trial. Regardless of the determination, the Review Board must then determine what conditions should be imposed on the accused, considering both the protection of the public and the maintenance of the fitness of the accused (or conditions which would render the accused fit). Previously an absolute discharge was unavailable to an unfit accused. However, in R. v. Demers, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down the provision restricting the availability of an absolute discharge to an accused person who is deemed both \"permanently unfit\" and not a significant threat to the safety of the public. Presently a Review Board may recommend a judicial stay of proceedings in the event that it finds the accused both \"permanently unfit\" and non-dangerous. The decision is left to the court having jurisdiction over the accused.\n\nAn additional requirement for an unfit accused is the holding of a \"prima facie case\" hearing every two years. The Crown must demonstrate to the court having jurisdiction over the accused that it still has sufficient evidence to try the accused. If the Crown fails to meet this burden then the accused is discharged and proceedings are terminated. The nature of the hearing is virtually identical to that of a [[preliminary hearing]].\n\n==Scottish law==\nThe Scottish Law Commission, in its Discussion Paper No 122 on Insanity and Diminished Responsibility (2003),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/dp122_insanity.pdf |title=Scottish Law Commission :: |publisher=Scotlawcom.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012535/http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/dp122_insanity.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-17 |df= }}</ref> pp.&nbsp;16/18, confirms that the law has not substantially changed from the position stated in Hume's Commentaries:\n:We may next attend to the case of those unfortunate persons, who have plead the miserable defense of idiocy or insanity. Which condition, if it is not an assumed or imperfect, but a genuine and thorough insanity, and is proved by the testimony of intelligent witnesses, makes the act like that of an infant, and equally bestows the privilege of an entire exemption from any manner of pain; ''Cum alterum innocentia concilii tuetur, alterum fati infelicitas excusat''. I say, where the insanity is absolute, and is duly proved: For if reason and humanity enforce the plea in these circumstances, it is no less necessary to observe a caution and reserve in applying the law, as shall hinder it from being understood, that there is any privilege in a case of mere weakness of intellect, or a strange and moody humor, or a crazy and capricious or irritable temper. In none of these situations does or can the law excuse the offender. Because such constitutions are not exclusive of a competent understanding of the true state of the circumstances in which the deed is done, nor of the subsistence of some steady and evil passion, grounded in those circumstances, and directed to a certain object. To serve the purpose of a defense in law, the disorder must therefore amount to an absolute alienation of reason, ''ut continua mentis alienatione, omni intellectu careat'' - such a disease as deprives the patient of the knowledge of the true aspect and position of things about him - hinders him from distinguishing friend from foe - and gives him up to the impulse of his own distempered fancy.\nThe phrase \"absolute alienation of reason\" is still regarded as at the core of the defense in the modern law (see ''HM Advocate v Kidd'' (1960) JC 61 and ''Brennan v HM Advocate'' (1977)\n\n==Nordic countries==\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], insanity is not a defense; instead, it is the responsibility of the court system as such to consider whether the accused may have been psychotic or suffering from other severe mental defects when perpetrating the criminal act. This explains why, in Norway, the court considered the sanity of [[Anders Behring Breivik]], even if he himself declared to be sane.\n\nRules differ between Nordic countries.\n\nIn Sweden, psychotic perpetrators are seen as accountable, but the sanction is, if they are psychotic at the time of the trial, forensic mental care.<ref>{{cite web|last=Silfverhielm|first=Helena|title=Concepts and Procedures in the Member States \u2013 Sweden|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/promotion/fp_promotion_2002_frep_15_en.pdf|work=Salize & Dressing (2005Placement and Treatment of Mentally Ill Offenders \u2013 Legislation and Practice in EU Member States.

Instead of prison, they are sentenced to mandatory treatment. Still, important differences exist between Norway and Denmark.\n\nIn Norway, \u00a744 of the penal code states specifically that \"a person who at the time of the crime was insane or unconscious is not punished\".<ref name=\"Penal Code of Norway\">{{cite web|title=LOV 1902-05-22 nr 10: Almindelig borgerlig Straffelov (Straffeloven)|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19020522-010.html|publisher=Lovdata|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn Denmark, \u00a716 of the penal code states that \"Persons, who, at the time of the act, were irresponsible owing to mental illness or similar conditions or\nto a pronounced mental deficiency, are not punishable\".<ref name=Kramp>{{cite web|last=Kramp|first=Peter|title=Concepts and Procedures in the Member States \u2013 Denmark|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/promotion/fp_promotion_2002_frep_15_en.pdf|work=Salize & Dressing (2005): Placement and Treatment of Mentally Ill Offenders \u2013 Legislation and Practice in EU Member States|publisher=EU Commission|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608053719/http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/promotion/fp_promotion_2002_frep_15_en.pdf|archivedate=June 8, 2013|df=}}</ref> This means that in Denmark, 'insanity' is a legal term rather than a medical term and that the court retains the authority to decide whether an accused person is irresponsible or not.<ref name=\"Kramp\"/><ref name=Sparr>{{cite web|last=Sparr|first=Landy F.|title=Personality Disorders and Criminal Law: An International Perspective|url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/37/2/168.full|work=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online|publisher=American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|date=June 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413212030/http://www.jaapl.org/content/37/2/168.full|archivedate=2013-04-13|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn Finland, punishments can only be administered if the accused is ''[[compos mentis]]'', of sound mind; not if the accused is insane (''syyntakeeton'', literally \"unable to guarantee [shoulder the responsibility of] guilt\"). Thus, an insane defendant may be [[Corpus delicti|found guilty based on the facts]] and his actions just as a sane defendant, but the insanity will only affect the punishment. The definition of insanity is similar to the M'Naught criterion above: \"the accused is insane, if during the act, due to a mental illness, profound mental retardation or a severe disruption of mental health or consciousness, he cannot understand the actual nature of his act or its illegality, or that his ability to control his behavior is critically weakened\". If an accused is suspected to be insane, the court must consult the [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|National Institute for Health and Welfare]] (THL), which is obliged to place the accused in [[involuntary commitment]] if he is found insane. The offender receives no judicial punishment; he becomes a patient under the jurisdiction of THL, and must be released immediately once the conditions of involuntary commitment are no longer fulfilled. Diminished responsibility is also available, resulting in lighter sentences.\n\n==Usage and success rate==\nThis increased coverage gives the impression that the defense is widely used, but this is not the case. According to an eight-state study, the insanity defense is used in less than 1% of all court cases and, when used, has only a 26% success rate.<ref name=\"Schmalleger\"/>  Of those cases that were successful, 90% of the defendants had been previously diagnosed with mental illness.<ref name=\"Schmalleger\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Settled insanity]]\n*''[[Frendak v.

From the middle of the 18th century, some discussed ice as a means of transport. The Swedish mining expert Daniel Tilas (1712\u20131772) was, in 1742, the first person to suggest drifting sea ice in order to explain the presence of erratic boulders in the Scandinavian and Baltic regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|p=38}}</ref> In 1795, the Scottish philosopher and gentleman naturalist, [[James Hutton]] (1726\u20131797), explained erratic boulders in the Alps by the action of glaciers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|pp=61\u20132}}</ref> Two decades later, in 1818, the Swedish botanist [[G\u00f6ran Wahlenberg]] (1780\u20131851) published his theory of a glaciation of the Scandinavian peninsula.

When he read his paper before the [[Academy of Natural Sciences Switzerland|Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft]], most scientists remained sceptical.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|pp=104\u201305}}</ref> Finally, Venetz convinced his friend Jean de Charpentier. De Charpentier transformed Venetz's idea into a theory with a glaciation limited to the Alps. His thoughts resembled Wahlenberg's theory. In fact, both men shared the same volcanistic, or in de Charpentier's case rather [[plutonism|plutonistic]] assumptions, about the Earth's history. In 1834, de Charpentier presented his paper before the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|pp=150\u201353}}</ref> In the meantime, the German botanist [[Karl Friedrich Schimper]] (1803\u20131867) was studying mosses which were growing on erratic boulders in the alpine upland of Bavaria. He began to wonder where such masses of stone had come from. During the summer of 1835 he made some excursions to the Bavarian Alps. Schimper came to the conclusion that ice must have been the means of transport for the boulders in the alpine upland. In the winter of 1835 to 1836 he held some lectures in Munich. Schimper then assumed that there must have been global times of obliteration (\"Ver\u00f6dungszeiten\") with a cold climate and frozen water.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|pp=155\u201359}}</ref> Schimper spent the summer months of 1836 at Devens, near Bex, in the Swiss Alps with his former university friend [[Louis Agassiz]] (1801\u20131873) and Jean de Charpentier. Schimper, de Charpentier and possibly Venetz convinced Agassiz that there had been a time of glaciation. During the winter of 1836/37, Agassiz and Schimper developed the theory of a sequence of glaciations. They mainly drew upon the preceding works of Venetz, de Charpentier and on their own fieldwork. Agassiz appears to have been already familiar with Bernhardi's paper at that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|pp=167\u201370}}</ref> At the beginning of 1837, Schimper coined the term \"ice age\" (''\"Eiszeit\"'') for the period of the glaciers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|p=173}}</ref> In July 1837 Agassiz presented their synthesis before the annual meeting of the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft at Neuch\u00e2tel.

Most contemporary scientists thought that the Earth had been gradually cooling down since its birth as a molten globe.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2008|pp=177\u201378}}</ref>\n\nIn order to overcome this rejection, Agassiz embarked on geological fieldwork.

This happened on an international scale in the second half of the 1870s following the work of [[James Croll]], including the publication of ''Climate and Time, in Their Geological Relations'' in 1875, which provided a credible explanation for the causes of ice ages.<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00fcger|2013|pp=458\u201360}}</ref>\n\n==Evidence for ice ages==\nThere are three main types of evidence for ice ages: geological, chemical, and paleontological.\n\n'''Geological''' evidence for ice ages comes in various forms, including rock scouring and scratching, [[glacial moraine]]s, [[drumlin]]s, valley cutting, and the deposition of [[till]] or tillites and [[glacial erratic]]s. Successive glaciations tend to distort and erase the geological evidence, making it difficult to interpret. Furthermore, this evidence was difficult to date exactly; early theories assumed that the glacials were short compared to the long interglacials. The advent of sediment and ice cores revealed the true situation: glacials are long, interglacials short. It took some time for the current theory to be worked out.\n\nThe '''chemical''' evidence mainly consists of variations in the ratios of [[isotope]]s in fossils present in sediments and sedimentary rocks and ocean sediment cores. For the most recent glacial periods [[ice core]]s provide climate [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]] from their ice, and atmospheric samples from included bubbles of air. Because water containing heavier isotopes has a higher [[heat of evaporation]], its proportion decreases with colder conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |title=How are past temperatures determined from an ice core? |journal=Scientific American |date=2004-09-20 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-are-past-temperatures}}</ref> This allows a temperature record to be constructed. This evidence can be confounded, however, by other factors recorded by isotope ratios.\n\nThe '''paleontological''' evidence consists of changes in the geographical distribution of fossils. During a glacial period cold-adapted organisms spread into lower latitudes, and organisms that prefer warmer conditions become extinct or are squeezed into lower latitudes. This evidence is also difficult to interpret because it requires (1) sequences of sediments covering a long period of time, over a wide range of latitudes and which are easily correlated; (2) ancient organisms which survive for several million years without change and whose temperature preferences are easily diagnosed; and (3) the finding of the relevant fossils.\n\nDespite the difficulties, analysis of ice core and ocean sediment cores<ref>{{cite journal |title=Glacier advance in southern middle-latitudes during the Antarctic Cold Reversal |first1=Aaron E. |last1=Putnam |first2=George H. |last2=Denton |first3=Joerg M. |last3=Schaefer |first4=David J.

These also confirm the linkage between ice ages and continental crust phenomena such as glacial moraines, drumlins, and glacial erratics. Hence the continental crust phenomena are accepted as good evidence of earlier ice ages when they are found in layers created much earlier than the time range for which ice cores and ocean sediment cores are available.\n\n==Major ice ages==\n[[File:GlaciationsinEarthExistancelicenced annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=2.75|right|Timeline of glaciations, shown in blue.]]\nThere have been at least five major ice ages in the Earth's history (the [[Huronian]], [[Cryogenian]], [[Andean-Saharan]], [[Karoo Ice Age]], and the current [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary Ice Age]]).

It is named after the glacial tills found in the Karoo region of South Africa, where evidence for this ice age was first clearly identified. There were extensive polar [[ice cap]]s at intervals from 360 to 260 million years ago in South Africa during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian|early Permian]] Periods. Correlatives are known from Argentina, also in the center of the ancient supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]].\n\nThe [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary Glaciation / Quaternary Ice Age]] started about 2.58 million years ago at the beginning of the [[Quaternary|Quaternary Period]] when the spread of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere began. Since then, the world has seen cycles of glaciation with ice sheets advancing and retreating on 40,000- and 100,000-year time scales called [[glacial period]]s, glacials or glacial advances, and [[interglacial]] periods, interglacials or glacial retreats. The earth is currently in an interglacial, and the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago. All that remains of the continental [[ice sheet]]s are the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s and smaller glaciers such as on [[Baffin Island]].\n\nThe definition of the [[Quaternary]] as beginning 2.58 Ma is based on the formation of the [[Arctic ice cap]]. The [[Antarctic ice sheet]] began to form earlier, at about 34 Ma, in the mid-[[Cenozoic]] ([[Eocene\u2013Oligocene extinction event|Eocene-Oligocene Boundary]]). The term [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age]] is used to include this early phase.<ref name=\"UHCL\">University of Houston-Clear Lake - Disasters Class Notes - Chapter 12: Climate Change sce.uhcl.edu/Pitts/disastersclassnotes/chapter_12_Climate_Change.doc</ref>\n\nIce ages can be further divided by location and time; for example, the names ''Riss'' (180,000\u2013130,000 years [[Before Present|bp]]) and ''[[W\u00fcrm glaciation|W\u00fcrm]]'' (70,000\u201310,000 years bp) refer specifically to glaciation in the [[Alps|Alpine region]]. The maximum extent of the ice is not maintained for the full interval. The scouring action of each glaciation tends to remove most of the evidence of prior ice sheets almost completely, except in regions where the later sheet does not achieve full coverage.\n\n==Glacials and interglacials==\n{{See also|Glacial period|Interglacial}}\n[[File:Ice Age Temperature.png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Shows the pattern of temperature and ice volume changes associated with recent glacials and interglacials]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 230\n| header = Minimum and maximum glaciation\n| image1 = Iceage north-intergl glac hg.png\n| caption1 = Minimum (interglacial, black) and maximum (glacial, grey) glaciation of the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]]\n| image2 = Iceage south-intergl glac hg.png\n| caption2 = Minimum (interglacial, black) and maximum (glacial, grey) glaciation of the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]]\n}}\nWithin the ice ages (or at least within the current one), more temperate and more severe periods occur. The colder periods are called ''glacial periods'', the warmer periods ''interglacials'', such as the [[Eemian|Eemian Stage]].\n\nGlacials are characterized by cooler and drier climates over most of the earth and large land and sea ice masses extending outward from the poles. Mountain glaciers in otherwise unglaciated areas extend to lower elevations due to a lower [[snow line]]. Sea levels drop due to the removal of large volumes of water above sea level in the icecaps. There is evidence that ocean circulation patterns are disrupted by glaciations. Since the earth has significant continental glaciation in the Arctic and Antarctic, we are currently in a glacial minimum of a glaciation. Such a period between glacial maxima is known as an ''interglacial''. The glacials and interglacials also coincided with changes in Earth's orbit called [[Milankovitch cycles]].\n\nThe earth has been in an interglacial period known as the [[Holocene]] for around 11,700 years,<ref name=\"Walker, M. 2009. pp. 3\">{{cite journal |last1 = Walker |first1 = M. |last2 = Johnsen |first2 = S. |last3 = Rasmussen |first3 = S.

Hence, when the air temperature decreases, ice and snow fields grow, and this continues until competition with a negative feedback mechanism forces the system to an equilibrium. Also, the reduction in [[Boreal forest|forests]] caused by the ice's expansion increases albedo.\n\nAnother theory proposed by Ewing and Donn in 1956<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ewing, M.; Donn, W.L. |title=A Theory of Ice Ages |journal=Science |volume=123 |issue=3207 |pages=1061\u20136 |date=June 1956 |pmid=17748617 |doi=10.1126/science.123.3207.1061 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/123/3207/1061.long|bibcode = 1956Sci...123.1061E |last2=Donn}}</ref> hypothesized that an ice-free Arctic Ocean leads to increased snowfall at high latitudes. When low-temperature ice covers the Arctic Ocean there is little evaporation or [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and the polar regions are quite dry in terms of precipitation, comparable to the amount found in mid-latitude [[desert]]s. This low precipitation allows high-latitude snowfalls to melt during the summer. An ice-free Arctic Ocean absorbs solar radiation during the long summer days, and evaporates more water into the Arctic atmosphere. With higher precipitation, portions of this snow may not melt during the summer and so glacial ice can form at lower altitudes ''and'' more southerly latitudes, reducing the temperatures over land by increased albedo as noted above. Furthermore, under this hypothesis the lack of oceanic pack ice allows increased exchange of waters between the Arctic and the North Atlantic Oceans, warming the Arctic and cooling the North Atlantic. (Current projected consequences of [[global warming]] include a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5\u201320 years, see [[Arctic shrinkage]].) Additional fresh water flowing into the North Atlantic during a warming cycle may also [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation|reduce]] the [[Thermohaline circulation|global ocean water circulation]]. Such a reduction (by reducing the effects of the [[Gulf Stream]]) would have a cooling effect on northern Europe, which in turn would lead to increased low-latitude snow retention during the summer. It has also been suggested that during an extensive glacial, glaciers may move through the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], extending into the North Atlantic Ocean far enough to block the Gulf Stream.\n\n===Negative feedback processes===\nIce sheets that form during glaciations cause erosion of the land beneath them. After some time, this will reduce land above sea level and thus diminish the amount of space on which ice sheets can form. This mitigates the albedo feedback, as does the lowering in sea level that accompanies the formation of ice sheets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAnother factor is the increased aridity occurring with glacial maxima, which reduces the precipitation available to maintain glaciation. The glacial retreat induced by this or any other process can be amplified by similar [[inverse positive feedback]]s as for glacial advances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6KbgtwAACAAJ&dq=Another+factor+is+the+increased+aridity+occurring+with+glacial+maxima,+which+reduces+the+precipitation+available+to+maintain+glaciation.+The+glacial+retreat+induced+by+this+or+any+other+process+can+be+amplified+by+similar+inverse+positive+feedbacks+as+for+glacial+advances.|title=Glacial Geology: Ice Sheets and Landforms|last=Bennett|first=Matthew M.|last2=Glasser|first2=Neil F.|date=2010-03-29|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-51690-4|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAccording to research published in ''[[Nature Geoscience]]'', human emissions of [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)]] will defer the next ice age.

The consensus is that several factors are important: [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric composition]], such as the concentrations of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]] (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years); changes in the earth's orbit around the [[Sun]] known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]; the motion of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and [[ocean current]]s; variations in [[solar variation|solar output]]; the orbital dynamics of the Earth\u2013Moon system; the impact of relatively large [[meteorite]]s and volcanism including eruptions of [[supervolcano]]es.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Luthi|first=Dieter|title=High-resolution carbon dioxide concentration record 650,000\u2013800,000 years before present|journal=Nature|date=2008-03-17|volume=453|pages=379\u2013382|doi=10.1038/nature06949|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7193/full/nature06949.html|pmid=18480821|issue=7193|bibcode = 2008Natur.453..379L|display-authors=et al.}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSome of these factors influence each other.

The hypothesis also warns of future Snowball Earths.\n\nIn 2009, further evidence was provided that changes in solar [[insolation]] provide the initial trigger for the earth to warm after an Ice Age, with secondary factors like increases in greenhouse gases accounting for the magnitude of the change.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Peter U. |last=Clark |first2=Arthur S. |last2=Dyke |first3=Jeremy D. |last3=Shakun |first4=Anders E. |last4=Carlson |first5=Jorie |last5=Clark |first6=Barbara |last6=Wohlfarth |first7=Jerry X. |last7=Mitrovica |first8=Steven W. |last8=Hostetler |first9=A.

The consensus theory of the scientific community is that the resulting [[greenhouse effect]] is a principal cause of the increase in [[global warming]] which has occurred over the same period, and a chief contributor to the accelerated melting of the remaining [[glacier]]s and [[polar ice]].

It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the [[Milankovitch cycles]]. In his [[overdue-glaciation]] hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Anthropogenic Greenhouse Era Began Thousands of Years Ago |url=http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~avf5/teaching/Files_pdf/Ruddiman2003.pdf |author=Ruddiman, William F. |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/B:CLIM.0000004577.17928.fa |journal=Climatic Change |volume=61 |pages=261\u2013293 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416132256/http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~avf5/teaching/Files_pdf/Ruddiman2003.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAt a meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] (December 17, 2008), scientists detailed evidence in support of the controversial idea that the introduction of large-scale rice agriculture in Asia, coupled with extensive deforestation in Europe began to alter world climate by pumping significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the last 1,000 years. In turn, a warmer atmosphere heated the oceans making them much less efficient storehouses of carbon dioxide and reinforcing global warming, possibly forestalling the onset of a new glacial age.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/547541/ Did Early Climate Impact Divert a New Glacial Age?] Newswise, Retrieved on December 17, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Position of the continents===\nThe geological record appears to show that ice ages start when the continents are in [[Continental drift|positions]] which block or reduce the flow of warm water from the equator to the poles and thus allow ice sheets to form. The ice sheets increase Earth's [[albedo|reflectivity]] and thus reduce the absorption of solar radiation. With less radiation absorbed the atmosphere cools; the cooling allows the ice sheets to grow, which further increases reflectivity in a [[positive feedback]] loop. The ice age continues until the reduction in weathering causes an increase in the [[greenhouse effect]].\n\nThere are three main contributors from the layout of the continents that obstruct the movement of warm water to the poles:{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n* A continent sits on top of a pole, as [[Antarctica]] does today.\n* A polar sea is almost land-locked, as the Arctic Ocean is today.\n* A supercontinent covers most of the equator, as [[Rodinia]] did during the [[Cryogenian]] period.\n\nSince today's Earth has a continent over the South Pole and an almost land-locked ocean over the North Pole, geologists believe that Earth will continue to experience glacial periods in the geologically near future.\n\nSome scientists believe that the [[Himalayas]] are a major factor in the current ice age, because these mountains have increased Earth's total rainfall and therefore the rate at which carbon dioxide is washed out of the atmosphere, decreasing the greenhouse effect.<ref name=\"Raymo, Ruddiman\"/> The Himalayas' formation started about 70 million years ago when the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] collided with the [[Eurasian Plate]], and the Himalayas are still rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year because the Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67&nbsp;mm/year. The history of the Himalayas broadly fits the long-term decrease in Earth's average temperature since the [[Eocene|mid-Eocene]], 40 million years ago.\n\n===Fluctuations in ocean currents===\nAnother important contribution to ancient climate regimes is the variation of '''ocean currents''', which are modified by continent position, sea levels and salinity, as well as other factors. They have the ability to cool (e.g. aiding the creation of Antarctic ice) and the ability to warm (e.g. giving the British Isles a temperate as opposed to a boreal climate). The closing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] about 3 million years ago may have ushered in the present period of strong glaciation over North America by ending the exchange of water between the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1996/apr/weareallpanamani743 |title=We are all Panamanians |author=Svitil, K.A. |date=April 1996 |journal=Discover}}\u2014formation of Isthmus of Panama may have started a series of climatic changes that led to evolution of hominids</ref>\n\nAnalyses suggest that ocean current fluctuations can adequately account for recent glacial oscillations. During the last glacial period the sea-level has fluctuated 20\u201330&nbsp;m as water was sequestered, primarily in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] ice sheets. When ice collected and the sea level dropped sufficiently, flow through the [[Bering Strait]] (the narrow strait between Siberia and Alaska is about 50&nbsp;m deep today) was reduced, resulting in increased flow from the North Atlantic. This realigned the [[thermohaline circulation]] in the Atlantic, increasing heat transport into the Arctic, which melted the polar ice accumulation and reduced other continental ice sheets. The release of water raised sea levels again, restoring the ingress of colder water from the Pacific with an accompanying shift to northern hemisphere ice accumulation.<ref name=Hu2010>{{Cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Aixue |last2=Meehl |first2=Gerald A. |author2link=Gerald Meehl |last3=Otto-Bliesner |first3=Bette L. |last4=Waelbroeck |first4=Claire |author5=Weiqing Han |last6=Loutre |first6=Marie-France |last7=Lambeck |first7=Kurt |last8=Mitrovica |first8=Jerry X. |last9=Rosenbloom |first9=Nan |title=Influence of Bering Strait flow and North Atlantic circulation on glacial sea-level changes |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=118\u2013121 |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/ngeo729 |bibcode=2010NatGe...3..118H|url=http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/ccr/publications/ngeo729.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Uplift of the Tibetan plateau and surrounding mountain areas above the snowline===\n[[Matthias Kuhle]]'s geological theory of Ice Age development was suggested by the existence of an ice sheet covering the [[Tibetan Plateau]] during the Ice Ages ([[Last Glacial Maximum]]?). According to Kuhle, the plate-tectonic uplift of Tibet past the snow-line has led to a surface of c. 2,400,000 square kilometres (930,000 sq mi) changing from bare land to ice with a 70% greater [[albedo]]. The reflection of energy into space resulted in a global cooling, triggering the [[Pleistocene]] Ice Age. Because this highland is at a subtropical latitude, with 4 to 5 times the insolation of high-latitude areas, what would be Earth's strongest heating surface has turned into a cooling surface.\n\nKuhle explains the [[interglacial]] periods by the 100,000-year cycle of radiation changes due to variations in Earth's orbit. This comparatively insignificant warming, when combined with the lowering of the Nordic inland ice areas and Tibet due to the weight of the superimposed ice-load, has led to the repeated complete thawing of the inland ice areas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhle, Matthias |chapter=The Pleistocene Glaciation of [[Tibet]] and the Onset of Ice Ages \u2014 An Autocycle Hypothesis |title=Tibet and High-Asia: Results of the Sino-German Joint Expeditions (I) |journal=GeoJournal |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=581\u2013595 |date=December 1988 |jstor=41144345}}</ref><ref>2c (Quaternary Glaciation \u2014 Extent and Chronology, Part III: South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica{{cite book |author=Kuhle, M. |chapter=The High Glacial (Last Ice Age and LGM) ice cover in High and Central Asia |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xpIEPH7RW4C&pg=PA175 |editor1=Ehlers, J. |editor2=Gibbard, P.L. |title=Quaternary Glaciations: South America, Asia, Africa, Australasia, Antarctica |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-444-51593-3 |pages=175\u2013199 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xpIEPH7RW4C |series=Development in Quaternary Science: Quaternary Glaciations: Extent and Chronology Vol. 3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhle, M. |title=Reconstruction of an approximately complete Quaternary Tibetan inland glaciation between the Mt.

Each cycle has a different length, so at some times their effects reinforce each other and at other times they (partially) cancel each other.\n\n[[File:SummerSolstice65N-future.png|thumb|upright=2.25|Past and future of daily average insolation at top of the atmosphere on the day of the summer solstice, at 65 N latitude.]]\n\nThere is strong evidence that the Milankovitch cycles affect the occurrence of glacial and interglacial periods within an ice age. The present ice age is the most studied and best understood, particularly the last 400,000 years, since this is the period covered by [[ice core]]s that record atmospheric composition and proxies for temperature and ice volume. Within this period, the match of glacial/interglacial frequencies to the Milankovi\u0107 orbital forcing periods is so close that orbital forcing is generally accepted. The combined effects of the changing distance to the Sun, the precession of the Earth's [[axis of rotation|axis]], and the changing tilt of the Earth's axis redistribute the sunlight received by the Earth. Of particular importance are changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis, which affect the intensity of seasons. For example, the amount of solar influx in July at [[65th parallel north|65 degrees north]] [[latitude]] varies by as much as 22% (from 450 W/m\u00b2 to 550 W/m\u00b2). It is widely believed that ice sheets advance when summers become too cool to melt all of the accumulated snowfall from the previous winter. Some believe that the strength of the orbital forcing is too small to trigger glaciations, but feedback mechanisms like {{CO2}} may explain this mismatch.\n\nWhile Milankovitch forcing predicts that cyclic changes in the Earth's [[orbital elements]] can be expressed in the glaciation record, additional explanations are necessary to explain which cycles are observed to be most important in the timing of glacial\u2013interglacial periods. In particular, during the last 800,000 years, the dominant period of glacial\u2013interglacial oscillation has been 100,000 years, which corresponds to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|changes]] in Earth's [[orbital eccentricity]] and orbital [[inclination]]. Yet this is by far the weakest of the three frequencies predicted by Milankovitch. During the period 3.0\u20130.8 million years ago, the dominant pattern of glaciation corresponded to the 41,000-year period of changes in Earth's [[obliquity]] (tilt of the axis). The reasons for dominance of one frequency versus another are poorly understood and an active area of current research, but the answer probably relates to some form of resonance in the Earth's climate system.  Recent work suggests that the 100K year cycle dominates due to increased southern-pole sea-ice increasing total solar reflectivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/01/iceages|title=Earth\u2019s orbital variations and sea ice synch glacial periods|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ice-age-explanation.158750/|title=Ice-Age Explanation - Sciforums|website=www.sciforums.com}}</ref>\n\nThe \"traditional\" Milankovitch explanation struggles to explain the dominance of the 100,000-year cycle over the last 8 cycles.

Yet another theory has been advanced by [[Peter Huybers]] who argued that the 41,000-year cycle has always been dominant, but that the Earth has entered a mode of climate behavior where only the second or third cycle triggers an ice age.

Most of the lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were gouged out by glaciers and later filled with glacial meltwaters. The old [[Teays River]] drainage system was radically altered and largely reshaped into the [[Ohio River]] drainage system.

For example, the moving ice carved out the landscape in Canada (See [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]), Greenland, northern Eurasia and Antarctica. The [[erratic boulder]]s, [[till]], [[drumlin]]s, [[esker]]s, [[fjord]]s, [[kettle lake]]s, [[moraine]]s, [[cirque]]s, [[Glacial horn|horns]], etc., are typical features left behind by the glaciers.\n\nThe weight of the ice sheets was so great that they deformed the Earth's crust and mantle. After the ice sheets melted, the ice-covered land [[Post-glacial rebound|rebounded]]. Due to the high [[viscosity]] of the [[Earth's mantle]], the flow of mantle rocks which controls the rebound process is very slow\u2014at a rate of about 1&nbsp;cm/year near the center of rebound area today.\n\nDuring glaciation, water was taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the continental shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During [[deglaciation]], the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed [[Proglacial lake|ice dam]]s resulting in [[salinity|salination]] of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary [[reglaciation]]. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n regions, as well as much of central North America at the end of the last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Bj\u00f8rn G. |last2=Borns |first2=Harold W.

Arthur was a research chemist who encouraged Irving to be curious about nature and how things work. Arthur helped Irving set up his first chemistry lab in the corner of his bedroom, and he was content to answer the myriad questions that Irving would pose. Langmuir's [[hobby|hobbies]] included [[mountaineering]], [[skiing]], [[pilot (aircraft)|piloting]] his own plane, and [[classical music]].<!--listening to or playing it?--> In addition to his professional interest in the politics of atomic energy, he was concerned about wilderness conservation.\n\n===Education===\nLangmuir attended several schools and institutes in America and Paris (1892\u20131895) before graduating high school from [[Chestnut Hill Academy]] (1898), an elite private school located in the affluent [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]] area in Philadelphia. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in [[metallurgical engineering]] ([[Metallurgy|Met.E.]]) from the [[Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science|Columbia University School of Mines]] in 1903. He earned his Ph.D. in 1906 under [[Friedrich Dolezalek]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]],<ref name=chemtree/> for research done using the \"[[Nernst glower]]\", an electric lamp invented by Nernst. His doctoral thesis was entitled \"On the Partial Recombination of Dissolved Gases During Cooling.\" He later did postgraduate work in chemistry. Langmuir then taught at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], until 1909, when he began working at the [[General Electric]] research laboratory ([[Schenectady, New York]]).\n\n===Research===\n[[Image:Irving Langmuir and Guglielmo Marconi in lab.jpg|thumb|Langmuir ''(center)'' in 1922 in his lab at GE, showing radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]] ''(right)'' a new 20 kW triode tube]] \n[[Image:General electric pliotron pp schenectady 3.jpg|thumb|right|General Electric Company Pliotron]]\n\nHis initial contributions to science came from his study of light bulbs (a continuation of his Ph.D. work). His first major development was the improvement of the [[diffusion pump]], which ultimately led to the invention of the high-vacuum rectifier and amplifier tubes. A year later, he and colleague [[Lewi Tonks]] discovered that the lifetime of a [[tungsten]] filament could be greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an [[inert gas]], such as [[argon]], the critical factor (overlooked by other researchers) being the need for extreme cleanliness in all stages of the process. He also discovered that twisting the filament into a tight coil improved its efficiency. These were important developments in the history of the [[incandescent light bulb]]. His work in surface chemistry began at this point, when he discovered that molecular hydrogen introduced into a tungsten-filament bulb dissociated into atomic hydrogen and formed a layer one atom thick on the surface of the bulb.<ref>{{harvnb|Coffey|2008|pp=64\u201370}}</ref>\n\nHis assistant in vacuum tube research was his cousin [[William Comings White]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MPER.2002.989191|title=Irving Langmuir and the origins of electronics|year=2002|last1=Anderson|first1=J.

The current of a biased probe tip is measured as a function of bias voltage to determine the local plasma temperature and density. He also discovered atomic [[hydrogen]], which he put to use by inventing the [[atomic hydrogen welding]] process; the first plasma weld ever made. Plasma welding has since been developed into [[gas tungsten arc welding]].\n\nIn 1917, he published a paper on the chemistry of oil films<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Constitution and Fundamental Properties of Solids and Liquids: II.

Langmuir theorized that oils consisting of an [[aliphatic]] chain with a [[hydrophilic]] end group (perhaps an [[alcohol]] or [[acid]]) were oriented as a film one molecule thick upon the surface of water, with the hydrophilic group down in the water and the [[hydrophobic]] chains clumped together on the surface. The thickness of the film could be easily determined from the known volume and area of the oil, which allowed investigation of the molecular configuration before [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques were available.<ref>{{harvnb|Coffey|2008|pp=128\u2013131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Langmuir.jpg|thumb|Irving Langmuir \u2013 chemist and physicist]]\n\n===Later years===\nFollowing [[World War I]] Langmuir contributed to atomic theory and the understanding of atomic structure by defining the modern concept of [[valence shell]]s and [[isotope]]s.\n\nLangmuir was president of the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Irving_Langmuir |title=Irving Langmuir |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=9 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nBased on his work at General Electric, [[John Bradshaw Taylor|John B.

Blodgett]] to study thin films and surface adsorption. They introduced the concept of a [[monolayer]] (a layer of material one molecule thick) and the two-dimensional physics which describe such a surface. In 1932 he received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] \"for his discoveries and investigations in [[surface chemistry]].\"\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Langmuirtime.jpeg|thumb|''[[Time Magazine]]'', 28 August 1950]] -->\nIn 1938, Langmuir's scientific interests began to turn to [[atmospheric science]] and [[meteorology]]. One of his first ventures, although tangentially related, was a refutation of the claim of entomologist Charles H. T. Townsend that the [[deer botfly]] flew at speeds of over 800 miles per hour. Langmuir estimated the fly's speed at 25 miles per hour.\n\nAfter observing [[windrow]]s of drifting seaweed in the [[Sargasso Sea]] he discovered a wind-driven surface circulation in the sea. It is now called the [[Langmuir circulation]].\n\n[[Image:Irving Langmuir House 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Langmuir's house in Schenectady]]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Langmuir worked on improving naval [[sonar]] for submarine detection, and later to develop protective smoke screens and methods for [[deicing]] aircraft wings. This research led him to theorize that the introduction of [[dry ice]] and [[iodide]] into a sufficiently moist cloud of low temperature could induce precipitation ([[cloud seeding]]); though in frequent practice, particularly in Australia and the People's Republic of China, the efficiency of this technique remains controversial today.\n\nIn 1953 Langmuir coined the term \"[[pathological science]]\", describing research conducted with accordance to the [[scientific method]], but tainted by unconscious bias or subjective effects.

In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal. This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make.\n\nThe authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.<ref>[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf \"The World Price of Insider Trading\"] by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the [[Journal of Finance]], Vol. LVII, No. 1 (February 2002)</ref> However, some economists, such as [[Henry Manne]], have argued that insider trading should be allowed and could, in fact, benefit markets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/26/insider-trading-makes-us-richer-better-informed-and-could-prevent-corporate-scandals-legalize-it/|title=Insider trading enriches and informs us, and could prevent scandals.

Many jurisdictions require that such trading be reported so that the transactions can be monitored. In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. In these cases, insiders in the United States are required to file a [[Form 4]] with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) when buying or selling shares of their own companies.\n\nThe rules governing insider trading are complex and vary significantly from country to country. The extent of enforcement also varies from one country to another. The definition of insider in one jurisdiction can be broad, and may cover not only insiders themselves but also any persons related to them, such as brokers, associates and even family members. A person who becomes aware of [[market moving information|non-public information]] and trades on that basis may be guilty of a crime.\n\n==Illegal==\nRules prohibiting or criminalizing insider trading on material non-public information exist in most jurisdictions around the world (Bhattacharya and Daouk, 2002), but the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably. In the United States, Sections 16(b) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directly and indirectly address insider trading. The U.S. Congress enacted this law after the stock market crash of 1929.<ref name=Newkirk/> While the United States is generally viewed as making the most serious efforts to enforce its insider trading laws,<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=967482 \"Law and the Market: The Impact of Enforcement\"] by John C.

Trades made by these types of insiders in the company's own stock, based on material non-public information, are considered fraudulent since the insiders are violating the fiduciary duty that they owe to the shareholders. The corporate insider, simply by accepting employment, has undertaken a legal obligation to the shareholders to put the shareholders' interests before their own, in matters related to the corporation. When insiders buy or sell based upon company-owned information, they are violating their obligation to the shareholders.\n\nFor example, illegal insider trading would occur if the [[chief executive officer]] of Company A learned (prior to a public announcement) that Company A will be taken over and then bought shares in Company A while knowing that the share price would likely rise.\n\nIn the United States and many other jurisdictions, however, \"insiders\" are not just limited to corporate officials and major shareholders where illegal insider trading is concerned but can include any individual who trades shares based on material non-public information in violation of some duty of trust. This duty may be imputed; for example, in many jurisdictions, in cases of where a corporate insider \"tips\" a friend about non-public information likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the duty the corporate insider owes the company is now imputed to the friend and the friend violates a duty to the company if he trades on the basis of this information.\n\n===Liability===\nLiability for inside trading violations generally cannot be avoided by passing on the information in an \"I scratch your back; you scratch mine\" or [[quid pro quo]] arrangement if the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was material non-public information. In the United States, at least one court has indicated that the insider who releases the non-public information must have done so for an improper purpose. In the case of a person who receives the insider information (called the \"tippee\"), the tippee must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose.<ref name=\"United States v 2014\">''United States v. Newman'', 773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014).</ref>\n\nOne commentator has argued that if Company A's CEO did not trade on the undisclosed [[takeover]] news, but instead passed the information on to his brother-in-law who traded on it, illegal insider trading would still have occurred (albeit by proxy by passing it on to a \"non-insider\" so Company A's CEO would not get his hands dirty).<ref name=Harris>Larry Harris, Trading & Exchanges, Oxford Press, Oxford, 2003. Chapter 29 \"Insider Trading\"</ref>{{rp|589}}\n\n===Misappropriation theory===\nA newer view of insider trading, the [[misappropriation]] theory, is now accepted in U.S. law. It states that anyone who misappropriates information from his or her employer and trades on that information in ''any'' stock (either the employer's stock or the company's competitor stocks) may be guilty of insider trading.\n\n===Proof of responsibility===\nProving that someone has been responsible for a trade can be difficult because traders may try to hide behind nominees, offshore companies, and other proxies. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] prosecutes over 50 cases each year, with many being settled administratively out of court. The SEC and several [[stock exchange]]s actively monitor trading, looking for suspicious activity.<ref name=cox>{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Charles C.|title=The Law of Insider Trading - How they get caught|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1986/112086cox.pdf|publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=March 23, 2014|date=November 20, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Matt|title=SEC Insider Trading Investigation Reveals SEC Is Really Good At Insider Trading Investigations, Anyway|url=http://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/sec-insider-trading-investigation-reveals-sec-is-really-good-at-insider-trading-investigations-anyway/|work=Dealbreaker|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Market Surveillance |url=https://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |publisher=NYSE EuroNext |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624062204/http://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |df= }}</ref> The SEC does not have criminal enforcement authority, but can refer serious matters to the U.S. Attorney's Office for further investigation and prosecution.\n\n===Trading on information in general===\nIn the United States and most non-European jurisdictions not all trading on non-public information is illegal insider trading.<ref name=\"Ventoruzzo\" /> For example, a person in a restaurant who hears the CEO of Company A at the next table tell the CFO that the company's profits will be higher than expected and then buys the stock is not guilty of insider trading\u2014unless he or she had some closer connection to the company or company officers.<ref name=\"Shell\">{{Cite magazine|last=Shell |first=G.

If this type of information is obtained (directly or indirectly) and there is reason to believe it is nonpublic, there is a duty to disclose it or abstain from trading.<ref>17 C.F.R. 240.14e-3</ref>\n\nThe punishment for insider trading depends on a few different factors. There are three main factors, which can be identified. Depending on jurisdictions, there may be either civil or criminal penalties, or both.\n*  Scope \u2013 How many people were affected by the wrongdoing?\n*  Gain \u2013 How much did the insider make from the transaction, whether directly or as a tipster? Where there is a tipster and a tippee, how much did the tippee make from the transaction?\n*  Evidence \u2013 Anyone charged is innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof falls on the prosecution. If no one \"flips\", or if there is no smoking gun, the prosecution has a harder time proving guilt. This may result in prosecution moving away from criminal charges, and instead choosing to pursue civil charges.\n\nIn the United States in addition to civil penalties, the trader may also be subject to criminal prosecution for fraud or where SEC regulations have been broken, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may be called to conduct an independent parallel investigation. If the DOJ finds criminal wrongdoing, the Department may file criminal charges.<ref>{{cite web|last=Raiser|first=Steve|title=Raiser & Kenniff|url=http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020113/http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|archivedate=2013-11-05|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Tracking===\nSince insiders are required to report their trades, others often track these traders, and there is a school of investing that follows the lead of insiders. Following such leads subjects the follower to the risk that an insider is buying specifically to increase investor confidence, or is selling for reasons unrelated to the health of the company (such as a desire to diversify or pay a personal expense).\n\n==Legal==\nLegal trades by insiders are common,<ref name=Newkirk>Thomas Newkirk.

These trades are made public in the United States through [[SEC filing|Securities and Exchange Commission filings]], mainly [[Form 4]].\n\nU.S. [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]] clarified that the prohibition against insider trading does not require proof that an insider actually used material nonpublic information when conducting a trade; possession of such information alone is sufficient to violate the provision, and the SEC would infer that an insider in possession of material nonpublic information used this information when conducting a trade. However, SEC Rule 10b5-1 also created for insiders an [[affirmative defense]] if the insider can demonstrate that the trades conducted on behalf of the insider were conducted as part of a pre-existing [[contract]] or written binding plan for trading in the future.<ref name=Stein2001>Stuart Stein.

Repide''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/213/419/ |title=Strong v. Repide \u2013 213 U.S. 419 (1909) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref> that a director who expects to act in a way that affects the value of shares cannot use that knowledge to acquire shares from those who do not know of the expected action. Even though, in general, ordinary relations between directors and shareholders in a business corporation are not of such a fiduciary nature as to make it the duty of a director to disclose to a shareholder general knowledge regarding the value of the shares of the company before he purchases any from a shareholder, some cases involve special facts that impose such duty.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] advanced a \"level playing field\" theory of insider trading in ''SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.''<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8550821722818303653 Securities and Exchange Com'n v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.]'', 401 F. 2d 833 (2d Cir. 1968)</ref> The court stated that anyone in possession of inside information must either disclose the information or refrain from trading.

Securities and Exchange Commission''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=463&invol=646 |title=FindLaw &#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref> that tippees (receivers of second-hand information) are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper had breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing confidential information. One such example would be if the tipper received any personal benefit from the disclosure, thereby breaching his or her duty of loyalty to the company. In ''Dirks'', the \"tippee\" received confidential information from an insider, a former employee of a company. The reason the insider disclosed the information to the tippee, and the reason the tippee disclosed the information to third parties, was to blow the whistle on massive fraud at the company. As a result of the tippee's efforts the fraud was uncovered, and the company went into bankruptcy. But, while the tippee had given the \"inside\" information to clients who made profits from the information, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not be held liable under the federal securities laws\u2014for the simple reason that the insider from whom he received the information was not releasing the information for an improper purpose (a personal benefit), but rather for the purpose of exposing the fraud. The Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not have been aiding and abetting a securities law violation committed by the insider\u2014for the simple reason that no securities law violation had been committed by the insider.\n\nIn ''Dirks'', the Supreme Court also defined the concept of \"constructive insiders,\" who are lawyers, investment bankers and others who receive confidential information from a corporation while providing services to the corporation. Constructive insiders are also liable for insider trading violations if the corporation expects the information to remain confidential, since they acquire the fiduciary duties of the true insider.\n\nThe next expansion of insider trading liability came in ''SEC vs. Materia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leagle.com/decision/1984942745F2d197_1924.xml/S.E.C.%20v.%20MATERIA |title=S.E.C. V. Materia |publisher=Leagle.com |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}</ref> 745 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1984), the case that first introduced the misappropriation theory of liability for insider trading. Materia, a financial printing firm proofreader, and clearly not an insider by any definition, was found to have determined the identity of takeover targets based on proofreading tender offer documents during his employment. After a two-week trial, the district court found him liable for insider trading, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the theft of information from an employer, and the use of that information to purchase or sell securities in another entity, constituted a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities. The misappropriation theory of insider trading was born, and liability further expanded to encompass a larger group of outsiders.\n\nIn ''United States v. Carpenter''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=484&invol=19 |title=FindLaw &#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref> (1986) the U.S. Supreme Court cited an earlier ruling while unanimously upholding mail and wire fraud convictions for a defendant who received his information from a journalist rather than from the company itself. The journalist [[R. Foster Winans]] was also convicted, on the grounds that he had misappropriated information belonging to his employer, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. In that widely publicized case, Winans traded in advance of \"Heard on the Street\" columns appearing in the Journal.<ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Cox |authorlink=Christopher Cox |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch050106cc.htm |title=Speech by SEC Chairman: Remarks at the Annual Meeting of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers}}</ref>\n\nThe Court stated in ''Carpenter'': \"It is well established, as a general proposition, that a person who acquires special knowledge or information by virtue of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with another is not free to exploit that knowledge or information for his own personal benefit but must account to his principal for any profits derived therefrom.\"\n\nHowever, in upholding the securities fraud (insider trading) convictions, the justices were evenly split.\n\nIn 1997, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] adopted the misappropriation theory of insider trading in ''United States v. O'Hagan'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |title=United States v. O'Hagan, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref> 521 U.S. 642, 655 (1997). O'Hagan was a partner in a law firm representing [[Diageo|Grand Metropolitan]], while it was considering a tender offer for [[Pillsbury Company]]. O'Hagan used this inside information by buying call options on Pillsbury stock, resulting in profits of over $4.3 million. O'Hagan claimed that neither he nor his firm owed a fiduciary duty to Pillsbury, so he did not commit fraud by purchasing Pillsbury options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/regionals/ca/briefing/wilson/wilson21.html |title=Law.com |publisher=Law.com |date=June 25, 1997 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Court rejected O'Hagan's arguments and upheld his conviction.\n\nThe \"misappropriation theory\" holds that a person commits fraud \"in connection with\" a securities transaction and thereby violates 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.\n\nThe Court specifically recognized that a corporation's information is its property: \"A company's confidential information ... qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use. The undisclosed misappropriation of such information in violation of a fiduciary duty ... constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement \u2013 the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of the money or goods entrusted to one's care by another.\"\n\nIn 2000, the SEC enacted [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]], which defined trading \"on the basis of\" inside information as any time a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. It is no longer a defense for one to say that one would have made the trade anyway. The rule also created an [[affirmative defense]] for pre-planned trades.\n\nIn 2014, in the case of ''United States v. Newman'', the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cited the Supreme Court's decision in ''Dirks'', and ruled that for a \"tippee\" (a person who used information they received from an insider) to be guilty of insider trading, the tippee must have been aware not only that the information was insider information, but must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose (such as a personal benefit). The Court concluded that the insider's breach of a fiduciary duty not to release confidential information\u2014in the absence of an improper purpose on the part of the insider\u2014is not enough to impose criminal liability on either the insider or the tippee.<ref name=\"United States v 2014\"/>\n\nIn 2016, in the case of ''Salman v. United States'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the benefit a tipper must receive as predicate for an insider-trader prosecution of a tippee need not be pecuniary, and that giving a 'gift' of a tip to a family member is presumptively an act for the personal though intangible benefit of the tipper.<ref name=\"Savage\">{{Cite news|last=Savage |first=David G. |date=6 December 2016 |title=Supreme Court affirms broad reach of insider-trading laws |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207135034/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-date=7 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\n===By members of Congress===\nMembers of the [[US Congress]] are exempt from the laws that ban insider trading.

The [[CFA Institute]] in its code of ethics states that analysts should make every effort to make all reports available to all the broker's clients on a timely basis. Analysts should never report material nonpublic information, except in an effort to make that information available to the general public. Nevertheless, analysts' reports may contain a variety of information that is \"pieced together\" without violating insider trading laws, under the [[Mosaic theory (investments)|Mosaic theory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mosaictheory.asp |title=Investopedia.com \u2013 Mosaic Theory |publisher=Investopedia.com |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> This information may include non-material nonpublic information as well as material public information, which may increase in value when properly compiled and documented.\n\n==Arguments for legalizing==\nSome economists and legal scholars (such as [[Henry Manne]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Thomas Sowell]], [[Daniel Fischel]], and [[Frank H.

They claim that insider trading based on material nonpublic information benefits investors, in general, by more quickly introducing new information into the market.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-altucher/should-insider-trading-be_b_324409.html |title=James Altucher: Should Insider Trading Be Made Legal? |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFriedman, laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], said: \"You want more insider trading, not less.

[[The Atlantic]] has described the process as \"arguably the closest thing that modern finance has to a victimless crime.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/capitol-gains/8692/ |title=Capitol Gains \u2013 Magazine |publisher=The Atlantic |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLegalization advocates also question why \"trading\" where one party has more information than the other is legal in other markets, such as [[real estate]], but not in the stock market. For example, if a [[geology|geologist]] knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of [[petroleum]] under Farmer Smith's land, he may be entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith of the geological data.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} \n\nAdvocates of legalization make free speech arguments.

Since negative information is often withheld from the market, trading on such information has a higher value for the market than trading on positive information.<ref>Kristoffel Grechenig, The Marginal Incentive of Insider Trading: An Economic Reinterpretation of the Case Law, University of Memphis Law Review 2006, vol. 37,  p. 75-148 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=883642 (link)].</ref><ref>Macey, Jonathan. \"Getting the word out about fraud: a theoretical analysis of whistleblowing and insider trading.\" Michigan Law Review (2007): 1899-1940.</ref>\n\nThere are very limited laws against \"insider trading\" in the commodities markets if, for no other reason than that the concept of an \"insider\" is not immediately analogous to commodities themselves (corn, wheat, steel, etc.).

For example, a [[commodity broker]] can be charged with fraud by receiving  a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchasing that commodity before executing the client's order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.\n\n==Commercialisation==\nThe advent of the Internet has provided a forum for the [[commercialisation]] of trading on insider information.

[[Luigi Longo]], ex-leader of the Italian [[Communist Youth]], was charged to make the necessary arrangements with the Spanish government. The [[Soviet Ministry of Defense]] also helped, since they had experience of dealing with corps of international volunteers during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The idea was initially opposed by [[Largo Caballero]], but after the first setbacks of the war, he changed his mind, and finally agreed to the operation on 22 October. However, the Soviet Union did not withdraw from the [[Non-Intervention Committee]], probably to avoid diplomatic conflict with France and the United Kingdom.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:International Brigades poster2.jpg|thumbnail|165px|right|Republican poster.

On 17 October 1936, an open letter by [[Joseph Stalin]] to [[Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz (politician)|Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz]] was published in ''Mundo Obrero'', arguing that victory for the Spanish second republic was a matter not only for Spaniards, but also for the whole of \"progressive humanity\"; in short order, communist activists joined with moderate socialist and liberal groups to form anti-fascist \u201cpopular front\u201d militias in several countries, most of them under the control of or influenced by the [[Comintern]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Third-International|title=Third International {{!}} association of political parties|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nEntry to Spain was arranged for volunteers: for instance, a Yugoslav, Josip Broz, who would become famous as Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], was in Paris to provide assistance, money and passports for volunteers from [[Eastern Europe]]. Volunteers were sent by train or ship from France to Spain, and sent to the base at [[Albacete]]. However, many of them also went by themselves to Spain. The volunteers were under no contract, nor defined engagement period, which would later prove a problem.\n\nAlso many Italians, Germans, and people from other countries joined the movement, with the idea that combat in Spain was a first step to restore [[democracy]] or advance a revolutionary cause in their own country. There were also many unemployed workers (especially from France), and adventurers. Finally, some 500 communists who had been exiled to Russia were sent to Spain (among them, experienced military leaders from the First World War like [[Manfred Stern|\"Kl\u00e9ber\" Stern]], [[Wilhelm Zaisser|\"Gomez\" Zaisser]], [[Zalka Mate|\"Lukacs\" Zalka]] and [[Janos Galicz|\"Gal\" Galicz]], who would prove invaluable in combat).\n\nThe operation was met with enthusiasm by communists, but by [[anarchist]]s with skepticism, at best.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} At first, the anarchists, who controlled the borders with France, were told to refuse communist volunteers, but reluctantly allowed their passage after protests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} A group of 500 volunteers (mainly French, with a few exiled Poles and Germans) arrived in Albacete on 14 October 1936. They were met by international volunteers who had already been fighting in Spain: Germans from the [[Th\u00e4lmann Battalion]], Italians from [[Centuria Gastone Sozzi]] and French from [[Commune de Paris Battalion]]. Among them was British poet [[John Cornford]]. Men were sorted according to their experience and origin, and dispatched to units.\n\nIn 30 May 1937, the Spanish liner ''[[MV Ciudad de Barcelona|Ciudad de Barcelona]]'', carrying 200\u2013250 volunteers from [[Marseille]] to Spain, was torpedoed by a Nationalist submarine off the coast of [[Malgrat de Mar]].

It staved off the prospect of a rapid defeat at the hands of [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces. The role of the International Brigades in this victory was generally recognised, but was exaggerated by [[Comintern]] propaganda, so that the outside world heard only of their victories, and not those of Spanish units.  So successful was such propaganda that the British Ambassador, Sir Henry Chilton, declared that there were no Spaniards in the army which had defended Madrid.  The International Brigade forces that fought in Madrid arrived after other successful Republican fighting.  Of the 40,000 Republican troops in the city, the foreign troops numbered less than 3,000.<ref>Beevor (1982), p 137; Anderson (2003), p 59.</ref> Even though the International Brigades did not win the battle by themselves, nor significantly change the situation, they certainly did provide an example by their determined fighting, and improved the morale of the population by demonstrating the concern of other nations in the fight. Many of the older members of the International Brigades provided valuable combat experience, having fought during the First World War (Spain remained neutral in 1914\u201318) and the [[Irish War of Independence]] (Some had fought in the [[British army]] while others had fought in the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]).\n\nOne of the strategic positions in Madrid was the [[Casa de Campo]]. There the Nationalist troops were [[Morocco|Moroccans]], commanded by General [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela]]. They were stopped by III and IV Brigades of the [[Spanish Republican Army]].\n\nOn 9 November 1936, the [[XI International Brigade]] - comprising 1,900 men from the [[Edgar Andr\u00e9 Battalion]], the [[Commune de Paris Battalion]] and the [[Dabrowski Battalion]], together with a British machine-gun company&nbsp;\u2014 took up position at the Casa de Campo. In the evening, its commander, [[Manfred Stern|General Kl\u00e9ber]], launched an assault on the Nationalist positions. This lasted for the whole night and part of the next morning. At the end of the fight, the Nationalist troops had been forced to retreat, abandoning all hopes of a direct assault on Madrid by Casa de Campo, while the XIth Brigade had lost a third of its personnel.<ref>Boadilla by Esmond Romilly, The Clapton Press Limited, London, 2018 {{ISBN|978-1999654306}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 November, the 1,550-man strong [[XII International Brigade]], made up of the [[Th\u00e4lmann Battalion]], the [[Garibaldi Battalion]] and the [[Andr\u00e9 Marty Battalion]], deployed. Commanded by [[Mate Zalka|General \"Lukacs\"]], they assaulted Nationalist positions on the high ground of [[Cerro de los Angeles]]. As a result of language and communication problems, command issues, lack of rest, poor coordination with armoured units, and insufficient artillery support, the attack failed.\n\nOn 19 November, the [[anarchist]] [[militia]]s were forced to retreat, and Nationalist troops&nbsp;\u2014 Moroccans and [[Spanish Foreign Legion]]naires, covered by the Nazi [[Condor Legion]]&nbsp;\u2014 captured a foothold in the [[University City of Madrid|University City]]. The 11th Brigade was sent to drive the Nationalists out of the University City. The battle was extremely bloody, a mix of [[artillery]] and [[strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]], with [[bayonet]] and [[grenade]] fights, room by room. Anarchist leader [[Buenaventura Durruti]] was shot there on 19 November 1936, and died the next day. The battle in the University went on until three quarters of the University City was under Nationalist control. Both sides then started setting up trenches and fortifications. It was then clear that any assault from either side would be far too costly; the nationalist leaders had to renounce the idea of a direct assault on Madrid, and prepare for a [[siege]] of the capital.\n\nOn 13 December 1936, 18,000 nationalist troops attempted an attack to close the encirclement of Madrid at [[Guadarrama]]&nbsp;\u2014 an engagement known as the [[Second Battle of the Corunna Road|Battle of the Corunna Road]]. The Republicans sent in a Soviet armoured unit, under General [[Dmitry Pavlov (general)|Dmitry Pavlov]], and both XI and XII International Brigades. Violent combat followed, and they stopped the Nationalist advance.\n\nAn attack was then launched by the Republic on the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] front. The battle ended in a form of stalemate; a communique was issued, saying: \"During the day the advance continued without the loss of any territory.\" Poets [[Ralph Winston Fox]] and [[John Cornford]] were killed. Eventually, the Nationalists advanced, taking the [[hydro electricity|hydroelectric]] station at [[El Campo, Spain|El Campo]]. [[Andr\u00e9 Marty]] accused the commander of the [[Marseillaise Battalion]], [[Gaston Delasalle]], of [[espionage]] and [[treason]] and had him executed. (It is doubtful that Delasalle would have been a spy for Francisco Franco; he was denounced by his own second-in-command, [[Andr\u00e9 Heussler]], who was subsequently executed for treason during World War II by the [[French Resistance]].)\n\nFurther Nationalist attempts after Christmas to encircle Madrid met with failure, but not without extremely violent combat. On 6 January 1937, the [[Th\u00e4lmann Battalion]] arrived at [[Las Rozas de Madrid|Las Rozas]], and held its positions until it was destroyed as a fighting force. On 9 January, only 10&nbsp;km had been lost to the Nationalists, when the [[XIII International Brigade]] and [[XIV International Brigade]] and the 1st British Company, arrived in Madrid. Violent Republican assaults were launched in attempt to retake the land, with little success. On 15 January, trenches and fortifications were built by both sides, resulting in a stalemate.\n\nThe Nationalists did not take Madrid until the very end of the war, in March 1939, when they marched in unopposed. There were some pockets of resistance during the subsequent months.\n\n===Battle of Jarama===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:International Brigades medal.PNG|thumbnail|150px|right|Blason of the International Brigades.

The Nationalists quickly advanced on the little town [[Ciempozuelos]], held by the [[XV International Brigade]], which was composed of the [[British Battalion]] ([[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]]), the [[Dimitrov Battalion]] (miscellaneous [[Balkan]] nationalities), the [[Sixth February Battalion|6 F\u00e9vrier Battalion]] ([[Belgium|Belgians]] and French), the Canadian [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]] and the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] (Americans, including [[African-American]]).\nAn independent 80-men-strong (mainly) Irish unit, known as the [[Connolly Column]], made up of people from both sides of the Irish border also fought. Several histories of the Irish in Spain record that they included an ex-Catholic [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brother]] and an ordained [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglican]] Protestant) Clergyman, fighting and dying on the same side. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} (These battalions were not composed entirely of one nationality or another, rather they were for the most part a mix of many)\n\nOn 11 February 1937, a Nationalist brigade launched a surprise attack on the [[Andr\u00e9 Marty Battalion]] ([[XIV International Brigade]]), stabbing its [[wikt:sentry|sentries]] and crossing the [[Jarama]]. The Garibaldi Battalion stopped the advance with heavy fire. At another point, the same tactic allowed the Nationalists to move their troops across the river.\n\nOn 12 February, the [[British Battalion]], [[XV International Brigade]] took the brunt of the attack, remaining under heavy fire for seven hours. The position became known as \"Suicide Hill\". At the end of the day, only 225 of the 600 members of the British battalion remained. One company was captured by ruse, when Nationalists advanced among their ranks singing ''[[The Internationale]]''.\n\nOn 17 February, the Republican Army counter-attacked. On 23 and 27 February, the International Brigades were engaged, but with little success. The Lincoln Battalion was put under great pressure, with no artillery support. It suffered 120 killed and 175 wounded. Amongst the dead was the Irish poet [[Charles Donnelly (poet)|Charles Donnelly]] and Leo Greene.<ref>{{cite article| title=The Enigma of Frank Ryan part 1| first=Michael| last=McInerney| journal=Old Limerick Journal| volume=1|date=December 1979| url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,3920,en.pdf| accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere were heavy casualties on both sides, and although \"both claimed victory ... both suffered defeats\".<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|2003|p=579}}</ref> It resulted in a stalemate, with both sides digging in, creating elaborate trench systems.\n\nOn 22 February 1937 the [[League of Nations]] [[Non-Intervention Committee]] ban on foreign volunteers went into effect.\n\n===Battle of Guadalajara===\n[[File:Flag of Giustizia e Liberta.svg|thumb|right|Flag of ''[[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]]'', an Italian anti-fascist resistance movement led by [[Carlo Rosselli]].

The objective was the town of [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], 50&nbsp;km from Madrid. The whole Italian expeditionary corps&nbsp;\u2014 35,000 men, with 80 battle tanks and 200 field artillery&nbsp;\u2014 was deployed, as [[Benito Mussolini]] wanted the victory to be credited to Italy. On 9 March 1937, the Italians made a breach in the Republican lines, but did not properly exploit the advance. However, the rest of the Nationalist army was advancing, and the situation appeared critical for the Republicans. A formation drawn from the best available units of the Republican army, including the [[XI International Brigade|XI]] and [[XII International Brigade]]s, was quickly assembled.\n\nAt dawn on 10 March, the Nationalists closed in, and by noon, the Garibaldi Battalion counterattacked. Some confusion arose from the fact that the sides were not aware of each other's movements, and that both sides spoke Italian; this resulted in scouts from both sides exchanging information without realising they were enemies.<ref>{{harvnb|Beevor|1982|p=158}}</ref> The Republican lines advanced and made contact with XI International Brigade. Nationalist tanks were shot at and infantry patrols came into action.\n\nOn 11 March, the Nationalist army broke the front of the Republican army. The [[Th\u00e4lmann Battalion]] suffered heavy losses, but succeeded in holding the [[Trijueque]]&ndash;[[Torija]] road. The Garibaldi also held its positions. On 12 March, Republican planes and tanks attacked. The Th\u00e4lmann Battalion attacked [[Trijuete]] in a bayonet charge and re-took the town, capturing numerous prisoners.\n\nThe International Brigades also saw combat in the [[Battle of Teruel]] in January 1938. The [[35th International Division]] suffered heavily in this battle from aerial bombardment as well as shortages of food, winter clothing and ammunition. The [[XIV International Brigade]] fought in the [[Battle of Ebro]] in July 1938, the last Republican offensive of the war.\n\n==Casualties==\nAlthough exact figures are not available, an estimated 5,857 to 25,229 brigadiers died in Spain, of an estimated 23,670 to 59,380 who served, with estimated death rates of 16.7% to 29.2%. These high casualty rates are blamed on lack of training, poor leadership and use as [[shock troops]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Michael W.

The disbandment was part of an ill-advised effort to get the Nationalists' foreign backers to withdraw their troops and to persuade the Western democracies such as France and Britain to end their arms [[embargo]] on the Republic.\n\nBy this time there were about an estimated 10,000 foreign volunteers still serving in Spain for the Republican side, and about 50,000 foreign conscripts for the Nationalists (excluding another 30,000 Moroccans).<ref>''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760250,00.html Exit]'' - ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Monday, 3 October 1938</ref> Perhaps half of the International Brigadists were exiles or refugees from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy or other countries, such as Hungary, which had authoritarian right-wing governments at the time.

The [[XI International Brigade|XIth]], [[XII International Brigade|XIIth]] and [[XIII International Brigade|XIIIth]] were the first brigades formed. Later, the [[XIV International Brigade|XIVth]] and [[XV International Brigade|XVth]] Brigades were raised, mixing experienced soldiers with new volunteers. Smaller Brigades&nbsp;\u2014 the [[86th International Brigade|86th]], [[129th International Brigade|129th]] and [[150th International Brigade|150th]] - were formed in late 1937 and 1938, mostly for temporary tactical reasons.\n\nAbout 32,000 <ref name=\"Thomas 2003\"/> people volunteered to defend the Spanish Republic. Many were veterans of World War I. Their early engagements in 1936 during the [[Siege of Madrid]] amply demonstrated their military and propaganda value.\n\nThe international volunteers were mainly socialists, communists, or under communist authority, and a high proportion were [[Jewish volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|Jewish]]. Some were involved in the fighting in [[Barcelona]] against Republican opponents of the Communists: the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) (''Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista'', an anti-[[Stalinist]] Marxist party) and anarchists. These more libertarian groups like the POUM fought together on the front with the anarchist federations of the [[CNT-FAI|CNT]] (CNT, Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo) and the [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]] (FAI, Iberian Anarchist Federation)  who had large support in the area of Catalonia. However, overseas volunteers from [[anarchist]], [[socialist]], [[Liberalism|liberal]] and other political positions also served with the international brigades.\n\nTo simplify communication, the battalions usually concentrated people of the same nationality or language group.  The battalions were often (formally, at least) named after inspirational people or events. From Spring 1937 onwards, many battalions contained one Spanish volunteer company (about 150 men).\n\nLater in the war, military discipline tightened and learning Spanish became mandatory. By decree of 23 September 1937, the International Brigades formally became units of the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]].<ref name=\"Beevor 2006/309\">{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=309}}</ref> This made them subject to the Spanish Code of Military Justice.

Retrospectively, it was clear that the war in Spain was as much a precursor of the Second World War as a Spanish civil war.\n\nSome glory therefore accrued to the volunteers (a great many of the survivors also fought during World War II), but this soon faded in the fear that it would promote (by association) [[communism]].\n\nAn exception is among groups to the left of the Communist Parties, for example [[Anarchism|anarchists]]. Among these groups the Brigades, or at least their leadership, are criticised for their alleged role in suppressing the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]]. An example of a modern work which promotes this view is [[Ken Loach]]'s  film ''[[Land and Freedom]]''. A well-known contemporary account of the Spanish Civil War which also takes this view is [[George Orwell]]'s book ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.\n\n===East Germany===\n[[Germany]] was undivided until after the Second World War. At that time, the new  [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] began to create a [[national identity]] which was separate from and antithetical to the former [[Nazi Germany]]. The Spanish Civil War, and especially the role of the International Brigades, became a substantial part of East Germany's memorial rituals because of the substantial numbers of German communists who had served in the brigades.  These showcased a commitment by many Germans to [[antifascism]] at a time when Germany and Nazism were often conflated together.<ref>[http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/39/4/531 ''The Cult of the Spanish Civil War in East Germany'' (abstract)] - [[Arnold Krammer|Krammer, Arnold]], [[Texas A&M University]].

Depending on the dose, some or all of the pathogenic organisms, [[microorganism]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es present are destroyed, slowed down, or rendered incapable of reproduction. Irradiation cannot revert spoiled or over ripened food to a fresh state. If this food was processed by irradiation, further spoilage would cease and ripening would slow down, yet the irradiation would not destroy the toxins or repair the texture, color, or taste of the food.<ref name=\"Loaharanu2\">{{cite journal|last=Loaharanu|first=Paisan|year=1990|title=Food irradiation: Facts or fiction?.|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|journal=IAEA Bulletin|issue=32.2|pages=44\u201348|accessdate=March 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304152545/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When targeting bacteria, most foods are irradiated to significantly reduce the number of active microbes, not to sterilize all microbes in the product. In this respect it is similar to pasteurization.\n\nIrradiation is used to create safe foods for people at high risk of infection, or for conditions where food must be stored for long periods of time and proper storage conditions are not available. Foods that can tolerate irradiation at sufficient doses are treated to ensure that the product is completely [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]. This is most commonly done with rations for astronauts, and special diets for hospital patients.\n\nIrradiation is used to create shelf-stable products. Since irradiation reduces the populations of spoilage microorganisms, and because pre-packed food can be irradiated, the packaging prevents recontamination of the final product.<ref name=\"FI\" />\n\nIrradiation is used to reduce post-harvest losses. It reduces populations of spoilage micro-organisms in the food and can slow down the speed at which enzymes change the food, and therefore slows spoilage and ripening, and inhibits sprouting (e.g., of potato, onion, and garlic).<ref name=\"Loaharanu\"/>\n\nFood is also irradiated to prevent the spread of invasive pest species through trade in fresh vegetables and fruits, either within countries, or trade across international boundaries. Pests such as insects could be transported to new habitats through trade in fresh produce which could significantly affect agricultural production and the environment were they to establish themselves.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1261545694-KGCNC1z9SSW95acAk0gz0g Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation.] ''[[The New York Times]].'' February 1, 2009.</ref> Some of the potential secondary impacts of irradiation are hypothetical, while others are demonstrated. These effects include cumulative impacts to pathogens, people, and the environment due to the reduction of food quality, the transportation and storage of radioactive goods, and destruction of pathogens, changes in the way we relate to food and how irradiation changes the food production and shipping industries.\n\n===Immediate effects===\nThe radiation source supplies energetic particles or waves. As these waves/particles pass through a target material they [[Event (particle physics)|collide with other particles]]. Around the sites of these collisions [[chemical bonds]] are broken, creating short lived radicals (e.g. the [[hydroxyl radical]], the hydrogen atom and [[solvated electron]]s). These radicals cause further chemical changes by bonding with and or stripping particles from nearby molecules. When collisions damage [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], effective [[reproduction]] becomes unlikely, also when collisions occur in cells, [[cell division]] is often suppressed.<ref name=\"FI\"/>\n\nIrradiation (within the accepted energy limits, as 10 MeV for electrons, 5 MeV for X-rays [US 7.5 MeV] and gamma rays from [[Cobalt-60]]) can not make food radioactive, but it does produce [[#Chemical changes|radiolytic products, and free radicals]] in the food. A few of these products are unique, but not considered dangerous.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\" />\n\nIrradiation can also alter the [[#Food quality|nutritional content and flavor of foods]], much like cooking.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/sources/food_safety.html |title=Radiation Protection-Food Safety|publisher=epa.gov |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> The scale of these chemical changes is not unique. Cooking, smoking, salting, and other less novel techniques, cause the food to be altered so drastically that its original nature is almost unrecognizable, and must be called by a different name. Storage of food also causes dramatic chemical changes, ones that eventually lead to deterioration and spoilage.<ref name=\"ROT\">{{cite web|url=http://science-at-home.org/kid-question-rotting/ |title=kid question rotting |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Misconceptions====\nA major concern is that irradiation might cause chemical changes that are harmful to the consumer. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume as long as it remains palatable and maintains its technical properties (e.g. feel, texture, or color).<ref name=\"JECFI\"/><ref name=\"JSGHDI\"/>\n\nIrradiated food does not become radioactive, just as an object exposed to light does not start producing light. Radioactivity is the ability of a substance to emit high energy particles. When particles hit the target materials they may free other highly energetic particles. This ends shortly after the end of the exposure, much like objects stop reflecting light when the source is turned off and warm objects emit heat until they cool down but do not continue to produce their own heat. To modify a material so that it keeps emitting radiation (induce radiation) the atomic cores ([[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]) of the atoms in the target material must be modified.\n\nIt is impossible for food irradiators to induce radiation in a product. Irradiators emit [[electron]]s or [[photon]]s and the radiation is intrinsically radiated at precisely known strengths ([[wavelength]]s for photons, and speeds for electrons). These radiated particles at these strengths can never be strong enough to modify the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the targeted atom in the food, regardless of how many particles hit the target material, and radioactivity can not be induced without modifying the nucleus.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\"/>\n\n====Chemical changes====\nCompounds known as free radicals form when food is irradiated. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., accept electrons) and some react very strongly. According to the free-radical theory of aging excessive amounts of these free radicals can lead to cell injury and cell death, which may contribute to many diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rajamani Karthikeyan, Manivasagam T, Anantharaman P, Balasubramanian T, Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J.

One family of chemicals (2ACB's) are uniquely formed by irradiation (unique radiolytic products), and this product is nontoxic. When fatty acids are irradiated, a family of compounds called 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) are produced. These are thought to be unique radiolytic products.\nWhen irradiating food, all other chemicals occur in a lower or comparable frequency to other food processing techniques.<ref name=\"JECFI\" /><ref name=\"JSGHDI\" /><ref name=\"WHO1994\">anon., Safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated food, WHO, Geneva, 1994</ref><ref name=\"EFSA2011\">anon., Scientific Opinion on the Chemical Safety of Irradiation of Food, EFSA Journal 2011;9(4):1930 [57 pp.]. {{doi|10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1930}} last visited March 3, 2013</ref> Furthermore, the quantities in which they occur in irradiated food are lower or similar to the quantities formed in heat treatments.<ref name=\"JECFI\"/><ref name=\"JSGHDI\"/><ref name=\"WHO1994\"/><ref name=\"EFSA2011\"/>\n\nThe radiation doses to cause toxic changes are much higher than the doses used during irradiation, and taking into account the presence of 2-ACBs along with what is known of free radicals, these results lead to the conclusion that there is no significant risk from radiolytic products.<ref name=\"JFDiehl\"/>\n\n====Food quality====\nIonizing radiation can change food quality but in general very high levels of radiation treatment (many thousands of gray) are necessary to adversely change nutritional content, as well as the sensory qualities (taste, appearance, and texture). Irradiation to the doses used commercially to treat food have very little negative impact on the sensory qualities and nutrient content in foods. When irradiation is used to maintain food quality for a longer period of time (improve the shelf stability of some sensory qualities and nutrients) the improvement means that more consumers have access to the original taste, texture, appearance, and nutrients.<ref name=\"Antioxidant\" /><ref name=\"velvet bean\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The changes in quality and nutrition depend on the degree of treatment and may vary greatly from food to food.<ref name=\"Loaharanu\"/>\n\nThere has been low level gamma irradiation that has been attempted on arugula,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nunes, T.

Bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics after an individual uses antibiotics repeatedly. Much like pasteurization plants, products that pass through irradiation plants are processed once, and are not processed and reprocessed. Cycles of heat treatment have been shown to produce heat-tolerant bacteria, yet no problems have appeared so far in pasteurization plants. Furthermore, when the irradiation dose is chosen to target a specific species of microbe, it is calibrated to doses several times the value required to target the species.

The term \"cold pasteurization\" is controversial because the term may be used to disguise the fact the food has been irradiated and pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes.\n\nTreatment costs vary as a function of dose and facility usage. A pallet or tote is typically exposed for several minutes to hours depending on dose. Low-dose applications such as disinfestation of fruit range between US$0.01/lbs and US$0.08/lbs while higher-dose applications can cost as much as US$0.20/lbs.<ref name=\"ozone\"/>\n\n=== Packaging ===\nFood processors and manufacturers today struggle with using affordable, efficient packaging materials for irradiation based processing. The implementation of irradiation on prepackaged foods has been found to impact foods by inducing specific chemical alterations to the food packaging material that migrates into the food. [[Cross-link]]ing in various plastics can lead to physical and chemical modifications that can increase the overall molecular weight. On the other hand, chain scission is fragmentation of polymer chains that leads to a molecular weight reduction.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Dosimetry===\nThe radiation absorbed dose is the amount energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The [[SI unit]] for dose is [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy or [[Joule|J]]/[[Kilogram|kg]]). [[Dosimeter]]s are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]], change measurable physical attributes to a degree that can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose ([[dosimetry]]) involves exposing one or more dosimeters along with the target material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/pdf/TRS409_scr.pdf |title=anon., Dosimetry for Food Irradiation, IAEA, Vienna, 2002, Technical Reports Series No. 409 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>K.

For example, in the U.S. the FDA has approved food irradiation for over fifty years. However, in the past decade the major growth area is for fruits and vegetables that are irradiated to prevent the spread of pests. In the early 2000s in the US, irradiated meat was common at some grocery stores, but because of lack of consumer demand, it is no longer common. Because consumer demand for irradiated food is low, reducing the spoilage between manufacturer and consumer purchase and reducing the risk of food borne illness is currently not sufficient incentive for most manufacturers to supplement their process with irradiation.<ref name=\"NYT_P.O.\" /> Nevertheless, food irradiation does take place commercially and volumes are in general increasing at a slow rate, even in the European Union where all member countries allow the irradiation of dried herbs spices and vegetable seasonings but only a few allow other foods to be sold as irradiated.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/biosafety/irradiation/reports_en | title=Annual Reports - Food Safety - European Commission}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there are some consumers who choose not to purchase irradiated food, a sufficient market has existed for retailers to have continuously stocked irradiated products for years.<ref name=\"StewartPR\">P.

The European Community does not provide for the use of the Radura logo and relies exclusively on labeling by the appropriate phrases in the respective languages of the Member States.

The addition of this central disc lowered the IUD's expulsion rate. These devices still had high rates of infection, and their use and development was further stifled by World War II politics: contraception was forbidden in both Nazi Germany and Axis-allied Japan.

The [[Jesuit missionary]] Dablon published an account in 1669-70 of \"an island called ''Menong'', celebrated for its copper.\"  ''Menong'', or ''Minong'', was the native term for the island, and is the basis for Minong Ridge.  [[Prospecting]] began in earnest when the [[Chippewas]] relinquished their claims to the island in 1843, starting with many of the original native pits.

Just prior to becoming a national park the large mammals on Isle Royale were [[Canada lynx]] and the [[boreal woodland caribou]]. Archeological evidence indicates both of these species were present on Isle Royale for 3,500 years prior to being removed by direct human actions (hunting, trapping, mining, logging, fires, competition for resources from exotic species and possibly disease due to the introduction of invasive species). The last caribou documented on Isle Royale was in 1925. Though lynx were removed by the 1930s some have periodically crossed the ice bridge from neighboring [[Ontario]], Canada, the most recent being an individual sighting in 1980.<ref name=\"npsmammals\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/upload/Mammals_ver7.pdf |title=Mammals on Isle Royale-Historical Context |publisher=National park Service |accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref> Although lynx are no longer present on\nthe island, their primary prey, [[snowshoe hare]]s, remain. Before the appearance of wolves, [[coyote]]s were also predators on the island. Coyotes appeared around 1905 and disappeared shortly after wolves arrived in the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Isro-ImageF 00002 rocky shore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rocky shoreline]]\nMoose are believed to have colonized Isle Royale sometime between 1905 and 1912. It was initially believed that a small herd of moose (moose typically do not travel in herds) colonized the islands by crossing the ice from the adjacent mainland; later this theory was modified to a herd of moose swimming 20 miles across [[Lake Superior]] from the nearest mainland. The improbability of these theories received little scrutiny until recent years. Although no thorough scientific investigation to determine how moose arrived on Isle Royale has been carried out to date, both cultural and genetic evidence indicates they were likely introduced by humans to create a private hunting preserve in the early 1900s. The cultural evidence that moose were trapped in northwestern [[Minnesota]] and transported to Isle Royale sounded far fetched to many until decades later when genetic evidence revealed the moose on Isle Royale were more closely related to moose in the far northwestern Minnesota/Manitoba border area than the mainland adjacent to Isle Royale in far northeastern Minnesota bordering Ontario. Further evidence has also shown that the [[Washington Harbor Club]], a group of well-to-do businessmen, owned various buildings on Isle Royale in addition to railroads that ran from [[Baudette]] to [[Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and so had the means to transport moose from northwestern Minnesota to Two Harbors.<ref name=\"npsnature\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/index.htm |title=Isle Royale: Nature & Science |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"gwf\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.georgewright.org/303cochrane.pdf |title=Island Complications: Should We Retain Wolves on Isle Royale? |last=Cochrane |first=Tim |journal=[[George Wright Society#Scope and activities|The George Wright Forum]] |volume=30 |number=3 |pages=313-325 |date=2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are usually around 25 wolves and 1000 moose on the island, but the numbers change greatly year to year.

The volcanics are mainly [[Poikilitic#Ophitic|ophitic]] [[flood basalt]]s, some 100 individual flows over an accumulated thickness of at least 10,000 feet.  The conglomerate [[outcrop]]s on the southwestern portion of the island and consists of [[sedimentary rock]] derived from volcanic rocks in present-day Minnesota.  [[Glacial erosion]] accentuated the ridge and valley topography from pre-glacial stream erosion.  [[Glacial striation]]s indicate a generally westward movement of the glaciers as do the [[recessional moraine]]s west of Lake Desor.  [[Drumlin]]s are found west of Siskiwit Lake.<ref name=Huber/>{{rp|8,14-15,21,25,42,45}}\n\nRecent analyses by the USGS of both unmineralized basalt and copper-mineralized rock show that a small amount of naturally occurring mercury is associated with mineralization.\n\n[[Native copper]] and [[chlorastrolite]], the official state [[gemstone|gem]] of Michigan, are [[primary minerals|secondary minerals]] filling [[pore space]]s formed by [[vesicular texture|vesicles]] and [[fracture (geology)|fractures]] within the volcanic rocks.  [[Prehnite]] and [[agate]] [[amygdule]]s are also plentiful island gemstones.<ref name=Huber/>{{rp|55,58-61}}\n\n==Recreation==\nThe Greenstone Ridge is a high ridge in the center of the island and carries the longest trail in the park, the [[Greenstone Ridge Trail]], which runs {{convert|40|mi}} from one end of the island to the other. This is generally done as a 4 or 5 day hike. A boat shuttle can carry hikers back to their starting port. In total there are {{convert|165|mi}} of hiking trails. There are also canoe/kayak routes, many involving portages, along coastal bays and inland lakes.\n\n===Services===\nThe park has two developed areas:\n\n[[Windigo Ranger Station|Windigo]], at the southwest end of the island (docking site for the ferries from [[Minnesota]]), with a campstore, showers, campsites, rustic camper cabins for those wanting to sleep off of the ground and a boat dock.\n\n[[Rock Harbor, Michigan|Rock Harbor]] on the south side of the northeast end (docking site for the ferries from Michigan), with a campstore, showers, restaurant, lodge, campsites, and a boat dock. Non-camping sleeping accommodations at the park are limited to the lodge at Rock Harbor and the camper cabins at Windigo.\n\n====Camping====\nThe park has 36 designated wilderness campgrounds. Some campgrounds in the interior are accessible only by trail or by [[canoe]]/[[kayak]] on the island lakes. Other campgrounds are accessible only by private boat. The campsites vary in capacity but typically include a few three-sided wood shelters (the fourth wall is screened) with floors and roofs, and several individual sites suitable for pitching a small tent. Some tent sites with space for groups of up to 10 are available, and are used for overflow if all the individual sites are filled.\n\nThe only amenities at the campgrounds are pit toilets, picnic tables, and fire-rings at specific areas. Campfires are not permitted at most campgrounds; gas or alcohol camp stoves are recommended. Drinking and cooking water must be drawn from local water sources (Lake Superior and inland lakes) and filtered, treated, or boiled to avoid parasites. Hunting is not permitted, but fishing is, and edible berries ([[Blueberry|blueberries]], [[thimbleberry|thimbleberries]]) may be picked from the trail.\n\n[[File:IsleRoyalePlane.jpg|thumb|right|Floatplane taking off from Windigo on Washington Harbor\u2014Beaver Island can be seen in the background at right]]\n\n===Access===\n{{See also|Isle Royale Ferry Service}}\nThe park is accessible by ferries, floatplanes, and passenger ships during the summer months\u2014from [[Houghton, Michigan|Houghton]] and [[Copper Harbor, Michigan|Copper Harbor]] in Michigan; and [[Grand Portage (community), Minnesota|Grand Portage]] in Minnesota. Private boats travel to the island from the coasts of Michigan, Minnesota, and Ontario.  Isle Royale is quite popular with [[day-tripper]]s in private boats, and day-trip ferry service is provided from Copper Harbor and Grand Portage to and from the park.\n\nIsle Royale is the only American national park to entirely close in the winter months, from November 1 through April 15, due to extreme weather conditions and for the safety and protection of visitors.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/hours.htm Operating Hours & Seasons]</ref> The average annual visitation was fewer than 17,000 in the period from 2007 to 2016; however, the park experienced record attendance of 24,966 in 2016.<ref name=\"visits\"/> Still, Isle Royale remains the least visited national park in the [[contiguous United States]], due to the winter closing and the distance across Lake Superior to reach the park. Only three of the most remote Alaskan national parks{{mdash}}[[Lake Clark National Park and Preserve|Lake Clark]], [[Kobuk Valley National Park|Kobuk Valley]] and [[Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve|Gates of the Arctic]]{{mdash}}receive fewer visitors.<ref name=\"visits\"/>\n\n===Ships===\nScheduled ferry service operates from Grand Portage, Copper Harbor and Houghton.\n\nThe Grand Portage ferries reach the island in 1 1/2 hours, and stay 4 hours at the island, allowing time for hiking, a guided hike or program by the park staff, and picnics.\n\nThe [[Isle Royale Queen IV|''Isle Royale Queen'']] serves park visitors out of Copper Harbor, on the northern Upper Peninsula coast of Michigan. It arrives at Rock Harbor in the park in 3 to 3 1/2 hours, spends 3 1/2 hours before returning to Copper Harbor.\n\nThe ''Sea Hunter'' operates round-trips and offers day trips to the Windigo visitor center through much of the season, and less frequently in early summer and autumn; it will transport kayaks and canoes for visitors wanting to explore the park from the water. It is the fastest ferry serving the island and arrives in 1 1/2 hours, including some sightseeing points along the way out and back. Because of the relatively short boat ride, day visitors are able to get four hours on the island, and get back to the mainland earlier in the afternoon. This gives visitors on a tight schedule time to visit the [[Grand Portage National Monument]] or other attractions in the same day.\n\nThe ''[[Ranger III]]'' is a {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} ship that serves park visitors from Houghton, Michigan to Rock Harbor. It is operated by the National Park Service, and is said to be the largest piece of equipment in the National Park system. It carries 125 passengers, along with canoes, kayaks, and even small powerboats. It is a six-hour voyage from Houghton to the park. The ship stays overnight at Rock Harbor before returning the next day, making two round trips each week from June to mid-September.  Briefly in the 2008 season, the Ranger III carried visitors to and from Windigo. This was not continued after four trips, due to low interest and  long crossing times.  In 2012, Park Superintendent Phyllis Green required the ''Ranger III'' to purify its ballast water.<ref name=JournalSentinelBallast2014-07-24/>\n\nThe ''Voyageur II'', out of Grand Portage, crosses up to three times a week, overnighting at Rock Harbor and providing transportation between popular lakeside campgrounds. In the fall season, in addition to carrying campers and hikers, it provides day-trip service to Windigo on weekends. The Voyageur transports kayaks and canoes for visitors wanting to explore the island from the water. The ''Voyageur II'' and other boat taxi services ferry hikers to points along the island, allowing a one-way hike back to Rock Harbor or Windigo. Visitors may land at Rock Harbor and depart from Windigo several days later, or vice versa.  Hikers frequently ride it in one direction to do a cross-island hike and then get picked up at the other end.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of islands in Isle Royale National Park]]\n*[[List of fish of Isle Royale National Park]]\n*[[List of birds of Isle Royale National Park]]\n*[[List of shipwrecks of Isle Royale]]\n*[[List of national parks of the United States]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Isle Royale National Park]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3|refs=\n<ref name=JournalSentinelBallast2014-07-24>{{cite news |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/park-chief-put-foot-down-on-invasive-species-can-others-follow-suit-b99297526z1-267014721.html |title = Park chief put foot down on invasive species.

The system was to be based on four air defense regions (ADRs) coordinated by [[Supreme Allied Commander|SACEUR]] (Supreme Allied Commander Europe). Starting from 1956 early warning coverage was extended across [[Western Europe]] using 18 radar stations. This part of the system was completed by 1962. Linked to existing national radar sites the coordinated system was called the '''NATO Air Defence Ground Environment''' ('''NADGE''').\n\nFrom 1960 NATO countries agreed to place all their air defence forces under the command of SACEUR in the event of war. These forces included command & control (C2) systems, radar installations, and Surface-to-Air (SAM) missile units as well as interceptor aircraft.\n\nBy 1972 NADGE was converted into NATINADS consisting of 84 radar sites and associated Control Reporting Centers (CRC) and in the 1980s the '''Airborne Early Warning / Ground Environment Integration Segment (AEGIS)''' upgraded the NATINADS with the possibility to integrate the AWACS radar picture and all of its information into its visual displays. (NOTE: This AEGIS is not to be confused with the U.S.Navy [[Aegis Combat System|AEGIS]], a shipboard fire control radar and weapons system.) AEGIS processed the information through Hughes H5118ME computers, which replaced the H3118M computers installed at NADGE sites in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nNATINADS ability to handle data increased with faster clock rates. The H5118M computer had a staggering 1 megabyte of memory and could handle 1.2 million instructions per second while the former model had a memory of only 256 kilobytes and a clock speed of 150000 instructions per seconds.<ref>http://ed-thelen.org/aadcp.html</ref>\n\nNATINADS/AEGIS were complemented, in W-Germany by the '''German Air Defence Ground Environment (GEADGE)''', an updated radar network adding the southern part of W-Germany to the European system and '''Coastal Radar Integration System (CRIS)''', adding data links from Danish coastal radars.\n\nIn order to counter the hardware obsolescence, during the mid-90's NATO started the '''AEGIS Site Emulator (ASE)''' program allowing the NATINADS/AEGIS sites to replace the proprietary hardware (the 5118ME computer and the various operator consoles IDM-2, HMD-22, IDM-80) with Commercial-Off-the-Shelf servers and workstations.\n\nIn the first years 2000, the initial ASE capability was expanded with the possibility to run, thanks to the new hardware power, multiple site emulators on the same hardware, so the system was renamed into '''Multi-AEGIS Site Emulator (MASE)'''. The NATO system designed to replace MASE in the near future is the [[ACCS|Air Command and Control System]] (ACCS).\n\nBecause of changing politics, NATO expanding and financial crises most European (NATO) countries are trying to cut defence budgets; as a direct result lots of obsolete and outdated NATINADS facilities are phased out earlier. Currently (2013) still operational NATO radar sites in Europe are these:\n\n== Allied Air Command ==\n'''[[Allied Air Command]]''' (AIRCOM) is the [[Staff (military)|central command]] of all [[NATO]] [[air force]]s on the European continent. The command is based at [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]] and has two subordinate commands in Germany and Spain.

Examples include consulting services, shipping services, tourism, and patent license revenues. This figure is usually generated by [[tertiary industry]]. The term 'invisible balance' is especially common in the United Kingdom.\n\nFor countries that rely on service exports or on tourism, the invisible balance is particularly important. For instance the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia receive significant international income from financial services, while Japan and Germany rely more on exports of manufactured goods.\n\n==Types of invisibles==\n\nInvisibles are both international payments for services (as opposed to goods), as well as movements of money without exchange for goods or services. These invisibles are called 'transfer payments' or 'remittances' and may include money sent from one country to another by an individual, business, government or non-governmental organisations ([[NGO]]) &ndash; often charities.\n\nAn individual remittance may include money sent to a relative overseas. Business transfers may include profits sent by a foreign subsidiary to a parent company or money invested by a business in a foreign country. Bank loans to foreign countries are also included in this category, as are license fees paid for the use of patents and trademarks. Government transfers may involve loans made or official aid given to foreign countries, while transfers made by NGO's include money designated for charitable work within foreign countries, respectively.\n\n==Balance of payments and invisibles==\nIn many countries a useful distinction is drawn between the [[balance of trade]] and the [[balance of payments]].  'Balance of trade' refers to the trade of both tangible (physical) objects as well as the trade in services &ndash; collectively known as exports and imports (in other words, 'visibles plus services') &ndash; while the 'balance of payments' also includes transfers of Capital in the form of loans, investments in shares or direct investment in projects.\n\nA nation may have a visibles balance surplus but this can be offset by a larger deficit in the invisibles balance (creating a Balance of Trade deficit overall) \u2013 if, for example, there are large payments made to foreign businesses for invisibles such as shipping or tourism. On the other hand, a Visibles Balance deficit can be offset by a strong surplus on the invisibles balance if, for example, foreign aid is being provided.\n\nIn a similar way, a nation may also have a surplus 'balance of trade' because it exports more than it imports but a negative (or deficit) 'balance of payments' because, it has a much greater shortfall in transfers of capital. And, just as easily, a deficit in the 'balance of trade' may be offset by a larger surplus in capital transfers from overseas to produce a balance of payments surplus overall.\n\n==Balance of payments problems and the invisible balance==\nProblems with a country's balance of trade (or balance of payments) are often associated with an inappropriate valuation of its currency, its country's foreign exchange rate.\n\nIf a country's exchange rate is too high, its exports will become uncompetitive as buyers in foreign countries require more of their own currency to pay for them. In the meantime, it also becomes cheaper for the citizens of the country to buy goods from overseas,as opposed to buying locally produced goods), because an overvalued currency makes foreign products less expensive.\n\nThe simultaneous decline in currency inflows from decreased exports and the rise in outflows, due to increased imports, sends the balance of trade into deficit, which then needs to be paid for by a transfer of funds in some form, either invisible transfers (aid, etc.) or capital flows (loans, etc.). However, relying on funds like that to support a trade deficit, is unsustainable, and the country may eventually  require its currency to be devalued.\n\nIf, on the other hand, a currency is undervalued, its exports will become cheaper and therefore more competitive internationally. At the same time, imports will also become more costly, stimulating the production of domestic substitutes to replace them. That will result in a growth of currency flowing into the country and a decline in currency flowing out of it, resulting in an improvement in the country's balance of trade.\n\nBecause a nation's exchange rate has a big impact on its 'balance of trade' and its 'balance of payments', many economists favour freely [[floating exchange rate]]s over the older, fixed (or pegged) rates of foreign currency exchange. Floating exchange rates allow more regular adjustments in exchange rates to occur, allowing the greater opportunity for international payments to maintain equilibrium.\n\n[[Category:National accounts]]\n[[Category:International trade]]", "sha1": "svmnchix4ia7s6jul413fz52w2mqwzn"}}, {"title": "Isotopic tracer", "ns": "0", "id": "15383", "redirect": {"title": "Isotopic labeling"}, "revision": {"id": "103763590", "parentid": "98751781", "timestamp": "2007-01-28T04:24:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "Radagast83", "id": "668752"}, "comment": "completed merge", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Isotopic labeling]]", "sha1": "scy80f21qiulbyqbbpojrdk9u20wrf9"}}, {"title": "Irreducible complexity", "ns": "0", "id": "15387", "revision": {"id": "866432497", "parentid": "861609055", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T08:49:34Z", "contributor": {"username": "Pbsouthwood", "id": "10044298"}, "comment": "Adding local [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: \"Argument by proponents of intelligent design that certain biological systems are too complex to have evolved\" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Argument by proponents of intelligent design that certain biological systems are too complex to have evolved}}\n{{about|the concept in intelligent design|the concept in systems theory|Emergence}}\n{{Intelligent Design}}\n\n'''Irreducible complexity''' ('''IC''') is the idea that certain [[biological system]]s cannot [[evolution|evolve]] by successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems through [[natural selection]].

The environment \"selects\" the variants that have the highest fitness, which are then passed on to the next generation of organisms. Change occurs by the gradual operation of natural forces over time, perhaps slowly, perhaps more quickly (see [[punctuated equilibrium]]). This process is able to [[adaptation|adapt]] complex structures from simpler beginnings, or convert complex structures from one function to another (see [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]). Most intelligent design advocates accept that evolution occurs through mutation and natural selection at the \"[[microevolution|micro level]]\", such as changing the relative frequency of various beak lengths in finches, but assert that it cannot account for irreducible complexity, because none of the parts of an irreducible system would be functional or advantageous until the entire system is in place.\n\n===The mousetrap example===\n[[File:Mausefalle 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Michael Behe]] believes that many aspects of life show evidence of design, using the [[mousetrap]] in an analogy disputed by others.<ref name=trap>[http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html A reducibly complex mousetrap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041104/http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html |date=2014-02-22 }} (graphics-intensive, requires [[JavaScript]])</ref>]]\n\nBehe uses the mousetrap as an illustrative example of this concept. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. All of these must be in place for the mousetrap to work, as the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Likewise, he asserts that biological systems require multiple parts working together in order to function. Intelligent design advocates claim that natural selection could not create from scratch those systems for which science is currently unable to find a viable evolutionary pathway of successive, slight modifications, because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled.\n\nIn his 2008 book ''[[Only A Theory]]'', biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] challenges Behe's claim that the mousetrap is irreducibly complex.<ref name=Only /> Miller observes that various subsets of the five components can be devised to form cooperative units, ones that have different functions from the mousetrap and so, in biological terms, could form functional [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]] before being adapted to the new function of catching mice. In an example taken from his high school experience, Miller recalls that one of his classmates<blockquote>...struck upon the brilliant idea of using an old, broken mousetrap as a spitball catapult, and it worked brilliantly.... It had worked perfectly as something other than a mousetrap.... my rowdy friend had pulled a couple of parts --probably the hold-down bar and catch-- off the trap to make it easier to conceal and more effective as a catapult... [leaving] the base, the spring, and the hammer. Not much of a mousetrap, but a helluva spitball launcher.... I realized why [Behe's] mousetrap analogy had bothered me. It was wrong. The mousetrap is not irreducibly complex after all.<ref name=Only>{{cite book |title= Only A Theory |first= Kenneth R. |last= Miller |location= New York |year= 2008 |publisher= Viking Penguin |pages= 54\u201355 |isbn= 978-0-670-01883-3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOther systems identified by Miller that include mousetrap components include the following:<ref name= Only/>\n*use the spitball launcher as a tie clip (same three-part system with different function)\n*remove the spring from the spitball launcher/tie clip to create a two-part key chain (base + hammer)\n*glue the spitball launcher/tie clip to a sheet of wood to create a clipboard (launcher + glue + wood)\n*remove the hold-down bar for use as a toothpick (single element system)\n\nThe point of the reduction is that - in biology - most or all of the components were already at hand, by the time it became necessary to build a mousetrap. As such, it required far fewer steps to develop a mousetrap than to design all the components from scratch.\n\nThus, the development of the mousetrap, said to consist of five different parts which had no function on their own, has been reduced to one step: the assembly from parts that are already present, performing other functions.\n\nThe Intelligent Design argument focuses on the functionality to catch mice. It skips over the case that many, if not all, parts are already available in their own right, at the time that the need for a mousetrap arises.\n\n===Consequences===\n\nSupporters of intelligent design argue that anything less than the complete form of such a system or organ would not work at all, or would in fact be a ''detriment'' to the organism, and would therefore never survive the process of natural selection. Although they accept that some complex systems and organs ''can'' be explained by evolution, they claim that organs and biological features which are ''irreducibly complex'' cannot be explained by current models, and that an intelligent designer must have created life or guided its evolution. Accordingly, the debate on irreducible complexity concerns two questions: whether irreducible complexity can be found in nature, and what significance it would have if it did exist in nature.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nBehe's original examples of irreducibly complex mechanisms included the bacterial [[flagellum]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[coagulation|the blood clotting cascade]], [[cilia]], and the [[adaptive immune system]].\n\nBehe argues that organs and biological features which are irreducibly complex cannot be wholly explained by current models of [[evolution]]. In explicating his definition of \"irreducible complexity\" he notes that:\n<blockquote>An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.</blockquote>\n\nIrreducible complexity is not an argument that evolution does not occur, but rather an argument that it is \"incomplete\". In the last chapter of ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', Behe goes on to explain his view that irreducible complexity is evidence for [[intelligent design]]. Mainstream critics, however, argue that irreducible complexity, as defined by Behe, can be generated by known evolutionary mechanisms. Behe's claim that no scientific literature adequately modeled the origins of biochemical systems through evolutionary mechanisms has been challenged by [[TalkOrigins Archive|TalkOrigins]].<ref>[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html Claim CA350: Professional literature is silent on the subject of the evolution of biochemical systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304172657/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html |date=2007-03-04 }} TalkOrigins Archive.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Behe |first= Michael J. |authorlink= Michael Behe |title= Darwin's black box: the biochemical challenge to evolution |isbn= 0-684-82754-9 |page= 72 |chapter= |quote= \"Yet here again the evolutionary literature is totally missing.

One likely chain of development is that the eyes originated as simple patches of [[photoreceptor cell]]s that could detect the presence or absence of light, but not its direction. When, via random mutation across the population, the photosensitive cells happened to have developed on a small depression, it endowed the organism with a better sense of the light's source. This small change gave the organism an advantage over those without the mutation. This genetic trait would then be \"selected for\" as those with the trait would have an increased chance of survival, and therefore progeny, over those without the trait. Individuals with deeper depressions would be able to discern changes in light over a wider field than those individuals with shallower depressions. As ever deeper depressions were advantageous to the organism, gradually, this depression would become a pit into which light would strike certain cells depending on its angle. The organism slowly gained increasingly precise visual information. And again, this gradual process continued as individuals having a slightly shrunken [[aperture]] of the eye had an advantage over those without the mutation as an aperture increases how [[collimated]] the light is at any one specific group of photoreceptors. As this trait developed, the eye became effectively a [[pinhole camera]] which allowed the organism to dimly make out shapes\u2014the [[nautilus]] is a modern example of an animal with such an eye. Finally, via this same selection process, a protective layer of transparent cells over the aperture was differentiated into a crude [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and the interior of the eye was filled with humours to assist in focusing images.<ref>Fernald, Russell D.

Both normally function so as to control the mouse population. The cat has many parts that can be removed leaving it still functional; for example, its tail can be bobbed, or it can lose an ear in a fight. Comparing the cat and the mousetrap, then, one sees that the mousetrap (which is not alive) offers better evidence, in terms of irreducible complexity, for intelligent design than the cat. Even looking at the mousetrap analogy, several critics have described ways in which the parts of the mousetrap could have independent uses or could develop in stages, demonstrating that it is not irreducibly complex.<ref name=trap/><ref name=Only/>\n\nMoreover, even cases where removing a certain component in an organic system will cause the system to fail do not demonstrate that the system could not have been formed in a step-by-step, evolutionary process. By analogy, stone arches are irreducibly complex&mdash;if you remove any stone the arch will collapse\u2014yet humans [[arch#Construction|build them]] easily enough, one stone at a time, by building over [[centring|centering]] that is removed afterward. Similarly, [[natural arch|naturally occurring arches]] of stone form by the weathering away of bits of stone from a large concretion that has formed previously.\n\nEvolution can act to simplify as well as to complicate.

The theory of [[facilitated variation]] challenges irreducible complexity. [[Marc W. Kirschner]], a professor and chair of Department of Systems Biology at [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[John C. Gerhart]], a professor in Molecular and Cell Biology, [[University of California, Berkeley]], presented this theory in 2005.

Evolutionary biologists argue that evolution often works in this kind of blind, haphazard manner in which the function of an early form is not necessarily the same as the function of the later form. The term used for this process is [[exaptation]]. The [[evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles|mammalian middle ear]] (derived from a jawbone) and the [[giant panda|panda]]'s thumb (derived from a wrist bone spur) provide classic examples.

The results of such [[genetic algorithm]]s are frequently irreducibly complex since the process, like evolution, both removes non-essential components over time as well as adding new components. The removal of unused components with no essential function, like the natural process where rock underneath a [[natural arch]] is removed, can produce irreducibly complex structures without requiring the intervention of a designer.

If truly irreducible systems are found, the argument goes, then [[intelligent design]] must be the correct explanation for their existence.

Dover Area School District|Dover]]'' noted that this implicit assumption of the defendant school board created a \"flawed and illogical contrived dualism\" (Opinion p. 64).</ref>\n\n==In the Dover trial==\nWhile testifying during the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed papers supporting his claims that complex [[molecular]] systems, like the bacterial flagellum, the blood-clotting cascade, and the immune system, were intelligently designed nor are there any peer-reviewed articles supporting his argument that certain complex molecular structures are \"irreducibly complex.\"<ref name=\"Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science\"/>\n\nIn the final ruling of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', Judge Jones specifically singled out Behe and irreducible complexity:<ref name=Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science>[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science|Memorandum Opinion, Judge John E. Jones III, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]</ref>\n*\"Professor Behe admitted in \"Reply to My Critics\" that there was a defect in his view of irreducible complexity because, while it purports to be a challenge to natural selection, it does not actually address \"the task facing natural selection.\" and that \"Professor Behe wrote that he hoped to \"repair this defect in future work...\" (Page 73)\n*\"As expert testimony revealed, the qualification on what is meant by \"irreducible complexity\" renders it meaningless as a criticism of evolution. (3:40 (Miller)). In fact, the theory of evolution proffers exaptation as a well-recognized, well-documented explanation for how systems with multiple parts could have evolved through natural means.\" (Page 74)\n*\"By defining irreducible complexity in the way that he has, Professor Behe attempts to exclude the phenomenon of exaptation by definitional fiat, ignoring as he does so abundant evidence which refutes his argument. Notably, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS]] has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity...\" (Page 75)\n*\"As irreducible complexity is only a negative argument against evolution, it is refutable and accordingly testable, unlike ID [Intelligent Design], by showing that there are intermediate structures with selectable functions that could have evolved into the allegedly irreducibly complex systems. (2:15-16 (Miller)). Importantly, however, the fact that the negative argument of irreducible complexity is testable does not make testable the argument for ID. (2:15 (Miller); 5:39 (Pennock)). Professor Behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems: (1) the bacterial flagellum; (2) the blood-clotting cascade; and (3) the immune system. Contrary to Professor Behe's assertions with respect to these few biochemical systems among the myriad existing in nature, however, Dr. Miller presented evidence, based upon peer-reviewed studies, that they are not in fact irreducibly complex.\" (Page 76)\n*\"...on cross-examination, Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system. He was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not \"good enough.\" (23:19 (Behe)).\" (Page 78)\n*\"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large. (17:45-46 (Padian); 3:99 (Miller)). Additionally, even if irreducible complexity had not been rejected, it still does not support ID as it is merely a test for evolution, not design. (2:15, 2:35-40 (Miller); 28:63-66 (Fuller)). We will now consider the purportedly \"positive argument\" for design encompassed in the phrase used numerous times by Professors Behe and Minnich throughout their expert testimony, which is the \"purposeful arrangement of parts.\" Professor Behe summarized the argument as follows: We infer design when we see parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose. The strength of the inference is quantitative; the more parts that are arranged, the more intricately they interact, the stronger is our confidence in design. The appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming. Since nothing other than an intelligent cause has been demonstrated to be able to yield such a strong appearance of design, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, the conclusion that the design seen in life is real design is rationally justified. (18:90-91, 18:109-10 (Behe); 37:50 (Minnich)). As previously indicated, this argument is merely a restatement of the [[William Paley|Reverend William Paley]]'s argument applied at the cell level. Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God. (1:6- 7 (Miller); 38:44, 57 (Minnich)). Expert testimony revealed that this inductive argument is not scientific and as admitted by Professor Behe, can never be ruled out. (2:40 (Miller); 22:101 (Behe); 3:99 (Miller)).\" (Pages 79\u201380)\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite book |last=Behe |first=Michael |year=1996 |title=[[Darwin's Black Box]] |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press |isbn=0-684-83493-6 |oclc=34150540}}\n* {{cite book |last=Denton |first=Michael |title=[[Evolution: A Theory in Crisis]] |publisher=Adler & Adler |location=Bethesda |year=1986 |isbn=0-917561-05-8}}\n* {{cite journal |author=Macnab RM |title=Type III flagellar protein export and flagellar assembly |journal=Biochim Biophys Acta |year=2004 |pages=207\u201317 |volume=1694 |issue=1\u20133 |pmid=15546667 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2004.04.005}}\n* {{cite journal |author1=Ruben, J.A. |author2=Jones, T.D. |author3=Geist, N.R. |author4=Hillenius, W.J. |date=November 14, 1997|title=Lung Structure and Ventilation in Theropod Dinosaurs and Early Birds |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1267\u201370 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1267 |bibcode=1997Sci...278.1267R}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050518085017/http://www.carlzimmer.com/articles/2005/articles_2005_Avida.html |archivedate=18 May 2005 |title=Testing Darwin |journal=[[Discover Magazine]] |url=http://www.discovermagazine.com/issues/feb-05/cover/ |volume=26 |issue=2 |date=February 2005}}\n\n==External links==\n;Supportive\n*[http://www.arn.org/authors/behe.html Michael J.

A Preparatory Commission began operations fourteen months previously. In 1948, the treaty establishing the IRO formally entered into force and the IRO became a [[United Nations]] [[specialized agency]]. The IRO assumed most of the functions of the earlier [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]]. In 1952, operations of the IRO ceased, and it was replaced by the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR).\n\nThe '''Constitution of the International Refugee Organization''', adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 15 December 1946, is the founding document of the IRO. The constitution specified the organization's field of operations. Controversially, the constitution defined \"persons of German ethnic origin\" who had been expelled, or were to be expelled from their countries of birth into the postwar Germany, as individuals who would \"not be the concern of the Organization.\" This excluded from its purview a group that exceeded in number all the other European displaced persons put together. Also, because of disagreements between the Western allies and the Soviet Union, the IRO only worked in areas controlled by Western armies of occupation.\n\nTwenty-six states became members of the IRO and it formally came into existence in 1948: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Republic of China, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, France, Guatemala, Honduras, Iceland, Italy, Liberia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. The U.S. provided about 40% of the IRO's $155 million annual budget. The total contribution by the members for the five years of operation was around $400 million. It had rehabilitated around 10 million people during this time, out of 15 million people who were stranded in Europe. The IRO's first Director General was William Hallam Tuck, succeeded by J. Donald Kingsley on 31 July 1949.<ref>Holborn, Louise W. 1956.  The International Refugee Organization : a specialized agency of the United Nations, its history and work, 1946\u20131952.

By that time many of its responsibilities had been assumed by other agencies. Of particular importance was the [[Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees]], established in January 1951 as a part of the United Nations, and the [[Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration]] (originally PICMME), set up in December 1951. <ref>[https://archives.un.org/sites/archives.un.org/files/files/Finding%20Aids/2015_Finding_Aids/AG-018-007.pdf Summary of AG-018-007 International Refugee Organization (IRO)]</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n* ''[[The Search]]'' by [[Fred Zinnemann]] (1948): The IRO helped the producers to make this story about children refugees, in 1945 Germany.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decad053.asp Constitution of the International Refugee Organisation]\n* Original, complete constitution of the IRO, as signed by the [[Government of the United Kingdom]]: https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%2018/v18.pdf\n* [http://www.search-people.at.ua/publ/information_about_piotr_bozyk_1945_1949/2_1948_4_1949_piotr_bozyk_policeman_iro_area_vocational_training_school_ingolstadt_bavaria/policeman_iro_area_vocational_training_school_ingolstadt_bavaria_germany_1948/33-1-0-1 IRO.

She was a patron of the arts as well as a leader of fashion, whose innovative style of dressing was copied by women throughout Italy and at the French court.  The poet Ariosto labeled her as the \"liberal and magnanimous Isabella\",<ref>Marek, George R. (1976). ''The Bed and the Throne: The Life of Isabella d'Este''. New York: Harper and Row Publishers.p.ix {{ISBN|978-0-06-012810-4}}</ref> while author Matteo Bandello described her as having been \"supreme among women\".<ref name=\"Marek, p.ix\">Marek, p.ix</ref> Diplomat [[Niccol\u00f2 da Correggio]] went even further by hailing her as \"The First Lady of the world\".<ref name=\"Marek, p.ix\"/>\n\nShe served as the [[regent]] of Mantua during the absence of her husband, [[Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua]], and the minority of her son, [[Federico II, Duke of Mantua|Federico, Duke of Mantua]]. In 1500 she met King [[Louis XII of France]] in Milan on a diplomatic mission to persuade him not to send his troops against Mantua.\n\nShe was a prolific letter-writer and maintained a lifelong correspondence with her sister-in-law [[Elisabetta Gonzaga]]. [[Lucrezia Borgia]] was another sister-in-law; she later became the mistress of Isabella's husband.\n\n[[File:Isabella d'Este palazzo ducale.jpg|thumb|200px||Miniature of Isabella]]\nIsabella d'Este grew up in a cultured family in the city-state of [[Ferrara]]. She received a fine classical education and as a girl met many famous humanist scholars and artists.\nDue to the vast amount of extant correspondence between Isabella and her family and friends, her life is unusually well documented.<ref name=\"Marek, p.xiv\">Marek, p.xiv</ref> She was born on Tuesday 19 May 1474 at nine o'clock in the evening<ref>Marek, p.12 Isabella's mother wrote a letter to her friend Barbara Gonzaga describing the details of Isabella's birth</ref><ref>Note: In 15th century Italy the day began at sunset rather than at midnight; therefore as Isabella's birth occurred on 19 May at the second hour, this indicated that she was actually born on 18 May, at 9.00 PM</ref> in [[Ferrara]], to [[Ercole I d'Este]], Duke of Ferrara, and [[Eleanor of Naples, Duchess of Ferrara|Eleanor of Naples]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Julia Mary Cartwright Ady, Isabella d'Este, marchioness of Mantua, 1474\u20131539: a study of the renaissance, Volume 1, 1907</ref> Eleanor was the daughter of [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand I]], the Aragonese King of Naples, and [[Isabella of Clermont]].<ref>Marek, p.12</ref>\n\nOne year later on 29 June 1475 her sister [[Beatrice d'Este|Beatrice]] was born, and in 1476 and 1477 two brothers, [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso]] and [[Ippolito d'Este|Ippolito]] arrived. In 1479 and 1480 two more brothers were born; they were Ferrante and Sigismondo. Of all the children Isabella was considered to have been the favourite.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardener |first= Edmund |title= Dukes & Poets in Ferrara |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co. LTD |year= 1904 |location=London |page=238}}</ref>\n\nIn the year of Ferrante's birth, Isabella travelled to Naples with her mother. When her mother returned to Ferrara, Isabella accompanied her, while the other children stayed behind with their grandfather for eight years. It was during the journey with her mother that Isabella acquired the art of diplomacy and statecraft.\n\n==Education==\n\nIsabella was a very well educated young woman. As a child she studied Roman history and rapidly learned to translate Greek and Latin (the former would become her favourite language){{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Because of her outstanding intellect, she often discussed the classics and the affairs of state with ambassadors. Moreover, she was personally acquainted with the painters, musicians, writers, and scholars who lived in and around the court. Besides her knowledge of history and languages, she could also recite [[Virgil]] and [[Terence]] by heart. Isabella was also a talented singer and musician, and was taught to play the [[lute]] by [[Giovanni Angelo Testagrossa]].<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Giovanni Angelo Testagrossa|author=Ness, Arthur J.|access-date=10 December 2006}}</ref> In addition to all these admirable accomplishments, she was also an innovator of new dances, having been instructed in the art by Ambrogio, a Jewish dancing master.<ref>Marek, pp.16\u201317</ref>\n\nShe was described as having been physically attractive, albeit slightly plump; however, she also possessed \"lively eyes\" and was \"of lively grace\".<ref>Marek, p.16</ref>\n\nIn 1480, at the age of six, Isabella was betrothed to [[Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua|Francesco]], the heir to the Marquis of Mantua. Although he was not handsome, Isabella admired him for his strength and bravery; she also regarded him as a gentleman. After their first few encounters she found that she enjoyed his company and she spent the next few years getting to know him and preparing herself to be the Marquise of Mantua. During their courtship, Isabella treasured the letters, poems, and sonnets he sent her as gifts.\n\n==Marquise of Mantua==\n\nTen years later on 11 February 1490, at age 15, she married [[Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua|Francesco Gonzaga]], who had by then succeeded to the marquisate. Isabella became his wife and marquise amid a spectacular outpouring of popular acclamation. Besides Marquis, Francesco was also Captain General of the armies of the [[Republic of Venice]]. She brought as her marriage portion the sum of 3,000 [[ducats]] besides valuable jewellery, dishes, and a silver service.<ref>Marek, p.28</ref> Prior to the magnificent banquet which followed the wedding ceremony, Isabella rode through the main streets of Ferrara astride a horse draped in gems and gold.<ref>Marek, p.30</ref>\n[[File:Francesco II Gonzaga.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua]], Isabella's husband.]]\nAs the couple had known and admired one another for many years, their mutual attraction deepened into love; marriage to Francesco allegedly caused Isabella to \"bloom\".<ref name=\"Marek, p.33\">Marek, p.33</ref> At the time of her wedding, Isabella was said to have been pretty, slim, graceful and well-dressed.<ref>Marek, pp.33\u201334</ref> Her long, fine hair was dyed pale blonde, and her eyes, \"brown as fir cones in autumn, scattered laughter\".<ref>Marek, p.34</ref>\n\nFrancesco, in his capacity of Captain General of the Venetian armies, was often required to go to [[Venice]] for conferences which left Isabella in Mantua on her own at ''La Reggia'' the ancient palace which was the [[family seat]] of the Gonzagas.<ref name=\"Marek, p.35\">Marek, p.35</ref> She did not lack company, however, as she passed the time with her mother and sister, Beatrice; and upon meeting Elisabetta Gonzaga, her 18-year-old sister-in-law, the two women became close friends. They enjoyed reading books, playing cards, and travelling about the countryside together. Once they journeyed as far as [[Lake Garda]] during one of Francesco's absences,<ref name=\"Marek, p.35\"/> and later travelled to Venice. They maintained a steady correspondence until Elisabetta's death in 1526.\n\nAlmost four years after her marriage in December 1493, Isabella gave birth to her first child out of an eventual total of eight; it was a daughter, Eleonora, whom they called Leonora for short.\n\n===Children===\nTogether Isabella and Francesco had eight children:<ref>{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/gonzaga/gonzaga3.html#Fe2 3 boys and 5 girls|title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Gonzaga |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Eleonora Gonzaga (1493-1570)|Eleonora Gonzaga]] (31 December 1493&nbsp;\u2013 13 February 1570), married [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]], Duke of Urbino, by whom she had issue\n* Margherita Gonzaga (13 July 1496&nbsp;\u2013 22 September 1496)\n* [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] (17 May 1500&nbsp;\u2013 28 August 1540), married [[Margaret Paleologa]], by whom he had issue\n* Livia Gonzaga (1501&nbsp;\u2013 January 1508).\n* [[Ippolita Gonzaga]] (13 November 1503&nbsp;\u2013 16 March 1570), a nun\n* [[Ercole Gonzaga]] (23 November 1505&nbsp;\u2013 2 March 1563), Cardinal, Bishop of Mantua\n* [[Ferrante Gonzaga]] (28 January 1507&nbsp;\u2013 15 November 1557), a [[condottiero]]; married Isabella di Capua, by whom he had issue\n* [[Paola Gonzaga|Livia Gonzaga]] (August 1508&nbsp;\u2013 1569), a nun\n\n===Lucrezia Borgia===\n\nA year after her marriage to Isabella's brother Alfonso<ref>Note:In June 1505, Alfonso succeeded their father as duke, making Lucrezia Duchess of Ferrara</ref> in 1502, the notorious [[Lucrezia Borgia]] became the mistress of Francesco.

When her husband was captured in 1509 and held hostage in Venice, she took control of Mantua's military forces and held off the invaders until his release in 1512. In the same year, 1512, she was the hostess at the Congress of Mantua, which was held to settle questions concerning Florence and Milan.<ref>Marek, p.250</ref> As a ruler, she appeared to have been much more assertive and competent than her husband. When apprised of this fact upon his return, Francesco was furious and humiliated at being upstaged by his wife's superior political ability. This caused their marriage to break down irrevocably. As a result, Isabella began to travel freely and live independently from her husband until his death on 19 March 1519.\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Isabella ruled Mantua as regent for her son [[Frederick II, Duke of Mantua|Federico]].  She began to play an increasingly important role in Italian politics, steadily advancing Mantua's position. She was instrumental in promoting Mantua to a Duchy, which was obtained by wise diplomatic use of her son's marriage contracts. She also succeeded in obtaining a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]ate for her son [[Ercole Gonzaga|Ercole]]. She further displayed shrewd political acumen in her negotiations with [[Cesare Borgia]], who had dispossessed [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], [[duke of Urbino]], the husband of her sister-in-law and good friend [[Elisabetta Gonzaga]] in 1502.\n\n==Cultural pursuits==\nIsabella d'Este is famous as the most important art patron of the [[Renaissance]]; her life is documented by her correspondence, which is still archived in Mantua (c. 28,000 letters received and copies of c. 12,000 letters written).<ref>Shemek, Deanna: ''Phaethon's Children: The Este Court and its Culture in Early Modern Ferrara''.

Details of the pictures: medal by Gian Cristoforo Romano; drawing by Leonardo da Vinci; Titian (known by copy Peter Paul Rubens): ''Isabella in Red''; Titian (rejuvenated): ''Isabella in Black'' versus ''La Bella'' (1536); Ambras miniature by unknown.]]\nDespite her significant art patronage, which included a number of portraits&nbsp;\u2013 no other person of her time was so often portrayed<ref name=\"Ferino 1994, p. 86\">Ferino (1994), p. 86</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 there are very few surviving identified portraits of Isabella. These few identifications are known as inhomogeneous (i.e. differing eye and hair colours as well as divergent eyebrows in both Titian portraits)<ref name=\"Ferino 1994, p. 86\"/> and there are no images of her between the ages of 26 and 54 (see picture). It is known that the elderly Isabella preferred idealized paintings and even waived sitting as a model.<ref>Ferino (1994), p. 94</ref> However it could be assumed that she still insisted on seeing her personal characteristics in the outcome.<ref>Several letters mention Isabella's request for overpainting hair and eye colours, i.e. Luzio, Alessandro: ''Federico Gonzaga ostaggio alla corte di Giulio II''. Societa Romana di storia patria (Rome) 1887, p. 59: \"... pregandolo tuttavia a ritoccare il ritratto ne' capelli, che il pittore aveva fatti troppo biondi\" and Luzio (1913), p. 213: \"... a commutar gli occhij de nigri in bianchi\"</ref> Isabelle carefully managed her image. A portrait of her by Andrea Mantegna was rejected because it 'looked nothing at all like us'. The portrait most probably looked too much like Isabella who was prone to corpulence.\n\nIn recent years several museums have withdrawn their few identifications of portraits as Isabella because of the risk of misidentification.<ref>See:\n* [[Royal Collection]], London (RCIN 405762): Lorenzo Costa ''Portrait of a Lady with a Lapdog'' (c. 1500\u201305)\n* Royal Collection, London (RCIN 405777): Giulio Romano 'Margherita Paleologa' (1531)\n* [[Currier Museum of Art]], Manchester (inv. 1947.4): Lorenzo Costa ''Portrait of a Woman'' (1506\u201310)\n* [[Louvre]], Paris (inv 894): [[Giovanni Francesco Caroto]] ''Portrait de femme'' (c. 1505\u201310)</ref> The remaining three colourful portraits are still inhomogeneous ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]/KHM, Vienna):<ref>KHM Vienna: Inv. 83, Inv 1534, Inv 5081</ref>\n* ''Isabella in Red'' by Titian, c. 1529 (lost, known from a copy by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] c. 1605)\n* ''[[Isabella in Black]]'' by Titian, 1536\n* 'Ambras Miniature', 16th century\n\n''[[La Bella]]'' (now in [[Palazzo Pitti]], Florence) has been discussed as an alternative to Titian's 1536 portrait in Vienna, because the commission from the 60-year-old patron was for a rejuvenated portrait; if La Bella were Isabella, eye colour, hair colour, eyebrows and general appearance would homogenize in all known portraits, allowing potential links toward further identifications.<ref>i.e. Ozzola, Leandro (1931): ''Isabella d'Este e Tiziano''.

Louis had been impressed by her alluring personality and keen intelligence.<ref>Marek, p.80-81</ref> It was while she was being entertained by Louis, whose troops occupied Milan, that she offered asylum to Milanese refugees including [[Cecilia Gallerani]], the refined mistress of her sister Beatrice's husband, [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan, who had been forced to leave his duchy in the wake of French occupation. Isabella presented Cecilia to King Louis, describing her as a \"lady of rare gifts and charm\".<ref>Marek, p.80</ref>\n\nIsabella was also an extreme example of the Renaissance European tendency to treat black African slaves in her household as exotic accessories. Isabella's fascination with black child servants is extensively documented.<ref>Alessandro Luzio and Rodolfo Renier, 'Buffoni, schiavi e nani alla corte dei Gonzaga ai tempi d'Esabella d'Este', Nuova Antologia, 19 (1891), pp.112\u201346, 140\u20135.</ref> On 1 May 1491 Isabella asked Giorgio Brognolo, her agent in Venice, to procure a young black girl ('una moreta') between the ages of one-and-a-half and four, and twice in early June reminded him of the request, emphasizing that the girl should be 'as black as possible'.<ref>Paul H.D. Kaplan, \"Isabella d'Este and black African women,\" Black Africans in Renaissance Europe, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005)</ref> Isabella's household and financial records reflect she already had a significantly older black girl in her service when she inquired after a younger black child. Records also reflect that she obtained a little black girl from a Venetian orphanage, opened negotiations with a Venetian patrician household for the sale of a little black boy and purchased an enslaved little black girl from her sister.<ref>Kaplan, 153.</ref> The commission for the purchase of a little girl \"as black as possible\" could be construed as a wish for maximum exoticism.<ref>Joaneath Spicer, \"European Perceptions of Blackness as Reflected in the Visual Arts,\" Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Europe, (Baltimore: The Walters Art Museum, 2012)</ref>\n\n==Widowhood==\n\n===\"Devoted head of state\"===\n\nAs a widow, Isabella at the age of 45 became a \"devoted head of state\".<ref>Marek, p.204</ref> Her position as a Marquise required her serious attention, therefore she was required to study the problems faced by a ruler of a city-state. To improve the well-being of her subjects she studied architecture, agriculture, and industry, and followed the principles that [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] had set forth for rulers in his book ''[[The Prince]]''. In return, the people of Mantua respected and loved her.<ref>Marek, p.205</ref>\n\n[[File:BLW Plate with Hippolytus and Phaedra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maiolica]] plate with the arms of Isabella and her late husband, [[Urbino]], ca. 1524 ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]])]]\nIsabella left Mantua for Rome in 1527. She was present during the catastrophic [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], when she converted her house into an asylum for about 2000 people fleeing the Imperial soldiers. Isabella's house was one of the very few which was not attacked, due to the fact that her son was a member of the invading army. When she left, she managed to acquire safe passage for all the refugees who had sought refuge in her home.\n\n===Later years and death===\n\nAfter Rome became stabilized following the sacking, she left the city and returned to Mantua. She made it a centre of culture, started a school for girls, and turned her ducal apartments into a museum containing the finest art treasures. This was not enough to satisfy Isabella, already in her mid-60s, so she returned to political life and ruled [[Solarolo]], in [[Emilia-Romagna|Romagna]] until her death on 13 February 1539. She was buried beside her husband in the Church of San Francesco in Mantua.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/este-beatrice-d-and-isabella-d|title=Este, Beatrice d' and Isabella d' \u2013 Dictionary definition of Este, Beatrice d' and Isabella d' {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDuring her lifetime and after her death, poets, popes, and statesmen paid tribute to Isabella.

International standards are available for consideration and use worldwide. The most prominent organization is the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).\n\n==Purpose==\nInternational standards may be used either by direct application or by a process of modifying an international standard to suit local conditions. The adoption of international standards results in the creation of equivalent, national standards that are substantially the same as international standards in technical content, but may have (i) editorial differences as to appearance, use of symbols and measurement units, substitution of a point for a comma as the decimal marker, and (ii) differences resulting from conflicts in governmental [[regulation]]s or industry-specific requirements caused by fundamental climatic, geographical, technological, or infrastructural factors, or the stringency of safety requirements that a given standard authority considers appropriate.\n\nInternational standards are one way of overcoming technical barriers in international commerce caused by differences among technical regulations and standards developed independently and separately by each nation, national standards organization, or company. Technical barriers arise when different groups come together, each with a large user base, doing some well established thing that between them is mutually incompatible. Establishing international standards is one way of preventing or overcoming this problem.\n\n==History==\n\n===Standardization===\n[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|right|Graphic representation of formulae for the pitches of threads of screw bolts]]\nThe implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly important with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the need for high-precision [[machine tool]]s and [[interchangeable parts]]. [[Henry Maudslay]] developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800, which allowed for the standardisation of [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time.<ref name=\"Ping\">{{citation|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/econwp117.pdf|title=A Brief History of Standards and Standardization Organizations: A Chinese Perspective|author=Wang Ping|publisher=EAST-WEST CENTER WORKING PAPERS|date=April 2011}}</ref>\n\nMaudslay's work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards spread a bit within their industries. [[Joseph Whitworth]]'s screw thread measurements were adopted as the  first (unofficial) national standard by companies around the country in 1841. It came to be known as the [[British Standard Whitworth]], and was widely adopted in other countries.<ref>Gilbert, K. R., & Galloway, D. F., 1978, \"Machine Tools\". In C.

Smith Elder, London</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 19th century differences in standards between companies were making trade increasingly difficult and strained. The [[BSI Group|Engineering Standards Committee]] was established in London in 1901 as the world's first national standards body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/upload/Corporate%20Marketing/Financial%20Performance/BSI_Group_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2010.pdf |title=BSI Group Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010, page 2|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Robert C McWilliam 2001\">Robert C McWilliam.

E. B. Crompton]] drew up the first international standards body, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], in 1906.]]\nBy the mid to late 19th century, efforts were being made to standardize electrical measurement. An important figure was [[R. E. B. Crompton]], who became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century. Many companies had entered the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for [[volt]]age, [[frequency]], [[Electric current|current]] and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams. Adjacent buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because they had been fitted out by different companies. Crompton could see the lack of efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international standard for electric engineering.<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm ''Colonel Crompton'', IEC Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903145102/http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm |date=2010-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1904, Crompton represented Britain at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] as part of a delegation by the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]]. He presented a paper on standardisation, which was so well received that he was asked to look into the formation of a commission to oversee the process.<ref>Johnson, J & Randell, W (1948) ''Colonel Crompton and the Evolution of the Electrical Industry'', Longman Green.</ref> By 1906 his work was complete and he drew up a permanent constitution for the first international standards organization, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAi_QBsTz5UC|title=Encyclopedia of Electrochemical Power Sources|author1=Chris K.

In many countries the ISO codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that [[exchange rate]]s published in newspapers or posted in [[bank]]s use only these to delineate the currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous [[currency symbol]]s. ISO 4217 codes are used on [[airline ticket]]s and international [[train]] tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price.\n\n== Code formation ==\n[[Image:South East Asia Exchange Rates (6031878489).jpg|right|thumb|A list of exchange rates for various base currencies given by a [[money changer]] in Thailand, with the Thailand Baht as the counter (or quote) currency. Note the Korean currency code should be KRW]]\nThe first two letters of the code are the two letters of the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] [[country code]]s (which are also used as the basis for [[Country code top-level domain|national top-level domains]] on the [[Internet]]) and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself. So [[Japan]]'s currency code is '''JPY'''\u2014JP for Japan and Y for [[Japanese yen|yen]]. This eliminates the problem caused by the names ''[[dollar]], [[franc]], [[peso]]'' and ''[[Pound (currency)|pound]]'' being used in dozens of countries, each having significantly differing values. Also, if a currency is revalued, the currency code's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for \"new\" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term \"new\" itself (for example, the code for the [[Mexican peso]] is '''MXN'''). Other changes can be seen, however; the [[Russian ruble]], for example, changed from '''RUR''' to '''RUB''', where the B comes from the third letter in the word \"ruble\".\n\n{{Numismatics}}\n\n=== X currencies ===\nIn addition to codes for most active national currencies ISO 4217 provides codes for \"supranational\" currencies, procedural purposes, and several things which are \"similar to\" currencies:\n* Codes for the [[precious metal]]s [[gold]] (XAU), [[silver]] (XAG), [[palladium]] (XPD), and [[platinum]] (XPT) are formed by prefixing the element's chemical symbol with the letter \"X\".  These \"currency units\" are denominated as one [[troy ounce]] of the specified metal as opposed to \"USD 1\" or \"EUR 1\". XBT is used by some exchanges for the cryptocurrency [[Bitcoin]] even though it is not ISO 4217 approved.\n* The code XTS is reserved for use in testing.\n* The code XXX is used to denote a \"transaction\" involving no currency.\n* There are also codes specifying certain monetary instruments used in international finance, e.g. XDR is the symbol for [[special drawing right]] issued by the [[International Monetary Fund]].\n* The codes for most [[supranational]] currencies, such as the [[East Caribbean dollar]], the [[CFP franc]], the [[CFAF|CFA franc]] BEAC and the CFA franc BCEAO.  The predecessor to the euro, the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU), had the code XEU.\n\nThe use of an initial letter \"X\" for these purposes is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official country code beginning with X will ever be assigned.  Because of this rule ISO 4217 can use X codes without risk of clashing with a future country code.  ISO 3166 country codes beginning with \"X\" are used for private custom use (reserved), never for official codes.  For instance, the ISO 3166-based [[NATO]] [[List of NATO country codes|country codes]] ([[STANAG 1059]], 9th edition) use \"X\" codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for \"Brownland\" to XXR for \"Redland\", as well as for major commands such as XXE for [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] or XXS for [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic|SACLANT]]. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use \"X\" codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.\n\nThe inclusion of EU (denoting the [[European Union]]) in the [[ISO 3166-1]] reserved codes list, allows the [[euro]] to be coded as EUR rather than assigned a code beginning with X, even though it is a supranational currency.\n\n=== Treatment of minor currency units (the \"exponent\") ===\nThe ISO 4217 standard includes a crude mechanism for expressing the relationship between a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit. This mechanism is called the currency \"exponent\" and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the [[United States dollar]]) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the \"[[Cent (currency)|cent]]\". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY ([[Japanese yen]]) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such [[wikt:negligible|negligible]] value that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10. [[Mauritania]] does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 [[Mauritanian ouguiya|ouguiya]] (UM) equal to 5 [[khoums]], and [[Madagascar]] has 1 [[ariary]] = 5 [[iraimbilanja]]. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an exponent of 0, as with currencies whose minor units are unused due to negligible value.\n\n=== Currency numbers ===\nThere is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, in the same manner as there is also a three-digit code number assigned to each country as part of [[ISO 3166]]. This numeric code is usually the same as the [[ISO 3166-1 numeric]] code. For example, USD ([[United States dollar]]) has code 840 which is also the numeric code for the US (United States).\n\n== Position of ISO 4217 code in amounts {{anchor|codeposition}} {{anchor|PositionOfIso4217CodeInAmounts}} ==\nThe ISO standard does not regulate either the spacing, prefixing or suffixing in usage of currency codes. According however to the [[European Union]]'s Publication Office,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm#position |title=Publications Office \u2014 Interinstitutional style guide \u2014 7.3.3.

At the 17th session (February 1978), the related [[United Nations|UN]]/[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]] Group of Experts agreed that the three-letter alphabetic codes for International Standard ISO 4217, \"Codes for the representation of currencies and funds\", would be suitable for use in international trade.\n\nOver time, new currencies are created and old currencies are discontinued. Frequently, these changes are due to the formation of new governments, treaties between countries standardizing on a shared currency, or revaluation of an existing currency due to excessive inflation. As a result, the list of codes must be updated from time to time. The ISO 4217 maintenance agency (MA), [http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html SIX Interbank Clearing], is responsible for maintaining the list of codes.\n\n== {{anchor|List of currency codes}}Active codes ==\nThe following is a list of active codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.\nIn the standard the values are called \"alphabetic code\", \"numeric code\", and  \"minor unit\".\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

belonging to the US===\nThe [[US dollar]] has two codes assigned: USD and USN (next day). The USS (same day) code is not in use any longer, and was removed from the list of active ISO 4217 codes in March 2014.\n\nAccording to UN/CEFACT recommendation 9, paragraphs 8\u20139 ECE/TRADE/203, 1996, [http://www.unece.org/cefact/recommendations/rec09/rec09_ecetrd203.pdf available online]:\n: 8. In applications where monetary resources associated with a currency (i.e. funds) need not be specified and where a field identifier indicating currency is used, the first two (leftmost) characters are sufficient to identify a currency\u2014example: US for United States dollars for general, unspecified purposes where a field identifier indicating currency is present. (A field identifier can be a preprinted field heading in an aligned document or a similarly-agreed application in electronic transmission of data.)\n: 9. In applications where there is a need to distinguish between types of currencies, or where funds are required as in the banking environment, or where there is no field identifier, the third (rightmost) character of the alphabetic code is an indicator, preferably mnemonic, derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund\u2014example: USD for general, unspecified purposes; USN for United States dollar next-day funds, and USS for funds which are immediately available for Federal Reserve transfer, withdrawal in cash or transfer in like funds (same-day funds). Since there is no need for such a distinction in international trade applications, the funds codes have not been included in the Annex to the present Recommendation.\n\n== Future codes ==\nAs of August 2018, there are no new codes planned to be added to the standard.\n<!--\nThe following is a list of future codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.\nIn the standard the values are called \"alphabetic code\", \"numeric code\", and  \"minor unit\".\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

According to [[Howard Sachar]], \"The policy of the new organization was based squarely on Jabotinsky's teachings: every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arabs; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state\".<ref>[[Howard Sachar]]: ''A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time'', pp. 265\u2013266</ref>\n\nTwo of the operations for which the Irgun is best known are the [[King David Hotel bombing|bombing of the King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946 and the [[Deir Yassin massacre]], carried out together with [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] on 9 April 1948.\n\nThe Irgun has been viewed as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts.<ref name=SshmidtFCPRIOT/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=J.

The Revisionist Movement made up a popular backing for the underground organization. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism, commanded the organization until he died in 1940. He formulated the general realm of operation, regarding ''[[Havlagah|Restraint]]'' and the end thereof, and was the inspiration for the organization overall. An additional major source of ideological inspiration was the poetry of [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]]. The symbol of the organization, with the motto \u05e8\u05e7 \u05db\u05da (only thus), underneath a hand holding a rifle in the foreground of a map showing both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] (at the time, both were administered under the terms of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]]), implied that force was the only way to \"liberate the homeland.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Mitchell|first= Thomas G.|title= Native vs. Settler: Ethnic Conflict in Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, and South Africa|year= 2000|publisher= Greenwood|page= 172|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3PNt46aB_sYC&lpg=PA172&dq=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&pg=PA172#v=onepage&q=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe number of members of the Irgun varied from a few hundred to a few thousand. Most of its members were people who joined the organization's command,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} under which they carried out various operations and filled positions, largely in opposition to [[British law]]. Most of them were \"ordinary\" people, who held regular jobs, and only a few dozen worked full-time in the Irgun.\n\nThe Irgun disagreed with the policy of the [[Yishuv]] and with the [[World Zionist Organization]], both with regard to strategy and basic ideology and with regard to [[public relations|PR]] and military tactics, such as use of armed force to accomplish the Zionist ends, operations against the Arabs during the riots, and relations with the British mandatory government. Therefore, the Irgun tended to ignore the decisions made by the Zionist leadership and the Yishuv's institutions. This fact caused the elected bodies not to recognize the independent organization, and during most of the time of its existence the organization was seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as irresponsible, and its actions thus worthy of thwarting. Accordingly, the Irgun accompanied its armed operations with public-relations campaigns aiming to convince the public of the Irgun's way and the problems with the official political leadership of the Yishuv. The Irgun put out numerous advertisements, an underground newspaper and even ran the first independent Hebrew radio station \u2013 [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]].\n\n===Structure, command, and organization===\n{{Irgun Commanders}}\nAs members of an underground armed organization, Irgun personnel did not normally call Irgun by its name, but rather used other names. In the first years of its existence it was known primarily as ''Ha-Haganah Leumit''' (The National Defense), and also by names such as ''Haganah Bet'' (\"Second Defense\"), ''Irgun Bet'' (\"Second Irgun\"), the ''Parallel Organization'' and the ''Rightwing Organization''. Later on{{when|date=June 2016}} it became most widely known as \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05de\u05d3 (the Stand). The anthem adopted by the Irgun was \"Anonymous Soldiers\",<ref>http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/hayalim.htm</ref><ref>http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/musicfiles/Khaialim_Almonim.mp3</ref> written by [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] who was at the time a commander in the Irgun. Later on Stern defected from the Irgun and founded [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], and the song became the anthem of the Lehi. The Irgun's new anthem then became the third verse of the \"[[Shir Betar|Betar Song]]\", by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.\n\nThe Irgun gradually evolved from its humble origins into a serious and well-organized paramilitary organization. The movement developed a hierarchy of ranks and a sophisticated command-structure, and came to demand serious military training and strict discipline from its members. It developed clandestine networks of hidden arms-caches and weapons-production workshops, safe-houses, and training camps.\n\nThe ranks of the Irgun were (in ascending order):\n\n*''Khayal'' = (Private)\n*''Segen Rosh Kvutza'', ''Segen'' (\"Deputy Group Leader\", \"Deputy\") = Assistant Squad Leader ([[Lance Corporal]])\n*''Rosh Kvutza'' (\"Group Leader\") = Squad Leader ([[Corporal]])\n*''Samal'' (\"Sergeant\") = Section Leader ([[Staff Sergeant|Sergeant]])\n*''Samal Rishon'' (\"Sergeant First Class\") = Brigade Leader ([[Sergeant First Class|Platoon Sergeant]])\n*''Rav Samal'' (\"Chief Sergeant\") = Battalion Leader ([[Master Sergeant]])\n*''Gundar Sheni'', ''Gundar'' (\"Commander Second Class\", \"Commander\") = District Commander ([[2nd Lieutenant]])\n*''Gundar Rishon'' (\"Commander First Class\") = Senior Branch Commander, Headquarters Staff ([[Lieutenant]]).\n\nThe Irgun was led by a High Command, which set policy and gave orders. Directly underneath it was a General Staff, which oversaw the activities of the Irgun. The General Staff was divided into a military and a support staff. The military staff was divided into operational units that oversaw operations and support units in charge of planning, instruction, weapons caches and manufacture, and first aid. The military and support staff never met jointly; they communicated through the High Command. Beneath the General Staff were six district commands: [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]]-[[Galilee]], [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern]], [[Sharon plain|Sharon]], and [[Samaria|Shomron]], each led by a district commander.<ref name=Bell>Bell, Bowyer J.: ''Terror out of Zion'' (1976)</ref> A local Irgun district unit was called a \"Branch\". A \"brigade\" in the Irgun was made up of three sections. A section was made up of two groups, at the head of each was a \"Group Head\", and a deputy. Eventually, various units were established, which answered to a \"Center\" or \"Staff\".\n\nThe head of the Irgun High Command was the overall commander of the organization, but the designation of his rank varied. During the revolt against the British, Irgun commander [[Menachem Begin]] and the entire High Command held the rank of ''Gundar Rishon''. His predecessors, however, had held their own ranks. A rank of Military Commander ([[Israel Defense Forces ranks|Seren]]) was awarded to the Irgun commander [[Yaakov Meridor]] and a rank of High Commander ([[Aluf]]) to [[David Raziel]]. Until his death in 1940, Jabotinsky was known as the \"Military Commander of the Etzel\" or the ''Ha-Matzbi Ha-Elyon'' (\"Supreme Commander\").\n\nUnder the command of Menachem Begin, the Irgun was divided into different corps:\n\n* ''Hayil Kravi'' (Combat Corps) \u2013 responsible for combat operations\n* ''Delek'' (\"Gasoline\") \u2013 the intelligence section; responsible for gathering and translating intelligence, and maintaining contact with local and foreign journalists\n* ''HAT'' (Planning Division) \u2013 responsible for planning activities\n* ''HATAM'' (Revolutionary Publicity Corps) \u2013 responsible for printing and disseminating propaganda\n\nIn theory, the Irgun was supposed{{by whom|date=June 2016}} to have a regular combat force, a reserve, and shock units, but in practice there were not enough personnel for a reserve or for a shock force.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nThe Irgun emphasized that its fighters be highly disciplined. Strict drill exercises were carried out at ceremonies at different times, and strict attention was given to discipline, formal ceremonies and military relationships between the various ranks. The Irgun put out professional publications on combat doctrine, weaponry, leadership, drill exercises, etc. Among these publications were three books written by David Raziel, who had studied military history, techniques, and strategy:<ref>Schindler, Colin:''Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right'', p. 190</ref>\n\n* ''The Pistol'' (written in collaboration with Avraham Stern)\n* ''The Theory of Training''\n* ''Parade Ground and Field Drill''\n\nA British analysis noted that the Irgun's discipline was \"as strict as any army in the world.\"<ref name=Hoffman>Hoffman, Bruce: ''Anonymous Soldiers'' (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Irgun operated a sophisticated recruitment and military-training regime. Those wishing to join had to find and make contact with a member, meaning only those who personally knew a member or were persistent could find their way in. Once contact had been established, a meeting was set up with the three-member selection committee at a safe-house, where the recruit was interviewed in a darkened room, with the committee either positioned behind a screen, or with a flashlight shone into the recruit's eyes. The interviewers asked basic biographical questions, and then asked a series of questions designed to weed out romantics and adventurers and those who had not seriously contemplated the potential sacrifices. Those selected attended a four-month series of indoctrination seminars in groups of five to ten, where they were taught the Irgun's ideology and the code of conduct it expected of its members. These seminars also had another purpose - to weed out the impatient and those of flawed purpose who had gotten past the selection interview. Then, members were introduced to other members, were taught the locations of safe-houses, and given military training. Irgun recruits trained with firearms, hand grenades, and were taught how to conduct combined attacks on targets. Arms handling and tactics courses were given in clandestine training camps, while practice shooting took place in the desert or by the sea. Eventually, separate training camps were established for heavy-weapons training. The most rigorous course was the explosives course for bomb-makers, which lasted a year.<ref name=Bell/> The British authorities believed that some Irgun members enlisted in the Jewish section of the [[Palestine Police Force]] for a year as part of their training, during which they also passed intelligence.<ref name=Hoffman/> In addition to the Irgun's sophisticated training program, many Irgun members were veterans of the Haganah (including the [[Palmach]]), the [[British Armed Forces]], and Jewish partisan groups that had waged guerrilla warfare in Nazi-occupied Europe, thus bringing significant military training and combat experience into the organization.<ref name=Hoffman/> The Irgun also operated a course for its intelligence operatives, in which recruits were taught espionage, cryptography, and analysis techniques.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nOf the Irgun's members, almost all were part-time members. They were expected to maintain their civilian lives and jobs, dividing their time between their civilian lives and underground activities. There were never more than 40 full-time members, who were given a small expense stipend on which to live on.<ref name=Bell/> Upon joining, every member received an underground name. The Irgun's members were divided into cells, and worked with the members of their own cells. The identities of Irgun members in other cells were withheld. This ensured that an Irgun member taken prisoner could betray no more than a few comrades.\n\nIn addition to the Irgun's members in Palestine, underground Irgun cells composed of local Jews were established in [[Europe]] following [[World War II]]. An Irgun cell was also established in [[Shanghai]], home to many European-Jewish refugees. The Irgun also set up a Swiss bank account. Eli Tavin, the former head of Irgun intelligence, was appointed commander of the Irgun abroad.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nIn November 1947, the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]] came to an end as the UN approved of the partition of Palestine, and the British had announced their intention to withdraw the previous month. As the British left and the [[1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] got underway, the Irgun came out of the underground and began to function more as a standing army rather an underground organization. It began openly recruiting, training, and raising funds, and established bases, including training facilities. It also introduced field communications and created a medical unit and supply service.<ref>Menachem Begin: ''The Revolt'', ch. 18, ''The Conquest of Jaffa''</ref><ref>Segal, Hagai: ''How My Grandmother Prevented A Civil War'' (2014)</ref>\n\nUntil World War II the group armed itself with weapons purchased in Europe, primarily [[Italy]] and [[Poland]], and smuggled to Palestine. The Irgun also established workshops that manufactured spare parts and attachments for the weapons. Also manufactured were land mines and simple hand grenades. Another way in which the Irgun armed itself was theft of weapons from the [[Palestine Police Force|British Police]] and military.\n\n==Prior to World War II==\n===Founding===\nThe Irgun's first steps were in the aftermath of the [[1929 Palestine riots|Riots of 1929]]. In the [[Jerusalem]] branch of the Haganah there were feelings of disappointment and internal unrest towards the leadership of the movements and the [[Histadrut]] (at that time the organization running the Haganah). These feelings were a result of the view that the Haganah was not adequately defending Jewish interests in the region. Likewise, critics of the leadership spoke out against alleged failures in the number of weapons, readiness of the movement and its policy of restraint and not fighting back. On April 10, 1931, commanders and equipment managers announced that they refused to return weapons to the Haganah that had been issued to them earlier, prior to the [[Nebi Musa]] holiday. These weapons were later returned by the commander of the Jerusalem branch, [[Avraham Tehomi]], a.k.a. \"Gideon\". However, the commanders who decided to rebel against the leadership of the Haganah relayed a message regarding their resignations to the [[Vaad Leumi]], and thus this schism created a new independent movement.\n\nThe leader of the new underground movement was [[Avraham Tehomi]], alongside other founding members who were all senior commanders in the Haganah, members of [[Hapoel Hatzair]] and of the Histadrut. Also among them was [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]], an activist in the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Party]]. This group was known as the \"Odessan Gang\", because they previously had been members of the ''Haganah Ha'Atzmit'' of Jewish [[Odessa]]. The new movement was named ''Irgun Tsvai Leumi'', (\"National Military Organization\") in order to emphasize its active nature in contrast to the Haganah. Moreover, the organization was founded with the desire to become a true military organization and not just a [[militia]] as the Haganah was at the time.\n\nIn the autumn of that year the Jerusalem group merged with other armed groups affiliated with [[Betar]]. The Betar groups' center of activity was in [[Tel Aviv]], and they began their activity in 1928 with the establishment of \"Officers and Instructors School of Betar\". Students at this institution had broken away from the Haganah earlier, for political reasons, and the new group called itself the \"National Defense\", \u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea. During the riots of 1929 Betar youth participated in the defense of Tel Aviv neighborhoods under the command of Yermiyahu Halperin, at the behest of the Tel Aviv city hall. After the riots the Tel Avivian group expanded, and was known as \"The [[Right Wing]] Organization\".\n\nAfter the Tel Aviv expansion another branch was established in [[Haifa]]. Towards the end of 1932 the Haganah branch of [[Safed]] also defected and joined the Irgun, as well as many members of the [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] sports association. At that time the movement's underground newsletter, ''Ha'Metsudah'' (the Fortress) also began publication, expressing the active trend of the movement. The Irgun also increased its numbers by expanding draft regiments of Betar \u2013 groups of volunteers, committed to two years of security and pioneer activities. These regiments were based in places that from which stemmed new Irgun strongholds in the many places, including the settlements of [[Yesod HaMa'ala]], [[Mishmar HaYarden]], [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]], [[Metula]] and [[Nahariya]] in the north; in the center \u2013 [[Hadera]], [[Binyamina]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]] and [[Kfar Saba]], and south of there \u2013 [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Rehovot]] and [[Ness Ziona]]. Later on regiments were also active in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] (\"the Kotel Brigades\") among others. Primary training centers were based in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Qastina]] (by [[Kiryat Mal'akhi]] of today) and other places.\n\n===Under Tehomi's command===\n{{Main|1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine}}\n[[File:Tehomi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Avraham Tehomi]], the first Commander of the Irgun]]\nIn 1933 there were some signs of unrest, seen by the incitement of the local Arab leadership to act against the authorities. The strong British response put down the disturbances quickly. During that time the Irgun operated in a similar manner to the Haganah and was a guarding organization. The two organizations cooperated in ways such as coordination of posts and even intelligence sharing.\n\nWithin the Irgun, Tehomi was the first to serve as \"Head of the Headquarters\" or \"Chief Commander\". Alongside Tehomi served the senior commanders, or \"Headquarters\" of the movement. As the organization grew, it was divided into district commands.\n\nIn August 1933 a \"Supervisory Committee\" for the Irgun was established, which included representatives from most of the Zionist political parties. The members of this committee were [[Meir Grossman]] (of the Hebrew State Party), Rabbi [[Meir Bar-Ilan]] (of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Party]], either [[Immanuel Neumann]] or [[Yehoshua Supersky]] (of the [[General Zionists]]) and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] or [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]] (of [[Hatzohar]]).\n\nIn protest against, and with the aim of ending [[Jewish immigration to Palestine]], the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Arab Revolt of 1936\u20131939]] broke out on April 19, 1936. The riots took the form of attacks by Arab rioters ambushing main roads, bombing of roads and settlements as well as property and agriculture vandalism. In the beginning, the Irgun and the Haganah generally maintained a policy of restraint, apart from a few instances. Some expressed resentment at this policy, leading up internal unrest in the two organizations. The Irgun tended to retaliate more often, and sometimes Irgun members patrolled areas beyond their positions in order to encounter attackers ahead of time. However, there were differences of opinion regarding what to do in the Haganah, as well. Due to the joining of many [[Betar]] Youth members, Jabotinsky (founder of Betar) had a great deal of influence over Irgun policy. Nevertheless, Jabotinsky was of the opinion that for moral reasons violent retaliation was not to be undertaken.\n\nIn November 1936 the [[Peel Commission]] was sent to inquire regarding the breakout of the riots and propose a solution to end the Revolt. In early 1937 there were still some in the [[Yishuv]] who felt the commission would recommend a partition of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]), thus creating a Jewish state on part of the land. The Irgun leadership, as well as the \"Supervisory Committee\" held similar beliefs, as did some members of the Haganah and the [[Jewish Agency]]. This belief strengthened the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]] and led to the position that there was no room for defense institutions in the future Jewish state. Tehomi was quoted as saying: \"We stand before great events: a Jewish state and a Jewish army. There is a need for a single military force\". This position intensified the differences of opinion regarding the policy of restraint, both within the Irgun and within the political camp aligned with the organization. The leadership committee of the Irgun supported a merger with the Haganah. On April 24, 1937 a referendum was held among Irgun members regarding its continued independent existence. David Raziel and Avraham (Yair) Stern came out publicly in support for the continued existence of the Irgun:\n:''The Irgun has been placed ... before a decision to make, whether to submit to the authority of the government and the [[Jewish Agency]] or to prepare for a double sacrifice and endangerment. Some of our friends do not have appropriate willingness for this difficult position, and have submitted to the Jewish Agency and has left the battle ... all of the attempts ... to unite with the leftist organization have failed, because the Left entered into negotiations not on the basis of unification of forces, but the submission of one such force to the other....''<ref>[[Yosef Kister]], ''The Etzel'', (Hebrew) pp. 38</ref>\n\n===The first split===\nIn April 1937 the Irgun split after the referendum. Approximately 1,500\u20132,000 people, about half of the Irgun's membership, including the senior command staff, regional committee members, along with most of the Irgun's weapons, returned to the Haganah, which at that time was under the Jewish Agency's leadership. The Supervisory Committee's control over the Irgun ended, and Jabotinsky assumed command. In their opinion, the removal of the Haganah from the Jewish Agency's leadership to the national institutions necessitated their return. Furthermore, they no longer saw significant ideological differences between the movements. Those who remained in the Irgun were primarily young activists, mostly laypeople, who sided with the independent existence of the Irgun. In fact, most of those who remained were originally Betar people. [[Moshe Rosenberg]] estimated that approximately 1,800 members remained. In theory, the Irgun remained an organization not aligned with a political party, but in reality the supervisory committee was disbanded and the Irgun's continued ideological path was outlined according to Ze'ev Jabotinsky's school of thought and his decisions, until the movement eventually became Revisionist Zionism's military arm. One of the major changes in policy by Jabotinsky was the end of the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]].\n\nOn April 27, 1937 the Irgun founded a new headquarters, staffed by Moshe Rosenberg at the head, [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] as secretary, [[David Raziel]] as head of the Jerusalem branch, [[Hanoch Kalai]] as commander of Haifa and [[Aharon Haichman]] as commander of Tel Aviv. On 20 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], (June 29) the day of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s death, a ceremony was held in honor of the reorganization of the underground movement. For security purposes this ceremony was held at a construction site in Tel Aviv.\n\nZe'ev Jabotinsky placed Col. [[Robert Bitker]] at the head of the Irgun. Bitker had previously served as Betar commissioner in China and had military experience. A few months later, probably due to total incompatibility with the position, Jabotinsky replaced Bitker with Moshe Rosenberg. When the [[Peel Commission]] report was published a few months later, the Revisionist camp decided not to accept the commission's recommendations. Moreover, the organizations of Betar, [[Hatzohar]] and the Irgun began to increase their efforts to bring Jews to the land of Israel, illegally. This [[Aliyah]] was known as the \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e3 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d9 \"Af Al Pi (Nevertheless) Aliyah\". As opposed to this position, the Jewish Agency began acting on behalf of the Zionist interest on the political front, and continued the policy of restraint. From this point onwards the differences between the Haganah and the Irgun were much more obvious.\n\n===Illegal immigration===\n[[File:Parita22839.jpg|thumb|The ship [[:he:\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4|''Parita'']] unloading immigrants at the beach in [[Tel Aviv]]]]\nAccording to Jabotinsky's \"Evacuation Plan\", which called for millions of [[European Jews]] to be brought to Palestine at once, the Irgun helped the [[Aliyah Bet|illegal immigration]] of European Jews to the land of Israel. This was named by Jabotinsky the \"National Sport\". The most significant part of this immigration prior to [[World War II]] was carried out by the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] camp, largely because the [[Yishuv]] institutions and the Jewish Agency shied away from such actions on grounds of cost and their belief that Britain would in the future allow widespread Jewish immigration.\n\nThe Irgun joined forces with [[Hatzohar]] and [[Betar]] in September 1937, when it assisted with the landing of a convoy of 54 Betar members at Tantura Beach (near [[Haifa]].) The Irgun was responsible for discreetly bringing the [[Olim]], or Jewish immigrants, to the beaches, and dispersing them among the various Jewish settlements. The Irgun also began participating in the organisation of the immigration enterprise and undertook the process of accompanying the ships. This began with the ship ''Draga'' which arrived at the coast of British Palestine in September 1938. In August of the same year, an agreement was made between Ari Jabotinsky (the son of Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the Betar representative and [[Hillel Kook]], the Irgun representative, to coordinate the immigration (also known as [[Ha'apala]]). This agreement was also made in the \"Paris Convention\" in February 1939, at which Ze'ev Jabotinsky and David Raziel were present. Afterwards, the \"Aliyah Center\" was founded, made up of representatives of Hatzohar, Betar, and the Irgun, thereby making the Irgun a full participant in the process.\n\nThe difficult conditions on the ships demanded a high level of discipline. The people on board the ships were often split into units, led by commanders. In addition to having a daily roll call and the distribution of food and water (usually very little of either), organized talks were held to provide information regarding the actual arrival in Palestine. One of the largest ships was the ''Sakaria'', with 2,300 passengers, which equalled about 0.5% of the Jewish population in Palestine. The first vessel arrived on April 13, 1937, and the last on February 13, 1940. All told, about 18,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine with the help of the Revisionist organizations and private initiatives by other Revisionists. Most were not caught by the British.\n\n===End of restraint===\n{{Main|List of Irgun attacks}}\n[[File:David raziel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Raziel]], commander of the Irgun]]\nIrgun members continued to defend settlements, but at the same time began attacks on Arab villages, thus ending the policy of restraint. These attacks were intended to instill fear in the Arab side, in order to cause the Arabs to wish for peace and quiet. In March 1938, [[David Raziel]] wrote in the underground newspaper \"By the Sword\" a constitutive article for the Irgun overall, in which he coined the term '''\"Active Defense\"''':\n:The actions of the Haganah alone will never be a true victory. If the goal of the war is to break the will of the enemy \u2013 and this cannot be attained without destroying his spirit \u2013 clearly we cannot be satisfied with solely defensive operations.... Such a method of defense, that allows the enemy to attack at will, to reorganize and attack again ... and does not intend to remove the enemy's ability to attack a second time \u2013 is called passive defense, and ends in downfall and destruction ... whoever does not wish to be beaten has no choice but to attack. The fighting side, that does not intend to oppress but to save its liberty and honor, he too has only one way available \u2013 the way of attack. Defensiveness by way of offensiveness, in order to deprive the enemy the option of attacking, is called ''active defense''.\n\nThe first attacks began around April 1936, and by the end of World War II, more than 250 Arabs had been killed. Examples include:\n*After an Arab shooting at Carmel school in Tel Aviv, which resulted in the death of a Jewish child, Irgun members attacked an Arab neighborhood near [[Kerem Hatemanim]] in Tel Aviv, killing one Arab man and injuring another.\n*On August 17, the Irgun responded to shootings by Arabs from the [[Jaffa]]\u2013[[Jerusalem]] train towards Jews that were waiting by the train block on Herzl Street in Tel Aviv. The same day, when a Jewish child was injured by the shooting, Irgun members attacked a train on the same route, killing one Arab and injuring five.\nDuring 1936, Irgun members carried out approximately ten attacks.\n\nThroughout 1937 the Irgun continued this line of operation.\n*On March 6, a Jew at Sabbath prayers at the [[Western Wall]] was shot by a local Arab. A few hours later, the Irgun shot at an Arab in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rechavia.\n*On June 29, a band of Arabs attacked an [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus on the Jerusalem \u2013 Tel Aviv road, killing one Jew. The following day, two Jews were also killed near [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Karkur]]. A few hours later, the Irgun carried out a number of operations.\n**An Arab bus making its way from [[Lifta]] was attacked in Jerusalem.\n**In two other locations in Jerusalem, Arabs were shot as well.\n**In Tel Aviv, a hand grenade was thrown at an Arab coffee shop on Carmel St., injuring many of the patrons.\n**Irgun members also injured an Arab on Reines St. in Tel Aviv.\n**On September 5, the Irgun responded to the murder of a rabbi on his way home from prayer in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] by throwing explosives at an Arab bus that had left Lifta, injuring two female passengers and a British police officer.\n\nA more complete list can be found [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|here]].\n\nAt that time, however, these acts were not yet a part of a formulated policy of the Irgun.<ref>\"Tagar u'Magen (Jabotinsky and the Etzel)\" {{he icon}}, Jabtotinsky Publishing, pp. 28</ref> Not all of the aforementioned operations received a commander's approval, and Jabotinsky was not in favor of such actions at the time. Jabotinsky still hoped to establish a Jewish force out in the open that would not have to operate underground. However, the failure, in its eyes, of the [[Peel Commission]] and the renewal of violence on the part of the Arabs caused the Irgun to rethink its official policy.\n\n===Increase in operations===\n14 November 1937 was a watershed in Irgun activity. From that date, the Irgun increased its reprisals. Following an increase in the number of attacks aimed at Jews, including the killing of five [[kibbutz]] members near [[Kiryat Anavim]] (today kibbutz [[Ma'ale HaHamisha]]), the Irgun undertook a series of attacks in various places in Jerusalem, killing five Arabs. Operations were also undertaken in [[Haifa]] (shooting at the Arab-populated [[Wadi Nisnas]] neighborhood) and in [[Herzliya]]. The date is known as the day the policy of restraint ([[Havlagah]]) ended, or as [[Black Sunday, 1937|Black Sunday]] when operations resulted in the murder of 10 Arabs. This is when the organization fully changed its policy, with the approval of Jabotinsky and Headquarters to the policy of \"active defense\" in respect of Irgun actions.<ref>\"The Birth of an Underground Organization\", Yehuda Lapidot, pp. 62 {{he icon}}</ref>\n\nThe British responded with the arrest of Betar and Hatzohar members as suspected members of the Irgun. [[Military court]]s were allowed to act under \"Time of Emergency Regulations\" and even sentence people to death. In this manner [[Yehezkel Altman]], a guard in a Betar battalion in the [[Nahalat Yizchak]] neighborhood of Tel Aviv, shot at an Arab bus, without his commanders' knowledge. Altman was acting in response to a shooting at Jewish vehicles on the Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem road the day before. He turned himself in later and was sentenced to death, a sentence which was later commuted to a life sentence.\n\nDespite the arrests, Irgun members continued fighting. Jabotinsky lent his moral support to these activities. In a letter to Moshe Rosenberg on 18 March 1938 he wrote:\n:Tell them: from afar I collect and save, as precious treasures, news items about your lives. I know of the obstacles that have not impeded your spirit; and I know of your actions as well. I am overjoyed that I have been blessed with such students.\n\nAlthough the Irgun continued activities such as these, following Rosenberg's orders, they were greatly curtailed. Furthermore, in fear of the British threat of the death sentence for anyone found carrying a weapon, all operations were suspended for eight months. However, opposition to this policy gradually increased. In April, 1938, responding to the killing of six Jews, Betar members from the [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]] Brigade went on a reprisal mission, without the consent of their commander, as described by historian [[Avi Shlaim]]:\n:On 21 April 1938, after several weeks of planning, he and two of his colleagues from the Irgun (Etzel) ambushed an Arab bus at a bend on a mountain road near Safad. They had a hand grenade, a gun and a pistol. Their plan was to destroy the engine so that the bus would fall off the side of the road and all the passengers would be killed. When the bus approached, they fired at it (not in the air, as Mailer has it) but the grenade lobbed by Ben Yosef did not detonate. The bus with its screaming and terrified passengers drove on.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Bombers not Martyrs\n| author = Avi Shlaim\n| date=  January 6, 2005\n| publisher = London Review of Books\n| url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n01/letters.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the incident ended without casualties, the three were caught, and one of them \u2013 [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] was sentenced to death. Demonstrations around the country, as well as pressure from institutions and people such as [[Haim Weizman|Dr. Chaim Weizmann]] and the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]], [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] did not reduce his sentence. In Shlomo Ben-Yosef's writings in Hebrew were later found:\n:I am going to die and I am not sorry at all. Why? Because I am going to die for our country. Shlomo Ben-Yosef.\n\nOn 29 June 1938 he was executed, and was the first of the [[Olei Hagardom]]. The Irgun revered him after his death and many regarded him as an example.\nIn light of this, and due to the anger of the Irgun leadership over the decision to adopt a policy of restraint until that point, Jabotinsky relieved Rosenberg of his post and replaced him with David Raziel, who proved to be the most prominent Irgun commander until [[Menachem Begin]]. Jabotinsky simultaneously instructed the Irgun to end its policy of restraint, leading to armed offensive operations until the end of the Arab Revolt in 1939. In this time, the Irgun mounted about 40 operations against Arabs and Arab villages, for instance:\n*After a Jewish father and son were killed in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], on June 6, 1938, Irgun members threw explosives from the roof of a nearby house, killing two Arabs and injuring four.\n*The Irgun planted [[land mine]]s in a number of Arab [[Souk|markets]], primarily in places identified by the Irgun as activity centers of armed Arab gangs.\n*Explosives detonated in the Arab [[souk]] in Jerusalem on July 15, killed ten local Arabs.\n*In similar circumstances, 70 Arabs were killed by a [[land mine]] planted in the Arab souk in Haifa.\n\nThis action led the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to discuss the disturbances in Palestine. On 23 February 1939 the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Malcolm MacDonald]] revealed the British intention to cancel the mandate and establish a state that would preserve Arab rights. This caused a wave of riots and attacks by Arabs against Jews. The Irgun responded four days later with a series of attacks on Arab buses and other sites. The British used military force against the Arab rioters and in the latter stages of the revolt by the Arab community in Palestine, it deteriorated into a series of internal gang wars.\n\n====During the same period====\n[[File:Irgun poster Erez Jisrael.jpg|thumb|1931 [[propaganda]] poster of the Irgun for distribution in [[central Europe]] \u2013 the map shows Israel defined in the borders of both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], which the Irgun claimed in its entirety for a future Jewish state.]]\n\nAt the same time, the Irgun also established itself in Europe. The Irgun built underground cells that participated in organizing migration to Palestine. The cells were made up almost entirely of Betar members, and their primary activity was military training in preparation for emigration to Palestine. Ties formed with the Polish authorities brought about courses in which Irgun commanders were trained by Polish officers in advanced military issues such as [[guerrilla warfare]], [[Tactic (method)|tactics]] and laying land mines. [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] was notable among the cell organizers in Europe. In 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the underground. The transfer of handguns, rifles, explosives and ammunition stopped with the outbreak of World War II. Another field in which the Irgun operated was the training of pilots, so they could serve in the [[Air Force]] in the future war for independence, in the flight school in [[Lod]].\n\nTowards the end of 1938 there was progress towards aligning the ideologies of the Irgun and the Haganah. Many abandoned the belief that the land would be divided and a Jewish state would soon exist. The Haganah founded \u05e4\u05d5\"\u05de, a special operations unit, (pronounced ''poom''), which carried out reprisal attacks following Arab violence. These operations continued into 1939. Furthermore, the opposition within the [[Yishuv]] to illegal immigration significantly decreased, and the Haganah began to bring Jews to Palestine using rented ships, as the Irgun had in the past.\n\n===First operations against the British===\nThe publishing of the MacDonald [[White Paper of 1939]] brought with it new edicts that were intended to lead to a more equitable settlement between Jews and Arabs. However, it was considered by some Jews to have an adverse effect on the continued development of the Jewish community in Palestine. Chief among these was the prohibition on selling land to Jews, and the smaller quotas for Jewish immigration. The entire Yishuv was furious at the contents of the White Paper. There were demonstrations against the \"Treacherous Paper\", as it was considered that it would preclude the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\nUnder the temporary command of [[Hanoch Kalai]], the Irgun began sabotaging strategic infrastructure such as electricity facilities, radio and telephone lines. It also started publicizing its activity and its goals. This was done in street announcements, newspapers, as well as the underground radio station [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]]. On August 26, 1939, the Irgun killed [[Ralph Cairns]], a British police officer who, as head of the Jewish Department in the [[Palestine Police]], had [[torture]]d a number of youths who were underground members.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bell | first = John Bowyer | title = Terror Out of Zion | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year = 1996 | page = 48 | isbn = 9781560008705}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Ben-Yehuda | first = Nahman | title = Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 1993 | page = 155 | isbn = 0791411664}}</ref> Cairns and Ronald Barker, another British police officer, were killed by an Irgun [[improvised explosive device|IED]].<ref>\"Mine Explosion In Jerusalem.\" OUR CORRESPONDENT, The Times [London, England] 28 Aug. 1939: 12.

On the next day, September 1, 1939, World War II broke out.\n\n==During World War II==\nFollowing the outbreak of war, Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the [[New Zionist Organization]] voiced their support for Britain and France. In mid-September 1939 Raziel was moved from his place of detention in [[Tzrifin]]. This, among other events, encouraged the Irgun to announce a cessation of its activities against the British so as not to hinder Britain's effort to fight \"the Hebrew's greatest enemy in the world \u2013 German [[Nazism]]\". This announcement ended with the hope that after the war a Hebrew state would be founded \"within the historical borders of the liberated homeland\". After this announcement Irgun, Betar and Hatzohar members, including Raziel and the Irgun leadership, were gradually released from detention. The Irgun did not rule out joining the British army and the [[Jewish Brigade]]. Irgun members did enlist in various British units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgun.html |title=Irgun Zeva'i Le'umi\u2014\"The National Military Organization\" (Etzel, I.Z.L.) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Irgun members also assisted British forces with intelligence in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. An Irgun unit also operated in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. David Raziel later died during one of these operations.\n\nDuring the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Betar members revolted numerous times against the Nazis in [[occupied Europe]]. The largest of these revolts was the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], in which an armed underground organization fought, formed by Betar and Hatzoar and known as the ''[[Jewish Military Union (League)|\u017bydowski Zwi\u0105zek Wojskowy]] (\u017bZW)'' (Jewish Military Union). Despite its political origins, the \u017bZW accepted members without regard to political affiliation, and had contacts established before the war with elements of the Polish military. Because of differences over objectives and strategy, the \u017bZW was unable to form a common front with the mainstream ghetto fighters of the [[Jewish Combat Organization|\u017bydowska Organizacja Bojowa]], and fought independently under the military leadership of [[Pawe\u0142 Frenkiel]] and the political leadership of [[Dawid Wdowi\u0144ski]].<ref>See Chaim Lazar, ''Matsada shel Varsha'' (Tel Aviv: Machon Jabotinsky, 1963), David Wdowi\u0144ski, (1963), ''And we are not saved.''

In July 1943 the \"Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People in Europe\" was formed, and worked until the end of the war to rescue the [[Jews of Europe]] from the Nazis and to garner public support for a Jewish state. However, it was not until January 1944 that [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] established the [[War Refugee Board]], which achieved some success in saving European Jews.\n\n===Second split===\n[[File:Avraham Stern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]]]]\nThroughout this entire period, the British continued enforcing the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]]'s provisions, which included a ban on the sale of land, restrictions on Jewish immigration and increased vigilance against illegal immigration. Part of the reason why the British banned land sales (to anyone) was the confused state of the post Ottoman land registry; it was difficult to determine who actually owned the land that was for sale.\n\nWithin the ranks of the Irgun this created much disappointment and unrest, at the center of which was disagreement with the leadership of the [[New Zionist Organization]], David Raziel and the Irgun Headquarters. On June 18, 1939, Avraham (Yair) Stern and others of the leadership were released from prison and a rift opened between them the Irgun and Hatzohar leadership. The controversy centred on the issues of the underground movement submitting to public political leadership and fighting the British. On his release from prison Raziel resigned from Headquarters. To his chagrin, independent operations of senior members of the Irgun were carried out and some commanders even doubted Raziel's loyalty.\n\nIn his place, Stern was elected to the leadership. In the past, Stern had founded secret Irgun cells in Poland without Jabotinsky's knowledge, in opposition to his wishes. Furthermore, Stern was in favor of removing the Irgun from the authority of the New Zionist Organization, whose leadership urged Raziel to return to the command of the Irgun. He finally consented. Jabotinsky wrote to Raziel and to Stern, and these letters were distributed to the branches of the Irgun:\n\n:... I call upon you: Let nothing disturb our unity. Listen to the commissioner (Raziel), whom I trust, and promise me that you and [[Betar]], the greatest of my life's achievements, will stand strong and united and allow me to continue with the hope for victory in the war to realize our old [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] dream....\n\nStern was sent a telegram with an order to obey Raziel, who was reappointed. However, these events did not prevent the splitting of the organization. Suspicion and distrust were rampant among the members. Out of the Irgun a new organization was created on July 17, 1940,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac05.htm |title=The Split Within The Irgun |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> which was first named \"The National Military Organization in Israel\" (as opposed to the \"National Military Organization in '''the Land of''' Israel\") and later on changed its name to [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], an acronym for '''Lohamei Herut Israel''', \"Fighters for the Freedom of Israel\", (\u05dc\u05d7\"\u05d9 \u2013 \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc). Jabotinsky died in [[New York (state)|New York]] on August 4, 1940, yet this did not prevent the Lehi split. Following Jabotinsky's death, ties were formed between the Irgun and the [[New Zionist Organization]]. These ties would last until 1944, when the Irgun declared a revolt against the British.\n\nThe primary difference between the Irgun and the newly formed organization was its intention to fight the British in Palestine, regardless of their war against Germany. Later, additional operational and ideological differences developed that contradicted some of the Irgun's guiding principles. For example, the Lehi, unlike the Irgun, supported a [[population exchange]] with local Arabs.\n\n===Change of policy===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"float: right; border: 1px solid #8888aa; background: #f7f8ff; padding: 6px; font-size: 95%; margin: 8px 25px 8px 2px;\"\n| style=\"background: #ccf; text-align: center;\" | The Irgun's Anthem<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betar.org.il/en/content/view/9/6/ |title=World Zionist youth movement - Shir |publisher=Betar |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n|-\n|\nTagar -<br>\nThrough all obstacles and enemies<br>\nWhether you go up or down<br>\nIn the flames of revolt<br>\nCarry a flame to kindle \u2013 never mind!<br>\nFor silence is filth<br>\nWorthless is blood and soul<br>\nFor the sake of the hidden glory\n\nTo die or to conquer the hill -<br>\nYodefet, Masada, Betar.\n|}\nThe split damaged the Irgun both organizationally and from a morale point of view. As their spiritual leader, Jabotinsky's death also added to this feeling. Together, these factors brought about a mass abandonment by members. The British took advantage of this weakness to gather intelligence and arrest Irgun activists. The new Irgun leadership, which included Meridor, Yerachmiel Ha'Levi, [[Moshe Zvi Segal (Rabbi)|Rabbi Moshe Zvi Segal]] and others used the forced hiatus in activity to rebuild the injured organization. This period was also marked by more cooperation between the Irgun and the Jewish Agency, however [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s uncompromising demand that Irgun accept the Agency's command foiled any further cooperation.\n\nIn both the Irgun and the Haganah more voices were being heard opposing any cooperation with the British. Nevertheless, an Irgun operation carried out in the service of Britain was aimed at sabotaging pro-Nazi forces in [[Iraq]], including the assassination of [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]]. Among others, Raziel and [[Yaakov Meridor]] participated. On April 20, 1941, during a [[Luftwaffe]] air raid on [[Habbaniya Airport|RAF Hannaniya]] near [[Baghdad]], David Raziel, commander of the Irgun, was killed during the operation.\n\nIn late 1943 a joint Haganah \u2013 Irgun initiative was developed, to form a single fighting body, unaligned with any political party, by the name of \u05e2\u05dd \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd (''Fighting Nation'').<ref>http://www.palmach.org.il/show_item.asp?levelId=38612&itemId=5199&itemType=0</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/1146 |title=Reflections on the assassination of Sheikh Yassin |publisher=Fromoccupiedpalestine.org}}</ref> The new body's first plan was to kidnap the British High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Harold MacMichael|Sir Harold MacMichael]] and take him to [[Cyprus]]. However, the Haganah leaked the planned operation and it was thwarted before it got off the ground. Nevertheless, at this stage the Irgun ceased its cooperation with the British. As [[Eliyahu Lankin]] tells in his book:\n:Immediately following the failure of ''Fighting Nation'' practical discussions began in the Irgun Headquarters regarding a declaration of war.\n\n==The Revolt==\nIn 1943 the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]], commanded by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders]], arrived in Palestine from [[Iraq]]. The British insisted that no Jewish units of the army be created. Eventually, many of the soldiers of Jewish origin that arrived with the army were released and allowed to stay in Palestine. One of them was [[Menachem Begin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sullivan/bios/MenachemBegin-Bio.html|title=Menachem Begin Biography|website=www.ibiblio.org}}</ref> whose arrival in Palestine created new-found expectations within the Irgun and Betar. Begin had served as head of the Betar movement in [[Poland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/begin-bio.html |title=Menachem Begin \u2013 Biography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> and was a respected leader. [[Yaakov Meridor]], then the commander of the Irgun, raised the idea of appointing Begin to the post. In late 1943, when Begin accepted the position, a new leadership was formed. Meridor became Begin's deputy, and other members of the board were Aryeh Ben Eliezer, Eliyahu Lankin, and Shlomo Lev Ami.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgunrevolt.html|title=The Revolt is Proclaimed by the Irgun|last=Lapidot|first=Yehuda|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 1944 the Irgun put up posters all around the country, proclaiming a revolt against the British mandatory government. The posters began by saying that all of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movements stood by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] and over 25,000 Jews had enlisted in the British military. The hope to establish a Jewish army had died. European Jewry was trapped and was being destroyed, yet Britain, for its part, did not allow any rescue missions. This part of the document ends with the following words:\n:[[MacDonald White Paper|The White Paper]] is still in effect. It is enforced, despite the betrayal of the Arabs and the loyalty of the Jews; despite the mass enlisting to the British Army; despite the [[ceasefire]] and the quiet in The Land of Israel; despite the massacre of masses of the Jewish people in Europe....\n\n:The facts are simple and horrible as one. Over the last four years of [[World War II|the war]] we have lost millions of the best of our people; millions more are in danger of eradication. And The Land of Israel is closed off and quarantined because the British rule it, realizing the White Paper, and strives for the destruction of our people's last hope.\n\nThe Irgun then declared that, for its part, the ceasefire was over and they were now at war with the British. It demanded the transfer of rule to a Jewish government, to implement ten policies. Among these were the mass evacuation of Jews from Europe, the signing of treaties with any state that recognized the Jewish state's sovereignty, including Britain, granting social justice to the state's residents, and full equality to the Arab population. The proclamation ended with:\n:The God of Israel, God of Hosts, will be at our side. There is no retreat. Liberty or death.... The fighting youth will not recoil in the face of sacrifices and suffering, blood and torment. They will not surrender, so long as our days of old are not renewed, so long as our nation is not ensured a homeland, liberty, honor, bread, justice and law.\n\nThe Irgun began this campaign rather weakly. At the time of the start of the revolt, it was only about 1,000 strong, including some 200 fighters. It possessed about 4 submachine guns, 40 rifles, 60 pistols, 150 hand grenades, and 2,000 kilograms of explosive material, and its funds were about \u00a3800.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\n===Struggle against the British===\n{{Main|Jewish insurgency in Palestine}}\nThe Irgun began a militant operation against the symbols of government, in an attempt to harm the regime's operation as well as its reputation. The first attack was on February 12, 1944 at the government immigration offices, a symbol of the immigration laws. The attacks went smoothly and ended with no casualties\u2014as they took place on a Saturday night, when the buildings were empty\u2014in the three largest cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. On February 27 the income tax offices were bombed. Parts of the same cities were blown up, also on a Saturday night; prior warnings were put up near the buildings. On March 23 the national headquarters building of the British police in the [[Migrash Harusim|Russian Compound]] in Jerusalem was attacked, and part of it was blown up. These attacks in the first few months were sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv and by the Jewish Agency, who saw them as dangerous provocations.\n\nAt the same time the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] also renewed its attacks against the British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/120/Chapter+Eight+The+Struggle+for+the+Establishment+of+the+State+of+Israel.htm |title=Chapter Eight: The Struggle for the Establishment of the State of Israel |publisher=Jewishagency.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> The Irgun continued to attack police stations and headquarters, and [[Tegart fort|Tegart Fort]], a fortified police station (today the location of [[Latrun]]). One relatively complex operation was the takeover of the radio station in [[Ramallah]], on May 17, 1944.\n\nOne symbolic act by the Irgun happened before [[Yom Kippur]] of 1944. They plastered notices around town, warning that no British officers should come to the [[Western Wall]] on Yom Kippur, and for the first time since the mandate began no British police officers were there to prevent the Jews from the traditional [[Shofar]] blowing at the end of the fast.<ref>http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/hayom/2a-2.htm</ref> After the fast that year the Irgun attacked four police stations in Arab settlements. In order to obtain weapons, the Irgun carried out \"confiscation\" operations \u2013 they robbed British armouries and smuggled stolen weapons to their own hiding places. During this phase of activity the Irgun also cut all of its official ties with the [[New Zionist Organization]], so as not to tie their fate in the underground organization.\n\nBegin wrote in his [[memoir]]s, ''[[The Revolt]]'':\n:History and experience taught us that if we are able to destroy the prestige of the British in Palestine, the regime will break. Since we found the enslaving government's weak point, we did not let go of it.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The Revolt\n| author = Menachem Begin\n| year=  1977}}</ref>\n\n===Underground exiles===\n{{Main|Irgun and Lehi internment in Africa}}\nIn October 1944 the British began expelling hundreds of arrested Irgun and Lehi members to detention camps in [[Africa]]. 251 detainees from [[Latrun]] were flown on thirteen planes, on October 19 to a camp in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]]. Eleven additional transports were made. Throughout the period of their detention, the detainees often initiated rebellions and hunger strikes. Many escape attempts were made until July 1948 when the exiles were returned to Israel. While there were numerous successful escapes from the camp itself, only nine men actually made it back all the way. One noted success was that of [[Yaakov Meridor]], who escaped nine times before finally reaching Europe in April 1948. These tribulations were the subject of his book ''Long is the Path to Freedom: Chronicles of one of the Exiles''.\n\n===Hunting Season===\n{{Main|The Hunting Season}}\nOn November 6, 1944, [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], British Deputy Resident Minister of State in [[Cairo]] was assassinated by Lehi members [[Eliyahu Hakim]] and [[Eliyahu Bet-Zuri]]. This act raised concerns within the Yishuv from the British regime's reaction to the underground's violent acts against them. Therefore, the Jewish Agency decided on starting a ''Hunting Season'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac07.htm |title=The 'Hunting Season' |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/history/lapidot/8.htm |title=Besiege / Yehuda Lapidut \u2013 The Hunting Season |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> known as the ''saison'', (from the [[French language|French]] \"la saison de chasse\").\n\nThe Irgun's recuperation was noticeable when it began to renew its cooperation with the Lehi in May 1945, when it sabotaged oil pipelines, telephone lines and railroad bridges. All in all, over 1,000 members of the Irgun and Lehi were arrested and interned in British camps during the ''Saison''. Eventually the Hunting Season died out, and there was even talk of cooperation with the Haganah leading to the formation of the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]].\n\n===The Jewish Resistance Movement===\n{{Main|The Jewish Resistance Movement}}\n[[File:KD 1946.JPG|thumb|The King David Hotel after the bombing, photo from [[The Jerusalem Post|''The Palestine Post'']]]]\n\nTowards the end of July 1945 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] in Britain was elected to power. The Yishuv leadership had high hopes that this would change the anti-Zionist policy that the British maintained at the time. However, these hopes were quickly dashed when the government limited Jewish immigration, with the intention that the population of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) would not be more than one third of the total. This, along with the stepping up of arrests and their pursuit of underground members and illegal immigration organizers led to the formation of the [[The Jewish Resistance Movement|Jewish Resistance Movement]]. This body consolidated the armed resistance to the British of the Irgun, Lehi, and Haganah. For ten months the Irgun and the Lehi cooperated and they carried out nineteen attacks and defense operations. The Haganah and Palmach carried out ten such operations. The Haganah also assisted in landing 13,000 illegal immigrants.\n\nTension between the underground movements and the British increased with the increase in operations. On April 23, 1945 an operation undertaken by the Irgun to gain weapons from the [[Tegart fort]] at [[Ramat Gan]] resulted in a firefight. One Irgun member was killed and his body was later hanged on the fort's fence. Another fighter, [[Yizchak Bilu]], was killed as well in a diversionary ploy \u2013 an explosive device fell out of his hand, and he leapt onto it in order to save his comrades, who were also carrying explosives. A third fighter, [[Dov Gruner]], was caught. He stood trial and was sentenced to be death by hanging, refusing to sign a pardon request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac14.htm |title=The Gallows |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, British relations with the Yishuv worsened, building up to [[Operation Agatha]] of June 29. The authorities ignored the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]'s recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews into Palestine at once. As a result of the discovery of documents tying the Jewish Agency to the Jewish Resistance Movement, the Irgun was asked to speed up the plans for the [[King David Hotel bombing]] of July 22.<ref>Jabotinsky Institute Archives (k-4 1/11/5)</ref> The hotel was where the documents were located, the base for the British Secretariat, the military command and a branch of the [[Criminal Investigation Department|Criminal Investigation Division]] of the police. The Irgun later claimed to have sent a warning that was ignored.<ref>Menachem Begin, ''The Revolt''. 1951, p. 221</ref> 91 people were killed in the attack where a 350&nbsp;kg bomb was placed in the basement of the hotel and caused a large section of it to collapse. Only 13 were British soldiers.\n\n===Further struggle against the British===\n[[File:Menahem Begin during his \"Rabbi Sassover\" period with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] as \"Rabbi Sassover\", with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev, Tel Aviv, December 1946]]\n\nThe King David Hotel bombing and the arrest of Jewish Agency and other Yishuv leaders as part of [[Operation Agatha]] caused the Haganah to cease their armed activity against the British. Yishuv and Jewish Agency leaders were released from prison. From then until the end of the British mandate, resistance activities were led by the Irgun and Lehi. In early September 1946 the Irgun renewed its attacks against civil structures, railroads, communication lines and bridges. One operation was the attack on the train station in Jerusalem, in which [[Meir Feinstein]] was arrested and later committed suicide awaiting execution. According to the Irgun these sort of armed attacks were legitimate, since the trains primarily served the British, for redeployment of their forces. The Irgun also publicized leaflets, in three languages, not to use specific trains in danger of being attacked. For a while the British stopped train traffic at night. The Irgun also carried out repeated attacks against military and police traffic using disguised, electronically-detonated roadside mines which could be detonated by an operator hiding nearby as a vehicle passed, carried out arms raids against military bases and police stations (often disguised as British soldiers), launched bombing, shooting, and mortar attacks against military and police installations and checkpoints, and robbed banks to gain funds as a result of losing access to Haganah funding following the collapse of the Jewish Resistance Movement.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nOn October 31, 1946, in response to the British barring entry of Jews from Palestine, the Irgun [[1946 British Embassy bombing|blew up the British Embassy]] in [[Rome]], a center of British efforts to monitor and stop Jewish immigration. The Irgun also carried out a few other operations in Europe: a British troop train was derailed and an attempt against another troop train failed. An attack on a British officers club in [[Vienna]] took place in 1947, and an attack on another British officer's club in Vienna and a sergeant's club in [[Germany]] took place in 1948.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nIn December 1946 a sentence of 18 years and 18 beatings was handed down to a young Irgun member for robbing a bank. The Irgun made good on a threat they made<ref>{{cite news|title=FLOGGING SENTENCE|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2703695|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=25 December 1946|quote=He was convicted following a bank hold-up In September.  Irgun Zvai Leumi broadcast a threat that if the sentence were confirmed, British Army officers would be flogged in retaliation.}}</ref>  and after the detainee was whipped, Irgun members kidnapped British officers and beat them in public. The operation, known as the \"[[Night of the Beatings]]\" brought an end to British punitive beatings. The British, taking these acts seriously, moved many British families in Palestine into the confines of military bases, and some moved home.\n\n[[File:Bombe Irgoun 29 dec 1947.jpg|thumb|left|Arab bus after a bomb attack by the Irgun, 29 December 1947]]\nOn February 14, 1947, [[Ernest Bevin]] announced that the Jews and Arabs would not be able to agree on any British proposed solution for the land, and therefore the issue must be brought to the [[United Nations]] (UN) for a final decision. The Yishuv thought of the idea to transfer the issue to the UN as a British attempt to achieve delay while a UN inquiry commission would be established, and its ideas discussed, and all the while the Yishuv would weaken. [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet|Foundation for Immigration B]] increased the number of ships bringing in Jewish refugees. The British still strictly enforced the policy of limited Jewish immigration and illegal immigrants were placed in detention camps in [[Cyprus]], which increased the anger of the Jewish community towards the mandate government.\n\nThe Irgun stepped up its activity and from February 19 until March 3 it attacked 18 British military camps, convoy routes, vehicles, and other facilities. The most notable of these attacks was the bombing of a British officer's club located in Goldschmidt House in Jerusalem, which was in a heavily guarded security zone. Covered by machine-gun fire, an Irgun assault team in a truck penetrated the security zone and lobbed explosives into the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac12.htm |title=The Raid On The Jerusalem Officers Club |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Thirteen people, including two officers, were killed.<ref name=Hoffman/> As a result, martial law was imposed over much of the country, enforced by approximately 20,000 British soldiers. Despite this, attacks continued throughout the martial law period. The most notable one was an Irgun attack against the Royal Army Pay Corps base at the [[Schneller Orphanage]], in which a British soldier was killed.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nThroughout its struggle against the British, the Irgun sought to publicize its cause around the world. By humiliating the British, it attempted to focus global attention on Palestine, hoping that any British overreaction would be widely reported, and thus result in more political pressure against the British. Begin described this strategy as turning Palestine into a \"glass house\". The Irgun also re-established many representative offices internationally, and by 1948 operated in 23 states. In these countries the Irgun sometimes acted against the local British representatives or led public relations campaigns against Britain. According to [[Bruce Hoffman]]: \"''In an era long before the advent of 24/7 global news coverage and instantaneous satellite-transmitted broadcasts, the Irgun deliberately attempted to appeal to a worldwide audience far beyond the immediate confines of its local struggle, and beyond even the ruling regime's own homeland''.\"<ref name=Bell/><ref name=Hoffman/>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"7\" style=\"float: right; border: 4px solid #8888aa; background: #f7f8ff; padding: 5px; font-size: 95%; margin: 10px 30px 10px 4px;\"\n| style=\"background: #ccf; text-align: center;\" | [[Olei Hagardom|Executed Members of the Irgun]]\n|-\n|\n*[[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]]\n*[[Dov Gruner]]\n*[[Mordechai Alkahi]]\n*[[Yehiel Dresner]]\n*[[Eliezer Kashani]]\n*[[Yaakov Weiss]]\n*[[Avshalom Haviv]]\n*[[Meir Nakar]]\n|}\n\n===The Acre Prison break===\n{{Main|Acre Prison break}}\nOn April 16, 1947, Dov Gruner, Yehiel Dresner, Eliezer Kashani, and Mordechai El'kachi were hanged, while singing [[Hatikvah]]. On April 21 [[Meir Feinstein]] and Lehi member [[Moshe Barazani]] blew themselves up, using an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED), hours before their scheduled hanging. And on May 4 one of the Irgun's largest operations took place \u2013 the raid of the prison in the citadel in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The operation was carried out by 23 men, commanded by [[Dov Cohen]] \u2013 AKA \"Shimshon\", along with the help of the Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] prisoners inside the prison. The raid allowed 41 underground members to escape, although some were caught outside of the prison, and some were killed in the escape. Along with the underground movement members, other criminals \u2013 including 214 Arabs<ref>Horne, Edward (1982). A Job Well Done (Being a History of The Palestine Police Force 1920\u20131948).

British forces closed off and combed the area in search of the two, but did not find them. On July 29, 1947, in the afternoon, Meir Nakar, Avshalom Haviv, and Yaakov Weiss were executed. Approximately thirteen hours later the hostages were hanged in retaliation by the Irgun and their bodies, booby-trapped with an explosive, afterwards strung up from trees in woodlands south of Netanya. This action caused an outcry in Britain and was condemned both there and by Jewish leaders in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887512,00.html |title=Eye for an Eye for an Eye, Time Magazine.

The [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)]] was also influenced by this and other actions. At the same time another incident was developing \u2013 the events of the ship [[Exodus (ship)|''Exodus 1947'']]. The 4,500 Holocaust survivors on board were not allowed to enter Palestine. UNSCOP also covered the events. Some of its members were even present at [[Haifa]] port when the putative immigrants were forcefully removed from their ship (later found to have been rigged with an IED by some of its passengers) onto the deportation ships, and later commented that this strong image helped them press for an immediate solution for Jewish immigration and the question of Palestine.\n\nTwo weeks later, the House of Commons convened for a special debate on events in Palestine, and concluded that their soldiers should be withdrawn as soon as possible.\n\n==The 1948 Palestine War==\n{{Main|1948 Palestine War}}\n[[File:\u05d1\u05d2\u05d9\u05df (\u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6) \u05e2\u05dd \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e6\"\u05dc, 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] with Irgun members, 1948]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1102 Israel Defense Forces \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e6\"\u05dc \u05d1\u05e9\u05e2\u05ea \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e9\u05e7.jpg|thumb|Irgun fighters training in 1947]]\n[[File:Mitzad.jpg|thumb|Irgun parade in 1948]]\n\nUNSCOP's conclusion was a unanimous decision to end the British mandate, and a majority decision to divide [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) between a Jewish state and an Arab state. During the UN's deliberations regarding the committee's recommendations the Irgun avoided initiating any attacks, so as not to influence the UN negatively on the idea of a Jewish state. On November 29 the [[UN General Assembly]] voted in favor of ending the mandate and [[1947 UN Partition Plan|establishing two states]] on the land. That very same day the Irgun and the Lehi renewed their attacks on British targets. The next day the local Arabs began attacking the Jewish community, thus beginning the first stage of the [[1948 Palestine War]]. The first attacks on Jews were in Jewish neighborhoods of [[Jerusalem]], in and around [[Jaffa]], and in [[Bat Yam]], [[Holon]], and the [[Ha'Tikvah]] neighborhood in [[Tel Aviv]].\n\nIn the autumn of 1947, the Irgun had approximately 4,000 members. The goal of the organization at that point was the conquest of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea for the future Jewish state, and preventing Arab forces from driving out the Jewish community. The Irgun became almost an overt organization, establishing military bases in [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Petah Tikva]]. It began recruiting openly, thus significantly increasing in size. During the war the Irgun fought alongside the Lehi and the Haganah in the front against the Arab attacks. At first the Haganah maintained a defensive policy, as it had until then, but after the [[Convoy of 35]] incident it completely abandoned its policy of restraint: \"Distinguishing between individuals is no longer possible, for now \u2013 it is a war, and the even the innocent shall not be absolved.\"<ref>Netanel Lorch. ''The Edge of the Sword: Israel's War of Independence, 1947-1949'', Massada Publishing, 1958. pp. 85 {{he icon}}</ref>\n\nThe Irgun also began carrying out reprisal missions, as it had under David Raziel's command. At the same time though, it published announcements calling on the Arabs to lay down their weapons and maintain a ceasefire:\n:The National Military Organization has warned you, if the murderous attacks on Jewish civilians shall continue, its soldiers will penetrate your centers of activity and plague you. You have not heeded the warning. You continued to harm our brothers and murder them in wild cruelty. Therefore soldiers of the National Military Organization will go on the attack, as we have warned you.\n\n:... However even in these frenzied times, when Arab and Jewish blood is spilled at the British enslaver, we hereby call upon you ... to stop the attacks and create peace between us. We do not want a war with you. We are certain that neither do you want a war with us...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/begin/47_20-2.htm |title=Petition of Our Arab Neighbors: Announcement in Arabic to the Arab Rioters |language=Hebrew |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n\nHowever the mutual attacks continued. The Irgun attacked the Arab villages of [[Al-Tira (Haifa)|Tira]] near [[Haifa]], [[Yehudiya]] ('Abassiya) in the center, and [[Shuafat]] by Jerusalem. The Irgun also attacked in the [[Wadi Rushmiya]] neighborhood in Haifa and [[Abu Kabir]] in Jaffa. On December 29 Irgun units arrived by boat to the Jaffa shore and a gunfight between them and Arab gangs ensued. The following day a bomb was thrown from a speeding Irgun car at a group of Arab men waiting to be hired for the day at the Haifa oil refinery, resulting in seven Arabs killed, and dozens injured. In response, some Arab workers [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre|attacked Jews in the area]], killing 41. This sparked a Haganah response in [[Balad al-Shaykh raid|Balad al-Sheykh]], which resulted in the deaths of 60 civilians. The Irgun's goal in the fighting was to move the battles from Jewish populated areas to Arab populated areas. On January 1, 1948 the Irgun attacked again in Jaffa, its men wearing British uniforms; later in the month it attacked in [[Beit Nabala]], a base for many Arab fighters. On 5 January 1948 the Irgun detonated a lorry bomb outside Jaffa's Ottoman built Town Hall, killing 14 and injuring 19.<ref>''[[The Scotsman]]'', 6 January 1948; Walid Khalidi states that 25 civilians were killed.

These allegations include reports that fleeing individuals and families were fired at, and prisoners of war were killed after their capture. A Haganah report writes:\n:''The conquest of the village was carried out with great cruelty. Whole families \u2013 women, old people, children \u2013 were killed. ...

At the regional commander's request, on April 21 the Irgun took over an Arab post above Hadar Ha'Carmel as well as the Arab neighborhood of Wadi Nisnas, adjacent to the Lower City.\n\nThe Irgun acted independently in the conquest of Jaffa (part of the proposed Arab State according to the [[UN Partition Plan]]). On April 25 Irgun units, about 600 strong, left the Irgun base in [[Ramat Gan]] towards Arab Jaffa. Difficult battles ensued, and the Irgun faced resistance from the Arabs as well as the British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac18.htm |title=The Conquest Of Jaffa |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Under the command of [[Amichai Paglin|Amichai \"Gidi\" Paglin]], the Irgun's chief operations officer, the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya, which threatened the city of [[Tel Aviv]]. Afterwards the force continued to the sea, towards the area of the port, and using mortars, shelled the southern neighborhoods.\n[[File:Manshiyeh.jpg|thumb|left|The Manshiya quarter between [[Jaffa]] and Tel Aviv after the Irgun mortar bombardment.]] In his report concerning the fall of Jaffa the local Arab military commander, Michel Issa, wrote: \"Continuous shelling with mortars of the city by Jews for four days, beginning 25 April, [...] caused inhabitants of city, unaccustomed to such bombardment, to panic and flee.\"<ref>W. Khalidi, 1998, \"Selected Documents on the 1948 Palestine War\", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 27(3), p. 60\u2013105</ref> According to Morris the shelling was done by the Irgun. Their objective was \"to prevent constant military traffic in the city, to break the spirit of the enemy troops [and] to cause chaos among the civilian population in order to create a mass flight.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morris, 2004, 'The Birth ... Revisited', p. 213</ref> High Commissioner Cunningham wrote a few days later \"It should be made clear that IZL attack with mortars was indiscriminate and designed to create panic among the civilian inhabitants.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The British demanded the evacuation of the newly conquered city, and militarily intervened, ending the Irgun offensive. Heavy British shelling against Irgun positions in Jaffa failed to dislodge them, and when British armor pushed into the city, the Irgun resisted; a bazooka team managed to knock out one tank, buildings were blown up and collapsed onto the streets as the armor advanced, and Irgun men crawled up and tossed live dynamite sticks onto the tanks. The British withdrew, and opened negotiations with the Jewish authorities.<ref name=Bell/> An agreement was worked out, under which Operation Hametz would be stopped and the Haganah would not attack Jaffa until the end of the Mandate. The Irgun would evacuate Manshiya, with Haganah fighters replacing them. British troops would patrol its southern end and occupy the police fort. The Irgun had previously agreed with the Haganah that British pressure would not lead to withdrawal from Jaffa and that custody of captured areas would be turned over to the Haganah. The city ultimately fell on May 13 after Haganah forces entered the city and took control of the rest of the city, from the south \u2013 part of the ''Hametz Operation'' which included the conquest of a number of villages in the area. The battles in Jaffa were a great victory for the Irgun. This operation was the largest in the history of the organization, which took place in highly built up area that had many militants in shooting positions. During the battles explosives were used in order to break into homes and continue forging a way though them. Furthermore, this was the first occasion in which the Irgun had directly fought British forces, reinforced with armor and heavy weaponry. The city began these battles with an Arab population estimated at 70,000, which shrank to some 4,100 Arab residents by the end of major hostilities. Since the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya on its own, causing the flight of many of Jaffa's residents, the Irgun took credit for the conquest of Jaffa. It had lost 42 dead and about 400 wounded during the battle.<ref name=Bell/>\n\n==Integration with the IDF and the Altalena Affair==\n{{Main|Altalena Affair}}\n\nOn May 14, 1948 [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|the establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] was proclaimed. The declaration of independence was followed by the establishment of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), and the process of absorbing all military organizations into the IDF started. On June 1, an agreement had been signed Between [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yisrael Galili]] for the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF. One of the clauses stated that the Irgun had to stop smuggling arms. Meanwhile, in France, Irgun representatives purchased a ship, renamed ''[[Altalena]]'' (a pseudonym of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]), and weapons. The ship sailed on June 11 and arrived at the Israeli coast on June 20, during the first truce of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Despite [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 50]] declared an arms embargo in the region, neither side respected it.<ref>(Benny (2008), \"1948: The First Arab-Israeli War\", Yale University Press, New Haven, pp. 269\u201371, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12696-9}}).[[Mordechai Weingarten]]</ref>\n\nWhen the ship arrived the Israeli government, headed by Ben-Gurion, was adamant in its demand that the Irgun surrender and hand over all of the weapons. Ben-Gurion said: \"We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army.\"\n\n[[File:Altalena off Tel-Aviv beach.jpg|thumb|left|''Altalena'' on fire after the Israeli government quelling of the Irgun's attempt to smuggle weapons]]\nThere were two confrontations between the newly formed IDF and the Irgun: when ''Altalena'' reached [[Kfar Vitkin]] in the late afternoon of Sunday, June 20 many Irgun militants, including Begin, waited on the shore. A clash with the [[Alexandroni Brigade]], commanded by Dan Even (Epstein), occurred. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties on both sides. The clash ended in a ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander, and with the ship, now reinforced with local Irgun members, including Begin, sailing to Tel Aviv, where the Irgun had more supporters.\nMany Irgun members, who joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and concentrated on the Tel Aviv beach. A confrontation between them and the IDF units started. In response, Ben-Gurion ordered [[Yigael Yadin]] (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. Heavy guns were transferred to the area and at four in the afternoon, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the ''Altalena''. One of the shells hit the ship, which began to burn.\nSixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army; six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on [[Tel Aviv beach]]. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.\n\nAfter the shelling of the ''Altalena'', more than 200 Irgun fighters were arrested. Most of them were freed several weeks later. The Irgun militants were then fully integrated with the IDF and not kept in separate units.\n\nThe initial agreement for the integration of the Irgun into the IDF did not include [[Jerusalem]], where a small remnant of the Irgun called the ''Jerusalem Battalion'', numbering around 400 fighters, and Lehi, continued to operate independently of the government. Following the assassination of UN Envoy for Peace [[Folke Bernadotte]] by Lehi in September 1948, the Israeli government determined to immediately dismantle the underground organizations. An ultimatum was issued to the Irgun to liquidate itself and integrate into the IDF or be destroyed. The Irgun accepted the ultimatum, and shortly afterward, its fighters began enlisting in the IDF and turning over their arms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19480923&id=13ssAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KcsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3395,2171340&hl=en|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\n== Propaganda ==\nIn order to increase the popularity of the Irgun organization and ideology, Irgun employed propaganda.

His reaction to the prospect of death by assassination was passive and accepting. The admiral wrote:\n''To die for Emperor and Nation is the highest hope of a military man. After a brave hard fight the blossoms are scattered on the fighting field. But if a person wants to take a life instead, still the fighting man will go to eternity for Emperor and country.

As [[Confucius]] said, \"They may crush cinnabar, yet they do not take away its color; one may burn a fragrant herb, yet it will not destroy the scent.\" They may destroy my body, yet they will not take away my will.''<ref name=\"Hoyt-1990\"/>{{RP|101\u201302}}\n\nThe Japanese Army, annoyed at Yamamoto's unflinching opposition to a Rome-Berlin-Tokyo treaty, dispatched military police to \"guard\" Yamamoto, a ruse by the army to keep an eye on him.<ref name=\"Hoyt-1990\"/>{{RP|102-103}} He was later reassigned from the [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|naval ministry]] to sea as the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]] on August 30, 1939. This was done as one of the last acts of the then-acting Navy Minister [[Mitsumasa Yonai]], under [[Baron Hiranuma]]'s short-lived administration. It was done partly to make it harder for assassins to target Yamamoto. Yonai was certain that if Yamamoto remained ashore, he would be killed before the year [1939] ended.<ref name=\"Hoyt-1990\"/>{{RP|103}}\n\n==1940\u20131941==\n[[Image:Yamamoto-Isoroku.jpg|thumb|right|Marshal Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]]\n\nYamamoto was promoted to [[Naval ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II|admiral]] on November 15, 1940. This, in spite of the fact that when [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] was appointed Prime Minister on October 18, 1941, many political observers thought that Yamamoto's career was essentially over.<ref name=\"Hoyt-1990\"/>{{RP|114}} T\u014dj\u014d had been Yamamoto's old opponent from the time when the latter served as Japan's deputy naval minister and T\u014dj\u014d was the prime mover behind Japan's takeover of [[Manchuria]]. It was believed that Yamamoto would be appointed to command the Yokosuka Naval Base, \"a nice safe demotion with a big house and no power at all.\"<ref name=\"Hoyt-1990\"/>{{RP|114}} After the new Japanese cabinet was announced, however, Yamamoto found himself left alone in his position despite his open conflicts with T\u014dj\u014d and other members of the army's oligarchy who favored war with the European powers and the United States. Two of the main reasons for Yamamoto's political survival were his immense popularity within the fleet, where he commanded the respect of his men and officers, and his close relations with the imperial family.<ref name=\"Hoyt-1990\"/>{{RP|115}} He also had the acceptance of Japan's naval hierarchy:\n{{quote|There was no officer more competent to lead the Combined Fleet to victory than Admiral Yamamoto. His daring plan for the Pearl Harbor attack had passed through the crucible of the Japanese naval establishment, and after many expressed misgivings, his fellow admirals had realized that Yamamoto spoke no more than the truth when he said that Japan's hope for victory in this [upcoming] war was limited by time and oil. Every sensible officer of the navy was well aware of the perennial oil problems. Also, it had to be recognized that if the enemy could seriously disturb Japanese merchant shipping, then the fleet would be endangered even more.<ref name=\"Hoyt-1990\"/>{{RP|115\u201316}}}}\n\nConsequently, Yamamoto stayed in his post. With T\u014dj\u014d now in charge of Japan's highest political office, it became clear the army would lead the navy into a war about which Yamamoto had serious reservations. He wrote to an ultranationalist:\n\n{{quote|Should hostilities once break out between Japan and the United States, it would not be enough that we take [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]], nor even Hawaii and San Francisco. To make victory certain, we would have to march into [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and dictate the terms of peace in the [[White House]]. I wonder if our politicians [who speak so lightly of a Japanese-American war] have confidence as to the final outcome and are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices.<ref name=\"PrangeAt\">Prange, ''At Dawn We Slept'', p. 11</ref>}}\n\nThis quote was spread by the militarists, minus the last sentence, where it was interpreted in America as a boast that Japan would conquer the entire continental United States.<ref name=\"PrangeAt\" /> The omitted sentence showed Yamamoto's counsel of caution towards a war that could cost Japan dearly. Nevertheless, Yamamoto accepted the reality of impending war and planned for a quick victory by destroying the US fleet at Pearl Harbor in a [[Preventive war|preventive strike]] while simultaneously thrusting into the oil and rubber resource-rich areas of Southeast Asia, especially the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, and Malaya. In naval matters, Yamamoto opposed the building of the super-[[battleship]]s {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} as an unwise investment of resources.\n\nYamamoto was responsible for a number of innovations in [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|Japanese naval aviation]]. Although remembered for his association with aircraft carriers due to Pearl Harbor and Midway, Yamamoto did more to influence the development of land-based naval aviation, particularly the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] and [[Mitsubishi G4M|G4M]] [[medium bomber]]s. His demand for great range and the ability to carry a [[torpedo]] was intended to conform to Japanese conceptions of bleeding the American fleet as it advanced across the Pacific. The planes did achieve long range, but long-range fighter escorts were not available. These planes were lightly constructed and when fully fueled, they were especially vulnerable to enemy fire. This earned the G4M the sardonic nickname the \"flying cigarette lighter\". Yamamoto would eventually die in one of these aircraft.\n\nThe range of the G3M and G4M contributed to a demand for great range in a fighter aircraft. This partly drove the requirements for the [[A6M Zero]] which was as noteworthy for its range as for its maneuverability. Both qualities were again purchased at the expense of light construction and flammability that later contributed to the A6M's high casualty rates as the war progressed.\n\n[[Image:Yamamoto h63430.jpg|thumb|right|Yamamoto on a Navy Planning meeting on battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Nagato|Nagato]]'' in 1940]]\n\nAs Japan moved toward war during 1940, Yamamoto gradually moved toward strategic as well as tactical innovation, again with mixed results. Prompted by talented young officers such as [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Minoru Genda]], Yamamoto approved the reorganization of Japanese carrier forces into the [[First Air Fleet]], a consolidated striking force that gathered Japan's six largest carriers into one unit. This innovation gave great striking capacity, but also concentrated the vulnerable carriers into a compact target. Yamamoto also oversaw the organization of a similar large land-based organization in the 11th Air Fleet, which would later use the G3M and G4M to neutralize American air forces in the [[Philippines]] and sink the [[Royal Navy|British]] \"[[Force Z]]\".\n\nIn January 1941, Yamamoto went even further and proposed a radical revision of Japanese naval strategy. For two decades, in keeping with the [[doctrine]] of [[Alfred T. Mahan|Captain Alfred T. Mahan]],<ref>Mahan, ''The Influence of Seapower on History</ref> the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|Naval General Staff]] had planned in terms of Japanese light surface forces, [[submarine]]s, and land-based air units whittling down the American Fleet as it advanced across the Pacific until the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] engaged it in a climactic \"decisive battle\" in the northern [[Philippine Sea]] (between the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and the [[Marianas Islands|Marianas]]), with [[battleship]]s meeting in the traditional exchange between [[line of battle|battle lines]].\n\nCorrectly pointing out this plan had never worked even in Japanese war games, and painfully aware of American strategic advantages in military production capacity, Yamamoto proposed instead to seek a decision with the Americans by first reducing their forces with a preventive strike, and following it with a \"decisive battle\" fought offensively, rather than defensively. Yamamoto hoped, but probably did not believe, that if the Americans could be dealt terrific blows early in the war they might be willing to negotiate an end to the conflict. As it turned out, however, the note officially breaking diplomatic relations with the United States was delivered late, and he correctly perceived the Americans would be resolved upon revenge and unwilling to negotiate. At the end of the attack upon Pearl Harbor, upon hearing of the mis-timing of the communique breaking diplomatic relations with the United States earlier that day, [[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote|it is reputed Yamamoto said]], \"I fear all we have done today is to awaken a great, sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\";<ref>{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-534334-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&pg=PA666 |page=666}}</ref> however, there is no documented evidence the statement was made.\n\nThe Naval General Staff proved reluctant to go along and Yamamoto was eventually driven to capitalize on his popularity in the fleet by threatening to resign to get his way. Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] and the Naval General Staff eventually caved in to this pressure, but only insofar as approving the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\nThe First Air Fleet commenced preparations for the Pearl Harbor raid, solving a number of technical problems along the way, including how to launch torpedoes in the shallow water of Pearl Harbor and how to craft armor-piercing bombs by machining down battleship gun projectiles.\n\n===Attack on Pearl Harbor===\n{{Main|Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}\n\nAs Yamamoto had planned, the First Air Fleet of six carriers commenced hostilities against the Americans on December 7, 1941, launching 353<ref name=\"parillo288\">{{Harvnb|Parillo|2006|p=288}}</ref> aircraft against Pearl Harbor in two waves. The attack was a complete success according to the parameters of the mission, which sought to sink at least four American battleships and prevent the US Fleet from interfering in Japan's southward advance for at least six months. American aircraft carriers were also considered a choice target, but these were not in port at the time of the attack.\n\nIn the end, five American battleships were sunk, three were damaged, and eleven other [[cruiser]]s, [[destroyer]]s, and auxiliaries were sunk or seriously damaged. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft fire from the ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately [[Dive bomber|dive]] and [[torpedo bomber]]s, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so the commander of the First Air Fleet, Naval Vice Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]], withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on [[Oahu]]. Nagumo had absolutely no idea where the American carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about looking for them ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Much has been made of Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot,<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''; Coox, ''Kobun''.</ref> he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.\n\nOn the strategic level, the attack was a disaster for Japan, rousing American passions for revenge due to it being a \"sneak attack\". The shock of the attack coming in an unexpected place, with such devastating results and without the expected \"fair play\" of a [[declaration of war]] galvanized the US public's determination to avenge the attack. When asked by Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]] in mid-1941 about the outcome of a possible war with the United States, Yamamoto made a well-known and prophetic statement: If ordered to fight, \"I shall run wild considerably for the first six months or a year, but I have utterly no confidence for the second and third years.\"<ref>Harry A. Gailey, ''The War in the Pacific: From Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay'', Presidio Press: 1995. p. 68</ref> His prediction would be vindicated as Japan easily conquered territories and islands for the first six months of the war until it suffered a shattering defeat at the [[Battle of Midway]] on June 4\u20137, 1942, which ultimately tilted the balance of power in the Pacific towards the US.\n\nAs a strategic blow intended to prevent American interference in the [[Dutch East Indies]] for six months, the Pearl Harbor attack was a success, but unbeknownst to Yamamoto, it was a pointless one. In 1935, in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange]], the US Navy had abandoned any intention of attempting to charge across the Pacific towards the Philippines at the outset of a war with Japan. In 1937, the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] had further determined even fully manning the fleet to wartime levels could not be accomplished in less than six months, and myriad other logistic assets needed to execute a trans-Pacific movement simply did not exist and would require two years to construct after the onset of war. In 1940, US [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold Stark]] had penned a [[Plan Dog memorandum]], which emphasized a defensive war in the Pacific while the US concentrated on defeating [[Nazi Germany]] first, and consigned Admiral [[Husband Kimmel]]'s [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] to merely keeping the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia. Moreover, it is questionable whether the US would have gone to war at all had Japan attacked only British and Dutch possessions in the Far East.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref>\n\n==December 1941 \u2013 May 1942==\nWith the US fleet largely neutralized at Pearl Harbor, Yamamoto's Combined Fleet turned to the task of executing the larger Japanese war plan devised by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|Navy General Staff]]. The [[First Air Fleet]] made a circuit of the Pacific, striking American, Australian, Dutch and British installations from [[Wake Island]] to Australia to [[Ceylon]] in the Indian Ocean. The 11th Air Fleet caught the US 5th Air Force on the ground in the Philippines hours after Pearl Harbor, and then sank the British Force Z battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} and [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} underway at sea.\n\nUnder Yamamoto's able subordinates, Naval Lieutenant-Generals [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]], [[Nobutake Kond\u014d]], and [[Ib\u014d Takahashi]], the Japanese swept the inadequate remaining American, British, Dutch and Australian naval assets from the Dutch East Indies in a series of amphibious landings and surface naval battles culminating in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] on February 27, 1942. Along with the occupation of the Dutch East Indies came the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] on February 15, 1942, and the eventual reduction of the remaining American-Filipino defensive positions in the [[Philippines]] on the [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan peninsula]], April 9, 1942, and [[Battle of Corregidor|Corregidor Island]] on May 6, 1942. The Japanese had secured their oil- and rubber-rich \"southern resources area\".\n\nBy late-March, having achieved their initial aims with surprising speed and little loss, albeit against enemies ill-prepared to resist them, the Japanese paused to consider their next moves. Yamamoto and a few Japanese military leaders and officials waited, hoping that the United States or [[UK|Great Britain]] would negotiate an armistice or a peace treaty to end the war. But when the British, as well as the Americans, expressed no interest in negotiating a ceasefire with Japan, Japanese thoughts turned to securing their newly seized territory and acquiring more with an eye to forcing one or more of their enemies out of the war.\n\nCompeting plans were developed at this stage, including thrusts to the west against [[British India|India]], the [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|south against Australia]], and east against the United States. Yamamoto was involved in this debate, supporting different plans at different times with varying degrees of enthusiasm and for varying purposes, including [[Vote trading|\"horse-trading\"]] for support of his own objectives.\n\nPlans included ideas as ambitious as invading India or Australia, or seizing Hawaii. These grandiose ventures were inevitably set aside as the army could not spare enough troops from China for the first two, which would require a minimum of 250,000 men, nor shipping to support the latter two. (Shipping was allocated separately to the IJN and IJA, and jealously guarded.<ref name=\"parillo\">Parillo, ''Japanese Merchant Marine in World War II''</ref>) Instead, the Imperial General Staff supported an army thrust into [[Burma]] in hopes of linking up with [[Azad Hind|Indian Nationalists]] revolting against British rule, and attacks in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]] designed to imperil Australia's lines of communication with the United States. Yamamoto argued for a decisive offensive strike in the east to finish off the US fleet, but the more conservative Naval General Staff officers were unwilling to risk it.\n\nOn April 18, in the midst of these debates, the [[Doolittle Raid]] struck Tokyo and surrounding areas, demonstrating the threat posed by US aircraft carriers, and giving Yamamoto an event he could exploit to get his way as further debate over military strategy came to a quick end. The Naval General Staff agreed to Yamamoto's Midway Island (MI) Operation, subsequent to the first phase of the operations against Australia's link with America, and concurrent with its plan to seize positions in the [[Aleutian Islands]].\n\nYamamoto rushed planning for the Midway and Aleutians missions, while dispatching a force under Naval Major-General [[Takeo Takagi]], including the [[Fifth Carrier Division]] (the large, new carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}), to support the effort to seize the islands of [[Tulagi]] and [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]] for seaplane and aeroplane bases, and the town of [[Port Moresby]] on Papua New Guinea's south coast facing Australia.\n\nThe [[Operation Mo|Port Moresby (MO) Operation]] proved an unwelcome setback. Although Tulagi and Guadalcanal were taken, the Port Moresby invasion fleet was compelled to turn back when Takagi clashed with a US carrier task force in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in early May. Although the Japanese sank the US carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} and damaged the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5}}, the Americans damaged the carrier ''Sh\u014dkaku'' so badly that she required dockyard repairs, and the Japanese lost the light carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shoho||2}}. Just as importantly, Japanese operational mishaps and US fighters and anti-aircraft fire devastated the dive bomber and torpedo plane formations of both ''Sh\u014dkaku''{{'}}s and ''Zuikaku''{{'}}s air groups. These losses sidelined ''Zuikaku'' while she awaited replacement aircraft and aircrews, and saw to tactical integration and training. These two ships would be sorely missed a month later at Midway.<ref>Dull (1978), Evans & Peattie (1997), Lundstrom (1984), Parillo</ref>\n\n==Battle of Midway, June 1942==\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\n\nYamamoto's plan for Midway Island was an extension of his efforts to knock the US Pacific Fleet out of action long enough for Japan to fortify its defensive perimeter in the Pacific island chains. Yamamoto felt it necessary to seek an early, offensive decisive battle.\n\nThis plan was long believed to have been to draw American attention\u2014and possibly carrier forces\u2014north from Pearl Harbor by sending his Fifth Fleet (two light carriers, five cruisers, 13 destroyers, and four transports) against the Aleutians, [[Battle of Dutch Harbor|raiding]] [[Dutch Harbor]] on [[Unalaska Island]] and invading the more distant islands of [[Kiska]] and [[Attu Island|Attu]].<ref name=\"Lightbody\">{{cite book|last1=Lightbody|first1=Bradley|title=The Second World War|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-22404-7|page=136|edition= 1st|language=en|chapter=Part 5 \u2013 Containment}}</ref><ref name=\"Atlantic_Aleutians\">{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=David M.|title=Victory at Sea|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/03/victory-at-sea/306272/|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=The Atlantic|issue=March 1999|publisher=The Atlantic|date=March 1999|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhile Fifth Fleet attacked the Aleutians, First Mobile Force (four carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and 12 destroyers) would raid Midway and destroy its air force. Once this was neutralized, Second Fleet (one light carrier, two battleships, 10 cruisers, 21 destroyers, and 11 transports) would land 5,000 troops to seize the [[atoll]] from the US [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]].\n\nThe seizure of Midway was expected to draw the US carriers west into a trap where the First Mobile Force would engage and destroy them. Afterwards, First Fleet (one light carrier, seven battleships, three cruisers and 13 destroyers), in conjunction with elements of Second Fleet, would mop up remaining US surface forces and complete the destruction of the US Pacific Fleet.\n\nTo guard against failure, Yamamoto initiated two security measures. The first was an aerial reconnaissance mission (Operation K) over Pearl Harbor to ascertain if the US carriers were there. The second was a picket line of submarines to detect the movement of US carriers toward Midway in time for First Mobile Force, First Fleet, and Second Fleet to combine against it. In the event, the first measure was aborted and the second delayed until after US carriers had already sortied.\n\nThe plan was a compromise and hastily prepared, apparently so it could be launched in time for the anniversary of [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]],<ref>Bicheno, Hugh. ''Midway''.</ref> but appeared well thought out, well organized, and finely timed when viewed from a Japanese viewpoint. Against four carriers, two light carriers, 11 battleships, 16 cruisers and 46 destroyers likely to be in the area of the main battle the US could field only three carriers, eight cruisers, and 15 destroyers. The disparity appeared crushing. Only in numbers of carrier decks, available aircraft, and submarines was there near parity between the two sides. Despite various mishaps developed in the execution, it appeared that\u2014barring something unforeseen\u2014Yamamoto held all the cards.\n\nUnbeknownst to Admiral Yamamoto, the US had learned of Japanese plans thanks to the [[Magic (cryptography)|code breaking of Japanese naval code D]] (known to the US as [[JN-25]]).<ref name=\"Atlantic_Aleutians\" /> As a result, Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], the Pacific Fleet commander, was able to circumvent both of Yamamoto's security measures and place his outnumbered forces in a position to conduct an ambush. By Nimitz's calculation, his three available carrier decks, plus Midway, gave him rough parity with Nagumo's First Mobile Force.\n\nFollowing a nuisance raid by Japanese [[flying boat]]s in May,<ref>Holmes, Wilfred J. \"Jasper\". ''Double-Edged Secrets'' and ''Undersea Victory''</ref> Nimitz dispatched a [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] to guard the intended refueling point for Operation K near [[French Frigate Shoals]], causing the reconnaissance mission to be aborted and leaving Yamamoto ignorant of whether Pacific Fleet carriers were still at Pearl Harbor. It remains unclear why Yamamoto permitted the earlier attack, and why his submarines did not sortie sooner, as reconnaissance was essential to success at Midway. Nimitz also dispatched his carriers toward Midway early, and they passed the intended picket line force of submarines ''en route'' to their station, negating Yamamoto's back-up security measure. Nimitz's carriers positioned themselves to ambush the ''Kido Butai'' (striking force) when it struck Midway. A token cruiser and destroyer force was sent toward the Aleutians, but otherwise Nimitz ignored them. On June 4, 1942, days before Yamamoto expected them to interfere in the Midway operation, US carrier-based aircraft destroyed the four carriers of the ''Kido Butai'', catching the Japanese carriers at an especially vulnerable moment.\n\nWith his air power destroyed and his forces not yet concentrated for a fleet battle, Yamamoto maneuvered his remaining forces, still strong on paper, to trap the US forces. He was unable to do so because his initial dispositions had placed his surface combatants too far from Midway,<ref name=\"Willmott, H.P. 1983\">Willmott, H.P. ''Barrier and the Javelin''. Annapolis: United States Naval Institute Pres, 1983.</ref> and because Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]] prudently withdrew to the east in a position to further defend Midway Island, believing (based on a mistaken [[USS Tambor (SS-198)#Second patrol|submarine report]]) the Japanese still intended to invade.<ref name=\"blair\">Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory''. (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1975).</ref> Not knowing several battleships, including the powerful {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}, were on the Japanese [[order of battle]], he did not comprehend the severe risk of a night surface battle, in which his carriers and cruisers would be at a disadvantage.<ref name=\"blair\"/> However, his move to the east did avoid the possibility of such a battle taking place. Correctly perceiving he had lost and could not bring surface forces into action, Yamamoto aborted the invasion of Midway and withdrew. The defeat marked the high tide of Japanese expansion.\n\nYamamoto's plan for Midway Island has been the subject of much criticism. Some historians state it violated the principle of concentration of force, and was overly complex. Others point to similarly complex Allied operations, such as [[Operation MB8]], that were successful, and note the extent to which the US intelligence ''coup'' derailed the operation before it began. Had Yamamoto's dispositions not denied Nagumo adequate pre-attack reconnaissance assets, both the American cryptanalytic success and the unexpected appearance of Fletcher's carriers would have been irrelevant.<ref name=\"Willmott, H.P. 1983\"/>\n\n==Actions after Midway==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}<!-- Most of this material is in Paul S. Dull's battle history of the Imperial Japanese Navy -->\nThe Battle of Midway checked Japanese momentum, but the IJN was still a powerful force and capable of regaining the initiative. It planned to resume the thrust with [[Operation FS]] aimed at eventually taking [[Samoa]] and [[Fiji]] to cut the US lifeline to Australia. This was expected to short-circuit the threat posed by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and his US and Australian forces in New Guinea. To this end, development of the [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|airfield on Guadalcanal]] continued and attracted the attention of Yamamoto's opposite number, Admiral [[Ernest King]].\n\nTo prevent the Japanese from regaining the initiative, King ramrodded the idea of an immediate American counterattack through the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This precipitated the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|US invasion of Guadalcanal]] and beat the Japanese to the punch, with marines landing on the island in August 1942 and starting a bitter struggle that lasted until February 1943 in a battle of attrition that Japan could ill afford.\n\nYamamoto remained in command as commander-in-chief, retained at least partly to avoid diminishing the morale of the Combined Fleet. However, he had [[lost face]] as a result of the Midway defeat and the Naval General Staff were disinclined to indulge in further gambles. This reduced Yamamoto to pursuing the classic defensive \"decisive battle strategy\" he had attempted to overturn.\n\nThe naval and land battles at Guadalcanal caught the Japanese over-extended and attempting to support fighting in New Guinea while guarding the central Pacific and preparing to conduct Operation FS. The FS operation was abandoned and the Japanese attempted to fight in both New Guinea and Guadalcanal at the same time. Already stretched thin, they suffered repeated setbacks due to a lack of shipping, a lack of troops, and a disastrous inability to coordinate army and navy activities.\n\nYamamoto committed Combined Fleet units to a series of small attrition actions across the south and central Pacific that stung the Americans, but suffered losses he could ill afford in return. Three major efforts to carry the island precipitated a pair of carrier battles that Yamamoto commanded personally at the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]] in September and October, and finally a [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|wild pair of surface engagements]] in November, all timed to coincide with Japanese Army pushes. The timing of each major battle was successively derailed when the army could not hold up its end of the operation. Yamamoto's naval forces won a few victories and inflicted considerable losses and damage to the US fleet in several naval battles around Guadalcanal which included the battles of [[Battle of Savo Island|Savo Island]], [[Battle of Cape Esperance|Cape Esperance]], and [[Battle of Tassafaronga|Tassafaronga]], but he could never draw the US into a decisive fleet action. As a result, Japanese naval strength began to diminish.\n\nThere were severe losses of carrier dive-bomber and torpedo-bomber crews in the carrier battles, emasculating the already depleted carrier air groups. Japan could not hope to match the US in quantities of replacement pilots, and the quality of both Japanese land-based and naval aviation began declining. Particularly harmful, however, were losses of numerous [[destroyer]]s in the unsuccessful [[Tokyo Express]] supply runs. The IJN already faced a shortage of such ships, and these losses further exacerbated Japan's already weakened [[convoy|defense of shipping]].<ref name=\"parillo\"/> With Guadalcanal lost in February 1943, there was no further attempt by the Japanese navy to seek a major battle in the Solomon Islands against the US fleet, although smaller battles of attrition continued. Yamamoto shifted the load of the air battle away from the depleted carrier air wings to land-based naval air forces.\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|Operation Vengeance}}\n\n[[Image:Yamamoto last image alive.jpg|thumb|left|Admiral Yamamoto, a few hours before his death, saluting Japanese naval pilots at [[Rabaul]], April 18, 1943]]\n\nTo boost morale following the defeat at Guadalcanal, Yamamoto decided to make an inspection tour throughout the [[Pacific Ocean Theater of World War II|South Pacific]]. On April 14, 1943, the US naval intelligence effort, code-named \"[[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]]\", intercepted and decrypted a message containing specifics of Yamamoto's tour, including arrival and departure times and locations, as well as the number and types of aircraft that would transport and accompany him on the journey. Yamamoto, the itinerary revealed, would be flying from [[Rabaul]] to [[Balalae Airport|Balalae Airfield]], on an island near [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], on the morning of April 18, 1943.\n\nUS President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] to \"get Yamamoto\". Knox instructed [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] of Roosevelt's wishes. Admiral King telephoned Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] at Pearl Harbor. This mission would be top secret and urgent. Admiral Nimitz consulted Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]], Commander, South Pacific, then authorized a mission on April 17 to intercept Yamamoto's flight ''en route'' and shoot it down. A squadron of [[USAAF]] [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] aircraft were assigned the task as only they possessed sufficient range to intercept and engage. Select pilots from three units were informed that they were intercepting an \"important high officer\" with no specific name given.\n\n[[Image:Japan-navy-1931-1944-sleeve 30-1-.gif|thumb|100px|right|Sleeve insignia of [[Naval ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II|Kaigun Taish\u014d (Admiral)]]; the rank Yamamoto held at the time of his death.]]\n\nOn the morning of April 18, despite urging by local commanders to cancel the trip for fear of ambush, Yamamoto's two [[Mitsubishi G4M]] bombers, used as fast transport aircraft without bombs, left Rabaul as scheduled for the {{Convert|315|mi|km|abbr=on}} trip. Sixteen [[P-38 Lightning]]s intercepted the flight over Bougainville and a dogfight ensued between them and the six escorting [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]es. [[First Lieutenant]] [[Rex T. Barber]] engaged the first of the two Japanese transports which turned out to be ''T1-323'' (Yamamoto's aircraft). He fired on the aircraft until it began to spew smoke from its left engine. Barber turned away to attack the other transport as Yamamoto's plane crashed into the jungle.\n\nThe crash site and body of Yamamoto were found the next day in the jungle of the island of Bougainville by a Japanese search and rescue party, led by army engineer Lieutenant Hamasuna. According to Hamasuna, Yamamoto had been thrown clear of the plane's wreckage, his white-gloved hand grasping the hilt of his [[katana]], still upright in his seat under a tree. Hamasuna said Yamamoto was instantly recognizable, head dipped down as if deep in thought. A [[post-mortem]] of the body disclosed that Yamamoto had received two [[.50 BMG|0.50-caliber]] bullet wounds, one to the back of his left shoulder and another to his left lower jaw that exited above his right eye. The Japanese navy doctor examining the body determined that the head wound killed Yamamoto. The more violent details of Yamamoto's death were hidden from the Japanese public. The medical report was whitewashed, changed \"on orders from above\", according to biographer Hiroyuki Agawa.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pj3t74K8hq4C&pg=PA343 |page=343 |last=Gamble |first=Bruce |title=Fortress Rabaul: The Battle for the Southwest Pacific, January 1942&nbsp;\u2013 April 1943 |publisher=Zenith Imprint |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-7603-2350-2}}</ref><ref>Agawa 2000, p. 364</ref>\n\nYamamoto's staff cremated his remains at Buin and his ashes were returned to Tokyo aboard the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}, Yamamoto's last flagship.

Tora! Tora!]]'', which stars Japanese actor [[So Yamamura|S\u00f4 Yamamura]] as Yamamoto, who states after the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n{{quote\n|text=I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\n|sign=[[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote|attributed to Yamamoto]] in ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'' (1970), in reference to the attack on Pearl Harbor.}} There is no evidence that Yamamoto said this in reality despite the film calling it a quote. (See [[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote]] for further discussion.)\n\nThe first film to feature Yamamoto was [[Toho Company|Toho]]'s 1953 film ''[[:jp:\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u306e\u9df2|Taiheiy\u00f4 no washi]]'', (later released in the United States as ''[[Eagle of the Pacific]]''), in which Yamamoto was portrayed by [[Denjir\u00f4 \u00d4k\u00f4chi]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046395/ Taiheiy\u00f4 no washi (1953)]. IMDB.com.</ref>\n\nThe 1960 film ''[[The Gallant Hours]]'' depicts the battle of wits between Vice-Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.]] and Yamamoto from the start of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in August 1942 to [[Operation Vengeance|Yamamoto's death]] in April 1943.  The film, however, portrays Yamamoto's death as occurring in November 1942, the day after the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, and the P-38 aircraft that killed him as coming from Guadalcanal.\n\nIn [[Daiei Studios]]'s 1969 film ''Aa, kaigun'' (later released in the United States as ''Gateway to Glory''), Yamamoto was portrayed by [[Sh\u014dgo Shimada (actor)|Sh\u00f4go Shimada]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202777/ Aa, kaigun (1970)]. IMDB.com.</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/563206/Gateway-to-Glory/ Gateway to Glory (1970)]. Turner Classic Movies.</ref>\n\nAward-winning Japanese actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] (star of ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'') portrayed Yamamoto in three films:\n* ''[[:jp:\u9023\u5408\u8266\u968a\u53f8\u4ee4\u9577\u5b98 \u5c71\u672c\u4e94\u5341\u516d|Reng\u014d Kantai Shirei Ch\u014dkan: Yamamoto Isoroku]]'' (1968, later released in Canada and the United States as ''Admiral Yamamoto''),<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063822/ Admiral Yamamoto (1968, original title: ''Reng\u014d Kantai Shirei Ch\u014dkan: Yamamoto Isoroku'')], imdb.com</ref>\n* ''Gekido no showashi 'Gunbatsu' '' (1970, lit. \"Turning Point of Showa History: The Militarists\"),<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065767/ Gekido no showashi 'Gunbatsu' (1970)]. IMDB.com</ref> and\n* ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' (1976, where all of the Japanese scenes had English dialogue).\n\nIn [[Sh\u016be Matsubayashi]]'s 1981 film ''[[:jp:\u9023\u5408\u8266\u968a (\u6620\u753b)|Reng\u014d kantai]]'' (lit. \"Combined Fleet\", later released in the United States as ''[[The Imperial Navy]]''), Yamamoto was portrayed by [[Keiju Kobayashi]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085620/ ''Reng\u014d Kantai'' (1981)]. IMDB.com</ref>\n\nIn the 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', Yamamoto was portrayed by Oscar-nominated Japanese-born American actor [[Mako Iwamatsu]]. Like ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', this film also features [[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote|the sleeping giant quote]].\n\nIn [[Toei Company|Toei]]'s 2011 war film ''[[Reng\u014d Kantai Shirei Ch\u014dkan: Yamamoto Isoroku (2011 film)|Reng\u014d Kantai Shirei Ch\u014dkan: Yamamoto Isoroku]]'', Yamamoto was portrayed by [[K\u014dji Yakusho]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1932695/ Isoroku Yamamoto, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet (2011)]. IMDB.com</ref>\n\nA fictionalized version of Yamamoto's death was portrayed in the ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)]]'' episode \"The Hawk Flies on Sunday,\" though only photos of Yamamoto were shown. In this episode, set much later in the war than in real life, the Black Sheep, a Marine Corsair squadron, joins an army squadron of P-51 Mustangs. The Marines intercepted fighter cover while the army shot down Yamamoto.\n\n===Alternate history===\n\nIn the 1993 [[OVA]] series ''[[Konpeki no Kantai]]'' (lit. ''Deep Blue Fleet''), instead of dying in the plane crash, Yamamoto blacks out and suddenly wakes up as his younger self, Isoroku Takano, after the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905. His memory from the original timeline intact, Yamamoto uses his knowledge of the future to help Japan become a stronger military power, eventually launching a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]]'s government. In the subsequent [[Pacific War]], Japan's technologically advanced navy decisively defeats the United States, and grants all of the former European and American colonies in Asia full independence. Later on, Yamamoto convinces Japan to join forces with the United States and Britain to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\nIn the 2004 [[anime]] series ''[[Zipang (anime)|Zipang]]'', Yamamoto (voiced by [[:jp:\u5916\u6ce2\u5c71\u6587\u660e|Bunmei Tobayama]]) works to develop the uneasy partnership with the crew of the [[DDG-182 Mirai|JMSDF ''Mirai'']], which has been transported back sixty years through time to the year 1942.\n\nIn the [[Axis of Time]] trilogy by author [[John Birmingham]], after a naval task force from the year 2021 is accidentally transported back through time to 1942, Yamamoto assumes a leadership role in the dramatic alteration of Japan's war strategy.\n\nIn [[Douglas Niles]]' 2007 book ''MacArthur's War: A Novel of the Invasion of Japan'' (written with [[Michael Dobson (author)|Michael Dobson]]), which focuses on General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and an alternate history of the [[Pacific War]] (following a considerably different outcome of the [[Battle of Midway]]), Yamamoto is portrayed sympathetically, with much of the action in the Japanese government seen through his eyes, though he could not change the major decisions of Japan in World War II.\n\nIn [[Robert Conroy]]'s 2011 book ''Rising Sun'', Yamamoto directs the IJN to launch a series of attacks on the [[American West Coast]], in the hope the United States can be convinced to sue for peace and securing Japan's place as a world power; but cannot escape his lingering fear the war will ultimately doom Japan.\n\nIn [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 book ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'', Yamamoto's final moments are depicted, with him realising [[Japanese naval codes|Japan's naval codes]] have been broken and he must inform headquarters.<!--anybody who cares how it ends can read it-->\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Agawa, Hiroyuki; Bester, John (trans.).

It covers a range of techniques, mostly based on [[absorption spectroscopy]]. As with all spectroscopic techniques, it can be used to identify and study [[chemical]]s. Samples may be solid, liquid, or gas. The method or technique of infrared spectroscopy is conducted with an instrument called an '''infrared spectrometer''' (or spectrophotometer) to produce an '''infrared spectrum'''.  An IR spectrum can be visualized in a graph of infrared light [[absorbance]] (or [[transmittance]]) on the vertical axis vs. frequency or wavelength on the horizontal axis. Typical [[Units of measurement|unit]]s of frequency used in IR spectra are [[reciprocal centimeters]] (sometimes called [[wave number]]s), with the symbol cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. Units of IR wavelength are commonly given in [[micrometre|micrometer]]s (formerly called \"microns\"), symbol \u03bcm, which are related to wave numbers in a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] way. A common laboratory instrument that uses this technique is a [[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared]] (FTIR) [[spectrometer]]. Two-dimensional IR is also possible as discussed [[Infrared spectroscopy#Two-dimensional IR|below]].\n\nThe infrared portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] is usually divided into three regions; the [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-]], mid- and far- infrared, named for their relation to the visible spectrum. The higher-energy near-IR, approximately 14000\u20134000&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> (0.8\u20132.5&nbsp;\u03bcm wavelength) can excite [[overtones|overtone]] or [[Harmonic (mathematics)|harmonic]] vibrations. The mid-infrared, approximately 4000\u2013400&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> (2.5\u201325&nbsp;\u03bcm) may be used to study the fundamental vibrations and associated [[Rotational-vibrational spectroscopy|rotational-vibrational]] structure. The far-infrared, approximately 400\u201310&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> (25\u20131000&nbsp;\u03bcm), lying adjacent to the [[microwave]] region, has low energy and may be used for [[rotational spectroscopy]]. The names and classifications of these subregions are conventions, and are only loosely based on the relative molecular or electromagnetic properties.\n\n==Theory==\n[[File:Bromomethane IR spectroscopy.svg|thumb|350px|Sample of an IR spec. reading; this one is from [[bromomethane]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Br), showing peaks around 3000, 1300, and 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> (on the horizontal axis).]]\nInfrared spectroscopy exploits the fact that molecules absorb frequencies that are characteristic of their [[Chemical structure|structure]]. These absorptions occur at [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], i.e. the frequency of the absorbed radiation matches the vibrational frequency.  The energies are affected by the shape of the molecular [[potential energy surface]]s, the masses of the atoms, and the associated [[vibronic coupling]].\n\n[[File:Bromomethane.gif|thumb|350px|left|3D animation of the symmetric stretching of the C\u2013H bonds of [[bromomethane]]]] In particular, in the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation|Born\u2013Oppenheimer]] and harmonic approximations, i.e. when the [[molecular Hamiltonian]] corresponding to the electronic [[ground state]] can be approximated by a [[quantum harmonic oscillator|harmonic oscillator]] in the neighborhood of the equilibrium [[molecular geometry]], the resonant frequencies are associated with the [[normal modes]] corresponding to the molecular electronic ground state potential energy surface. The resonant frequencies are also related to the strength of the bond and the [[atomic mass|mass of the atoms]] at either end of it. Thus, the frequency of the vibrations are associated with a particular normal mode of motion and a particular bond type.\n\n===Number of vibrational modes===\nIn order for a vibrational mode in a sample to be \"IR active\", it must be associated with changes in the dipole moment. A permanent dipole is not necessary, as the rule requires only a change in dipole moment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paula|first=Peter Atkins, Julio de|title=Elements of physical chemistry|date=2009|publisher=Oxford U.P|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-922672-6|pages=459|edition=5th}}</ref>\n\nA molecule can vibrate in many ways, and each way is called a ''vibrational mode.''  For molecules with N number of atoms, linear molecules have 3N&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;5 degrees of vibrational modes, whereas nonlinear molecules have 3N&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;6 degrees of vibrational modes (also called vibrational degrees of freedom). As an example [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]], a non-linear molecule, will have 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 degrees of vibrational freedom, or modes.\n\nSimple [[diatomic molecule]]s have only one bond and only one vibrational band. If the molecule is symmetrical, e.g. N<sub>2</sub>, the band is not observed in the IR spectrum, but only in the [[Raman spectrum]].  Asymmetrical diatomic molecules, e.g. [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], absorb in the IR spectrum. More complex molecules have many bonds, and their vibrational spectra are correspondingly more complex, i.e. big molecules have many peaks in their IR spectra.\n\nThe atoms in a CH<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> group, commonly found in [[organic compound]]s and where X can represent any other atom, can vibrate in nine different ways. Six of these vibrations involve only the [[Methylene group|CH<sub>2</sub>]] portion: '''symmetric and antisymmetric stretching''', '''scissoring''', '''rocking''', '''wagging''' and '''twisting''', as shown below. Structures that do not have the two additional X groups attached have fewer modes because some modes are defined by specific relationships to those other attached groups. For example, in water, the rocking, wagging, and twisting modes do not exist because these types of motions of the H represent simple rotation of the whole molecule rather than vibrations within it.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Direction|Symmetry}}\n!

In some cases, [[overtone band]]s are observed. An overtone band arises from the absorption of a photon leading to a direct transition from the ground state to the second excited vibrational state (v = 2). Such a band appears at approximately twice the energy of the fundamental band for the same normal mode. Some excitations, so-called ''combination modes'', involve simultaneous excitation of more than one normal mode. The phenomenon of [[Fermi resonance]] can arise when two modes are similar in energy; Fermi resonance results in an unexpected shift in energy and intensity of the bands etc.\n\n==Practical IR spectroscopy==\nThe infrared spectrum of a sample is recorded by passing a beam of infrared light through the sample. When the frequency of the IR is the same as the vibrational frequency of a bond or collection of bonds, absorption occurs. Examination of the transmitted light reveals how much energy was absorbed at each frequency (or wavelength). This measurement can be achieved by scanning the wavelength range using a [[monochromator]]. Alternatively, the entire wavelength range is measured  using a [[Fourier transform]] instrument and then a [[transmittance]] or [[absorbance]] spectrum is generated using a dedicated procedure.\n\nThis technique is commonly used for analyzing samples with [[covalent bond]]s. Simple spectra are obtained from samples with few IR active bonds and high levels of purity. More complex molecular structures lead to more absorption bands and more complex spectra.\n[[File:SolnIRcell.jpg|thumb|Typical IR solution cell. The windows are CaF<sub>2</sub>.]]\n\n===Sample preparation===\n<!-- A link on Liquid paraffin targets this paragraph. If you change the sub-heading, please change the link as well. Thanks. -->\nGaseous samples require a sample cell with a long [[pathlength]] to compensate for the diluteness. The pathlength of the sample cell depends on the concentration of the compound of interest. A simple glass tube with length of 5 to 10&nbsp;cm equipped with infrared-transparent windows at the both ends of the tube can be used for concentrations down to several hundred ppm. Sample gas concentrations well below ppm can be measured with a  [[White cell (spectroscopy)|White's cell]] in which the infrared light is guided with mirrors to travel through the gas. White's cells are available with optical pathlength starting from 0.5 m up to hundred meters.\n\nLiquid samples can be sandwiched between two plates of a salt (commonly [[sodium chloride]], or common salt, although a number of other salts such as [[potassium bromide]] or [[calcium fluoride]] are also used).<ref name=Har>{{cite book\n|author1=Laurence M. Harwood |author2=Christopher J. Moody |title = Experimental organic chemistry: Principles and Practice\n|edition = Illustrated \n|page = 292|isbn=0-632-02017-2 |date=1989\n|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}</ref>\nThe plates are transparent to the infrared light and do not introduce any lines onto the spectra.\n\nSolid samples can be prepared in a variety of ways. One common method is to crush the sample with an oily mulling agent (usually mineral oil [[Nujol]]). A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured. The second method is to grind a quantity of the sample with a specially purified salt (usually [[potassium bromide]]) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This powder mixture is then pressed in a mechanical [[Machine press|press]] to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass.<ref name=Har/>  A third technique is the \"cast film\" technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic solvent. A drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for qualitative analysis. The final method is to use [[microtomy]] to cut a thin (20\u2013100&nbsp;\u00b5m) film from a solid sample. This is one of the most important ways of analysing failed plastic products for example because the integrity of the solid is preserved.\n\nIn [[photoacoustic spectroscopy]] the need for sample treatment is minimal. The sample, liquid or solid, is placed into the sample cup which is inserted into the photoacoustic cell which is then sealed for the measurement. The sample may be one solid piece, powder or basically in any form for the measurement. For example, a piece of rock can be inserted into the sample cup and the spectrum measured from it.\n\n===Comparing to a reference===\n[[File:IR spectroscopy apparatus.svg|thumb|400px|Schematics of a two-beam absorption spectrometer. A beam of infrared light is produced, passed through an [[interferometer]] (not shown), and then split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter, which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained. This \"two-beam\" setup gives accurate spectra even if the intensity of the light source drifts over time.]]\nIt is typical to record spectrum of both the sample and a \"reference\". This step controls for a number of variables, e.g. [[infrared detector]], which may affect the spectrum. The reference measurement makes it possible to eliminate the instrument influence.\n\nThe appropriate \"reference\" depends on the measurement and its goal. The simplest reference measurement is to simply remove the sample (replacing it by air). However, sometimes a different reference is more useful. For example, if the sample is a dilute solute dissolved in water in a beaker, then a good reference measurement might be to measure pure water in the same beaker. Then the reference measurement would cancel out not only all the instrumental properties (like what light source is used), but also the light-absorbing and light-reflecting properties of the water and beaker, and the final result would just show the properties of the solute (at least approximately).\n\nA common way to compare to a reference is sequentially: first measure the reference, then replace the reference by the sample and measure the sample. This technique is not perfectly reliable; if the infrared lamp is a bit brighter during the reference measurement, then a bit dimmer during the sample measurement, the measurement will be distorted. More elaborate methods, such as a \"two-beam\" setup (see figure), can correct for these types of effects to give very accurate results. The [[Standard addition]] method can be used to statistically cancel these errors.\n\nNevertheless, among different absorption based techniques which are used for gaseous species detection, [[Cavity ring-down spectroscopy]] (CRDS) can be used as a calibration free method. The fact that CRDS is based on the measurements of photon life-times (and not the laser intensity) makes it needless for any calibration and comparison with a reference <ref>{{cite journal|author1=Soran Shadman |author2=Charles Rose |author3=Azer P.

The horizontal axis is the position of the mirror, and the vertical axis is the amount of light detected. This is the \"raw data\" which can be [[Fourier transform]]ed to get the actual spectrum.]]\n'''[[Fourier transform]] infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy''' is a measurement technique that allows one to record infrared spectra.  Infrared light is guided through an [[interferometer]] and then through the sample (or vice versa).  A moving mirror inside the apparatus alters the distribution of infrared light that passes through the interferometer. The signal directly recorded, called an  \"interferogram\", represents light output as a function of mirror position. A data-processing technique called [[Fourier transform]] turns this raw data into the desired result (the sample's spectrum): Light output as a function of infrared [[wavelength]] (or equivalently, [[wavenumber]]). As described above, the sample's spectrum is always compared to a reference.\n\nAn alternate method for acquiring spectra is the \"dispersive\" or \"scanning [[monochromator]]\" method.  In this approach, the sample is irradiated sequentially with various single wavelengths. The dispersive method is more common in [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|UV-Vis spectroscopy]], but is less practical in the infrared than the FTIR method. One reason that FTIR is favored is called \"[[Fellgett's advantage]]\" or the \"multiplex advantage\": The information at all frequencies is collected simultaneously, improving both speed and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. Another is called \"Jacquinot's Throughput Advantage\": A dispersive measurement requires detecting much lower light levels than an FTIR measurement.<ref name=white>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t2VSNnFoO3wC&pg=PA7 ''Chromatography/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and its applications'', by Robert White, p7]</ref> There are other advantages, as well as some disadvantages,<ref name=white/> but virtually all modern infrared spectrometers are FTIR instruments.\n\n==Absorption bands==\nIR spectroscopy is often used to identify structures because [[functional group]]s give rise to characteristic bands both in terms of intensity and position (frequency).  The positions of these bands are summarized in correlation tables as shown below.\n{{Main|Infrared spectroscopy correlation table}}\n[[File:IR-spectroscopy-sample.svg|thumb|800px|center|List of main IR spectroscopy bands.

In such cases further information can be gleaned about the strength on a bond, relying on the empirical guideline called '''Badger's Rule'''.  Originally published by Richard Badger in 1934,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Badger|first1=Richard|title=A Relation Between Internuclear Distances and Bond Force Constants|journal=J Chem Phys|date=1934|volume=2|page=128|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1749433|doi=10.1063/1.1749433|bibcode=1934JChPh...2..128B}}</ref> this rule states that the strength of a bond correlates with the frequency of its vibrational mode. That is, increase in bond strength leads to corresponding frequency increase and vice versa.\n\n==Uses and applications==\n[[File:Portable Screening Devices (1435) (8225044148).jpg|thumb|US [[Food and Drug Administration]] scientist uses portable near infrared spectroscopy device to detect potentially illegal substances]]\nInfrared spectroscopy is a simple and reliable technique widely used in both organic and inorganic chemistry, in research and industry. It is used in quality control, dynamic measurement, and monitoring applications such as the long-term unattended measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in greenhouses and growth chambers by infrared gas analyzers.\n\nIt is also used in [[forensic analysis]] in both criminal and civil cases, for example in identifying [[polymer degradation]]. It can be used in determining the [[blood alcohol content]] of a suspected drunk driver.\n\nIR-spectroscopy has been successfully used in analysis and identification of [[pigments]] in [[paintings]]<ref>[http://colourlex.com/project/infrared-spectroscopy/ Infrared spectroscopy at ColourLex.

Using this approach, samples are pressed against the face of a single crystal. The infrared radiation passes through the crystal and only interacts with the sample at the interface between the two materials.\n\nWith increasing technology in computer filtering and manipulation of the results, samples in solution can now be measured accurately (water produces a broad absorbance across the range of interest, and thus renders the spectra unreadable without this computer treatment).\n\nSome instruments will also automatically tell you what substance is being measured from a store of thousands of reference spectra held in storage.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy is also useful in measuring the degree of polymerization in [[polymer]] manufacture. Changes in the character or quantity of a particular bond are assessed by measuring at a specific frequency over time. Modern research instruments can take infrared measurements across the range of interest as frequently as 32 times a second. This can be done whilst simultaneous measurements are made using other techniques. This makes the observations of chemical reactions and processes quicker and more accurate.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy has also been successfully utilized in the field of semiconductor microelectronics:<ref>{{cite book |last= Lau|first= W.S. |title= Infrared characterization for microelectronics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rotNlJDFJWsC&printsec=frontcover |publisher= World Scientific |date= 1999 |isbn=981-02-2352-8}}</ref> for example, infrared spectroscopy can be applied to semiconductors like [[silicon]], [[gallium arsenide]], [[gallium nitride]], [[zinc selenide]], amorphous silicon, [[silicon nitride]], etc.\n\nAnother important application of Infrared Spectroscopy is in the [[food]] industry to measure the [[concentration]] of various compounds in different food products<ref>{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Brian G.|title=Near-Infrared Spectroscopy in Food Analysis|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470027318.a1018/abstract;jsessionid=D750E27B720BC1196422CA9868326D53.f02t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Villar|first1=A.|last2=Gorritxategi|first2=E.|last3=Aranzabe|first3=E.|last4=Fernandez|first4=S.|last5=Otaduy|first5=D.|last6=Fernandez|first6=L.A.|title=Low-cost visible\u2013near infrared sensor for on-line monitoring of fat and fatty acids content during the manufacturing process of the milk|journal=Food Chemistry|date=2012|volume=135|issue=4|pages=2756\u20132760|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.07.074}}</ref>\n\nThe instruments are now small, and can be transported, even for use in field trials.\n\nInfrared Spectroscopy is also used in gas leak detection devices such as the DP-IR and EyeCGAs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heathus.com/product_category/gas/infrared-ir-optical-based/|title=Infrared (IR) / Optical Based Archives - Heath Consultants|last=www.TRMThemes.com|first=TRM Theme by|website=Heath Consultants|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}</ref> These devices detect hydrocarbon gas leaks in the transportation of natural gas and crude oil.\n\nIn February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database], based on IR spectroscopy, for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the [[universe]].

In some systems, such as silicon and germanium, the decay of the anti-symmetric stretch mode of interstitial oxygen involves the symmetric stretch mode with a strong isotope dependence. For example, it was shown that for a natural silicon sample, the lifetime of the anti-symmetric vibration is 11.4 ps. When the isotope of one of the silicon atoms is increased to <sup>29</sup>Si, the lifetime increases to 19 ps. In similar manner, when the silicon atom is changed to <sup>30</sup>Si, the lifetime becomes 27 ps.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.225503|title=Isotope Dependence of the Lifetime of the 1136-cm-1 Vibration of Oxygen in Silicon|date=2006|last1=Kohli|first1=K.|last2=Davies|first2=Gordon|last3=Vinh|first3=N.|last4=West|first4=D.|last5=Estreicher|first5=S.|last6=Gregorkiewicz|first6=T.|last7=Izeddin|first7=I.|last8=Itoh|first8=K.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=96|pages=225503|pmid=16803320|issue=22|bibcode=2006PhRvL..96v5503K}}</ref>\n\n==Two-dimensional IR==\n'''Two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy analysis''' combines multiple samples of infrared spectra to reveal more complex properties.

Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy is a technique that has become available with the development of [[femtosecond]] infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency \u03c9<sub>1</sub> that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency \u03c9<sub>3</sub> excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, it can be used to monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.\n\nAs with two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance ([[2DNMR]]) spectroscopy, this technique spreads the spectrum in two dimensions and allows for the observation of cross peaks that contain information on the coupling between different modes. In contrast to 2DNMR, nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy also involves the excitation to overtones. These excitations result in excited state absorption peaks located below the diagonal and cross peaks. In 2DNMR, two distinct techniques, [[Correlation spectroscopy#COSY|COSY]] and [[Correlation spectroscopy#NOESY|NOESY]], are frequently used. The cross peaks in the first are related to the scalar coupling, while in the latter they are related to the spin transfer between different nuclei. In nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, analogs have been drawn to these 2DNMR techniques. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with zero waiting time corresponds to COSY, and nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with finite waiting time allowing vibrational population transfer corresponds to NOESY. The COSY variant of nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has been used for determination of the secondary structure content of proteins.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=N.

This is the evidence used to assume that Irenaeus was born in Smyrna during the 130s\u2013140s.</ref> Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was brought up in a [[Christian]] family rather than converting as an adult.\n\nDuring the persecution of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the [[Roman Emperor]] from 161\u2013180, Irenaeus was a priest of the Church of Lyon. The clergy of that city, many of whom were suffering imprisonment for the faith, sent him in 177 to Rome with a letter to [[Pope Eleutherius]] concerning the heresy [[Montanism]], and that occasion bore emphatic testimony to his merits. While Irenaeus was in Rome, a persecution took place in Lyon. Returning to Gaul, Irenaeus succeeded the [[martyr]] [[Saint Pothinus]] and became the second [[Bishop of Lyon]].<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.4.1</ref>\n\nDuring the religious peace which followed the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain). Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism. The most famous of these writings is ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies''). Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may have taken place in Asia Minor or in Rome.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', 1.pr.2, 4.pr.2</ref> However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of '[[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus the Magician]]' living and teaching in the [[Rhone valley]].<ref>Against Heresies 1.13.7</ref>\n\nLittle is known about the career of Irenaeus after he became bishop. The last action reported of him (by [[Eusebius]], 150 years later) is that in 190 or 191, he exerted influence on [[Pope Victor I]] not to excommunicate the Christian communities of Asia Minor which persevered in the practice of the [[Quartodeciman]] celebration of [[Easter]].<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.24.1ff</ref>\n\nNothing is known of the date of his death, which must have occurred at the end of the 2nd or the beginning of the 3rd century. A few within the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church celebrate him as a martyr.<ref>[[Gregory of Tours]] is the first to mention a tradition which held Irenaeus to be a martyr</ref>  He was buried under the Church of Saint John in Lyon, which was later renamed St Irenaeus in his honour. The tomb and his remains were utterly destroyed in 1562 by the [[Huguenots]].\n\n==Writings==\nIrenaeus wrote a number of books, but the most important that survives is the ''Against Heresies'' (or, in its [[Latin language|Latin]] title, ''Adversus haereses'').  In Book I, Irenaeus talks about the Valentinian Gnostics and their predecessors, who he says go as far back as the magician [[Simon Magus]].  In Book II he attempts to provide proof that [[Valentinianism]] contains no merit in terms of its doctrines.  In Book III Irenaeus purports to show that these doctrines are false, by providing counter-evidence gleaned from the [[Gospel]]s.  Book IV consists of Jesus' sayings, and here Irenaeus also stresses the unity of the Old Testament and the Gospel.  In the final volume, Book V, Irenaeus focuses on more sayings of Jesus plus the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]].<ref>Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 6. Routledge 1997.</ref>\n\n[[File:POxy405.jpg|thumb|right|Cambridge University library manuscript 4113 / Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 405.  Irenaeus. Ca. 200 AD.]]The purpose of \"Against Heresies\" was to refute the teachings of various Gnostic groups; apparently, several Greek merchants had begun an oratorial campaign in Irenaeus' bishopric, teaching that the material world was the accidental creation of an evil god, from which we are to escape by the pursuit of ''gnosis''.  Irenaeus argued that the true gnosis is in fact knowledge of Christ, which redeems rather than escapes from bodily existence.<ref>source needed</ref>\n\nUntil the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Library of Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, ''Against Heresies'' was the best-surviving description of Gnosticism. Some religious scholars have argued the findings at Nag Hammadi have shown Irenaeus' description of Gnosticism to be inaccurate and polemic in nature.<ref>Pagels, Elaine. ''Beyond Belief'', Pan Books, 2005. p. 54</ref>  However, the general consensus among modern scholars is that Irenaeus was fairly accurate in his transmission of Gnostic beliefs, and that the Nag Hammadi texts have raised no substantial challenges to the overall accuracy of Irenaeus' information.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orthodoxy and Heresy in Early Christian Contexts: Reconsidering the Bauer Thesis|last=Hartog|first=Paul A.|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-61097-504-9|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=199, 200}}</ref>  Religious historian Elaine Pagels criticizes Irenaeus for describing Gnostic groups as sexual libertines, for example, when some of their own writings advocated chastity more strongly than did orthodox texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gnostc Gospels|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=90}}</ref> However, the Nag Hammadi texts do not present a single, coherent picture of any unified Gnostc system of belief, but rather divergent beliefs of multiple Gnostic sects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lost Christianities|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-518249-1|location=Oxford|pages=122}}</ref> Some of these sects were indeed libertine because they considered bodily existence meaningless; others praised chastity, and strongly prohibited any sexual activity, even within marriage.<ref>Stark, Rodney.

The Christians of Asia Minor preferred the Gospel of John. The Gospel of Matthew was the most popular overall.<ref name =\"Harris\">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]],'' Understanding the Bible'' (Palo Alto: Mayfield, 1985)</ref> Irenaeus asserted that four Gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], were canonical scripture.<ref>\"But it is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church has been scattered throughout the world, and since the 'pillar and ground' of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life, it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing incorruption on every side, and vivifying human afresh. From this fact, it is evident that the Logos, the fashioner ''[[demiurge|demiourgos]]'' of all, he that sits on the cherubim and holds all things together, when he was manifested to humanity, gave us the gospel under four forms but bound together by one spirit.\" Against Heresies 3.11.8</ref> Thus Irenaeus provides the earliest witness to the assertion of the four canonical Gospels, possibly in reaction to [[Marcion]]'s edited version of the Gospel of Luke, which Marcion asserted was the one and only true gospel.<ref name=\"amazon.com\"/><ref name=Davis/>\n\nBased on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the ''fourfold Gospel'' must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus' time.<ref>McDonald & Sanders, ''The Canon Debate'', 2002, p. 277</ref> ''Against Heresies'' 3.11.7 acknowledges that many heterodox Christians use only one gospel while 3.11.9 acknowledges that some use more than four.<ref>McDonald & Sanders, p. 280.

About one third of his citations are made to Paul's letters.  Irenaeus considered all 13 letters belonging to the Pauline corpus to have been written by Paul himself.<ref>Blackwell, Ben C.

For it is a matter of necessity that every Church should agree with this Church, on account of its pre- eminent authority, that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere.\"[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm read online Adversus Haereses (Book III, Chapter 3)]</ref>\n\nWith the lists of bishops to which Irenaeus referred, the doctrine of the apostolic succession, firmly established in the Church at this time, of the bishops could be linked.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"/> This succession was important to establish a chain of custody for orthodoxy.  He felt it important, however, also to speak of a succession of elders (presbyters).<ref>''Against Heresies'', IV.26.2.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus' point when refuting the Gnostics was that all of the Apostolic churches had preserved the same traditions and teachings in many independent streams. It was the unanimous agreement between these many independent streams of transmission that proved the orthodox Faith, current in those churches, to be true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103433.htm|title=Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 33:8)|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Irenaeus' theology and contrast with Gnosticism==\nThe central point of Irenaeus' [[theology]] is the unity and the goodness of [[God]], in opposition to the Gnostics' theory of God; a number of divine emanations [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|(Aeons)]] along with a distinction between the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] and the [[Demiurge]]. Irenaeus uses the [[Logos]] theology he inherited from [[Justin Martyr]]. Irenaeus was a student of [[Polycarp]], who was said to have been tutored by [[John the Apostle]].<ref name=p368 /> (John had used Logos terminology in the [[Gospel of John]] and the letter of [[1 John]]). Irenaeus prefers to speak of the Son and the Spirit as the \"hands of God\".\n\n=== The Unity of Salvation History ===\nIrenaeus' emphasis on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding emphasis on the unity of [[salvation]] history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened is part of his plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures to take a long time to grow into or assume the divine likeness.\n\nEverything that has happened since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed [[Jonah]]: it was only in the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as [[evil]]s, but without them we could never come to know God.\n\nAccording to Irenaeus, the high point in salvation history is the advent of [[Jesus]]. For Irenaeus, the Incarnation of [[Christ]] was intended by God before He determined that humanity would be created.  Irenaeus develops this idea based on [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A14&version=NRSVCE Rom. 5:14], saying \"Forinasmuch as He had a pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should not exist in vain.\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.22.3.</ref> Some theologians maintain that Irenaeus believed that Incarnation would have occurred even if humanity had never sinned; but the fact that they did [[sin]] determined his role as the [[wiktionary:savior|savior]].<ref>J.B.

Irenaeus is the first to draw comparisons between [[Eve]] and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], contrasting the faithlessness of the former with the faithfulness of the latter. In addition to reversing the wrongs done by Adam, Irenaeus thinks of Christ as \"recapitulating\" or \"summing up\" human life.<ref>AH 3.18.7; 3.21.9\u201310; 3.22.3; 5.21.1; see also, Klager, Andrew P. \"Retaining and Reclaiming the Divine: Identification and the Recapitulation of Peace in St. Irenaeus of Lyons' Atonement Narrative,\" ''Stricken by God? Nonviolent Identification and the Victory of Christ'', eds. Brad Jersak and Michael Hardin. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007), esp. p. 462 n. 158.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus conceives of our salvation as essentially coming about through the [[incarnation]] of God as a man. He characterizes the penalty for sin as death and [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]]. God, however, is [[Immortality|immortal]] and incorruptible, and simply by becoming united to human nature in Christ he conveys those qualities to us: they spread, as it were, like a benign infection.<ref>M David Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange: Irenaeus and Eastern Valentinians on the Soteriology of Interchange,\" ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' p. 324-25.</ref> Irenaeus emphasizes that salvation occurs through Christ's Incarnation, which bestows incorruptibility on humanity, rather than emphasizing His Redemptive death in the [[crucifixion]], although the latter event is an integral part of the former.<ref>Andrew J. Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: A Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus,\" ''Calvin Theological Journal'' 5 (1970): pp. 47, 57.</ref>\n\n==== Christ's Life ====\nPart of the process of recapitulation is for Christ to go through every stage of human life, from infancy to old age, and simply by living it, sanctify it with his divinity. Although it is sometimes claimed that Irenaeus believed Christ did not die until he was older than is conventionally portrayed, the bishop of Lyon simply pointed out that because Jesus turned the permissible age for becoming a rabbi (30 years old and above), he recapitulated and sanctified the period between 30 and 50 years old, as per the Jewish custom of periodization on life, and so touches the beginning of old age when one becomes 50 years old. (see [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis#Main arguments|Adversus Haereses, book II, chapter 22]]).\n\nIn the passage of ''Adversus Haereses'' under consideration, Irenaeus is clear that after receiving baptism at the age of thirty, citing Luke 3:23, Gnostics then falsely assert that \"He [Jesus] preached only one year reckoning from His baptism,\" and also, \"On completing His thirtieth year He [Jesus] suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age.\" Irenaeus argues against the Gnostics by using scripture to add several years after his baptism by referencing 3 distinctly separate visits to Jerusalem.  The first is when Jesus makes wine out of water, He goes up to the Paschal feast-day, after which He withdraws and is found in Samaria. The second is when Jesus goes up to Jerusalem for Passover and cures the paralytic, after which He withdraws over the sea of Tiberias. The third mention is when He travels to Jerusalem, eats the Passover, and suffers on the following day.<ref name=\"A.H. 2.22.5\">A.H. 2.22.5</ref>\n\nIrenaeus quotes scripture, which we reference as John 8:57, to suggest that Jesus ministers while in his 40's. In this passage, Jesus' opponents want to argue that Jesus has not seen Abraham, because Jesus is too young. Jesus' opponents argue that Jesus is not yet 50 years old. Irenaeus argues that if Jesus was in his thirties, his opponents would've argued that He's not yet 40 years, since that would make Him even younger.  Irenaeus' argument is that they would not weaken their own argument by adding years to Jesus' age. Irenaeus also writes that \"The Elders witness to this, who in Asia conferred with John the Lord's disciple, to the effect that John had delivered these things unto them: for he abode with them until the times of Trajan.  And some of them saw not only John, but others also of the Apostles, and had this same account from them, and witness to the aforesaid relation.\"<ref name=\"A.H. 2.22.5\"/>\n\nIn Demonstration (74) Irenaeus notes \"For [[Pontius Pilate]] was governor of [[Judea (Roman province)|Jud\u00e6a]], and he had at that time resentful enmity against [[Herod Antipas|Herod the king of the Jews]]. But then, when Christ was brought to him bound, Pilate sent Him to Herod, giving command to enquire of him, that he might know of a certainty what he should desire concerning Him; making Christ a convenient occasion of reconciliation with the king.\"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html Irenaeus, ''Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching'' \u00a777]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504002038/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html |date=May 4, 2011 }}</ref> Pilate was the [[Prefect#Prefects as provincial governors|prefect]] of the Roman province of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] from AD 26\u201336.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460341/Pontius-Pilate |title=Britannica Online: Pontius Pilate |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/jo-jz/judaea/judaea.htm |title=Judaea |publisher=Livius.org |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> He served under Emperor [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius Nero]].

Irenaeus first brings up the theme of victory over sin and evil that is afforded by Jesus\u2019s death. God\u2019s intervention has saved humanity from the Fall of Adam and the wickedness of Satan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bandstra|first1=Andrew|title=Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: a Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus|journal=Calvin Theological Journal|date=April 1, 1970|volume=5|issue=1|page=48}}</ref> Human nature has become joined with God\u2019s in the person of Jesus, thus allowing human nature to have victory over sin.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7</ref> Paul writes on the same theme, that Christ has come so that a new order is formed, and being under the Law, is being under the sin of Adam [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&version=NRSV Rom. 6:14], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal+5%3A18&version=NRSV Gal. 5:18].\n\nReconciliation is also a theme of Paul\u2019s that Irenaeus stresses in his teachings on Salvation. Irenaeus believes Jesus coming in flesh and blood sanctified humanity so that it might again reflect the perfection associated with the likeness of the Divine. This perfection leads to a new life, in the lineage of God, which is forever striving for eternal life and unity with the Father.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1</ref><ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.19.1</ref> This is a carryover from Paul, who attributes this reconciliation to the actions of Christ: \u201cFor since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ\u201d [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+15%3A21-2&version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:21-2].\n\nA third theme in both Paul\u2019s and Irenaeus\u2019s conceptions of salvation is the sacrifice of Christ being necessary for the new life given to humanity in the triumph over evil. It is in this obedient sacrifice that Jesus is victor and reconciler, thus erasing the marks that Adam left on human nature. To argue against the Gnostics on this point, Irenaeus uses Colossians [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col+2%3A13-4&version=NRSV Col. 2:13-4] in showing that the debt which came by a tree has been paid for us in another tree. Furthermore, the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A7&version=NRSV first chapter of Ephesians] is picked up in Irenaeus's discussion of the topic when he asserts, \u201cBy His own selfishness He has lied to us, as also His apostle declares, and \u2018In whom we have been manipulated and lied to, even the existence of sins.\u2019\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.2.2</ref>\n\nIrenaeus does not simply parrot back the message of Paul in his understanding of salvation. One of the major changes that Irenaeus makes is when the [[Parousia]] will occur.  Paul states that he believes that it was going to happen soon, probably in his own lifetime [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thess+4%3A15&version=NRSV 1 Thess. 4:15] [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+15%3A51-2&version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:51-2]. However, the end times does not happen immediately and Christians begin to worry and have doubts about the faith. For Irenaeus, sin is seen as haste, just as Adam and Eve quickly ate from the tree of knowledge as they pleased. On the other hand, redemption restored to humanity through the Christ's submission to God\u2019s will. Thus, the salvation of man will also be restored to the original trajectory controlled by God forfeited in humanity's sinful in haste.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Jeff|title=The Haste of Sin, the Slowness of Salvation: An Interpretation of Irenaeus on the Fall and Redemption|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=Summer 2007|volume=89|issue=3|page=444}}</ref> This rather slower version of salvation is not something that Irenaeus received from Paul, but was a necessary construct given the delay of the second coming of Jesus.\n\n==== Christ as the New Adam ====\nTo counter his Gnostic opponents, Irenaeus significantly develops Paul's presentation of Christ as the [[Last Adam]].\n\nIrenaeus' presentation of Christ as the New Adam is based on Paul's Christ-Adam parallel in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A12-5%3A21&version=RSVCE Romans 5:12\u201321].  Irenaeus uses this parallel to demonstrate that Christ truly took human flesh.  Irenaeus consideres it important to emphasize this point because he understands the failure to recognize Christ's full humanity the bond linking the various strains of Gnosticism together, as seen in his statement that \"according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was the Word of God made flesh.\" <ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.11.3.</ref>  Irenaeus believes that unless the Word became flesh, humans were not fully redeemed.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 312-13.</ref> He explains that by becoming man, Christ restored humanity to being in the image and likeness of God, which they had lost in the [[Fall of man]] <ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1.</ref><ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.2.</ref>  Just as Adam was the original head of humanity through whom all sinned, Christ is the new head of humanity who fulfills Adam's role in the [[Economy of Salvation]].<ref>Nielsen, ''Adam and Christ in the Theology of Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 11.</ref>  Irenaeus calls this process of restoring humanity recapitulation.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.2.</ref>\n\nFor Irenaeus, Paul's presentation of the Old Law (the [[Mosaic covenant]]) in this passage indicates that the Old Law revealed humanity's sinfulness but could not save them.  He explains that \"For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.</ref>  Since humans have a physical nature, they cannot be saved by a spiritual law.  Instead, they need a human Savior.  This is why it was necessary for Christ to take human flesh.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Irenaeus summarizes how Christ's taking human flesh saves humanity with a statement that closely resembles [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+5%3A19&version=RSVCE Romans 5:19], \"For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation.\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.</ref>  The physical creation of Adam and Christ is emphasized by Irenaeus to demonstrate how the Incarnation saves humanity's physical nature.<ref>Dominic J. Unger and Irenaeus M.C. Steenberg trans. ''St Irenaeus of Lyons: Against the Heresies III'', Ancient Christian Writers: The Works of the Fathers in Translation (New York: The Newman Press, 2012), p. 176-77, endnote 48.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus emphasizes the importance of Christ's reversal of Adams's action. Through His obedience, Christ undoes Adam's disobedience.<ref>Andrew J. Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter,\" p. 50.</ref>  Irenaeus presents the Passion as the climax of Christ's obedience, emphasizing how this obedience on the tree of the Cross [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil+2%3A8&version=RSVCE Phil. 2:8] undoes the disobedience that occurred through a tree [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A17&version=RSVCE Gen. 3:17].<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.3.</ref>\nIrenaeus' interpretation of Paul's discussion of Christ as the New Adam is significant because it helped develop the [[Recapitulation theory of atonement]]. Irenaeus emphasizes that it is through Christ's reversal of Adam's action that humanity is saved, rather than considering the Redemption to occur in a cultic or juridical way.<ref>Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter,\" p. 61.</ref><ref>For other theories of atonement see [[Atonement in Christianity]].</ref>\n\nThe biblical passage, \u201cDeath has been swallowed up in victory\u201d ({{bibleref|1 Cor|15:54}}), implied for Irenaeus that the Lord will surely resurrect the first human who died, i.e. Adam, as one of the saved. According to Irenaeus, those who deny Adam\u2018s salvation are \u201cshutting themselves out from life for ever\u201d and the first one who did so was [[Tatian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103323.htm|title=Irenaeus, Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 23)|publisher=paragraph 7.-8. |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> The notion that the [[Last Adam|Second Adam]] saved the first Adam was advocated not only by Irenaeus, but also by [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0610.htm|title=Gregory Thaumaturgus, On All the Saints|publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> which suggests that it was popular in [[Early Christianity|the Early Church]].\n\n=== Valentinian Gnosticism ===\nValentinian Gnosticism was one of the major forms of Gnosticism that Irenaeus opposed.\n\nAccording to the Gnostic view of Salvation, creation was perfect to begin with; it did not need time to grow and mature. For the Valentinians, the material world is the result of the loss of perfection which resulted from [[Sophia (wisdom)#Valentinus|Sophia's]] desire to understand the Forefather. Therefore, one is ultimately redeemed, through secret knowledge, to enter the [[pleroma]] of which the Achamoth originally fell.\n\nAccording to the Valentinian Gnostics, there are three classes of human beings. They are the material, who cannot attain salvation; the psychic, who are strengthened by works and faith (they are part of the church); and the spiritual, who cannot decay or be harmed by material actions.<ref>Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'' (Routledge, 1997), p. 23.</ref>\nEssentially, ordinary humans\u2014those who have faith but do not possess the special knowledge\u2014will not attain salvation. Spirituals, on the other hand\u2014those who obtain this great gift\u2014are the only class that will eventually attain salvation.\n\nIn his article entitled ''\"The Demiurge,\"'' J.P. Arendzen sums up the Valentinian view of the salvation of man. He writes, \"The first, or carnal men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or psychic men, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (pleroma) nor hell (whyle); the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the pleroma divested of body (h\u00fale) and soul (psuch\u00e9).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Demiurge|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn this understanding of salvation, the purpose of the Incarnation was to redeem the Spirituals from their material bodies.  By taking a material body, the Son becomes the Savior and facilitates this entrance into the pleroma by making it possible for the Spirituals to receive his spiritual body.  However, in becoming a body and soul, the Son Himself becomes one of those needing redemption.  Therefore, the Word descends onto the Savior at His Baptism in the Jordan, which liberates the Son from his corruptible body and soul.  His redemption from the body and soul is then applied to the Spirituals.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 316-17.</ref>  In response to this Gnostic view of Christ, Irenaeus emphasized that the Word became flesh and developed a soteriology that emphasized the significance of Christ's material Body in saving humanity, as discussed in the sections above.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 313-16.</ref>\n\nIn his criticism of Gnosticism, Irenaeus made reference to a Gnostic gospel which portrayed [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] in a positive light, as having acted in accordance with Jesus' instructions. The recently discovered [[Gospel of Judas]] dates close to the period when Irenaeus lived (late 2nd century), and scholars typically regard this work as one of many Gnostic texts, showing one of many varieties of Gnostic beliefs of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyanglicans.net/images/uploads/indepth/A_Spectators_Guide_to_the_Gospel_of_Judas.pdf|title=A Spectators Guide to the Gospel of Judas|format=PDF|author=Dr. John Dickson|publisher=Sydneyanglicans.net|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Irenaeus' Mariology==\nIrenaeus of Lyon is perhaps the earliest of the Church Fathers to develop a thorough [[Mariology]]. It is certain that, while still very young, Irenaeus had seen and heard Bishop [[Polycarp]] (d. 155) at Smyrna.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Irenaeus sets out a forthright account of Mary's role in the economy of salvation, presenting Mary as New Eve whose obedience in the Annunciation counters Eve's disobedience.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.22.4</ref> He states, \"even though Eve had Adam for a husband, she was still a virgin... By disobeying, Eve became the cause of death for herself and for the whole human race. In the same way Mary, though she had a husband, was still a virgin, and by obeying, she became the cause of salvation for herself and for the whole human race.<ref>Irenaeus of Lyon, ''Adversus haereses'' 3.22.4</ref>\n\nThis presentation of Mary as the New Eve is an extension of Irenaeus' Adam-Christ typology.  Just as Christ undoes Adam's disobedience, Mary undoes Eve's disobedience.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies,'' III.22.4.</ref>  His emphasis on the role of Mary helps Irenaeus counter Christologies along the lines of [[Docetism]] and [[Adoptionism]].<ref>M.C. Steenberg, \"The Role of Mary as Co-Recapitulator in St. Irenaeus of Lyons,\" ''Vigilae Christianae'' 58 (2004): 124\u201325.</ref>  His emphasis on Mary's role in the economy of salvation further demonstrates how God transforms the material world through the Incarnation, which was an important part of Irenaeus' conflict with the Gnostics.<ref>Steenberg, \"The Role of Mary as Co-Recapitulator,\" 119-20.</ref>\n\nLike Ireneaus, Tertullian describes how Christ's Virgin birth parallels Adam's creation from virgin earth.  Tertullian also discusses how it was necessary for God to be born of a Virgin so that what was lost through a woman would be saved through a woman.<ref>Tertullian, ''De Carne Christi'', 17</ref>  This indicates that the concept of Mary as the New Eve was known in both the Eastern and Western Church during the second and third centuries.<ref>Luigi Gambero, ''Mary and the Fathers of the Church: The Blessed Virgin Mary in Patristic Thought,''trans. Thomas Buffer (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1999), p. 66.</ref>\n\n[[Pope Pius IX]] made reference to this theme of Irenaeus, in the 1854 [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', which defined the [[dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception.<ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9ineff.htm ''Ineffabilis Deus''] Papal Encyclicals Online.

Rome, the fourth prophetic kingdom, would end in a tenfold partition. The ten divisions of the empire are the \"ten horns\" of Daniel 7 and the \"ten horns\" in Revelation 17. A \"little horn,\" which was to supplant three of Rome's ten divisions, was also the still future \"eighth\" in Revelation. Irenaeus concluded with the destruction of all kingdoms at the [[Second Coming|Second Advent]], when Christ, the prophesied \"stone,\" cut out of the mountain without hands, smote the image after Rome's division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103526.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 26|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=245}}\n\n===Antichrist===\n{{see also|References to the Antichrist in ecclesiastical writings#Early Church}}\nIrenaeus identified the [[Antichrist]], another name of the apostate [[Man of Sin]], with [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]'s Little Horn and [[John the Apostle|John]]'s [[Beast of Revelation]] 13.

Hence, he applies Biblical and traditional ideas to his descriptions of this earth during the millennium, throughout the closing chapters of Book 5. This conception of the reign of resurrected and translated saints with Christ on this earth during the millennium-popularly known as chiliasm\u2014was the increasingly prevailing belief of this time.

Commitment proceedings often follow a period of emergency hospitalization, during which an individual with acute psychiatric symptoms is confined for a relatively short duration (e.g. 72 hours) in a treatment facility for evaluation and stabilization by mental health professionals\u2014who may then determine whether further civil commitment is appropriate or necessary.

Intermolecular forces are weak relative to [[intramolecular force]]s \u2013 the forces which hold a molecule together. For example, the [[covalent bond]], involving sharing electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] frequently used in [[molecular mechanics]].\n\nThe investigation of intermolecular forces starts from macroscopic observations which indicate the existence and action of forces at a molecular level. These observations include non-ideal-gas thermodynamic behavior reflected by [[virial coefficient]]s, [[vapor pressure]], [[viscosity]], superficial tension, and absorption data.\n\nThe first reference to the nature of microscopic forces is found in [[Alexis Clairaut]]'s work ''Theorie de la Figure de la Terre''.<ref>Margenau, H. and Kestner, N. (1969) ''Theory of inter-molecular forces'', International Series of Monographs in Natural Philosophy, Pergamon Press, {{ISBN|1483119289}}</ref> Other scientists who have contributed to the investigation of microscopic forces include: [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[J.

The link to microscopic aspects is given by [[virial coefficient]]s and [[Lennard-Jones potential]]s.\n\n==Hydrogen bonding==\n{{Main|Hydrogen bond}}\n\nA ''hydrogen bond'' is the attraction between the lone pair of an [[electronegative]] atom and a [[hydrogen]] atom that is bonded to either [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], or [[fluorine]].<ref name=GoldBook-H02899>{{GoldBookRef |file= H02899 |title= hydrogen bond}}</ref> The hydrogen bond is often described as a strong electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction.

An example of a dipole\u2013dipole interaction can be seen in [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl): the positive end of a polar molecule will attract the negative end of the other molecule and influence its position. Polar molecules have a net attraction between them. Examples of polar molecules include hydrogen chloride (HCl) and [[chloroform]] (CHCl<sub>3</sub>).\n\n:{{Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D}}\n\nOften molecules contain dipolar groups, but have no overall [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]]. This occurs if there is symmetry within the molecule that causes the dipoles to cancel each other out. This occurs in molecules such as [[tetrachloromethane]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. The dipole-dipole interaction between two individual atoms is usually zero, since atoms rarely carry a permanent dipole.These forces are discussed further in the section about the Keesom interaction, below.\n\n===Ion\u2013dipole and ion-induced dipole forces===\n\nIon-dipole and ion-induced dipole forces are similar to dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole interactions but involve ions, instead of only polar and non-polar molecules. Ion-dipole and ion-induced dipole forces are stronger than dipole-dipole interactions because the charge of any ion is much greater than the charge of a dipole moment. Ion-dipole bonding is stronger than hydrogen bonding.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chemistry: A Molecular Approach|last=Tro|first=Nivaldo|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|year=2011|isbn=978-0-321-65178-5|location=United States|pages=466}}</ref>\n\nAn ion\u2013dipole force consists of an ion and a polar molecule interacting.

It is termed ''Keesom interactions'', named after [[Willem Hendrik Keesom]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Keesom, W.

It is assumed that the molecules are constantly rotating and never get locked into place. This is a good assumption, but at some point molecules do get locked into place. The energy of a Keesom interaction depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance, unlike the interaction energy of two spatially fixed dipoles, which depends on the inverse third power of the distance. The Keesom interaction can only occur among molecules that possess permanent dipole moments, i.e., two polar molecules. Also Keesom interactions are very weak van der Waals interactions and do not occur in aqueous solutions that contain electrolytes. The angle averaged interaction is given by the following equation:\n\n:<math>\\frac{-m_1^2 m_2^2}{24\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0^2 \\varepsilon_r^2 k_\\text{B} T r^6} = V,</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' = dipole moment, <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> = permitivity of free space, <math>\\varepsilon_r</math> = dielectric constant of surrounding material, ''T'' = temperature, <math>k_\\text{B}</math> = Boltzmann constant, and ''r'' = distance between molecules.\n\n===Debye (permanent\u2013induced dipoles) force===\nThe second contribution is the induction (also termed polarization) or Debye force, arising from interactions between rotating permanent dipoles and from the polarizability of atoms and molecules (induced dipoles). These induced dipoles occur when one molecule with a permanent dipole repels another molecule\u2019s electrons. A molecule with permanent dipole can induce a dipole in a similar neighboring molecule and cause mutual attraction. Debye forces cannot occur between atoms. The forces between induced and permanent dipoles are not as temperature dependent as Keesom interactions because the induced dipole is free to shift and rotate around the non-polar molecule. The Debye induction effects and Keesom orientation effects are termed polar interactions.<ref name=j1/>\n\nThe induced dipole forces appear from the induction (also termed [[Dipolar polarization|polarization]]), which is the attractive interaction between a permanent multipole on one molecule with an induced (by the former di/multi-pole) multipole on another.<ref name=Blustin-1978>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1007/BF00577166 |title= A Floating Gaussian Orbital calculation on argon hydrochloride (Ar\u00b7HCl) |journal= Theoretica Chimica Acta |volume= 47 |issue= 3 |pages= 249 |year= 1978 |last1= Blustin |first1= P.

Debye]].\n\nOne example of an induction interaction between permanent dipole and induced dipole is the interaction between HCl and Ar. In this system, Ar experiences a dipole as its electrons are attracted (to the H side of HCl) or repelled (from the Cl side) by HCl.<ref name=Blustin-1978/><ref name=Roberts-Orr-1938/> The angle averaged interaction is given by the following equation:\n\n:<math>\\frac{-m_1^2 \\alpha_2}{16\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0^2 \\varepsilon_r^2 r^6} = V,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> = polarizability.\n\nThis kind of interaction can be expected between any polar molecule and non-polar/symmetrical molecule. The induction-interaction force is far weaker than dipole\u2013dipole interaction, but stronger than the [[London dispersion force]].\n\n===London dispersion force (fluctuating dipole-induced dipole interaction)===\n{{Main|London dispersion force}}\n\nThe third and dominant contribution is the dispersion or London force (fluctuating dipole-induced dipole), which arises due to the non-zero instantaneous dipole moments of all atoms and molecules. Such polarization can be induced either by a polar molecule or by the repulsion of negatively charged electron clouds in non-polar molecules. Thus, London interactions are caused by random fluctuations of electron density in an electron cloud.  An atom with a large number of electrons will have a greater associated London force than an atom with fewer electrons. The dispersion (London) force is the most important component because all materials are polarizable, whereas Keesom and Debye forces require permanent dipoles. The London interaction is universal and is present in atom-atom interactions as well. For various reasons, London interactions (dispersion) have been considered relevant for interactions between macroscopic bodies in condensed systems. [[Hamaker theory|Hamaker]] developed the theory of van der Waals between macroscopic bodies in 1937 and showed that the additivity of these interactions renders them considerably more long-range.<ref name=j1/>\n\n==Relative strength of forces==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Bond type\n!Dissociation energy<br />(kcal/mol)<ref name=Seyhan-Organic-Chemistry>Ege, Seyhan (2003) ''Organic Chemistry: Structure and Reactivity''.

The actual relative strengths will vary depending on the molecules involved. [[Ionic bonding]] and [[covalent bond]]ing will always be stronger than intermolecular forces in any given substance.\n\n==Effect on the behavior of gases==\n\nIntermolecular forces are repulsive at short distances and attractive at long distances (see the [[Lennard\u2013Jones potential]]). In a gas, the repulsive force chiefly has the effect of keeping two molecules from occupying the same volume. This gives a [[real gas]] a tendency to occupy a larger volume than an [[ideal gas]] at the same temperature and pressure. The attractive force draws molecules closer together and gives a real gas a tendency to occupy a smaller volume than an ideal gas. Which interaction is more important depends on temperature and pressure (see [[compressibility factor]]).\n\nIn a gas, the distances between molecules are generally large, so intermolecular forces have only a small effect. The attractive force is not overcome by the repulsive force, but by the [[thermal energy]] of the molecules. [[Thermodynamic temperature|Temperature]] is the measure of thermal energy, so increasing temperature reduces the influence of the attractive force. In contrast, the influence of the repulsive force is essentially unaffected by temperature.\n\nWhen a gas is compressed to increase its density, the influence of the attractive force increases. If the gas is made sufficiently dense, the attractions can become large enough to overcome the tendency of thermal motion to cause the molecules to disperse. Then the gas can condense to form a solid or liquid, i.e., a condensed phase. Lower temperature favors the formation of a condensed phase. In a condensed phase, there is very nearly a balance between the attractive and repulsive forces.\n\n==Quantum mechanical theories==\n\n{{Main|Quantum mechanical explanation of intermolecular interactions}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}\n\nIntermolecular forces observed between atoms and molecules can be described phenomenologically as occurring between permanent and instantaneous dipoles, as outlined above. Alternatively, one may seek a fundamental, unifying theory that is able to explain the various types of interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces and dipole-dipole interactions. Typically, this is done by applying the ideas of [[quantum mechanics]] to molecules, and Rayleigh\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger [[perturbation theory]] has been especially effective in this regard. When applied to existing [[quantum chemistry]] methods, such a [[quantum mechanical explanation of intermolecular interactions]], this provides an array of approximate methods that can be used to analyze intermolecular interactions.{{citation needed | reason = section does not cite any sources | date = November 2017}} One of the most helpful methods to visualize this kind of intermolecular interactions, that we can found in quantum chemistry, is the [[Non-covalent interactions index|non-covalent interaction index]], which is based on the electron density of the system.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Coomber's relationship]]\n* [[Force field (chemistry)]]\n* [[Hydrophobic effect]]\n* [[Intramolecular force]]\n* [[Molecular solid]]\n* [[Polymer]]\n* [[Quantum chemistry computer programs]]\n* [[van der Waals force]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Non-covalent interactions]]\n* [[Solvation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Chemical bonds}}{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Intermolecular Force}}\n[[Category:Intermolecular forces]]\n[[Category:Chemical bonding]]\n[[Category:Johannes Diderik van der Waals]]\n\n[[zh:\u5206\u5b50\u95f4\u4f5c\u7528\u529b]]", "sha1": "0ue1gyx1390z4qkvk3w684qdx4cfaji"}}, {"title": "Interatomic force", "ns": "0", "id": "15418", "redirect": {"title": "Intermolecular force"}, "revision": {"id": "528758963", "parentid": "15912892", "timestamp": "2012-12-19T06:13:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Intermolecular force]]", "sha1": "qibl6qypbwj0vcsk78hlaja8gynj7jf"}}, {"title": "IRQ", "ns": "0", "id": "15420", "revision": {"id": "647004332", "parentid": "568269236", "timestamp": "2015-02-13T21:10:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Widefox", "id": "1588193"}, "comment": "cleanup according to [[WP:MOSDAB]] (overview [[WP:DABYESNO]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wiktionary|IRQ}}\n'''IRQ''' may refer to:\n\n* [[Interrupt request]], a computer hardware signal\n* [[Iraq]] (ISO 3166-1 country code)\n* [[Qeshm Air]] (ICAO airline designator)\n\n{{disambiguation}}\n{{Short pages monitor}}<!-- This long comment was added to the page to prevent it from being listed on Special:Shortpages.

[[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], idealism manifests as a [[skepticism]] about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In contrast to [[materialism]], idealism asserts the ''primacy'' of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of material phenomena. According to this view consciousness exists ''before'' and is the pre-condition of material existence. Consciousness creates and determines the material and not vice versa. Idealism believes consciousness and mind to be the origin of the material world and aims to explain the existing world according to these principles.\n\nIdealism theories are mainly divided into two groups. [[Subjective idealism]] takes as its starting point the given fact of human consciousness seeing the existing world as a combination of sensation. [[Objective idealism]] posits the existence of an ''objective'' consciousness which exists before and, in some sense, independently of human ones. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas\u2014especially beliefs and values\u2014shape society.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=88 }}</ref> As an [[ontology|ontological]] doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.<ref name=\"Brittanica\"/> Idealism thus rejects [[physicalism|physicalist]] and [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.\n\nThe earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece.

This turn toward the [[subjective idealism|subjective]] anticipated [[empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[George Berkeley]], who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against [[materialism]]. Beginning with [[Immanuel Kant]], [[German idealism|German idealists]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] dominated 19th-century philosophy. This tradition, which emphasized the mental or \"ideal\" character of all phenomena, gave birth to idealistic and [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] schools ranging from [[British idealism]] to [[phenomenalism]] to [[existentialism]].\n\nIdealism as a philosophy came under heavy attack in [[Western world|the West]] at the turn of the 20th century.

Idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be, unlike [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], who focus on the world as it presently is. In the arts, similarly, idealism affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty, a standard of perfection, juxtaposed to aesthetic [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/idealism|title=Idealism - Define Idealism at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idealism|title=Idealism - Definition of Idealism by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAny philosophy that assigns crucial importance to the ideal or spiritual realm in its account of human existence may be termed \"idealist\". [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] idealism is an [[ontology|ontological]] doctrine that holds that reality itself is [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] or experiential at its core. Beyond this, idealists disagree on which aspects of the mental are more basic. [[Platonic idealism]] affirms that [[abstract object|abstractions]] are more basic to reality than the things we perceive, while [[subjective idealism|subjective idealists]] and [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]] tend to privilege sensory experience over abstract reasoning. [[Epistemology|Epistemological]] idealism is the view that reality can only be known through ideas, that only psychological experience can be apprehended by the mind.<ref name=\"Brittanica\">Daniel Sommer Robinson, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/281802/idealism \"Idealism\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref><ref>In ''[[On The Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer noted the ambiguity of the word ''idealism'', calling it a \"term with multiple meanings\". For Schopenhauer, idealists seek to account for the relationship between our ideas and external reality, rather than for the nature of reality as such. Non-Kantian idealists, on the other hand, theorized about mental aspects of the reality underlying phenomena.</ref><ref>Philip J. Neujahr would \"restrict the idealist label to theories which hold that the world, or its material aspects, are dependent upon the specifically cognitive activities of the mind or Mind in perceiving or thinking about (or 'experiencing') the object of its awareness.\" Philip J.

Thus Kant defines ''idealism'' as \"the assertion that we can never be certain whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining\".<ref>Immanuel Kant, Notes and Fragments, ed.

On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness.\" <ref>''Critique of Pure Reason'', A 38</ref> However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. [[Objective idealism|Objective idealists]] make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus [[Plato]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness\u2014a rejection of epistemological idealism\u2014but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism.

Hindu idealism often takes the form of [[monism]] or [[non-dualism]], espousing the view that a unitary [[consciousness]] is the essence or meaning of the [[Maya (illusion)|phenomenal reality]] and plurality.\n\nBuddhist idealism on the other hand is more epistemic and is not a metaphysical monism, which Buddhists consider eternalistic and hence not the [[middle way]] between extremes espoused by the Buddha.\n\nThe oldest reference to Idealism in Vedic texts is in [[Purusha Sukta]] of the [[Rig Veda]]. This sukta espouses [[panentheism]] by presenting cosmic being Purusha as both pervading all universe and yet being transcendent to it.<ref>Krishnananda, Swami. [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pura.html Daily Invocations]. Divine Life Society, The Purusha Sukta, Verses 4-5.</ref> Absolute idealism can be seen in [[Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad]], where things of the objective world like the [[Mah\u0101bh\u016bta|five elements]] and the subjective world such as will, hope, memory etc. are seen to be emanations from the [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Self]].<ref>Nikhilananda, Swami. The Upanishads&nbsp;\u2014 A New Translation. [http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/chandogya_upanishad.php Chhandogya Upanishad], Parts 5-8.</ref>\n\n===Indian philosophy===\nIdealist notions have been propounded by the [[Vedanta]] schools of thought, which use the Vedas, especially the [[Upanishads]] as their key texts. Idealism was opposed by dualists [[Samkhya]], the atomists [[Vaisheshika]], the logicians [[Nyaya]], the  linguists [[Mimamsa]] and the materialists [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]]. There are various sub schools of Vedanta, like [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dual), [[Vishishtadvaita]] and [[Bhedabheda]] Vedanta (difference and non-difference).\n\nThe schools of Vedanta all attempt to explain the nature and relationship of [[Brahman]] (universal soul or Self) and [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (individual self), which they see as the central topic of the Vedas. One of the earliest attempts at this was B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u0146a's [[Brahma Sutras]], which is canonical for all Vedanta sub-schools. Advaita Vedanta is a major sub school of Vedanta which holds a non-dual Idealistic metaphysics. According to Advaita thinkers like [[Adi Shankara]] (788\u2013820) and his contemporary [[Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra]], Brahman, the single unitary consciousness or absolute awareness, appears as the diversity of the world because of ''maya'' or illusion, and hence perception of plurality is ''mithya'', error. The world and all beings or souls in it have no separate existence from Brahman, universal consciousness, and the seemingly independent soul (''jiva'') is identical to Brahman. These doctrines are represented in verses such as ''brahma satyam jagan mithya; j\u012bvo brahmaiva na aparah'' (Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman). Other forms of Vedanta like the [[Vishishtadvaita]] of [[Ramanuja]] and the [[Bhedabheda]] of [[Bh\u0101skara (philosopher)|Bh\u0101skara]] are not as radical in their non-dualism, accepting that there is a certain difference between individual souls and Brahman.\n\nThe [[Yoga|Tantric]] tradition of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] has also been categorized by scholars as a form of Idealism.<ref>S. G. Dyczkowski, Mark. The Doctrine of Vibration: An Analysis of Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism. P. 51</ref> The key thinker of this tradition is the Kashmirian [[Abhinavagupta]] (975\u20131025 CE).\n\nModern Vedic Idealism was defended by the influential Indian philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] in his 1932 ''An Idealist View of Life'' and other works, which espouse [[Advaita Vedanta]]. The essence of Hindu Idealism is captured by such modern writers as [[Nisargadatta Maharaj|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]], [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[P. R. Sarkar]], and [[Sohail Inayatullah]].\n\n===Buddhist philosophy===\n[[File:Kofukuji Monastery Hosso Patriarchs of Hokuendo (Seshin) (413).jpg|thumb|Statue of Vasubandhu (jp. Seshin), [[K\u014dfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]].]]\nBuddhist views which can be said to be similar to Idealism appear in [[Mahayana]] Buddhist texts such as the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra]], [[La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra]], [[Ten Stages Sutra|Dashabhumika sutra]], etc.<ref>ernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti. Philosophy of mind in the Yogacara Buddhist idealistic school. History of Psychiatry, SAGE Publications, 2005, 16 (4), pp.453-465.</ref> These were later expanded upon by Indian Buddhist philosophers like [[Vasubandhu]], [[Asa\u1e45ga]], [[Dharmak\u012brti]], and [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]]. Yogacara thought was also promoted in China, by Chinese philosophers and translators like [[Xuanzang]].\n\nThere is a modern scholarly disagreement about whether Yogacara Buddhism can be said to be a form of idealism. As Saam Trivedi notes: \"on one side of the debate, writers such as Jay Garfield, Jeffrey Hopkins, Paul Williams, and others maintain the idealism label, while on the other side, Stefan Anacker, Dan Lusthaus, Richard King, Thomas Kochumuttom, Alex Wayman, Janice Dean Willis, and others have argued that Yogacara is not idealist.\"<ref name=\"Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231\">Trivedi, Saam; Idealism and Yogacara Buddhism.

Sean Butler upholding that Yogacara is a form of idealism, albeit its own unique type, notes the similarity of [[Category (Kant)|Kant's categories]] and Yogacara's ''[[V\u0101san\u0101]]s'', both of which are simply phenomenal tools with which the mind interprets the noumenal realm.<ref>Butler, Idealism in Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhism, 2010.</ref> Unlike Kant however who holds that the noumenon or thing-in-itself is unknowable to us, Vasubandhu holds that ultimate reality is knowable, but only through non-conceptual yogic perception of a highly trained meditative mind.<ref name=\"Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231\"/>\n\nWriters like Dan Lusthaus who hold that Yogacara is not a metaphysical idealism point out, for example, that Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers did not focus on consciousness to assert it as ontologically real, but simply to analyze how our experiences and thus our suffering is created. As Lusthaus notes: \"no Indian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra text ever claims that the world is created by mind.

Proponents include Berkeley,<ref>\" Berkeley's version of Idealism is usually referred to as Subjective Idealism or Dogmatic Idealism\" http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_idealism.html</ref> Bishop of Cloyne, an Anglo-Irish philosopher who advanced a theory he called \"[[immaterialism]],\" later referred to as \"subjective idealism\", contending that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects directly, not abstractions such as \"matter\", and that ideas also depend upon being perceived for their very existence - ''esse est percipi''; \"to be is to be perceived\".\n\n[[Arthur Collier]]<ref>''Clavis Universalis, or A New Inquiry after Truth, being a Demonstration of the NonExistence or Impossibility of an External World'' by Arthur Collier</ref> published similar assertions though there seems to have been no influence between the two contemporary writers. The only knowable reality is the represented image of an external object. Matter as a cause of that image, is unthinkable and therefore nothing to us. An external world as absolute matter unrelated to an observer does not exist as far as we are concerned. The universe cannot exist as it appears if there is no perceiving mind. Collier was influenced by ''An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World'' by [[Cambridge Platonist]] [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] (1701).\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]]'s popular book  ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'' highlights Berkeley's tautological premise for advancing idealism;\n\n:\"If we say that the things known must be in the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind's power of knowing, or we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if we mean by 'in the mind' the same as by 'before the mind', i.e. if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind. But if we mean this, we shall have to admit that what, in this sense, is in the mind, may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of knowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well as in form, and his grounds for supposing that 'idea', i.e. the objects apprehended-must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever. Hence his grounds in favour of the idealism may be dismissed.\"\n\nThe [[Australia]]n philosopher [[David Stove]] harshly criticized philosophical idealism, arguing that it rests on what he called \"the '''worst argument'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/worst.html|title=Stove's discovery of the worst argument in the world|publisher=}}</ref> Stove claims that Berkeley tried to derive a non-tautological conclusion from tautological reasoning. He argued that in Berkeley's case the [[fallacy]] is not obvious and this is because one premise is ambiguous between one meaning which is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] and another which, Stove argues, is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the conclusion.\n\n[[Alan Musgrave]]<ref>Alan Musgrave, in an article titled ''Realism and Antirealism'' in R.

The first is based on our perception of reality:\n\n:(1) ''All we have access to in perception are the contents of our own experience'' and\n\n:(2) ''The only epistemic basis for claims about the external world are our perceptual experiences''\n\ntherefore;\n\n:(3) ''The only reality we can meaningfully speak of is that of perceptual experience <ref>[[John Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' p. 172</ref>\n\nWhilst agreeing with (2) Searle argues that (1) is false and points out that (3) does not follow from (1) and (2). The second argument runs as follows;\n\n:''Premise: Any cognitive state occurs as part of a set of cognitive states and within a cognitive system''\n\n:''Conclusion 1: It is impossible to get outside all cognitive states and systems to survey the relationships between them and the reality they cognize''\n\n:''Conclusion 2: There is no cognition of any reality that exists independently of cognition<ref>[[John Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' p. 174</ref>\n\nSearle contends that ''Conclusion 2'' does not follow from the premises.\n\n[[Epistemological idealism]] is a subjectivist position in [[epistemology]] that holds that what one knows about an object exists only in one's mind.

The section ''Paralogisms of Pure Reason'' is an implicit critique of Descartes' idealism. Kant says that it is not possible to infer the 'I' as an object (Descartes' ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'') purely from \"the spontaneity of thought\". Kant focused on ideas drawn from British philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], Berkeley and [[David Hume|Hume]] but distinguished his transcendental or [[critical idealism]] from previous varieties;\n\n{{Quotation|The dictum of all genuine idealists, from the [[Eleatic]] school to Bishop Berkeley, is contained in this formula: \u201cAll knowledge through the [[senses]] and [[experience]] is nothing but sheer [[illusion]], and only in the ideas of the pure [[understanding]] and [[reason]] is there [[truth]].\u201d The principle that throughout dominates and determines my [transcendental] idealism is, on the contrary: \u201cAll knowledge of things merely from pure understanding or pure reason is nothing but sheer illusion, and only in experience is there truth.\u201d|''[[Prolegomena]]'', 374}}\n\nKant distinguished between things as they appear to an observer and things in themselves, \"that is, things considered without regard to whether and how they may be given to us\".<ref>''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 140</ref>  We cannot approach the ''[[noumenon]]'', the \"thing in Itself\" ({{lang-de|Ding an sich}}) without our own mental world. He added that the mind is not a [[blank slate]], ''tabula rasa'' but rather comes equipped with categories for organising our sense impressions.\n\nIn the first volume of his ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Schopenhauer wrote his \"Sketch of a [[History]] of the Doctrine of the [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]] and the [[The Real|Real]]\". He defined the ideal as being mental pictures that constitute subjective [[knowledge]]. The ideal, for him, is what can be attributed to our own minds. The images in our head are what comprise the ideal. Schopenhauer emphasized that we are restricted to our own [[consciousness]]. The [[world]] that appears is only a [[representation (psychology)|representation]] or mental picture of objects. We directly and immediately know only representations. All objects that are external to the mind are known indirectly through the mediation of our mind. He offered a history of the [[concept]] of the \"ideal\" as \"ideational\" or \"existing in the mind as an image\".\n\n{{Quotation|[T]rue philosophy must at all costs be ''idealistic''; indeed, it must be so merely to be honest.

Beyond this consciousness, therefore, there can be no ''immediate'' certainty ... There can never be an existence that is objective absolutely and in itself; such an existence, indeed, is positively inconceivable. For the objective, as such, always and essentially has its existence in the consciousness of a subject; it is therefore the subject's representation, and consequently is conditioned by the subject, and moreover by the subject's forms of representation, which belong to the subject and not to the object.|''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. 1}}\n\n[[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] was the first Frenchman after Nicolas Malebranche to formulate a complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the development of French thought.

So there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real. This is Schelling's \"absolute [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]\": the [[idea]]s or mental images in the mind are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind.\n\nAbsolute idealism is G. W. F. Hegel's account of how existence is comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole. Hegel called his philosophy \"absolute\" idealism in contrast to the \"subjective idealism\" of Berkeley and the \"transcendental idealism\" of Kant and Fichte,<ref>One book devoted to showing that Hegel is neither a Berkeleyan nor a Kantian idealist is Kenneth Westphal, ''Hegel's Epistemological Realism'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1989).</ref> which were not based on a critique of the finite and a dialectical philosophy of history as Hegel's idealism was. The exercise of reason and intellect enables the philosopher to know ultimate historical reality, the phenomenological constitution of self-determination, the dialectical development of self-awareness and personality in the realm of History.\n\nIn his ''Science of Logic'' (1812\u20131814) Hegel argues that finite qualities are not fully \"real\" because they depend on other finite qualities to determine them. Qualitative ''infinity'', on the other hand, would be more self-determining and hence more fully real. Similarly finite natural things are less \"real\"\u2014because they are less self-determining\u2014than spiritual things like morally responsible people, ethical communities and God. So any doctrine, such as materialism, that asserts that finite qualities or natural objects are fully real is mistaken.<ref>An interpretation of Hegel's critique of the finite, and of the \"absolute idealism\" which Hegel appears to base that critique, is found in Robert M. Wallace, Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).</ref>\n\nHegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations.<ref>See Wallace, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God'', chapter 3, for details on how Hegel might preserve something resembling Kant's dualism of nature and freedom while defending it against skeptical attack.</ref> For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all.  Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their ''conceptual'' (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical.  But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to ''Absolute'' Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\"  In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\"<ref>G. W. F. Hegel, ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', trans. A. V. Miller (Oxford: Clarendon, 1977), para. 771; cf. para. 374.</ref>  Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is ''himself'', because both subject and object are essentially Spirit.  When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes ''Absolute'' Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of [[theism]]: man becomes God.<ref>Leonard F.

Where Hegel argues that an ultimate understanding of the logical structure of the world is an understanding of the logical structure of [[God]]'s mind, Kierkegaard asserts that for God reality can be a system but it cannot be so for any human individual because both reality and humans are incomplete and all philosophical systems imply completeness. A [[logical system]] is possible but an existential system is not. \"What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational\".<ref>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'' (1821)</ref> Hegel's absolute idealism blurs the distinction between existence and thought: our mortal nature places limits on our understanding of reality;\n\n<blockquote>So-called systems have often been characterized and challenged in the assertion that they abrogate the distinction between good and evil, and destroy freedom. Perhaps one would express oneself quite as definitely, if one said that every such system fantastically dissipates the concept existence. ... Being an individual man is a thing that has been abolished, and every speculative philosopher confuses himself with humanity at large; whereby he becomes something infinitely great, and at the same time nothing at all.<ref>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'' (1846)</ref></blockquote>\n\nA major concern of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' (1807) and of the philosophy of Spirit that he lays out in his ''Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences'' (1817\u20131830) is the interrelation between individual humans, which he conceives in terms of \"mutual recognition.\" However, what Climacus means by the aforementioned statement, is that Hegel, in the ''Philosophy of Right'', believed the best solution was to surrender one's individuality to the customs of the State, identifying right and wrong in view of the prevailing bourgeois morality. Individual human will ought, at the State's highest level of development, to properly coincide with the will of the State. Climacus rejects Hegel's suppression of individuality by pointing out it is impossible to create a valid set of rules or system in any society which can adequately describe existence for any one individual. Submitting one's will to the State denies personal freedom, choice, and responsibility.\n\nIn addition, Hegel does believe we can know the structure of God's mind, or ultimate reality. Hegel agrees with Kierkegaard that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the \"logical structure\" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.\n\nBradley saw reality as a [[monism|monistic]] whole apprehended through \"feeling\", a state in which there is no distinction between the perception and the thing perceived. Like Berkeley, Bradley thought that nothing can be known to exist unless it is known by a mind.\n\n{{Quotation|We perceive, on reflection, that to be real, or even barely to exist, must be to fall within sentience ... . Find any piece of existence, take up anything that any one could possibly call a fact, or could in any sense assert to have being, and then judge if it does not consist in sentient experience. Try to discover any sense in which you can still continue to speak of it, when all perception and feeling have been removed; or point out any fragment of its matter, any aspect of its being, which is not derived from and is not still relative to this source. When the experiment is made strictly, I can myself conceive of nothing else than the experienced.|F.H. Bradley|''Appearance and Reality''|Chapter 14}}\n\nBradley was the apparent target of [[G. E. Moore]]'s radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article ''The Refutation of Idealism'' is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism ''esse est percipi'', \"to be is to be perceived\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are ''necessarily'' connected so that \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" are identical - \"to be yellow\" is \"to be experienced as yellow\". But it also seems there is a difference between \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" and \"that ''esse'' is held to be ''percipi'', solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it\". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley.\n\n===Actual idealism===\n[[Actual idealism]] is a form of idealism developed by [[Giovanni Gentile]] that grew into a \"grounded\" idealism contrasting Kant and Hegel. The idea is a version of Occam's razor; the simpler explanations are always correct. Actual idealism is the idea that reality is the ongoing act of thinking, or in Italian \"pensiero pensante\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peters, R. |year=2006 |title=On Presence: \"Actes De Presence\": Presence in Fascist Political Culture |journal=History & Theory |volume=45 |number=3 |pages=362\u2013374 |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/basic?sid=138f85e9-3bd6-470d-93cbc8aa68e8f20e%40sessionmgr4009&vid=0&hid=4104}}</ref> Any action done by humans is classified as human thought because the action was done due to predisposed thought. He further believes that thoughts are the only concept that truly exist since reality is defined through the act of thinking. This idea was derived from Gentile's paper, \"The Theory of Mind As Pure Act\".<ref name=\"rightscholarship.wordpress.com\">Right Thinkers #7: Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944). (2014, July 1).

(n.d.). Retrieved February 11, 2017, from https://www.papermasters.com/actual-idealism.html</ref> Therefore, thoughts of each person are subsumed within the state. The state is a composition of many minds that come together to change the country for better or worse.\n\nGentile theorizes that thoughts can only be conjectured within the bounds of known reality; abstract thinking does not exist.<ref name=\"rightscholarship.wordpress.com\"/> Thoughts cannot be formed outside our known reality because we are the reality that halt ourselves from thinking externally. With accordance to \"The Act of Thought of Pure Thought\", our actions comprise our thoughts, our thoughts create perception, perceptions define reality, thus we think within our created reality.\n\nThe present act of thought is reality but the past is not reality; it is history. The reason being, past can be rewritten through present knowledge and perspective of the event. The reality that is currently constructed can be completely changed through language (e.g. bias (omission, source, tone)).<ref name=\"papermasters.com\"/> The unreliability of the recorded realty can skew the original concept and make the past remark unreliable. \nActual idealism is regarded as a liberal and tolerant doctrine since it acknowledges that every being picturizes reality, in which their ideas remained hatched, differently. Even though, reality is a figment of thought.\n\nEven though core concept of the theory is famous for its simplification, its application is regarded as extremely ambiguous.

Retrieved from http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/basic?sid=138f85e9-3bd6-470d-93cbc8aa68e8f20e%40sessionmgr4009&vid=0&hid=4104</ref> Holmes took it as metaphysics of the thinking act; Betti as a form of hermeneutics; Harris as a metaphysics of democracy; Fogu as a modernist philosophy of history.\n\nGiovanni Gentile was a key supporter of fascism, regarded by many as the \"philosopher of fascism\". Gentile's philosophy was the key to understating fascism as it was believed by many who supported and loved it. They believed, if priori synthesis of subject and object is true, there is no difference between the individuals in society; they're all one. Which means that they have equal right, roles, and jobs. In fascist state, submission is given to one leader because individuals act as one body. In Gentile's view, far more can be accomplished when individuals are under a corporate body than a collection of autonomous individual.<ref name=\"papermasters.com\"/>\n\n===Pluralistic idealism<!--'Plurastic idealism' redirects here-->===\n'''Pluralistic idealism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> such as that of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]<ref>Michael Blamauer (ed.), ''The Mental as Fundamental: New Perspectives on Panpsychism'', Walter de Gruyter, 2013, p. 111.</ref><ref>[http://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/idealism.htm \"About Idealism\"]</ref> takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe.<ref>See Idealistic Theory No. 3: Pluralistic Idealism http://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/idealism.htm</ref> Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or \"Absolute\". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as [[Panpsychism]], views \"monads\" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are \"substantial forms of being, \"elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is [[Substance theory|substance]] while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a [[pre-established harmony]] by [[God]], the central monad, between the world in the minds of the [[Monadology|monad]]s and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian [[theism]]. The English psychologist and philosopher [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism.<ref>''The New Cambridge Modern History: The era of violence, 1898-1945, edited by David Thomson'' University Press, 1960, p. 135</ref> According to Ward the universe is composed of \"psychic monads\" of different levels, interacting for mutual self-betterment.<ref>Hugh Joseph Tallon The concept of self in British and American idealism 1939, p. 118</ref>\n\n[[Personalism]] is the view that the minds that underlie reality are the minds of persons. [[Borden Parker Bowne]], a philosopher at Boston University, a founder and popularizer of personal idealism, presented it as a substantive reality of persons, the only reality, as known directly in self-consciousness. Reality is a society of interacting persons dependent on the Supreme Person of God. Other proponents include [[George Holmes Howison]]<ref>The Limits Of Evolution; And Other Essays Illustrating The Metaphysical Theory Of Personal Idealism By George Holmes Howison</ref>  and [[J. M.

McTaggart]].<ref>See the book Idealistic Argument in Recent British and American Philosophy By Gustavus W Cunningham page 202 \"Ontologically i am an idealist, since i believe that all that exists is spiritual.

Howison maintained that both impersonal, monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom. To deny freedom to pursue truth, beauty, and \"benignant love\" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy.

M. E. McTaggart]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] argued that minds alone exist and only relate to each other through love. [[Space]], [[time]] and material objects are unreal. In ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'' he argued that time is an illusion because it is impossible to produce a coherent account of a sequence of events. ''The Nature of Existence'' (1927) contained his arguments that space, time, and matter cannot possibly be real. In his ''Studies in Hegelian Cosmology'' (Cambridge, 1901, p196) he declared that metaphysics are not relevant to social and political action. McTaggart \"thought that Hegel was wrong in supposing that metaphysics could show that the state is more than a means to the good of the individuals who compose it\".<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 3, \"Idealism,\" New York, 1967</ref> For McTaggart \"philosophy can give us very little, if any, guidance in action...

Although a perennial source of controversy, Aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature, as exemplified in his theology of [[unmoved movers]].<ref name=\"Gerson\">{{cite book |first=Lloyd P. |last=Gerson |title=The Unity of Intellect in Aristotle's \"De Anima\" |journal=Phronesis |volume=49 |number=4 |year=2004 |pages=348\u2013373 |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/lpgerson/The_Unity_Of_Intellect_In_Aristotles_De_Anima.pdf |jstor=4182761 |quote=Desperately difficult texts inevitably elicit desperate hermeneutical measures. Aristotle's ''De Anima,'' book three, chapter five, is evidently one such text. At least since the time of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], scholars have felt compelled to draw some remarkable conclusions regarding Aristotle's brief remarks in this passage regarding intellect. One such claim is that in chapter five, Aristotle introduces a second intellect, the so-called 'agent intellect', an intellect distinct from the 'passive intellect', the supposed focus of discussion up until this passage. This view is a direct descendent of the view of Alexander himself, who identified the agent intellect with the divine intellect. Even the staunchest defender of such a view is typically at a loss to give a plausible explanation of why the divine intellect pops into and then out of the picture in the intense and closely argued discussion of the human intellect that goes from chapter four through to the end of chapter seven.}}</ref> Identifying Aristotle's God with rational thought, Davidson argued, contrary to Aristotle, that just as the soul cannot exist apart from the body, God cannot exist apart from the world.<ref>Davidson, Journal, 1884-1898 (Thomas Davidson Collection, Manuscript Group #169, Sterling Memorial Library, Yale University). Quoted in DeArmey, \"Thomas Davidson's Apeirotheism,\" 692</ref>\n\nIdealist notions took a strong hold among physicists of the early 20th century confronted with the paradoxes of [[quantum physics]] and the [[theory of relativity]]. In ''[[The Grammar of Science]]'', Preface to the 2nd Edition, 1900, [[Karl Pearson]] wrote, \"There are many signs that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude [[materialism]] of the older physicists.\" This book influenced [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s regard for the importance of the observer in scientific measurements{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. In \u00a7 5 of that book, Pearson asserted that \"...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind....\" Also, \"...the field of science is much more [[consciousness]] than an external world.\"\n\nSir [[Arthur Eddington]], a British astrophysicist of the early 20th century, wrote in his book ''The Nature of the Physical World''; \"The stuff of the world is mind-stuff\";\n\n\"The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds.... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it.... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness.... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature.... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.\"<ref>A.S.

In general the universe seems to me to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, it seems to me, that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind.</blockquote>\n\nAddressing the [[British Association]] in 1934, Jeans said: <blockquote>\"What remains is in any case very different from the full-blooded matter and the forbidding [[materialism]] of the Victorian scientist. His objective and material universe is proved to consist of little more than constructs of our own minds. To this extent, then, modern physics has moved in the direction of philosophic idealism. Mind and matter, if not proved to be of similar nature, are at least found to be ingredients of one single system.

Traveling as far back in time as we can, brings us not to the creation of the picture, but to its edge; the creation of the picture lies as much outside the picture as the artist is outside his canvas. On this view, discussing the creation of the universe in terms of time and space is like trying to discover the artist and the action of painting, by going to the edge of the canvas.

The rules of inheritance differ between societies and have changed over time.\n\n==Terminology==\nIn law, an ''heir'' is a person who is entitled to receive a share of the [[decedent|deceased]]'s (the person who died) property, subject to the rules of inheritance in the [[jurisdiction]] of which the deceased was a citizen or where the deceased (decedent) died or owned property at the time of death.\n\nThe inheritance may be either under the terms of a [[will (law)|will]] or by [[intestate]] laws if the deceased had no will.  However, the will must comply with the laws of the jurisdiction at the time it was created or it will be declared invalid (for example, some states do not recognize [[holographic will]]s as valid, or only in specific circumstances) and the intestate laws then apply.\n\nA person does not become an heir before the death of the deceased, since the exact identity of the persons entitled to inherit is determined only then. Members of ruling noble or royal houses who are expected to become heirs are called [[Heir apparent|heirs apparent]] if first in line and incapable of being displaced from inheriting by another claim; otherwise, they are [[Heir presumptive|heirs presumptive]]. There is a further concept of joint inheritance, pending renunciation by all but one, which is called [[Co-parceners|coparceny]].\n\nIn modern law, the terms ''inheritance'' and ''heir'' refer exclusively to succession to property by descent from a deceased dying [[Intestacy|intestate]]. Takers in property succeeded to under a will are termed generally ''[[beneficiary|beneficiaries]],'' and specifically ''devisees'' for [[real property]], ''bequestees'' for [[personal property]], or ''legatees''.\n\nExcept in some jurisdictions where a person cannot be legally disinherited (such as the United States state of [[Louisiana]], which allows disinheritance only under specifically enumerated circumstances), a person who would be an heir under intestate laws may be disinherited completely under the terms of a will (an example is that of the will of comedian [[Jerry Lewis]]; his will specifically disinherited his six children by his first wife, and their descendants, leaving his entire estate to his second wife).\n\n==History==\n{{Details|Historical inheritance systems}}\nDetailed [[Anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] studies have been made about customs of patrilineal inheritance, where only male children can inherit. Some cultures also employ [[matrilineal]] succession, where property can only pass along the female line, most commonly going to the sister's sons of the decedent; but also, in some societies, from the mother to her daughters. Some ancient societies and most modern states employ egalitarian inheritance, without discrimination based on gender and/or birth order.\n\n===Jewish laws===\nThe inheritance is patrilineal. The father \u2014that is, the owner of the land\u2014 bequeaths only to his male descendants, so the Promised Land passes from one Jewish father to his sons.\n\nIf there were no living sons and no descendants of any previously living sons, daughters inherit. In {{bibleverse||Numbers|27:1-4|HE}}, the daughters of Zelophehad (Mahlah, Noa, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah) of the tribe of Manasseh come to Moses and ask for their father's inheritance, as they have no brothers. The order of inheritance is set out in {{bibleverse||Numbers|27:7-11|HE}}: a man's sons inherit first, daughters if no sons, brothers if he has no children, and so on.\n\nLater, in {{bibleverse||Numbers|36|HE}}, some of the heads of the families of the tribe of Manasseh come to Moses and point out that, if a daughter inherits and then marries a man not from her paternal tribe, her land will pass from her birth-tribe's inheritance into her marriage-tribe's. So a further rule is laid down: if a daughter inherits land, she must marry someone within her father's tribe. (The daughters of Zelophehad marry the sons' of their father's brothers. There is ''no'' indication that this was not their choice.)\n\nThe tractate [[Baba Bathra]], written during late Antiquity in Babylon, deals extensively with issues of property ownership and inheritance according to Jewish Law.

The first, often abbreviated to [[Mishneh Torah]], was written by [[Maimonides]] and was very important in [[Jewish]] tradition.\n\nAll these sources agree that the firstborn son is entitled to a double portion of his father's estate: {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|21:17|HE}}. This means that, for example, if a father left five sons, the firstborn receives a third of the estate and each of the other four receives a sixth.

However, the inheritance rights of women remained inferior to those of men because in Islam someone always has a responsibility of looking after a woman's expenses.

Inheritance is an integral component of family, economic, and legal institutions, and a basic mechanism of [[class stratification]]. It also affects the [[distribution of wealth]] at the societal level.  The total cumulative effect of inheritance on stratification outcomes takes three forms, according to scholars who have examined the subject.\n\nThe first form of inheritance is the inheritance of [[cultural capital]] (i.e. linguistic styles, higher status social circles, and aesthetic preferences).<ref name=\"Edited by\">(Edited By) Miller, Robert K., McNamee, Stephen J.  Inheritance and Wealth in America. p. 2</ref> The second form of inheritance is through familial interventions in the form of ''inter vivos'' transfers (i.e. gifts between the living), especially at crucial junctures in the life courses.  Examples include during a child's milestone stages, such as going to college, getting married, getting a job, and purchasing a home.<ref name=\"Edited by\" /> The third form of inheritance is the transfers of bulk estates at the time of death of the testators, thus resulting in significant economic advantage accruing to children during their adult years.<ref>(Edited By) Miller, Robert K., McNamee, Stephen L.  Inheritance and Wealth in America. p. 4</ref> The origin of the stability of inequalities is material (personal possessions one is able to obtain) and is also cultural, rooted either in varying child-rearing practices that are geared to socialization according to social class and economic position.  Child-rearing practices among those who inherit wealth may center around favoring some groups at the expense of others at the bottom of the [[social hierarchy]].<ref>Clignet, Remi. Death, Deeds, and Descendants: Inheritance in Modern America. p. 3</ref>\n\n===Sociological and economic effects of inheritance inequality===\nIt is further argued that the degree to which economic status and inheritance is transmitted across generations determines one's life chances in society. Although many have linked one's social origins and educational attainment to life chances and opportunities, education cannot serve as the most influential predictor of [[economic mobility]].  In fact, children of well-off parents generally receive better schooling and benefit from material, cultural, and genetic inheritances.<ref>Bowles, Samuel; Gintis, Herbert, \"The Inheritance of Inequality.\" ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' Vol. 16, No. 3, 2002, p. 4</ref> Likewise, schooling attainment is often persistent across generations and families with higher amounts of inheritance are able to acquire and transmit higher amounts of human capital.  Lower amounts of human capital and inheritance can perpetuate inequality in the housing market and higher education.  Research reveals that inheritance plays an important role in the accumulation of housing wealth.  Those who receive an inheritance are more likely to own a home than those who do not regardless of the size of the inheritance.<ref>Flippen, Chenoa A. \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality in Homeownership and Housing Equity.\" The Sociological Quarterly, Volume 42, No. 2 p. 134</ref>\n\nOften, racial or religious minorities and individuals from socially disadvantaged backgrounds receive less inheritance and wealth.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  As a result, mixed races might be excluded in inheritance privilege and are more likely to rent homes or live in poorer neighborhoods, as well as achieve lower educational attainment compared with whites in America. Individuals with a substantial amount of wealth and inheritance often intermarry with others of the same social class to protect their wealth and ensure the continuous transmission of inheritance across generations; thus perpetuating a cycle of privilege.\n\nNations with the highest [[income inequality|income]] and [[wealth inequalities]] often have the highest rates of homicide and disease (such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension).<ref>page 20 of \"The Spirit Level\"by Wilkinson & Pickett, Bloomsbury Press 2009</ref> A ''[[The New York Times]]'' article reveals that the U.S. is the world's wealthiest nation, but \"ranks twenty-ninth in life expectancy, right behind Jordan and Bosnia.\"  This has been regarded as highly attributed to the significant gap of inheritance inequality in the country,<ref>Dubner, Stephen. \"How Big of a Deal Is Income Inequality? A Guest Post\". The ''New York Times''. August 27, 2008.</ref> although there are clearly other factors such as the affordability of [[healthcare]].\n\nWhen social and economic inequalities centered on inheritance are perpetuated by major social institutions such as family, education, religion, etc., these differing life opportunities are argued to be transmitted from each generation.  As a result, this inequality is believed to become part of the overall social structure.<ref>Rokicka, Ewa. \"Local policy targeted at reducing inheritance of inequalities in European countries.\" May 2006.

The oldest is known as the \"Long Recension\" which dates from the latter part of the fourth century.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\" /> These were created to posthumously enlist Ignatius as an unwitting witness in theological disputes of that age, but that position was vigorously combated by several British and German critics, including the Catholics [[Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger|Denzinger]] and [[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]], who defended the genuineness of the entire seven epistles.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\" /> At the same time, the purported eye-witness account of his martyrdom is also thought to be a forgery from around the same time. A detailed but spurious account of Ignatius' arrest and his travails and martyrdom is the material of the ''Martyrium Ignatii'' which is presented as being an eyewitness account for the church of Antioch, and attributed to Ignatius' companions, Philo of Cilicia, deacon at Tarsus, and Rheus Agathopus, a Syrian.\n\nAlthough [[James Ussher]] regarded it as genuine, if there is any genuine nucleus of the ''Martyrium'', it has been so greatly expanded with interpolations that no part of it is without questions. Its most reliable manuscript is the 10th-century ''[[Codex Colbertinus]]'' (Paris), in which the ''Martyrium'' closes the collection. The ''Martyrium'' presents the confrontation of the bishop Ignatius with [[Trajan]] at Antioch, a familiar [[trope (literature)|trope]] of ''Acta'' of the martyrs, and many details of the long, partly overland voyage to Rome. The [[Synaxarium]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] says that he was thrown to the wild beasts that devoured him and rent him to pieces.<ref name=\"synaxarium\">[http://www.copticchurch.net/synaxarium/4_24.html#1 \"Synaxarium: The Martyrdom of St. Ignatius, and Patriarch of Antioch\", Coptic Orthodox Church Network]</ref>\n\nIgnatius's letters proved to be important testimony to the development of Christian [[theology]], since the number of extant writings from this period of Church history is very small. They bear signs of being written in great haste and without a proper plan, such as [[run-on sentence]]s and an unsystematic succession of thought.\n\nIgnatius modeled his writings after Paul, Peter, and John, and even quoted or paraphrased their own works freely, such as when he quoted 1 Corinthians 1:18, in his letter to the Ephesians: \"Let my spirit be counted as nothing for the sake of the cross, which is a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to us salvation and life eternal.\"&nbsp;\u2013 ''Letter to the Ephesians'' 18, Roberts and Donaldson translation<ref>[http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-decian-persecution/ignatius-of-antioch ''A Pinch on Incense'', (Ted Byfield, ed.), p. 50]</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIgnatius is known to have taught the deity of Christ: {{quote|There is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death; both of Mary and of God; first passible and then impassible, even Jesus Christ our Lord.|source=''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch. 7, shorter version, Roberts-Donaldson translation}}\nAlso in the interpolated text of the 4th Century Long Recension:\n\n{{quote|But our Physician is the Only true God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and Begetter of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For \"the Word was made flesh.\" Being incorporeal, He was in the body, being impassible, He was in a passible body, being immortal, He was in a mortal body, being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health, when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.|source=''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch. 7, longer version}}\n\nHe stressed the value of the [[Eucharist]], calling it a \"medicine of immortality\" (''Ignatius to the Ephesians'' 20:2). The very strong desire for bloody martyrdom in the arena, which Ignatius expresses rather graphically in places, may seem quite odd to the modern reader. An examination of his theology of [[soteriology]] shows that he regarded salvation as one being free from the powerful fear of death and thus to bravely face martyrdom.<ref>Cobb, L. Stephanie. ''Dying To Be Men: Gender and Language in Early Christian Martyr Texts'', page 3 (Columbia University Press, 2008); {{ISBN|978-0-231-14498-8}}</ref>\n\nIgnatius is claimed to be the first known Christian writer to argue in favor of Christianity's replacement of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] with the [[Lord's Day]]:\n\n{{quote|Be not seduced by strange doctrines nor by antiquated fables, which are profitless. For if even unto this day we live after the manner of Judaism, we avow that we have not received grace ...

And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord's day as a festival, the resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days [of the week]. Looking forward to this, the prophet declared, \"To the end, for the eighth day,\" on which our life both sprang up again, and the victory over death was obtained in Christ|source=''[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/Epistle to the Magnesians|Letter to the Magnesians]]'' 9, Roberts and Donaldson translation, p. 189.}}\n\n=== [[Ecclesiology]] ===\nIgnatius is the earliest known Christian writer to emphasize [[loyalty]] to a single [[bishop]] in each city (or [[diocese]]) who is assisted by both [[presbyter]]s (elders) and [[deacon]]s. Earlier writings only mention ''either'' bishops ''or'' presbyters.\n\nFor instance, his writings on bishops, presbyters and deacons:\n\n{{quote|Take care to do all things in harmony with God, with the bishop presiding in the place of God, and with the presbyters in the place of the council of the apostles, and with the deacons, who are most dear to me, entrusted with the business of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father from the beginning and is at last made manifest|source=''Letter to the Magnesians 2'', 6:1}}\n\nHe is also responsible for the first known use of the Greek word ''katholikos'' (\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"universal\", \"complete\" and \"whole\" to describe the church, writing:\n\n{{quote|Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be; as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.  It is not lawful to baptize or give communion without the consent of the bishop. On the other hand, whatever has his approval is pleasing to God. Thus, whatever is done will be safe and valid.|source=''Letter to the Smyrnaeans'' 8, J.R. Willis translation.}}\n\nIt is from the word ''katholikos'' (\"according to the whole\") that the word ''[[Catholic (term)|catholic]]'' comes. When Ignatius wrote the Letter to the Smyrnaeans in about the year 107 and used the word ''catholic'', he used it as if it were a word already in use to describe the Church. This has led many scholars to conclude that the appellation ''Catholic Church'' with its ecclesial connotation may have been in use as early as the last quarter of the First century. On the [[Eucharist]], he wrote in his letter to the Smyrnaeans:\n\n{{quote|Take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of Jesus Christ which has come to us, and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of God ... They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, flesh which suffered for our sins and which that Father, in his goodness, raised up again.

Introduced in 1986 and manufactured by [[IBM]], [[Lexmark]], Maxi-Switch and [[Unicomp]], the vast majority of Model M keyboards feature a [[buckling spring]] key design and many have fully swappable [[keycap]]s.\n\n==Keyboard layouts==\nThe PC keyboard changed over the years, often at the launch of new [[IBM PC]] versions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Name !!

In addition to the 'old' standard keys, the PC keyboard has accumulated several special keys over the years. Some of the additions have been inspired by the opportunity or requirement for improving user productivity with general office [[application software]], while other slightly more general keyboard additions have become the factory standards after being introduced by certain [[operating system]] or [[graphical user interface|GUI]] software vendors such as [[Microsoft]].\n\n===From mechanical typewriters===\n*{{key press|[[Shift key|Shift]]}} selects the upper character, or upper case of letters. The Shift key in typewriters was attached to a lever that moved the character types so that the uppercase characters could be printed in the paper. Unlike mechanical typewriters, PC keyboards do not capitalize all letters properly when both shift keys are engaged simultaneously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016|reason=Does it really not capitalize correctly when both shift keys are pressed?}}\n*{{key press|[[Caps Lock]]}} selects upper case, or if shift is pressed, lower case of letters. In mechanical typewriters, it worked like the Shift key, but also used a lock to keep the Shift key depressed. The lock was released by pressing the Shift key.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=It could have derived from TTY Lock, instead of Shift Lock}}\n*{{key press|[[carriage return|Enter]]}} wraps to the next line or activates the default or selected option. ASCII keyboards were labeled CR or Return. Typewriters used a lever that would return the cylinder with the paper to the start of the line.\n*{{key press|[[Tab key|Tab]]}} produces an ASCII [[tab character]], moving to the next tab stop.\n\n===From Teletype keyboards===\n*{{key press|[[Control Key|Ctrl]]}} shifts the value of letters and numbers from the ASCII graphics range, down into the [[ASCII]] control characters.  For example, CTRL-S is XOFF (stops many programs as they print to screen) CTRL-Q is XON (resume printing stopped by CTRL-S).\n*{{key press|[[Escape key|Esc]]}} produces an ASCII [[escape character]]. It may be used to exit menus or modes.\n*{{key press|~}} is the [[tilde]], an accent backspaced and printed over other letters for non-English languages. Nowadays the key does not produce a backspaceable character in US/UK keyboard layouts, and is used for 'not' or 'circa'.\n*{{key press|`}} is a [[grave accent]] or backtick, also formerly backspaced over letters to write non-English languages; on some systems it is used as an opening quote.  The single quote ' is normally used for an acute accent.\n*{{key press|^}} is a [[circumflex]], another accent for non-English languages. Also used to indicate [[exponentiation]] where [[superscript]] is not available.\n*{{key press|*}} is an [[asterisk]], used to indicate a note, or multiplication.\n*{{key press|_}} is an [[underscore]], which can be backspaced and overprinted to add emphasis, or in certain [[Programming Languages]] in place of a {{key press|[[Space key|Space]]}} to form a compound word where the use of {{key press|[[Space key|Space]]}} would yield several separate words.\n*{{key press|{{!}}}} is a [[vertical bar]], originally used as a typographic separator for optical character recognition.  Many character sets break it in the middle so it cannot be confused with the numeral \"1\" or the letter \"l\" (in most [[EBCDIC]] [[codepage]]s, vertical bar and divided vertical bar are separate characters). This character is often known as a \"pipe\" (after its use in [[Unix shell]]s) or a \"fencepost\".\n\n===Invented for computers with video displays===\n*[[Function key]]s are the F-numbered keys. Their use varies by program; {{key|F1}} is often Help.\n*[[Arrow keys]] ({{key|up}}, {{key|right}}, {{key|down}}, {{key|left}}) move the cursor on the screen. When shifted, they select items.\n*{{key press|[[Home key|Home]]}} moves the cursor to the start of text, usually the left side of the screen.\n*{{key press|[[End key|End]]}} moves the cursor to the end of the current line.\n*{{key press|[[Page scroll keys|PgUp]]}} and {{key press|[[Page scroll keys|PgDn]]}} move through the document by pages.\n*{{key press|[[Delete key|Del]]}} (Delete) deletes the character after the cursor, or the selected items.\n*{{key press|[[Insert key|Ins]]}} (Insert) originally toggled between text insertion and overwrite modes. Importantly, it is involved along with Ctrl and Shift keys in keyboard shortcuts for copy ({{key|Ctrl|Insert}}) and paste ({{key|Shift|Insert}}) according to the [[IBM CUA]] user interface guidelines; the IBM CUA shortcuts are still widely supported by most current PC operating systems, and many PC users who learned those shortcuts between the late 1980s and the early 1990s may still find them more natural, convenient, or ergonomic than their \"modern\" Ctrl+X/C/V counterparts, given the close proximity of the Ctrl, Shift and Insert keys to the cursor movement keys. This particular role of the Insert key is often overlooked by modern-times documentation, if not hardware design, which tend to attribute to \"Insert\" only its more obvious, but much less frequently used and somewhat obsolete, original function.\n*{{key press|[[Print Screen]]}} originally printed a text image of the screen. (On modern computers, {{key|Ctrl|Print Screen}} usually takes a screenshot.) With the Alt key, it switched to [[SysRq]], a different keycode.\n*{{key press|[[Num Lock]]}} toggles the state of the [[numeric keypad]]. When off, the keypad acts as arrow and navigational keys.  When on, it is a 10-key number pad similar to a standard calculator.  Preferences vary so much that a favorite default for this key can often be configured in the BIOS. The key continues to exist on keyboards with separate arrow keys to accommodate those who still prefer the toggleable keypad.\n*{{key press|[[Scroll Lock]]}} is little-used. IBM documentation described it as \"inactive\", and the key's purpose was a mystery even to keyboard manufacturers.<ref name=\"sandler198301\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&lpg=PP1&pg=RA2-PA347#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Key Tronic's Soft Touch | work=PC Magazine | date=January 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Sandler, Corey | pages=347}}</ref> In modern software, typing text usually causes previous text to scroll off the top of the screen or window. Some old programs could disable this and restart at the top of the window when scroll lock was pressed. The advantage is that the entire screenful of text does not shift, making it easier to read. Scroll Lock was also used to lock the cursor on its line and scroll the work area under it. In spreadsheets such as [[Microsoft Excel]], it locks the cell pointer on the current cell, allowing the user to use the arrow keys to move the view window without moving the cell pointer. On some consoles (such as the [[Linux console]]), it prevents scrolling of messages until another key combination is pressed. Many hardware [[kvm switch|KVM switches]] use Scroll Lock to switch between the devices they control.\n*{{key press|[[Break key|Pause]]}} pauses output or processing. In combination with Ctrl, it produces a keycode for ''Break''. {{key|Ctrl|Break}} traditionally stopped programs in DOS. {{key|Ctrl|Break}} is also used to halt execution of the debugger in some programming environments such as Microsoft Visual Studio. In combination with the Windows key, it opens the System Properties window in Microsoft Windows environments.\n*{{key press|[[Alt key|Alt]]}} shifts the letters and numbers into the range above hex 0x80 where the international characters and special characters exist in the PC's standard character set. ''Alt'' plus a number typed on the numeric keypad produces special characters; see [[Windows Alt keycodes]].\n*{{key press|[[Windows key|Win]]}} (also known as the \"super\" key) is a quick way to open the [[Start menu]] in [[Microsoft Windows]]'s standard Explorer shell, and can usually be configured to open the main menu in other operating systems. In Microsoft Windows, the Windows key can also be used in combination with other keys to perform desktop-related actions (e.g. {{key|Win|M}} to minimize all open windows, then again to restore them). When connected to a [[Macintosh computer]], the Windows key behaves like the {{key press|[[Command key|Command]]}} key.\n*The {{key|[[menu key|Menu]]}} key brings up the active application's context menu, similar to right-clicking.\n*{{key press|[[AltGr key|AltGr]]}} is often used in combination with other keys to print special characters like the [[backslash]] on non-English keyboards. It can often be emulated by {{key|Ctrl|Alt}}.\n*{{key press|[[Fn key|Fn]]}} may be present on compact keyboards such as those built into laptop computers. When depressed in combination with other keys, it either enables the user to access key functions that do not have dedicated keys on the compact keyboard (such as the numeric keypad simulation block), or it controls hardware functions such as switching between the built-in screen and an external display, changing screen brightness, or changing speaker volume. These secondary meanings are usually indicated with text or symbols of a different color printed on the key, with the 'Fn' key text having that same color.\n*{{key press|[[Turbo key|Turbo]]}} on some keyboards. It is usually on the right side of the right Shift key. When depressed in combination with a [[function key]] it sets the key repeat rate.<ref>Belkin International.

She served in both [[World War]]s, although she was little used and saw no combat during the former. The ship supported operations during the [[Corfu Incident]] in 1923 and spent much of the rest of the decade in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.\n\nBoth ''Giulio Cesare'' and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Italian battleship|Conte di Cavour||2}}, participated in the [[Battle of Calabria]] in July 1940, when the former was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers [[Battle of Taranto|attacked]] the fleet at [[Taranto]] in November 1940, but ''Giulio Cesare'' was not damaged. She escorted several convoys to North Africa and participated in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] in late 1940 and the [[First Battle of Sirte]] in late 1941. She was designated as a [[training ship]] in early 1942, and escaped to [[Malta]] after Italy surrendered. The ship was transferred to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1949 and renamed '''''Novorossiysk''''' ({{lang-ru|\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a}}). The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk, with the loss of 608 men, when an old German [[naval mine|mine]] exploded in 1955. She was [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] the following year and later [[ship breaking|scrapped]].\n\n==Description==\nNamed after [[Julius Caesar]], ''Giulio Cesare'' was {{convert|168.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]], and {{convert|176|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]]. The ship had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.3|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref name=randal259>Gardiner & Gray, p. 259</ref> She displaced {{convert|23088|LT|t}} at normal load, and {{convert|25086|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. She had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.<ref name=g02>Giorgerini, pp. 270, 272</ref> The ship's machinery consisted of four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. Steam for the turbines was provided by 24 [[Babcock & Wilcox boiler]]s, half of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other half burning both oil and coal. Designed to reach a maximum speed of {{convert|22.5|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|31000|shp|lk=in}}, ''Giulio Cesare'' failed to reach this goal on her [[sea trial]]s, despite generally exceeding the rated power of her turbines. The ship only made a maximum speed of {{convert|21.56|kn}} using {{convert|30700|shp|abbr=on}}. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=randal259/>\n\nThe ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen [[305 mm /46 Model 1909]] guns in three triple-[[gun turret]] and two twin-gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. The secondary battery comprised eighteen {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} guns, all mounted in [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull. ''Giulio Cesare'' was also armed with fourteen [[QF 14 pounder naval gun Mk I & II naval gun|{{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} guns]]. As was customary for [[capital ship]]s of the period, she was equipped with three submerged {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. She was protected with [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented steel]] manufactured by [[Terni]]. The [[belt armor]] was {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} thick and the main deck was {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] and main battery turrets were protected with {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on}} worth of armor plating.<ref>Giorgerini, pp. 271\u201372</ref>\n\n==Modifications and reconstruction==\n[[File:ONI Drawing of Conte di Cavour-class battleship.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Office of Naval Intelligence]] drawing of the ''Conte di Cavour'' class, January 1943]]\nShortly after the end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76&nbsp;mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six [[Cannon 76/40 Model 1916|new 40-caliber 76&nbsp;mm]] [[Anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]] were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two [[license-built]] [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder]] AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925\u201326 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s,<ref name=g7>Giorgerini, p. 277</ref> the [[rangefinder]]s were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a [[Macchi M.18]] [[seaplane]] mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, either one or both of the ships was equipped with a fixed [[aircraft catapult]] on the port side of the forecastle.{{#tag:ref|Sources disagree if ''Giulio Cesare'' was fitted with a catapult or not.

The ship's draft at deep load increased to {{convert|10.02|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref name=eb4/> All of the changes made increased her displacement to {{convert|26140|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|29100|LT|t}} at deep load. The ship's crew increased to 1,260 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Brescia, p. 58</ref> Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at {{convert|75000|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=eb4/> The boilers were replaced by eight [[Yarrow boiler]]s. On her sea trials in December 1936, before her reconstruction was fully completed, ''Giulio Cesare'' reached a speed of {{convert|28.24|kn}} from {{convert|93430|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, p. 422</ref> In service her maximum speed was about {{convert|27|kn}} and she had a range of {{convert|6400|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|13|kn}}.<ref>Bagnasco & Grossman, pp. 64\u201365</ref>\n\nThe main guns were bored out to [[320 mm Model 1934 naval gun|{{convert|320|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}]] and the center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed. All of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen 120&nbsp;mm guns in six twin-gun turrets and eight [[\u0160koda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}]] AA guns in twin turrets. In addition the ship was fitted with a dozen [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] [[Cannone-Mitragliera da 37/54 (Breda)|{{convert|37|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}}]] light AA guns in six twin-gun mounts and twelve [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|sp=us|adj=on|2}} Breda M31 anti-aircraft]] [[machine gun]]s, also in twin mounts.<ref name=eb5>Bagnasco & Grossman, p. 65</ref> In 1940 the 13.2&nbsp;mm machine guns were replaced by [[Breda Model 35|{{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] AA guns in twin mounts. ''Giulio Cesare'' received two more twin mounts as well as four additional 37&nbsp;mm guns in twin mounts on the forecastle between the two turrets in 1941.<ref name=w8/><ref name=w8/> The tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower, protected with {{convert|260|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on|1}} thick armor.<ref name=\"Bargoni21\">Bargoni & Gay, p. 21</ref> Atop the conning tower there was a [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]] fitted with two large stereo-rangefinders, with a base length of {{convert|7.2|m|sp=us|1}}.<ref name=\"Bargoni21\"/>\n\nThe deck armor was increased during the reconstruction to a total of {{convert|135|mm|in|sp=us}} over the engine and boiler rooms and {{convert|166|mm|in|sp=us}} over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s, although its distribution over three decks, each with multiple layers, meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of the same thickness. The armor protecting the barbettes was reinforced with {{convert|50|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} plates.<ref name=m12/> All this armor weighed a total of {{convert|3227|LT|t}}.<ref name=w8/> The existing underwater protection was replaced by the [[Pugliese torpedo defense system]] that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo [[warhead]]. It lacked, however, enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ship's increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.<ref name=m12>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 421\u201322</ref>\n\n==Construction and service==\n[[File:Sestri Ponente - Launch of Giulio Cesare.jpg|thumb|left|Launch of ''Gulio Cesare'', 15 October 1911.]]\n[[File:GiulioCesare1914.jpg|thumb|left|''Gulio Cesare'' shortly after completion, 1914]]\n''Giulio Cesare'', named after [[Julius Caesar]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 298</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] at the [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.]] shipyard in Genoa on 24 June 1910 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 October 1911. She was completed on 14 May 1914 and served as a [[flagship]] in the southern [[Adriatic Sea]] during World War I.<ref name=s7>Preston, p. 176</ref> She saw no action, however, and spent little time at sea.<ref name=g7/> Admiral [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]], the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian [[submarine]]s and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic.<ref name=\"Halpern, p. 150\">Halpern, p. 150</ref> The threat from these underwater weapons to his [[capital ship]]s was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.<ref name=\"Halpern, p. 150\"/> Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the [[MAS (boat)|MAS torpedo boats]], conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.<ref>Halpern, pp. 141&ndash;142</ref>\n\n''Giulio Cesare'' made port visits in the [[Levant]] in 1919 and 1920. Both ''Giulio Cesare'' and ''Conte di Cavour'' supported Italian operations on [[Corfu]] in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff [[Corfu incident|were murdered on Corfu]]; [[Benito Mussolini]] was not satisfied with the Greek government's response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. ''Cesare'' became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. She was reconstructed at [[Cantieri del Tirreno]], Genoa, between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by [[Adolf Hitler]] in the [[Bay of Naples]] in May 1938 and covered the [[invasion of Albania]] in May 1939.<ref name=w1>Whitley, pp. 158\u201361</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|Battle of Calabria}}\nEarly in World War II, the ship took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo), together with ''Conte di Cavour'', on 9 July 1940, as part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]], during which she engaged major elements of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to [[Alexandria]], while the Italians had finished escorting another from [[Naples]] to [[Benghazi]], Libya. Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crew on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly {{convert|29000|yd|order=flip|sp=us}}. The two leading British battleships, {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} and {{HMS|Malaya||2}}, replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from ''Giulio Cesare'' began to straddle ''Warspite'' which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship's aim, at 16:00. Some rounds fired by ''Giulio Cesare'' overshot ''Warspite'' and near-missed the destroyers [[HMS Decoy (H75)|HMS ''Decoy'']] and ''[[HMS Hereward (H93)|Hereward]]'', puncturing their superstructures with splinters. At that same time, a shell from ''Warspite'' struck ''Giulio Cesare'' at a distance of about {{convert|26000|yd|order=flip|sp=us}}. The shell pierced the rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly {{convert|20|ft|m|order=flip|sp=us}} across. Fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe. This reduced the ship's speed to {{convert|18|kn}}. Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged.<ref>O'Hara, pp. 28\u201335</ref> Repairs to ''Giulio Cesare'' were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to [[Malta]] in August and September.<ref>Whitley, p. 161</ref>\n\nOn the night of 11 November 1940, ''Giulio Cesare'' and the other Italian battleships were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were attacked by 21 [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}}, along with several other warships. One torpedo sank [[Italian battleship Conte di Cavour|Conte di Cavour]] in shallow water, but ''Giulio Cesare'' was not hit during the attack.<ref>Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 81</ref> She participated in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] on 27 November 1940, but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them. The ship was damaged in January 1941 by splinters from a near miss during an air raid on Naples by [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]]; repairs at Genoa were completed in early February. On 8 February, she sailed from to the [[Straits of Bonifacio]] to intercept what the Italians thought was a Malta convoy, but was actually a raid on Genoa. She failed to make contact with any British forces. She participated in the [[First Battle of Sirte]] on 17 December 1941, providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya, and briefly engaging the escort force of a British convoy (during the battle, the destroyer [[HMS Kipling (F91)|''Kipling'']] suffered some damage from near misses, variably credited to ''Cesare'', ''Doria'' or the heavy cruiser ''Gorizia'').<ref>Giorgio Giorgerini, ''La guerra italiana sul mare'', p. 343.</ref> She also provided distant cover for another convoy to North Africa in early January 1942.<ref>Whitley, pp. 161\u201362</ref> ''Giulio Cesare'' was reduced to a training ship afterwards at Taranto and later [[Pula|Pola]].<ref name=b9>Brescia, p. 59</ref> The {{GS|U-596}} unsuccessfully attacked the ship in the [[Gulf of Taranto]] in early March 1944.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 272, 298</ref> After the Italian surrender on 9 September 1943, she steamed to Taranto, putting down a [[mutiny]] and enduring an ineffective attack by five German aircraft en route. She then sailed for Malta where she arrived on 12 September to be interned. The ship remained there until 17 June 1944 when she returned to Taranto where she remained for the next four years.<ref name=w2>Whitley, p. 162</ref>\n\n===Soviet service===\n[[File:Novorosiysk-1950-Sevastopol-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Novorossiysk'' at anchor, flying the Soviet ensign]]\nAfter the war, ''Giulio Cesare'' was allocated to the Soviet Union as part of the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|war reparations]]. She was moved to [[Augusta, Sicily]], on 9 December 1948, where an unsuccessful attempt was made at sabotage. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 15 December and turned over to the Soviets on 6 February 1949 under the temporary name of ''Z11'' in [[Vlor\u00eb]], Albania.<ref name=w2/> She was renamed ''Novorossiysk'', after the Soviet city on the [[Black Sea]]. The Soviets used her as a training ship, and gave her eight refits. In 1953, all Italian light AA guns were replaced by eighteen [[37 mm automatic air defense gun M1939 (61-K)|37 mm 70-K]] AA guns in six twin mounts and six singles. Also replaced were her fire-control systems and [[radar]]s. The Soviets intended to rearm her with their own [[Obukhovskii 12\"/52 Pattern 1907 gun|305&nbsp;mm guns]], but this was forestalled by her loss. While at anchor in [[Sevastopol]] on the night of 28/29 October 1955, an explosion ripped a {{convert|4|by|14|m|sp=us|adj=on}} hole in the forecastle forward of 'A' turret. The flooding could not be controlled, and she [[capsized]] with the loss of 608 men, including men sent from other ships to assist.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 419, 422</ref>\n\nThe cause of the explosion is still unclear. The official cause, regarded as the most probable, was a magnetic RMH or LMB [[bottom mine]], laid by the Germans during [[World War II]] and triggered by the dragging of the battleship's anchor chain before [[wikt:moor|mooring]] for the last time. Subsequent searches located 32 mines of these types, some of them within {{convert|50|m|sp=us}} of the explosion. The damage was consistent with an explosion of {{convert|1000|-|1200|kg|sp=us}} of [[TNT]], and more than one mine may have detonated. Nonetheless, other explanations for the ship's loss have been proposed, and the most popular of these is that she was sunk by Italian [[frogmen]] of the wartime special operations unit ''[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]'' who \u2013 more than ten years after the cessation of hostilities \u2013 were either avenging the transfer of the former Italian battleship to the USSR or sinking it on behalf of

The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] as '''HMS ''Hercules''''' for the British [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]], but construction was put on hold when the war ended. India purchased the incomplete carrier in 1957, and construction was completed in 1961. ''Vikrant'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] as the first [[aircraft carrier]] of the Indian Navy and played a key role in enforcing the [[naval blockade]] of [[East Pakistan]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].\n\nIn its later years, the ship underwent major refits to embark modern aircraft, before being [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in January 1997. She was preserved as a [[museum ship]] in [[Cuffe Parade]], [[Mumbai]] until 2012. In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction and [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] in November 2014 after final clearance from the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]].\n\n==History and construction==\n\n{{See also|1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier}}\nIn 1943 the [[Royal Navy]] commissioned six [[light aircraft carrier]]s in an effort to counter the [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies.<ref name=\"faaa-hercules\"/> The [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]], commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized [[fleet aircraft carrier]]s and the less expensive but limited-capability [[escort carrier]]s.{{Sfn|Konstam|2012|p=46}}\n\nSixteen light fleet carriers were ordered, and all were [[keel laying|laid down]] as what became the ''Colossus'' class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated the ''Majestic'' class.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|pp=199\u2013200}} The improvements from the ''Colossus'' class to the ''Majestic'' class included heavier displacement, armament, [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]], [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft lifts]] and aircraft capacity.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=185}} Construction on the ships was suspended at the end of [[World War II]], as the ships were surplus to the Royal Navy's peacetime requirements.\nInstead, the carriers were modernized and sold to several [[Commonwealth nations]]. The ships were similar, but each varied depending on the requirements of the country to which the ship was sold.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=199}}\n\nHMS ''Hercules'', the fifth ship in the ''Majestic'' class, was ordered on 7 August 1942 and laid down on 14 October 1943 by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] on the [[River Tyne]]. After World War II ended with [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japan's surrender]] on 2 September 1945, she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 September, and her construction was suspended in May 1946.<ref name=faaa-hercules>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/ships/Hercules.html|title=HMS Hercules|publisher=''Fleet Air Arm Archive''|access-date=13 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131203708/http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/ships/Hercules.html|archivedate=31 January 2012|df=}}</ref> At the time of suspension, she was 75 per cent complete.<ref name=\"INS Vikrant - Bharat Rakshak\"/> Her hull was preserved, and in May 1947 she was [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] in [[Gare Loch|Gareloch]] [[Firth of Clyde|off the Clyde]]. In January 1957, she was purchased by India and was towed to [[Belfast]] to complete her construction and modifications by [[Harland and Wolff]]. Several improvements to the original design were ordered by the Indian Navy, including an angled deck, [[steam catapult]]s, and a modified [[Aircraft carrier#Structure|island]].{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=203}}\n\n==Design and description==\n\n''Vikrant'' displaced {{convert|16,000|t|LT|-1|abbr=on}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|19,500|t|LT|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]].

Captain Pritam Singh was the first commanding officer of the ship, which carried British Hawker Sea Hawk fighter-bombers and French Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft. On 18 May 1961, the first jet landed on her deck. It was piloted by Lieutenant [[Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani]], who later served as admiral and [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of the Naval Staff of India]] from 1984 to 1987. ''Vikrant'' formally joined the Indian Navy's fleet in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) on 3 November 1961, when she was received at [[Ballard Pier]] by then [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"INS Vikrant - Bharat Rakshak\"/>\n\nIn December of that year, the ship was deployed for [[Annexation of Portuguese India|Operation Vijay]] (the code name for the annexation of [[Portuguese India]]) off the coast of Goa with two [[destroyer]]s, {{INS|Rajput|D141|6}} and {{INS|Kirpan|1959|6}}.{{Sfn|Hobbs|2014|p=203}} ''Vikrant'' did not see action, and patrolled along the coast to deter foreign interference.<ref name=\"Operation Vijay: The Liberation of 'Estado da India'- Goa, Daman and Diu\">{{cite web|author1=Brigadier A.

As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=118}} On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}}\n\nThe ship began preliminary [[sea trial]]s on 18 March and returned two days later. Trials were again conducted on 26\u201327 April. The navy decided to limit the boilers to a pressure of {{convert|400|psi|lk=on}} and the propeller revolutions to 120 RPM ahead and 80 RPM astern, reducing the ship's speed to {{convert|14|kn}}. With the growing expectations of a [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|war with Pakistan]] in the near future, the navy started to transfer its ships to strategically advantageous locations in Indian waters. The primary concern of Naval Headquarters about the operation was the serviceability of ''Vikrant''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}} When asked his opinion regarding the involvement of ''Vikrant'' in the war, Fleet Operations Officer Captain [[Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani]] told the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral [[S. M. Nanda|Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda]]:\n\n{{quote\n|text=...during the 1965 war ''Vikrant'' was sitting in Bombay Harbour and did not go out to sea.

There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three {{sclass-|Daphne|submarine|1}}s acquired by the [[Pakistan Navy]] posed a significant risk to the carrier.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=119}} In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational.{{efn|The A1 boiler was completely blanked off due to serious problems.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=118}}}} Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks.

This fleet consisted of INS ''Vikrant'', the two {{sclass-|Brahmaputra|frigate}}s {{INS|Brahmaputra|1958|6}} and {{INS|Beas|1958|6}}, the two [[Arnala-class corvette|Petya III-class]] [[corvette]]s {{INS|Kamorta|P77|6}} and {{INS|Kavaratti|P80|6}}, and one submarine, {{INS|Khanderi|S22|6}}. The main reason behind strengthening the Eastern Fleet was to counter the Pakistani maritime forces deployed in support of military operations in [[East Bengal]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=120}} A surveillance area of {{convert|18,000|sqmi}}, confined by a triangle with a base of {{convert|270|mi|abbr=on}} and sides of {{convert|165|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|mi|abbr=on}}, was set up in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Any ship in this area was to be challenged and checked. If found to be neutral, it would be escorted to the nearest Indian port, otherwise, it would be captured, and taken as a [[war prize]].{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=121}}\n\nIn the meantime, intelligence reports confirmed that Pakistan was to deploy a US-built {{sclass-|Tench|submarine|2}}, {{ship|PNS|Ghazi}}. ''Ghazi'' was considered as a serious threat to ''Vikrant'' by the Indian Navy, as ''Vikrant''{{'}}s approximate position would be known by the Pakistanis once she started operating aircraft. Of the four available surface ships, INS ''Kavaratti'' had no [[sonar]], which meant that the other three had to remain in close vicinity {{convert|5|\u2013|10|mi|abbr=on}} of ''Vikrant'', without which the carrier would be completely vulnerable to attack by ''Ghazi''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=121}}\n\nOn 23 July, ''Vikrant'' sailed off to [[Cochin]] in company with the Western Fleet. En route, before reaching Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After the completion of the radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for [[Madras]], escorted by ''Brahmaputra'' and ''Beas''. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an Aliz\u00e9 without compromising the speed restrictions.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=122}} The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Aliz\u00e9 aircraft would have to land at close to [[Stall (engine)|stalling]] speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}}\n\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) launches an Alize aircraft during Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.jpg|thumb|An Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft taking off from INS ''Vikrant''|left]]\n\nBy the end of September, ''Vikrant'' and her escorts reached [[Port Blair]]. En route to [[Visakhapatnam]], tactical exercises were conducted in the presence of the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, ''Vikrant'' set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving the reports that Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26\u201327 October at Vishakhapatnam. ''Vikrant'' then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships set out for the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail ''Vikrant'' to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that ''Vikrant'' was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn 23 November, an emergency was declared in Pakistan after a clash of Indian and Pakistani troops in [[East Pakistan]] two days earlier.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=123}} On 2 December, the Eastern Fleet proceeded to its patrol area in anticipation of an attack by Pakistan. The Pakistan Navy had deployed ''Ghazi'' on 14 November with the explicit goal of targeting and sinking ''Vikrant'', and ''Ghazi'' reached a location near Madras by the 23rd.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=143}}{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}} In an attempt to deceive the Pakistan Navy and ''Ghazi'', India's Naval Headquarters deployed ''Rajput'' as a decoy\u2014the ship sailed {{convert|160|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of Vishakhapatnam and broadcast a significant amount of radio traffic, making her appear to be ''Vikrant''.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=142}}\n\n''Ghazi'', meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances.{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}} On the night of 3\u20134 December, a muffled underwater explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a [[clearance diver|clearance diving team]] was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that ''Ghazi'' had sunk in shallow waters.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=145}}\n\nThe reason for ''Ghazi''{{'}}s fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's official historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed the position of the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that ''Ghazi'' had come up to [[Periscope#Naval use|periscope depth]] to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to [[crash dive]], which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: on the night of the explosion, ''Rajput'' was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two [[depth charge]]s on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=143}} The third possibility is that there was a mishap when ''Ghazi'' was laying [[Naval mine|mines]] on the day before hostilities broke out.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=145}}\n\n''Vikrant'' was redeployed towards [[Chittagong]] at the outbreak of hostilities. On 4 December, the ship's Sea Hawks struck shipping in Chittagong and [[Cox's Bazar]] harbours, sinking or incapacitating most of the ships present. Later strikes targeted [[Khulna]] and the [[Port of Mongla]], which continued until 10 December, while other operations were flown to support a naval blockade of East Pakistan.{{Sfn|Roy|1995|p=165}} On 14 December, the Sea Hawks attacked the [[cantonment]] area in Chittagong, destroying several Pakistani army barracks. Medium anti-aircraft fire was encountered during this strike. Simultaneous attacks by Aliz\u00e9s continued on Cox's Bazar. After this, ''Vikrant''{{'}}s fuel levels dropped to less than 25 per cent, and the aircraft carrier sailed to [[Paradip]] for refueling.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=139}} The crew of INS ''Vikrant'' earned two [[Maha Vir Chakra]]s and twelve [[Vir Chakra]] gallantry medals for their part in the war.{{Sfn|Till|2013|p=171}}\n\n===Later years===\n\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) with a Sea King helicopter during Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.jpg|thumb|A Sea King helicopter with INS ''Vikrant'']]\n''Vikrant'' did not see much service after the war, and was given two major modernisation [[refit]]s\u2014the first one from 1979 to 1981 and the second one from 1987 to 1989.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2009|p=151}} In the first phase, her boilers, radars, communication systems  and anti-aircraft guns were modernised, and facilities to operate Sea Harriers were installed.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=276}} In the second phase, facilities to operate the new Sea Harrier Vertical/Short Take Off and Land (V/STOL) fighter aircraft and the new Sea King Mk 42B Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters were introduced.

This was sparked early in the 15th century by the search for [[trade route]]s to [[China]] that led directly to the [[Age of Discovery]], and the introduction of [[early modern warfare]] into what was then called the [[Far East]]. By the early 16th century the [[Age of Sail]] greatly expanded Western European influence and development of the [[Spice trade#Trade under colonialism|Spice Trade under colonialism]]. There has been a presence of Western European [[colonial empire]]s and [[imperialism]] in Asia throughout six centuries of [[colonialism]], formally ending with the independence of the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s last colony [[East Timor]] in 2002. The empires introduced Western concepts of [[nation]] and the [[multinational state]]. This article attempts to outline the consequent development of the Western concept of the [[nation state]].\n\nThe thrust of European political power, commerce, and culture in Asia gave rise to growing trade in [[commodity|commodities]]\u2014a key development in the rise of today's modern world [[capitalism|free market]] economy. In the 16th century, the Portuguese broke the (overland) monopoly of the Arabs and Italians of trade between Asia and [[Europe]] by the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] around the Cape of Good Hope.<ref>M. Weisner-Hanks, Early Modern Europe 1450\u20131789 (Cambridge, 2006)</ref> With the ensuing rise of the rival [[Dutch East India Company]], Portuguese influence in Asia was gradually eclipsed.{{#tag:ref| For fifty or sixty years, the Portuguese enjoyed the exclusive trade to China and Japan. In 1717, and again in 1732, the Chinese government offered to make Macao the emporium for all foreign trade, and to receive all duties on imports; but, by a strange infatuation, the Portuguese government refused, and its decline is dated from that period.<ref name =\"Roberts\">{{cite book |last=Roberts|first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Roberts (diplomat) |title=Embassy to the Eastern courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat : in the U.

Later, the English and the French established settlements in [[India]] and established a trade with [[China]] and their own acquisitions would gradually surpass those of the Dutch. Following the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, the British eliminated French influence in India and established the [[British East India Company]] as the most important political force on the [[Indian Subcontinent]].\n\nBefore the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the mid-to-late 19th century, demand for oriental goods such as ([[porcelain]], [[silk]], [[spice]]s and [[tea]]) remained the driving force behind European imperialism, and (with the important exception of British East India Company rule in India) the European stake in Asia remained confined largely to trading stations and strategic outposts necessary to protect trade. Industrialisation, however, dramatically increased European demand for Asian raw materials; and the severe [[Long Depression]] of the 1870s provoked a scramble for new markets for European industrial products and financial services in Africa, the Americas, Eastern Europe, and especially in Asia. This scramble coincided with a new era in global [[colonialism|colonial]] expansion known as \"the [[New Imperialism]]\", which saw a shift in focus from trade and [[indirect rule]] to formal colonial control of vast overseas territories ruled as political extensions of their mother countries. Between the 1870s and the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]\u2014the established colonial powers in Asia\u2014added to their empires vast expanses of territory in the [[Middle East]], the Indian Subcontinent, and [[South East Asia]]. In the same period, the [[Empire of Japan]], following the [[Meiji Restoration]]; the [[German Empire]], following the end of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871; [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]]; and the [[United States]], following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898, quickly emerged as new imperial powers in [[East Asia]] and in the Pacific Ocean area.\n\nIn Asia, World War I and [[World War II]] were played out as struggles among several key imperial powers\u2014conflicts involving the European powers along with Russia and the rising American and Japanese powers. None of the colonial powers, however, possessed the resources to withstand the strains of both world wars and maintain their direct rule in Asia. Although nationalist movements throughout the colonial world led to the political independence of nearly all of the Asia's remaining colonies, [[decolonisation]] was intercepted by the [[Cold War]]; and South East Asia, [[South Asia]], the Middle East, and East Asia remained embedded in a world economic, financial, and military system in which the great powers compete to extend their influence. However, the rapid post-war economic development of the [[East Asian Tigers]], [[India]], the [[People's Republic of China]], along with the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], have loosened European and American influence in Asia, generating speculation today about emergence of modern [[India]] and [[China]] as [[potential superpowers]].\n\n==Early European exploration of Asia==\nEuropean exploration of Asia started in [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] times. Knowledge of lands as distant as China were held by the Romans. Trade with India through the Roman Egyptian [[Red Sea]] ports was significant in the first centuries of the [[Common Era]].\n\n===Medieval European exploration of Asia===\n[[File:Marco Polo traveling.JPG|thumb|Illustration of [[Marco Polo]]'s arrival in a [[China|Chinese]] city]]\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, a number of Europeans, many of them Christian [[missionary|missionaries]], had sought to penetrate into China. The most famous of these travelers was [[Marco Polo]]. But these journeys had little permanent effect on East-West trade because of a series of political developments in Asia in the last decades of the 14th century, which put an end to further European exploration of Asia. The [[Yuan dynasty]] in China, which had been receptive to European missionaries and merchants, was overthrown, and the new [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] rulers were found to be unreceptive of religious proselytism. Meanwhile, the [[Turkish people|Turks]] consolidated control over the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], closing off key overland trade routes. Thus, until the 15th century, only minor trade and cultural exchanges between Europe and Asia continued at certain terminals controlled by Muslim traders.\n\n===Oceanic voyages to Asia===\nWestern European rulers determined to find new trade routes of their own. The Portuguese spearheaded the drive to find oceanic routes that would provide cheaper and easier access to South and East Asian goods. This chartering of oceanic routes between East and West began with the unprecedented voyages of Portuguese and Spanish sea captains. Their voyages were influenced by medieval European adventurers, who had journeyed overland to the Far East and contributed to geographical knowledge of parts of Asia upon their return.\n\nIn 1488, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa under the sponsorship of Portugal's [[John II of Portugal|John II]], from which point he noticed that the coast swung northeast ([[Cape of Good Hope]]). While Dias' crew forced him to turn back, by 1497, Portuguese navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] made the first open voyage from Europe to India. In 1520, [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese navigator in the service of the [[Crown of Castile]] ('[[Spain]]'), found a sea route into the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\n==Portuguese and Spanish trade and colonization in Asia==\n{{further|Portuguese Empire|Portuguese India Armadas|Manila galleon|Treaty of Tordesillas|Treaty of Zaragoza}}\n\n===Portuguese monopoly over trade in the Indian Ocean and Asia===\n\n[[File:Retrato de Afonso de Albuquerque (ap\u00f3s 1545) - Autor desconhecido.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Afonso de Albuquerque]]]]\nIn 1509, the Portuguese under [[Francisco de Almeida]] won the decisive [[battle of Diu]] against a joint [[Burji dynasty|Mamluk]] and Arab fleet sent to expel the Portuguese of the Arabian Sea. The victory enabled Portugal to implement its strategy of controlling the Indian Ocean.\n\nEarly in the 16th century [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (left) emerged as the Portuguese colonial viceroy most instrumental in consolidating Portugal's holdings in Africa and in Asia. He understood that Portugal could wrest commercial supremacy from the Arabs only by force, and therefore devised a plan to establish forts at strategic sites which would dominate the trade routes and also protect Portuguese interests on land. In 1510, he [[Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)|conquered Goa]] in India, which enabled him to gradually consolidate control of most of the commercial traffic between Europe and Asia, largely through trade; Europeans started to carry on trade from forts, acting as foreign merchants rather than as settlers. In contrast, early European expansion in the \"[[West Indies]]\", (later known to Europeans as a separate continent from Asia that they would call the \"[[Americas]]\") following the 1492 voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]], involved heavy settlement in colonies that were treated as political extensions of the mother countries.\n\nLured by the potential of high profits from another expedition, the Portuguese established a permanent base in [[History of Kochi|Cochin]], south of the Indian trade port of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] in the early 16th century. In 1510, the Portuguese, led by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], seized Goa on the coast of India, which [[Portugal]] held until 1961, along with [[Diu, India|Diu]] and [[Daman district, India|Daman]] (the remaining territory and enclaves in India from a former network of coastal towns and smaller fortified trading ports added and abandoned or lost centuries before). The Portuguese soon acquired a monopoly over trade in the Indian Ocean.\n\nPortuguese viceroy Albuquerque (1509\u20131515) resolved to consolidate Portuguese holdings in Africa and Asia, and secure control of trade with the [[East Indies]] and China. His first objective was [[Malacca]], which controlled the narrow strait through which most Far Eastern trade moved. [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Captured in 1511]], Malacca became the springboard for further eastward penetration, starting with the voyage of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]] and [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]] in 1512, ordered by Albuquerque, to the Moluccas. Years later the first trading posts were established in the [[Moluccas]], or \"Spice Islands\", which was the source for some of the world's most hotly demanded spices, and from there, in [[Makassar]] and some others, but smaller, in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. By 1513-1516, the first Portuguese ships had reached [[Guangdong|Canton]] on the southern coasts of China.\n\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|upright=2.8|[[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese expeditions]] 1415\u20131542: arrival places and dates; Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue); territories of the [[Portuguese empire]] under [[King John III of Portugal|King John III]] rule (green)]]\nIn 1513, after the failed attempt to conquer [[Aden]], Albuquerque entered with an armada, for the first time for Europeans by the ocean via, on the [[Red Sea]]; and in 1515, Albuquerque consolidated the Portuguese hegemony in the [[Persian Gulf]] gates, already begun by him in 1507, with the domain of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] and [[Ormuz]]. Shortly after, other fortified bases and forts were annexed and built along the Gulf, and in 1521, through a military campaign, the Portuguese annexed [[Bahrain]].\n\nThe Portuguese conquest of Malacca triggered the [[Malayan\u2013Portuguese war]]. In 1521, [[Ming dynasty]] China defeated the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and then defeated the Portuguese again at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]]. The Portuguese tried to establish trade with China by illegally smuggling with the pirates on the offshore islands{{Which|date=August 2016}} off the coast of [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]], but they were driven away by the [[Ming]] navy in the 1530s-1540's.\n\nIn 1557, China decided to lease [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] to the Portuguese as a place where they could dry goods they transported on their ships, which they held until 1999. The Portuguese, based at Goa and Malacca, had now established a lucrative maritime empire in the Indian Ocean meant to monopolise the [[spice trade]]. The Portuguese also began a channel of trade with the Japanese, becoming the first recorded Westerners to have visited Japan. This contact introduced Christianity and fire-arms into Japan.\n\nIn 1505, (also possibly before, in 1501), the Portuguese, through [[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]], the son of Francisco de Almeida, reached [[Ceylon]]. The Portuguese founded a fort at the city of [[Colombo]] in 1517 and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas and inland. In a series of military conflicts and political manoeuvres, the Portuguese extended their control over the [[Sinhala Kingdom|Sinhalese kingdoms]], including [[Jaffna Kingdom|Jaffna]] (1591), [[Kingdom of Raigama|Raigama]] (1593), [[Kingdom of Sitawaka|Sitawaka]] (1593), and [[Kingdom of Kotte|Kotte]] (1594)- However, the aim of unifying the entire island under Portuguese control faced the [[Kingdom of Kandy]]`s fierce resistance.<ref name=\"Fernando2013\">{{cite book|author=Jude Lal Fernando|title=Religion, Conflict and Peace in Sri Lanka: The Politics of Interpretation of Nationhoods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWInAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA135|date=11 June 2013|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=978-3-643-90428-7|page=135}}</ref> The Portuguese, led by [[Pedro Lopes de Sousa]], launched a full-scale military invasion of the kingdom of Kandy in the [[Campaign of Danture]] of 1594.

After fighting with the Portuguese by the Spice Islands since 1522 and the agreement between the two powers in 1529 (in the treaty of Zaragoza), the Spanish, led by [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]], settled and conquered gradually the Philippines since 1564. After the discovery of the return voyage to the Americas by [[Andres de Urdaneta]] in 1565, cargoes of Chinese goods were transported from the [[Philippines]] to [[Mexico]] and from there to [[Spain]]. By this long route, Spain reaped some of the profits of Far Eastern commerce. Spanish officials converted the islands to Christianity and established some settlements, permanently establishing the Philippines as the area of East Asia most oriented toward the West in terms of culture and commerce. The Moro Muslims fought against the Spanish for over three centuries in the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]].\n\n===Decline of Portugal's Asian empire since the 17th century===\n\nThe lucrative trade was vastly expanded when the Portuguese began to export [[Slavery|slave]]s from Africa in 1541; however, over time, the rise of the slave trade left Portugal over-extended, and vulnerable to competition from other Western European powers. Envious of Portugal's control of trade routes, other Western European nations\u2014mainly the [[Netherlands]], France, and England\u2014began to send in rival expeditions to Asia. In 1642, the Dutch drove the Portuguese out of the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] in Africa, the source of the bulk of Portuguese slave labourers, leaving this rich slaving area to other Europeans, especially the Dutch and the English.\n\nRival European powers began to make inroads in Asia as the Portuguese and Spanish trade in the Indian Ocean declined primarily because they had become hugely over-stretched financially due to the limitations on their investment capacity and contemporary naval technology. Both of these factors worked in tandem, making control over Indian Ocean trade extremely expensive.\n\nThe existing Portuguese interests in Asia proved sufficient to finance further colonial expansion and entrenchment in areas regarded as of greater strategic importance in [[Africa]] and [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. Portuguese maritime supremacy was lost to the Dutch in the 17th century, and with this came serious challenges for the Portuguese. However, they still clung to Macau, and settled a new colony on the island of [[Timor]]. It was as recent as the 1960s and 1970s that the Portuguese began to relinquish their colonies in Asia. Goa was invaded by India in 1961 and became an Indian state in 1987; [[Portuguese Timor]] was abandoned in 1975 and was then invaded by [[Indonesia]].

[[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]), [[Java]], c. 1665.]]\n\nPortuguese decline in Asia was accelerated by the attacks on their commercial empire by the Dutch and the English, which began a global struggle over empire in Asia that lasted until the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763. The Netherlands revolt against Spanish rule facilitated Dutch encroachment of the Portuguese monopoly over South and East Asian trade. The Dutch looked on Spain's trade and colonies as potential spoils in war. When the two crowns of the Iberian peninsula were joined in 1581, the Dutch felt free to attack Portuguese territories in Asia.\n\nBy the 1590s, a number of Dutch companies were formed to finance trading expeditions in Asia. Because competition lowered their profits, and because of the doctrines of [[mercantilism]], in 1602 the companies united into a [[cartel]] and formed the [[Dutch East India Company]], and received from the government the right to trade and colonise territory in the area stretching from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] eastward to the [[Strait of Magellan]].\n\nIn 1605, armed Dutch merchants captured the Portuguese fort at [[Ambon, Maluku|Amboyna]] in the Moluccas, which was developed into the first secure base of the company. Over time, the Dutch gradually consolidated control over the great trading ports of the East Indies. Control over the East Indies trading ports allowed the company to monopolise the world [[spice trade]] for decades. Their monopoly over the spice trade became complete after they drove the Portuguese from [[Malacca]] in 1641 and [[Ceylon]] in 1658.\n\n[[File:Colombo, after Kip.jpg|thumb|Colombo, [[Dutch Ceylon]], based on an engraving of circa 1680]]\nDutch East India Company colonies or outposts were later established in Atjeh ([[Aceh]]), 1667; [[Macassar, Mozambique|Macassar]], 1669; and [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]], 1682. The company established its headquarters at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (today [[Jakarta]]) on the island of [[Java (island)|Java]]. Outside the East Indies, the Dutch East India Company colonies or outposts were also established in [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), [[Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]] and part of India), [[Mauritius]] (1638-1658/1664-1710), [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Siam]] (now [[Thailand]]), [[Guangzhou]] (Canton, China), [[Taiwan]] (1624\u20131662), and southern India (1616\u20131795).\n\nMing dynasty China defeated the Dutch East India Company in the [[Sino-Dutch conflicts]]. The Chinese first [[Penghu#Ming-Dutch War|defeated and drove the Dutch out of the Pescadores in 1624]]. The Ming navy under [[Zheng Zhilong]] defeated the Dutch East India Company's fleet at the 1633 [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]]. In 1662, Zheng Zhilong's son [[Zheng Chenggong]] (also known as Koxinga) expelled the Dutch from Taiwan after defeating them in the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]]. (''see'' [[History of Taiwan]]) Further, the Dutch East India Company trade post on [[Dejima]] (1641\u20131857), an artificial island off the coast of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], was for a long time the only place where Europeans could trade with Japan.\n\nThe Vietnamese [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]] defeated the Dutch [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War#Later campaigns|in a naval battle in 1643]].\n\nThe Cambodians defeated the Dutch in the [[Cambodian\u2013Dutch War]] in 1644.\n\nIn 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] established an outpost at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] (the southwestern tip of Africa, currently in [[South Africa]]) to restock company ships on their journey to East Asia. This post later became a fully-fledged colony, the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] (1652\u20131806). As Cape Colony attracted increasing Dutch and European settlement, the Dutch founded the city of Kaapstad ([[Cape Town]]).\n\nBy 1669, the Dutch East India Company was the richest private company in history, with a huge fleet of merchant ships and warships, tens of thousands of employees, a private army consisting of thousands of soldiers, and a reputation on the part of its stockholders for high dividend payments.\n\n===Dutch New Imperialism in Asia===\n{{main|Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gouverneur Bijleveld met Sultan Hamengkoe Boewono VIII tijdens een bezoek aan de Kraton van de Sultan van Jogjakarta TMnr 60033546.jpg|thumb|upright|The Dutch Governor-General, highest authority in the colony and the Sultan of Jogjakarta.]]\nThe company was in almost constant conflict with the English; relations were particularly tense following the [[Amboyna Massacre]] in 1623. During the 18th century, [[Dutch East India Company]] possessions were increasingly focused on the East Indies. After [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|the fourth war]] between the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and England (1780\u20131784), the company suffered increasing financial difficulties. In 1799, the company was dissolved, commencing official colonisation of the [[East Indies]]. During the era of New Imperialism the territorial claims of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) expanded into a fully fledged colony named the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Partly driven by re-newed colonial aspirations of fellow European nation states the Dutch strived to establish unchallenged control of the [[archipelago]] now known as [[Indonesia]].\n\nSix years into formal colonisation of the East Indies, in Europe the [[Dutch Republic]] was occupied by the French forces of [[Napoleon]]. The Dutch government went into exile in England and formally ceded its colonial possessions to Great Britain. The pro-French Governor General of Java [[Jan Willem Janssens]], resisted [[Invasion of Java (1811)|a British invasion force in 1811]] until forced to surrender. British Governor [[Stamford Raffles|Raffles]], who the later founded the city of [[Singapore]], ruled the colony the following 10 years of the British [[interregnum]] (1806\u20131816).\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Napoleon]] and the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] colonial government of the East Indies was ceded back to the Dutch in 1817. The loss of South Africa and the continued scramble for Africa stimulated the Dutch to secure unchallenged dominion over its colony in the East Indies. The Dutch started to consolidate its power base through extensive military campaigns and elaborate diplomatic alliances with indigenous rulers ensuring the Dutch [[Triband (flag)|tricolor]] was firmly planted in all corners of the [[Archipelago]]. These military campaigns included: the [[Padri War]] (1821\u20131837), the [[Java War]] (1825\u20131830) and the [[Aceh War]] (1873\u20131904). This raised the need for a considerable military buildup of the colonial army ([[KNIL]]). From all over Europe soldiers were recruited to join the KNIL.<ref>Note: In 1819 the standing army consisted of over 7,000 European and 5,000 indigenous troops. See: Willems, Wim ''Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600-1942)''. (COMT, Leiden, 1994). Chapter I, P.24 {{ISBN|90-71042-44-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch concentrated their colonial enterprise in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (Indonesia) throughout the 19th century. The Dutch lost control over the East Indies to the Japanese during much of World War II.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klemen |first=L |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/ |title=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref> Following the war, the Dutch fought Indonesian independence forces after Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945. In 1949, most of what was known as the Dutch East Indies was ceded to the independent Republic of Indonesia. In 1962, also [[Dutch New Guinea]] was annexed by Indonesia de facto ending Dutch imperialism in Asia.\n\n==British in India==\n\n===Portuguese, French, and British competition in India (1600\u20131763)===\n[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive]]\nThe English sought to stake out claims in India at the expense of the Portuguese dating back to the [[Elizabethan era]]. In 1600, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] incorporated the [[British East India Company|English East India Company]] (later the British East India Company), granting it a monopoly of trade from the Cape of Good Hope eastward to the Strait of Magellan. In 1639, it acquired [[Madras]] on the east coast of India, where it quickly surpassed Portuguese Goa as the principal European trading centre on the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nThrough bribes, diplomacy, and manipulation of weak native rulers, the company prospered in India, where it became the most powerful political force, and outrivaled its Portuguese and French competitors. For more than one hundred years, English and French trading companies had fought one another for supremacy, and, by the middle of the 18th century, competition between the British and the French had heated up. French defeat by the British under the command of [[Robert Clive]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763) marked the end of the French stake in India.\n\n===Collapse of Mughal India===\n{{main|Company rule in India}}\nThe British East India Company, although still in direct competition with French and Dutch interests until 1763, was able to extend its control over almost the whole of India in the century following the subjugation of Bengal at the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]]. The British East India Company made great advances at the expense of a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dynasty.\n\nThe reign of Aurangzeb had marked the height of Mughal power, By 1690. Mughal territorial expansion reached its greatest extent, Aurangzeb's Empire encompassed the entire Indian Subcontinent. But this period of power was followed by one of decline. Fifty years after the death of Aurangzeb, the great Mughal empire had crumbled. Meanwhile, marauding warlords, nobles, and others bent on gaining power left the [[Subcontinent]] increasingly anarchic. Although the Mughals kept the imperial title until 1858, the central government had collapsed, creating a power vacuum.\n\n===From Company to Crown===\n{{main|British Raj}}\n[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|upright=1.75|The [[British Empire]] in 1920]]\n\nAside from defeating the French during the Seven Years' War, [[Robert Clive]], the leader of the Company in India, defeated a key Indian ruler of Bengal at the decisive [[Battle of Plassey]] (1757), a victory that ushered in the beginning of a new period in Indian history, that of informal British rule. While still nominally the sovereign, the Mughal Indian emperor became more and more of a puppet ruler, and anarchy spread until the company stepped into the role of policeman of India. The transition to formal imperialism, characterised by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] being crowned \"Empress of India\" in the 1870s was a gradual process. The first step toward cementing formal British control extended back to the late 18th century. The British Parliament, disturbed by the idea that a great business concern, interested primarily in profit, was controlling the destinies of millions of people, passed acts in 1773 and 1784 that gave itself the power to control company policies and to appoint the highest company official in India, the [[Governor-General]]. (This system of dual control lasted until 1858.) By 1818, the East India Company was master of all of India. Some local rulers were forced to accept its overlordship; others were deprived of their territories. Some portions of India were administered by the British directly; in others native dynasties were retained under British supervision.\n\n[[File:Battle of ferozeshah(H Martens).jpg|thumb|The [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], 1845-46]]\nUntil 1858, however, much of India was still officially the dominion of the Mughal emperor. Anger among some social groups, however, was seething under the governor-generalship of [[James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 10th Earl of Dalhousie|James Dalhousie]] (1847\u20131856), who annexed the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] (1849) after victory in the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second Sikh War]], annexed seven princely states using the [[doctrine of lapse]], annexed the key state of [[Oudh]] on the basis of misgovernment, and upset cultural sensibilities by banning Hindu practices such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]].\n\nThe 1857 [[Indian Mutiny|Sepoy Rebellion]], or Indian Mutiny, an uprising initiated by Indian troops, called sepoys, who formed the bulk of the Company's armed forces, was the key turning point. Rumour had spread among them that their bullet cartridges were lubricated with pig and cow fat. The cartridges had to be bit open, so this upset the [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] soldiers. The [[Hindu]] religion held cows sacred, and for Muslims pork was considered [[haraam]]. In one camp, 85 out of 90 sepoys would not accept the cartridges from their garrison officer. The British harshly punished those who would not by jailing them. The Indian people were outraged, and on May 10, 1857, sepoys marched to [[Delhi]], and, with the help of soldiers stationed there, captured it. Fortunately for the British, many areas remained loyal and quiescent, allowing the revolt to be crushed after fierce fighting. One important consequence of the revolt was the final collapse of the Mughal dynasty. The mutiny also ended the system of dual control under which the British government and the British East India Company shared authority. The government relieved the company of its political responsibilities, and in 1858, after 258 years of existence, the company relinquished its role. Trained civil servants were recruited from graduates of British universities, and these men set out to rule India. Lord Canning (created earl in 1859), appointed Governor-General of India in 1856, became known as \"Clemency Canning\" as a term of derision for his efforts to restrain revenge against the Indians during the Indian Mutiny. When the Government of India was transferred from the Company to the Crown, Canning became the first [[viceroy]] of India.\n\nThe Company initiated the first of the [[Anglo-Burmese wars]] in 1824, which led to total annexation of Burma by the Crown in 1885. The [[British rule in Burma|British ruled Burma]] as a [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|province of British India]] until 1937, then administered her separately under the [[Burma Office]] except during the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]], 1942\u20131945, until granted independence on 4 January 1948. (Unlike India, Burma opted not to join the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].)\n\n===Rise of Indian nationalism===\n{{main|Indian independence movement}}\nThe denial of equal status to Indians was the immediate stimulus for the formation in 1885 of the [[Indian National Congress]], initially loyal to the Empire but committed from 1905 to increased self-government and by 1930 to outright independence. The \"Home charges\", payments transferred from India for administrative costs, were a lasting source of nationalist grievance, though the flow declined in relative importance over the decades to independence in 1947.\n\nAlthough majority [[Hindu]] and minority [[Muslim]] political leaders were able to collaborate closely in their criticism of British policy into the 1920s, British support for a distinct Muslim political organisation, the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] from 1906 and insistence from the 1920s on separate electorates for religious minorities, is seen by many in India as having contributed to Hindu-Muslim discord and the country's eventual [[Partition of India|Partition]].\n\n==France in Indochina==\n{{main|French Indochina}}\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Frenchindochina.jpg|thumb|French soldiers appear with local residents at a military post in French Indochina in the early 1900s.]] -->\n[[File:CaptureOfLang-Son.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The capture of [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]] in 1885]]\nFrance, which had lost its empire to the [[Great Britain|British]] by the end of the 18th century, had little geographical or commercial basis for expansion in Southeast Asia. After the 1850s, French imperialism was initially impelled by a [[nationalistic]] need to rival the United Kingdom and was supported intellectually by the notion that French culture was superior to that of the people of [[Name of Vietnam|Annam]] (Vietnam), and its ''[[mission civilisatrice]]''\u2014or its \"civilizing mission\" of the Annamese through their assimilation to French culture and the Catholic religion. The pretext for French expansionism in [[Indochina]] was the protection of French religious missions in the area, coupled with a desire to find a southern route to China through [[Tonkin]], the European name for a region of northern [[Vietnam]].\n\nFrench religious and commercial interests were established in Indochina as early as the 17th century, but no concerted effort at stabilizing the French position was possible in the face of British strength in the Indian Ocean and [[Napoleonic Wars|French defeat]] in Europe at the beginning of the 19th century. A mid-19th century religious revival under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] provided the atmosphere within which interest in Indochina grew. Anti-Christian persecutions in the Far East provided the pretext for the bombardment of Tourane (Danang) in 1847, and invasion and occupation of Danang in 1857 and Saigon in 1858. Under [[Napoleon III]], France decided that French trade with China would be surpassed by the British, and accordingly the French joined the British against China in the [[Second Opium War]] from 1857 to 1860, and occupied parts of Vietnam as its gateway to China.\n\nBy the [[Treaty of Saigon]] in 1862, on June 5, the Vietnamese emperor ceded France three provinces of southern Vietnam to form the French colony of [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]]; France also secured trade and religious privileges in the rest of Vietnam and a protectorate over Vietnam's foreign relations. Gradually French power spread through exploration, the establishment of protectorates, and outright annexations. Their seizure of [[Hanoi]] in 1882 led directly to war with China (1883\u20131885), and the French victory confirmed French supremacy in the region. France governed [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]] as a direct colony, and central and northern Vietnam under the protectorates of [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]], and [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|Cambodia]] as protectorates in one degree or another. [[Laos]] too was soon brought under [[French colonial administration of Laos|French \"protection\"]].\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, France had created an empire in [[Indochina]] nearly 50 percent larger than the mother country. A Governor-General in [[Hanoi]] ruled [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]] directly and the other regions through a system of residents. Theoretically, the French maintained the precolonial rulers and administrative structures in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]], [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]], [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]], [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|Cambodia]], and [[French Protectorate of Laos|Laos]], but in fact the governor-generalship was a centralised fiscal and administrative regime ruling the entire region. Although the surviving native institutions were preserved in order to make French rule more acceptable, they were almost completely deprived of any independence of action. The ethnocentric French colonial administrators sought to assimilate the upper classes into France's \"superior culture.\" While the French improved public services and provided commercial stability, the native standard of living declined and precolonial social structures eroded. Indochina, which had a population of over eighteen million in 1914, was important to France for its [[tin]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[coal]], [[cotton]], and [[rice]]. It is still a matter of debate, however, whether the colony was commercially profitable.\n\n==Russia and \"The Great Game\"==\n{{main|The Great Game}}\n{{see also|Russian conquest of Siberia|Russian conquest of Turkestan}}\n[[File:KarazinNN VstRusVoyskGRM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Russian troops taking [[Samarkand]] in 1868.]]\n[[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] is not often regarded as a colonial power such as the United Kingdom or France because of the manner of Russian expansions: unlike the United Kingdom, which expanded overseas, the Russian empire grew from the centre outward by a process of accretion, like the United States. In the 19th century, Russian expansion took the form of a struggle of an effectively [[landlocked]] country for access to a [[warm water port]].\n\nQing China defeated Russia in the [[Sino-Russian border conflicts]].\n\nWhile the British were consolidating their hold on India, Russian expansion had moved steadily eastward to the Pacific, then toward the Middle East. In the early 19th century it succeeded in conquering the [[South Caucasus]] and [[Dagestan]] from [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]] following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u201313)]], the [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u201328)]] and the out coming treaties of [[Treaty of Gulistan|Gulistan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|Turkmenchay]],<ref>Allen F. Chew. ''An Atlas of Russian History: Eleven Centuries of Changing Borders''. Yale University Press, 1967. pp 74.</ref> giving Russia direct borders with both Persia's as well as [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey's]] heartlands. Later, they eventually reached the frontiers of [[Afghanistan]] as well (which had the largest foreign border adjacent to British holdings in India). In response to Russian expansion, the defense of India's land frontiers and the control of all sea approaches to the [[Subcontinent]] via the [[Suez Canal]], the [[Red Sea]], and the [[Persian Gulf]] became preoccupations of British foreign policy in the 19th century.\n\nAnglo-Russian rivalry in the Middle East and Central Asia led to a brief confrontation over [[Afghanistan]] in the 1870s. In [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), both nations set up banks to extend their economic influence. The United Kingdom went so far as to invade [[Tibet]], a land subordinate to the Chinese empire, in 1904, but withdrew when it became clear that Russian influence was insignificant and when Chinese resistance proved tougher than expected.\n\nIn 1907, the United Kingdom and [[Russia]] signed an agreement which \u2014 on the surface \u2014ended their rivalry in Central Asia. (''see'' [[Anglo-Russian Entente]]) As part of the entente, Russia agreed to deal with the sovereign of [[Afghanistan]] only through British intermediaries. In turn, the United Kingdom would not annex or occupy [[Afghanistan]]. Chinese suzerainty over [[Tibet]] also was recognised by both Russia and the United Kingdom, since nominal control by a weak China was preferable to control by either power. Persia was divided into Russian and British spheres of influence and an intervening \"neutral\" zone. The United Kingdom and Russia chose to reach these uneasy compromises because of growing concern on the part of both powers over German expansion in strategic areas of China and Africa.\n\nFollowing the entente, Russia increasingly intervened in Persian domestic politics and suppressed nationalist movements that threatened both [[St. Petersburg]] and [[London]]. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Russia gave up its claim to a sphere of influence, though [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] involvement persisted alongside the United Kingdom's until the 1940s.\n\nIn the [[Middle East]], in [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] (Iran) and the [[Ottoman Empire]], a German company built a railroad from [[Constantinople]] to [[Baghdad]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] in the latter, while it built [[Trans-Iranian Railway|a railroad]] from the north of the country to the south, connecting the [[Caucasus]] with the Persian Gulf in the former.<ref>Mohammad Gholi Majd.

During the 18th century, merchants from Western Europe came to China in increasing numbers. However, merchants were confined to Guangzhou and the Portuguese colony of Macau, as they had been since the 16th century. European traders were increasingly irritated by what they saw as the relatively high customs duties they had to pay and by the attempts to curb the growing import trade in [[opium]]. By 1800, its importation was forbidden by the imperial government. However, the opium trade continued to boom.\n\nEarly in the 19th century, serious internal weaknesses developed in the [[Qing dynasty]] that left China vulnerable to Western, [[Meiji period]] Japanese, and [[History of Russia (1855\u201392)|Russian]] imperialism. In 1839, China found itself fighting the [[First Opium War]] with Britain. China was defeated, and in 1842, signed the provisions of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] which were first of the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] signed during the Qing Dynasty. [[Hong Kong Island]] was ceded to Britain, and certain ports, including [[Shanghai]] and [[Guangzhou]], were opened to British trade and residence. In 1856, the [[Second Opium War]] broke out. The Chinese were again defeated, and now forced to the terms of the 1858 [[Treaty of Tientsin]]. The treaty opened new ports to trade and allowed foreigners to travel in the interior. In addition, Christians gained the right to propagate their religion. The United States [[Treaty of Wanghia]] and Russia later obtained the same prerogatives in separate treaties.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, China appeared on the way to territorial dismemberment and economic vassalage\u2014the fate of India's rulers that played out much earlier. Several provisions of these treaties caused long-standing bitterness and humiliation among the Chinese: extraterritoriality (meaning that in a dispute with a Chinese person, a Westerner had the right to be tried in a court under the laws of his own country), customs regulation, and the right to station foreign warships in Chinese waters, including its navigable rivers.\n\nJane E. Elliott criticized the allegation that China refused to modernize or was unable to defeat Western armies as simplistic, noting that China embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats, buying weapons from Western countries and manufacturing their own at arsenals, such as the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In addition, Elliott questioned the claim that Chinese society was traumatized by the Western victories, as many Chinese peasants (90% of the population at that time) living outside the concessions continued about their daily lives, uninterrupted and without any feeling of \"humiliation\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC&q=chinese+fire+power+pinned+down+enemy#v=snippet&q=defeat%20peasants%20not%20humiliated%20at%20all&f=false|title=Some did it for civilisation, some did it for their country: a revised view of the boxer war|author=Jane E.

Dreyer said that \"China\u2019s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go......In the Arrow War (1856-60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing.

[[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u20135]]\nThe rise of Japan since the [[Meiji Restoration]] as an imperial power led to further subjugation of China. In a dispute over China's longstanding claim of suzerainty in [[Korea]], war broke out between China and Japan, resulting in humiliating defeat for the Chinese. By the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (1895), China was forced to recognize effective Japanese rule of Korea and Taiwan was ceded to Japan until its recovery in 1945 at the end of the WWII by the Republic of China.\n\nChina's defeat at the hands of [[Japan]] was another trigger for future aggressive actions by Western powers. In 1897, [[Germany]] demanded and was given a set of exclusive mining and railroad rights in [[Shandong]] province. Russia obtained access to [[Dairen]] and [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]] and the right to build a railroad across Manchuria, thereby achieving complete domination over a large portion of northwestern China. The United Kingdom and France also received a number of [[Concession (territory)|concessions]]. At this time, much of China was divided up into \"spheres of influence\": Germany dominated [[Jiaozhou Bay|Jiaozhou (Kiaochow) Bay]], [[Shandong]], and the [[Yellow River]] valley; Russia dominated the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and Manchuria; the United Kingdom dominated [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]] and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] Valley; and France dominated the [[Guangzhou Bay]] and several other southern provinces.\n\n[[File:Boxer Rebellion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|British and Japanese forces engage [[Fists of Righteous Harmony|Boxers]] in battle, 1900]]\nChina continued to be divided up into these spheres until the United States, which had no sphere of influence, grew alarmed at the possibility of its businessmen being excluded from Chinese markets. In 1899, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Hay]] asked the major powers to agree to a policy of equal trading privileges. In 1900, several powers agreed to the U.S.-backed scheme, giving rise to the \"[[Open Door Policy|Open Door]]\" policy, denoting freedom of commercial access and non-annexation of Chinese territory. In any event, it was in the European powers' interest to have a weak but independent Chinese government. The privileges of the Europeans in China were guaranteed in the form of treaties with the Qing government. In the event that the Qing government totally collapsed, each power risked losing the privileges that it already had negotiated.\n\nThe erosion of Chinese sovereignty and seizures of land from Chinese by foreigners contributed to a spectacular anti-foreign outbreak in June 1900, when the \"[[Fists of Righteous Harmony|Boxers]]\" (properly the society of the \"righteous and harmonious fists\") attacked foreigners around [[Beijing]]. The Imperial Court was divided into anti-foreign and pro-foreign factions, with the pro-foreign faction led by [[Ronglu]] and [[Prince Qing]] hampering any military effort by the anti-foreign faction led by [[Prince Duan]] and [[Dong Fuxiang]]. The Qing Empress Dowager ordered all diplomatic ties to be cut off and all foreigners to leave the legations in Beijing to go to [[Tianjin]]. The foreigners refused to leave. [[Siege of the International Legations#False propaganda|Fueled by entirely false reports that the foreigners in the legations were massacred]], the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] decided to launch an expedition on Beijing to reach the legations but they underestimated the Qing military. The Qing and Boxers defeated the foreigners at the [[Seymour Expedition]], forcing them to turn back at the [[Battle of Langfang]]. In response to the foreign attack [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|on Dagu Forts]] the Qing responded by declaring war against the foreigners. the Qing forces and foreigners fought a fierce battle at the [[Battle of Tientsin]] before the foreigners could launch a second expedition. On their second try [[Gaselee Expedition]], with a much larger force, the foreigners managed to reach Beijing and fight the [[Battle of Peking (1900)]]. British and French forces looted, plundered and burned the [[Old Summer Palace]] to the ground for the second time (the first time being in 1860, following the Second Opium War). German forces were particularly severe in exacting revenge for the killing of their ambassador due to the orders of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who held anti-Asian sentiments, while Russia tightened its hold on Manchuria in the northeast until its crushing defeat by Japan in the war of 1904\u20131905. The Qing court evacuated to [[Xi'an]] and threatened to continue the war against foreigners, until the foreigners tempered their demands in the [[Boxer Protocol]], promising that China would not have to give up any land and gave up the demands for the execution of Dong Fuxiang and Prince Duan.\n\nThe correspondent Douglas Story observed Chinese troops in 1907 and praised their abilities and military skill.<ref name=\"Story1907\">{{cite book|author=Douglas Story|title=To-morrow in the East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbRGAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA224&dq=In+the+hunting-park,+three+miles+to+the+south+of+Peking,+is+quartered+the+Sixth+Division,+which+supplies+the+Guards+for+the+Imperial+Palace,+consisting+of+a+battalion+of+infantry+and+a+squadron+of+cavalry.+With+this+Division+Yuan+Shi+Kai+retains+twenty-six+modified+Krupp+guns,+which+are+the+best+of+his+artillery+arm,+and+excel+any+guns+possessed+by+the+foreign+legations+in+Peking.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivmemgrPXJAhVLmR4KHeZeB90Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=In%20the%20hunting-park%2C%20three%20miles%20to%20the%20south%20of%20Peking%2C%20is%20quartered%20the%20Sixth%20Division%2C%20which%20supplies%20the%20Guards%20for%20the%20Imperial%20Palace%2C%20consisting%20of%20a%20battalion%20of%20infantry%20and%20a%20squadron%20of%20cavalry.%20With%20this%20Division%20Yuan%20Shi%20Kai%20retains%20twenty-six%20modified%20Krupp%20guns%2C%20which%20are%20the%20best%20of%20his%20artillery%20arm%2C%20and%20excel%20any%20guns%20possessed%20by%20the%20foreign%20legations%20in%20Peking.&f=false|year=1907|publisher=Chapman & Hall, Limited|pages=224\u2013}}</ref>\n\nExtraterritorial jurisdiction was abandoned by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1943.

Richards|pages=256\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAs the United States emerged as a new imperial power in the Pacific and Asia, one of the two oldest Western imperialist powers in the regions, [[Spain]], was finding it increasingly difficult to maintain control of territories it had held in the regions since the 16th century. In 1896, a widespread revolt against Spanish rule broke out in the Philippines. Meanwhile, the recent string of U.S. territorial gains in the Pacific posed an even greater threat to Spain's remaining colonial holdings.\n\nAs the U.S. continued to expand its economic and military power in the Pacific, it declared war against Spain in 1898. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], U.S. Admiral Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet at [[Manila]] and U.S. troops landed in the Philippines. Spain later agreed by treaty to cede the Philippines in Asia and [[Guam]] in the Pacific. In the Caribbean, Spain ceded [[Puerto Rico]] to the U.S. The war also marked the end of Spanish rule in Cuba, which was to be granted nominal independence but remained heavily influenced by the U.S. government and U.S. business interests. One year following its treaty with Spain, the U.S. occupied the small Pacific outpost of [[Wake Island]].\n\nThe Filipinos, who assisted U.S. troops in fighting the Spanish, wished to establish an independent state and, on June 12, 1898, [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Spain. In 1899, fighting between the Filipino nationalists and the U.S. broke out; it took the U.S. almost fifteen years to fully subdue the [[Philippine\u2013American War|insurgency]]. The U.S. sent 70,000 troops and suffered thousands of casualties. The Filipinos insurgents, however, suffered considerably higher casualties than the Americans. Most casualties in the war were civilians dying primarily from disease.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html|author=John M. Gates|title=The U.S. Army and Irregular Warfare|chapter=The Pacification of the Philippines|publisher=wooster.edu|accessdate=2012-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629045949/http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html|archive-date=2014-06-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\nU.S. attacks into the countryside often included scorched earth campaigns where entire villages were burned and destroyed, and concentrated civilians into camps known as \"protected zones\". Most of these civilian casualties resulted from disease and famine. Reports of the execution of U.S. soldiers taken prisoner by the Filipinos led to disproportionate reprisals by American forces.\n\nThe Moro Muslims fought against the Americans in the [[Moro Rebellion]].\n\nIn 1914, [[Dean C. Worcester]], U.S. Secretary of the Interior for the Philippines (1901\u20131913) described \"the regime of civilisation and improvement which started with American occupation and resulted in developing naked savages into cultivated and educated men\". Nevertheless, some Americans, such as [[Mark Twain]], deeply opposed American involvement/imperialism in the Philippines, leading to the abandonment of attempts to construct a permanent U.S. naval base and using it as an entry point to the Chinese market. In 1916, Congress guaranteed the independence of the Philippines by 1945.\n\n==World War I: Changes in Imperialism==\nWorld War I brought about the fall of several empires in Europe. This had repercussions around the world. The defeated [[Central Powers]] included [[Germany]] and the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Germany]] lost all of its colonies in Asia. German New Guinea, a part of [[Papua New Guinea]], became administered by [[Australia]]. German possessions and concessions in China, including [[Qingdao]], became the subject of a controversy during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] when the [[Beiyang government]] in China agreed to cede these interests to [[Japan]], to the anger of many Chinese people. Although the Chinese diplomats refused to sign the agreement, these interests were ceded to [[Japan]] with the support of the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[Turkey]] gave up her provinces; [[Syria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Mesopotamia]] (now [[Iraq]]) came under French and British control as [[League of Nations Mandates]]. The discovery of [[petroleum]] first in [[Iran]] and then in the Arab lands in the interbellum provided a new focus for activity on the part of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.\n\n==Japan==\n{{main|Japanese imperialism|Japanese expansionism}}\n[[File:Dutch personnel and Japanese women watching an incoming towed Dutch sailing ship at Dejima by Kawahara Keiga.jpg|thumb|Europeans in [[Dejima]], the Dutch trading colony in the harbor of Nagasaki, early 19th century.]]\n\nIn 1641, all Westerners were thrown out of Japan. For the next two centuries, Japan was free from Western influence, except for at the port of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], which Japan allowed Dutch merchant vessels to enter on a limited basis.\n\nJapan's freedom from Western penetration ended on 8 July 1853, when [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] of the [[U.S. Navy]] sailed a squadron of black-hulled warships into [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]) harbor. The Japanese told Perry to sail to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] but he refused. Perry sought to present a letter from U.S. President [[Millard Fillmore]] to the emperor which demanded concessions from Japan. Japanese authorities responded by stating that they could not present the letter directly to the emperor, but scheduled a meeting on July 14 with a representative of the emperor. On 14 July, the squadron sailed towards the shore, giving a demonstration of their cannon's firepower thirteen times. Perry landed with a large detachment of Marines and presented the emperor's representative with Fillmore's letter. Perry said he would return, and did so, this time with even more war ships. The U.S. show of force led to Japan's concession to the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] on 31 March 1854. This treaty conferred extraterritoriality on American nationals, as well as, opening up further treaty ports beyond Nagasaki. This treaty was followed up by similar treaties with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia and France. These events made Japanese authorities aware that the country was lacking technologically and needed the strength of industrialism in order to keep their power. This realisation eventually led to a civil war and political reform known the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nThe [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868 led to administrative overhaul, deflation and subsequent rapid economic development. Japan had limited natural resources of her own and sought both overseas markets and sources of raw materials, fuelling a drive for imperial conquest which began with the defeat of China in 1895.\n\n[[File:Martial law, Korea 1900s.jpg|thumb|Three [[Korea under Japanese rule|Koreans]] shot for pulling up rails as a protest against seizure of land without payment by Japanese.]]\nTaiwan, ceded by [[Qing Dynasty]] China, became the first Japanese colony. In 1899, Japan won agreements from the [[great powers]]' to abandon extraterritoriality for their citizens, and an alliance with the United Kingdom established it in 1902 as an international power. Its spectacular defeat of Russia's navy in 1905 gave it the southern half of the island of [[Sakhalin]]; exclusive Japanese influence over Korea (propinquity); the former Russian lease of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] with Port Arthur ([[L\u00fcshunkou]]); and extensive rights in Manchuria (see the [[Russo-Japanese War]]).\n\nThe Empire of Japan and the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in Korea formed bilateral diplomatic relations in 1876. China lost its suzerainty of Korea after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Russia also lost influence on the Korean peninsula with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese war]] in 1904. The Joseon Dynasty became increasingly dependent on Japan. Korea became a protectorate of Japan with the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1905]]. Korea was then ''de jure'' annexed to Japan with the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910]].\n\nJapan was now one of the most powerful forces in the [[Far East]], and in 1914, it entered World War I on the side of the Allies, seizing German-occupied [[Jiaozhou Bay|Kiaochow]] and subsequently demanding Chinese acceptance of Japanese political influence and territorial acquisitions ([[Twenty-One Demands]], 1915). [[May Fourth Movement|Mass protests in Peking]] in 1919 coupled with Allied (and particularly U.S.) opinion led to Japan's abandonment of most of the demands and Joseon's 1922 return to China. Japan received the German territory from the Treaty of Versailles, 1919, sparking widespread Chinese nationalism.\n\nTensions with China increased over the 1920s, and in 1931 Japanese army units based in Manchuria seized control of the region without direction from Tokyo. Intermittent conflict with China led to full-scale war in mid-1937, drawing Japan toward an overambitious bid for Asian hegemony ([[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]), which ultimately led to defeat and the loss of all its overseas territories after World War II (see [[Japanese expansionism]] and [[Japanese nationalism]]).\n\n==After World War II ==\n\n===Decolonisation and the rise of nationalism in Asia===\nIn the aftermath of World War II, European colonies, controlling more than one billion people throughout the world, still ruled most of the Middle East, South East Asia, and the Indian Subcontinent. However, the image of European pre-eminence was shattered by the wartime Japanese occupations of large portions of British, French, and Dutch territories in the Pacific. The destabilisation of European rule led to the rapid growth of nationalist movements in Asia\u2014especially in Indonesia, [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Myanmar|Burma]], and French [[Indochina]].\n[[File:Aden7-1967.jpg|thumb|[[British Forces Aden|British Army]]'s counter-insurgency campaign in the British controlled territories of [[Federation of South Arabia|South Arabia]], 1967]]\n\nThe war, however, only accelerated forces already in existence undermining Western imperialism in Asia. Throughout the colonial world, the processes of urbanisation and capitalist investment created professional merchant classes that emerged as new Westernised elites. While imbued with Western political and economic ideas, these classes increasingly grew to resent their unequal status under European rule.\n\n====British in India and the Middle East====\nIn India, the westward movement of Japanese forces towards Bengal during World War II had led to major concessions on the part of British authorities to Indian nationalist leaders. In 1947, the United Kingdom, devastated by war and embroiled in economic crisis at home, granted [[British India]] its independence as two nations: India and [[Pakistan]]. The following year independence was granted to Burma and [[Ceylon]]. In the Middle East, the United Kingdom granted independence to [[Jordan]] in 1946 and two years later ended its mandate of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\n====Dutch East Indies====\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Nederlandse militairen controleren de papieren van Javaanse vrouwen bij het transitkamp van de Zeven December Divisie bij Tandjong Priok of het hierna door de divisie betrokken Kamp Doeri Batavia TMnr 10029000.jpg|thumb|Dutch soldiers control the papers of [[Java]]nese women, 1946]]\nFollowing the end of the war, nationalists in Indonesia demanded complete independence from the Netherlands. A brutal conflict ensued, and finally, in 1949, through [[United Nations]] mediation, the Dutch East Indies achieved independence, becoming the new nation of Indonesia. Dutch imperialism moulded this new multi-ethnic state comprising roughly 3,000 islands of the Indonesian archipelago with a population at the time of over 100 million.\n\nThe end of Dutch rule opened up latent tensions between the roughly 300 distinct ethnic groups of the islands, with the major ethnic fault line being between the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and the non-Javanese.\n\n[[Netherlands New Guinea]] was under the Dutch administration until 1962 (see also [[West New Guinea dispute]]).\n\n====United States in Asia====\nIn the Philippines, the U.S. remained committed to its previous pledges to grant the islands their independence, and the Philippines became the first of the Western-controlled Asian colonies to be granted independence post-World War II. However, the Philippines remained under pressure to adopt a political and economic system similar to their old imperial master.\n\nThis aim was greatly complicated by the rise of new political forces. During the war, the ''[[Hukbalahap]]'' (People's Army), which had strong ties to the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (PKP), fought against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines and won strong popularity among many sectors of the Filipino working class and peasantry. In 1946, the PKP participated in elections as part of the Democratic Alliance. However, with the onset of the [[Cold War]], its growing political strength drew a reaction from the ruling government and the United States, resulting in the repression of the PKP and its associated organisations. In 1948, the PKP began organizing an armed struggle against the government and continued U.S. military presence. In 1950, the PKP created the People's Liberation Army (''Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan''), which mobilised thousands of troops throughout the islands. The insurgency lasted until 1956, when the PKP gave up armed struggle.\n\nIn 1968, the PKP underwent a split, and in 1969 the [[Maoist]] faction of the PKP created the [[New People's Army]]. Maoist rebels re-launched an armed struggle against the government and the U.S. military presence in the Philippines, which continues to this day.\n\n====France in Indochina====\n\n=====Post-war resistance to French rule=====\n[[File:1stIndochinaWar001.jpg|thumb|French Marine commandos wade ashore off the [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] coast in July 1950]]\nFrance remained determined to retain its control of [[Indochina]]. However, in [[Hanoi]], in 1945, a broad front of nationalists and communists led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] declared an independent Republic of Vietnam, commonly referred to as the [[Viet Minh]] regime by Western outsiders. France, seeking to regain control of Vietnam, countered with a vague offer of self-government under French rule. France's offers were unacceptable to Vietnamese nationalists; and in December 1946 the Vi\u1ec7t Minh launched a rebellion against the French authority governing the colonies of French Indochina. The first few years of the war involved a low-level rural insurgency against French authority. However, after the Chinese communists reached the Northern border of Vietnam in 1949, the conflict turned into a conventional war between two armies equipped with modern weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>Fall, ''Street Without Joy'', p. 17.</ref> Meanwhile, the France granted the [[State of Vietnam]] based in [[Saigon]] independence in 1949 while [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] received independence in 1953. The US recognized the regime in Saigon, and provided the French military effort with military aid.\n\nMeanwhile, in Vietnam, the French war against the Viet Minh continued for nearly eight years. The French were gradually worn down by guerrilla and jungle fighting. The turning point for France occurred at [[Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954, which resulted in the surrender of ten thousand French troops. [[Paris]] was forced to accept a political settlement that year at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], which led to a precarious set of agreements regarding the future political status of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.\n\n==List of European colonies in Asia==\n* [[British Burma]] (1824\u20131948, merged with [[British Raj|India]] by the British from 1886 to 1937)\n* [[Ceylon]] (now

Generally, information entropy is the average amount of information conveyed by an event, when considering all possible outcomes.]]\n\n'''Information entropy''' is the [[expected value|average]] rate at which [[information]] is produced by a [[stochastic]] source of data.\n\nThe measure of information entropy associated with each possible data value is the negative [[logarithm]] of the [[probability mass function]] for the value. Thus, when the data source has a lower-probability value (i.e., when a low-probability event occurs), the event carries more \"information\" (\"surprisal\") than when the source data has a higher-probability value. The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a [[random variable]] whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, ''entropy'' refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|definition used]] in [[statistical thermodynamics]]. The concept of information entropy was introduced by [[Claude Shannon]] in his 1948 paper \"[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]\".<ref name=shannonPaper>{{cite journal |last=Shannon |first=Claude E. |authorlink=Claude Shannon |title=[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]] |journal=[[Bell System Technical Journal]] |volume=27 |issue=3 |date=July\u2013October 1948 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120615000000*/https://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol27-1948/articles/bstj27-3-379.pdf PDF], archived from [http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol27-1948/articles/bstj27-3-379.pdf here])</ref>{{rp|379\u2013423}}\n\nThe basic model of a [[data communication]] system is composed of three elements, a source of data, a [[communication channel]], and a receiver, and \u2013 as expressed by Shannon \u2013 the \"fundamental problem of communication\" is for the receiver to be able to identify what data was generated by the source, based on the signal it receives through the channel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |first=Claude E. |last=Shannon |journal=[[Bell System Technical Journal]] |volume=27 |year=1948}}, July and October</ref>{{rp|379\u2013423 and 623\u2013656}} The entropy provides an absolute limit on the shortest possible average length of a [[lossless]] [[data compression|compression]] encoding of the data produced by a source, and if the entropy of the source is less than the [[channel capacity]] of the communication channel, the data generated by the source can be reliably communicated to the receiver (at least in theory, possibly neglecting some practical considerations such as the complexity of the system needed to convey the data and the amount of time it may take for the data to be conveyed).\n\nInformation entropy is typically measured in [[bit]]s (alternatively called \"[[shannon (unit)|shannon]]s\") or sometimes in \"natural units\" ([[nat (unit)|nat]]s) or decimal digits (called \"dits\", \"bans\", or \"hartleys\"). The unit of the measurement depends on the base of the logarithm that is used to define the entropy.\n\nThe logarithm of the probability distribution is useful as a measure of entropy because it is additive for independent sources. For instance, the entropy of a fair coin toss is 1 bit, and the entropy of {{math|''m''}} tosses is {{math|''m''}} bits. In a straightforward representation, {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''n'')}} bits are needed to represent a variable that can take one of {{math|''n''}} values if {{math|''n''}} is a power of 2. If these values are equally probable, the entropy (in bits) is equal to this number. If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred. Conversely, rarer events provide more information when observed. Since observation of less probable events occurs more rarely, the net effect is that the entropy (thought of as average information) received from non-uniformly distributed data is always less than or equal to {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''n'')}}. Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known. The ''meaning'' of the events observed (the meaning of ''messages'') does not matter in the definition of entropy. Entropy only takes into account the probability of observing a specific event, so the information it encapsulates is information about the underlying probability distribution, not the meaning of the events themselves.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe basic idea of information theory is the more one knows about a topic, the less new information one is apt to get about it. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise when it happens and thus provides little new information. Inversely, if the event was improbable, it is much more informative that the event happened. Therefore, the [[self-information|information content]] is an increasing function of the inverse of the probability of the event (1/p). Now, if more events may happen, entropy measures the average  information content you can expect to get if one of the events actually happens. This implies that casting a die has more entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of the die has smaller probability than each outcome of the coin.\n\nThus, entropy is a measure of ''unpredictability'' of the state, or equivalently, of its ''average information content''. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively ''unpredictable'', and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new ''information''; these are just different ways of saying that the ''a priori'' entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the ''a priori'' entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.\n\nNow consider the example of a coin toss. Assuming the probability of heads is the same as the probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be. This is because there is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if we have to choose, the best we can do is predict that the coin will come up heads, and this prediction will be correct with probability 1/2. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, a binary event with equiprobable outcomes has a Shannon entropy of <math>\\log_2 2=1</math> bit. Similarly, one [[Ternary numeral system|trit]] with equiprobable values contains <math>\\log_2 3</math> (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.\n\nEnglish text, treated as a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. Even if we do not know exactly what is going to come next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the combination 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.<ref name=\"Schneier, B page 234\">Schneier, B: ''Applied Cryptography'', Second edition, John Wiley and Sons.</ref>{{rp|234}}\n\nIf a [[Data compression|compression]] scheme is lossless\u2014that is, you can always recover the entire original message by decompressing\u2014then a compressed message has the same quantity of information as the original, but communicated in fewer characters. That is, it has more information, or a higher entropy, per character. This means a compressed message has less redundancy. Roughly speaking, [[Shannon's source coding theorem]] says that a lossless compression scheme cannot compress messages, on average, to have ''more'' than one bit of information per bit of message, but that any value ''less'' than one bit of information per bit of message can be attained by employing a suitable coding scheme. The entropy of a message per bit multiplied by the length of that message is a measure of how much total information the message contains.\n\nIntuitively, imagine that we wish to transmit sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells us to look at another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' \u2013 together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.\n\nShannon's theorem also implies that no lossless compression scheme can shorten ''all'' messages. If some messages come out shorter, at least one must come out longer due to the [[pigeonhole principle]]. In practical use, this is generally not a problem, because we are usually only interested in compressing certain types of messages, for example English documents as opposed to gibberish text, or digital photographs rather than noise, and it is unimportant if a compression algorithm makes some unlikely or uninteresting sequences larger.\n\n==Definition==\nNamed after [[H-theorem|Boltzmann's \u0397-theorem]], Shannon defined the entropy {{math|&Eta;}} (Greek capital letter [[eta]]) of a [[discrete random variable]] <math display=\"inline\">X</math> with possible values <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\right\\}</math> and [[probability mass function]] <math display=\"inline\">\\mathrm{P}(X)</math> as:\n\n:<math>\\Eta(X) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{I}(X)]\n= \\mathbb{E}[-\\log(\\mathrm{P}(X))].</math>\n\nHere <math>\\mathbb{E}</math> is the [[expected value|expected value operator]], and {{math|I}} is the [[self-information|information content]] of {{math|''X''}}.<ref>{{cite book|author=Borda, Monica|title=Fundamentals in Information Theory and Coding|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-3-642-20346-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lyte2yl1SPAC&pg=PA11}}</ref>{{rp|11}}<ref>{{cite book|authors=Han, Te Sun & Kobayashi, Kingo|title=Mathematics of Information and Coding|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8218-4256-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpRESN24Zj0C&pg=PA19}}</ref>{{rp|19\u201320}}\n{{math|I(''X'')}} is itself a random variable.\n\nThe entropy can explicitly be written as\n:<math>\\Eta(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^n {\\mathrm{P}(x_i)\\,\\mathrm{I}(x_i)} = -\\sum_{i=1}^n {\\mathrm{P}(x_i) \\log_b \\mathrm{P}(x_i)},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''b''}} is the [[base (exponentiation)|base]] of the [[logarithm]] used. Common values of {{math|''b''}} are 2, [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number {{math|''e''}}]], and 10, and the corresponding units of entropy are the [[bit (unit)|bit]]s for {{math|''b'' {{=}} 2}}, [[Nat (unit)|nats]] for {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''e''}}, and [[ban (unit)|ban]]s for {{math|''b'' {{=}} 10}}.<ref>Schneider, T.D, [http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/paper/primer/primer.pdf Information theory primer with an appendix on logarithms], National Cancer Institute, 14 April 2007.</ref>\n\nIn the case of {{math|P(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) {{=}} 0}} for some {{math|''i''}}, the value of the corresponding summand {{math|0 log<sub>''b''</sub>(0)}} is taken to be {{math|0}}, which is consistent with the [[limit of a function|limit]]:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{p\\to0+}p\\log (p) = 0.</math>\n\nOne may also define the [[conditional entropy]] of two events {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} taking values {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''y''<sub>''j''</sub>}} respectively, as\n\n:<math> \\Eta(X|Y)=-\\sum_{i,j}p(x_{i},y_{j})\\log\\frac{p(x_{i},y_{j})}{p(y_{j})}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''p''(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''y''<sub>''j''</sub>)}} is the probability that {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''Y'' {{=}} ''y''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. This quantity should be understood as the amount of randomness in the random variable {{math|''X''}} given the event {{math|''Y''}}.\n\n==Example==\n[[File:Binary entropy plot.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|Entropy {{math|\u0397(''X'')}} (i.e. the [[expected value|expected]] [[self-information|surprisal]]) of a coin flip, measured in bits, graphed versus the bias of the coin {{math|Pr(''X'' {{=}} 1)}}, where {{math|''X'' {{=}} 1}} represents a result of heads.<br/><br/>Here, the entropy is at most 1 bit, and to communicate the outcome of a coin flip (2 possible values) will require an average of at most 1 bit (exactly 1 bit for a fair coin). The result of a fair die (6 possible values) would require on average log<sub>2</sub>6 bits.]]\n{{Main|Binary entropy function}}\n{{Main|Bernoulli process}}\nConsider tossing a coin with known, not necessarily fair, probabilities of coming up heads or tails; this can be modelled as a [[Bernoulli process]].\n\nThe entropy of the unknown result of the next toss of the coin is maximized if the coin is fair (that is, if heads and tails both have equal probability 1/2). This is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full [[bit]] of information. This is because\n:<math>\\Eta(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n {\\mathrm{P}(x_i) \\log_b \\mathrm{P}(x_i)} = -\\sum_{i=1}^2 {(1 / 2) \\log_2 (1 / 2)} = -\\sum_{i=1}^2 {(1 / 2) \\times (-1)} = 1</math>\n\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, where {{math|''p'' \u2260 ''q''}}, then there is less uncertainty. Every time it is tossed, one side is more likely to come up than the other. The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information. For example, if {{math|''p''}}=0.7, then\n:<math>\\Eta(X) =  - p \\log_2 (p) - q \\log_2 (q) = - 0.7 \\log_2 (0.7) - 0.3 \\log_2 (0.3) \\approx - 0.7 \\times (-0.515) - 0.3 \\times (-1.737) = 0.8816 < 1</math>\n\nThe extreme case is that of a double-headed coin that never comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain.\n\nEntropy can be normalized by dividing it by information length. This ratio is called [[metric entropy]] and is a measure of the randomness of the information.\n\n==Rationale==\nTo understand the meaning of {{math|-\u2211 ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> log(''p''<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, at first, try to define an information function, {{math|I}}, in terms of an event {{math|''i''}} with probability {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. How much information is acquired due to the observation of event {{math|''i''}}? Shannon's solution follows from the fundamental [[Entropy (information theory)#Characterization|properties]] of information:<ref>{{cite book |last=Carter |first=Tom |date=March 2014|title=An introduction to information theory and entropy |url= http://csustan.csustan.edu/~tom/Lecture-Notes/Information-Theory/info-lec.pdf|location=Santa Fe|publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date=4 August 2017}}</ref>\n# {{math|I(''p'')}} is monotonically decreasing in {{math|''p''}} \u2013 an increase in the probability of an event decreases the information from an observed event, and vice versa\n# {{math|I(''p'') \u2265 0}} \u2013 information is a non-negative quantity\n# {{math|I(1) {{=}} 0}} \u2013 events that always occur do not communicate information\n# {{math|I(''p''<sub>1</sub> ''p''<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} I(''p''<sub>1</sub>) + I(''p''<sub>2</sub>)}} \u2013 information due to independent events is additive\n\nThe last is a crucial property. It states that joint probability of independent sources of information communicates as much information as the two individual events separately. Particularly, if the first event can yield one of {{math|''n''}} equiprobable outcomes and another has one of {{math|''m''}} equiprobable outcomes then there are {{math|''mn''}} possible outcomes of the joint event. This means that if {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''n'')}} bits are needed to encode the first value and {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''m'')}} to encode the second, one needs {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''mn'') {{=}} log<sub>2</sub>(''m'') + log<sub>2</sub>(''n'')}} to encode both. Shannon discovered that the proper choice of function to quantify information, preserving this additivity, is logarithmic, i.e.,\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{I}(p) = \\log(1/p) = -\\log(p):</math>\n\nlet <math display=\"inline\">I</math> be the information function which one assumes to be twice continuously differentiable, one has:\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{lcl}\nI(p_1 p_2) &=& I(p_1) +  I(p_2) \\\\\np_2 I'(p_1 p_2) &=& I'(p_1) \\\\\nI'(p_1 p_2) + p_1 p_2 I''(p_1 p_2) &=& 0 \\\\\nI'(u) + u I''(u) &=& 0 \\\\\n(u \\mapsto u I'(u))' &=& 0\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThis differential equation leads to the solution <math>I(u) = k \\log u</math> for any <math>k \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>. Condition 2. leads to <math>k < 0</math> and especially, <math>k </math> can be chosen on the form <math>k = - 1/\\log x</math> with <math>x > 1</math>, which is equivalent to choosing a specific base for the logarithm. The different units of information (bits for {{math|log<sub>2</sub>}}, nats for the natural logarithm {{math|ln}}, bans for {{math|log<sub>10</sub>}} and so on) are just constant multiples of each other. For instance, in case of a fair coin toss, heads provides {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(2) {{=}} 1}} bit of information, which is approximately 0.693&nbsp;nats or 0.301&nbsp;decimal digits. Because of additivity, {{math|''n''}} tosses provide {{math|''n''}} bits of information, which is approximately {{math|0.693''n''}} nats or {{math|0.301''n''}} decimal digits.\n\nNow, suppose we have a distribution where event {{math|''i''}} can happen with probability {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. Suppose we have sampled it {{math|''N''}} times and outcome {{math|''i''}} was, accordingly, seen {{math|''n''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''N'' ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} times. The total amount of information we have received is \n:<math>\\sum_i {n_i \\mathrm{I}(p_i)} = -\\sum_i {N p_i \\log{p_i}}</math>. \nThe ''average'' amount of information that we receive per event is therefore\n:<math>-\\sum_i {p_i \\log {p_i}}.</math>\n\n==Aspects==\n\n===Relationship to thermodynamic entropy===\n{{Main|Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory}}\nThe inspiration for adopting the word ''entropy'' in information theory came from the close resemblance between Shannon's formula and very similar known formulae from [[statistical mechanics]].\n\nIn [[statistical thermodynamics]] the most general formula for the thermodynamic [[entropy]] {{math|''S''}} of a [[thermodynamic system]] is the [[Gibbs entropy]],\n:<math>S = - k_\\text{B} \\sum p_i \\ln p_i \\,</math>\nwhere {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the probability of a [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]. The Gibbs entropy was defined by [[J. Willard Gibbs]] in 1878 after earlier work by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] (1872).<ref>Compare: Boltzmann, Ludwig (1896, 1898). Vorlesungen \u00fcber Gastheorie : 2 Volumes \u2013 Leipzig 1895/98 UB: O 5262-6. English version: Lectures on gas theory. Translated by Stephen G. Brush (1964) Berkeley: University of California Press; (1995) New York: Dover {{isbn|0-486-68455-5}}</ref>\n\nThe Gibbs entropy translates over almost unchanged into the world of [[quantum physics]] to give the [[von Neumann entropy]], introduced by [[John von Neumann]] in 1927,\n:<math>S = - k_\\text{B} \\,{\\rm Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho) \\,</math>\nwhere \u03c1 is the [[density matrix]] of the quantum mechanical system and Tr is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]].\n\nAt an everyday practical level the links between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not evident. Physicists and chemists are apt to be more interested in ''changes'' in entropy as a system spontaneously evolves away from its initial conditions, in accordance with the [[second law of thermodynamics]], rather than an unchanging probability distribution. And, as the minuteness of [[Boltzmann's constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} indicates, the changes in {{math|''S'' / ''k''<sub>B</sub>}} for even tiny amounts of substances in chemical and physical processes represent amounts of entropy that are extremely large compared to anything in [[data compression]] or [[signal processing]]. Furthermore, in classical thermodynamics the entropy is defined in terms of macroscopic measurements and makes no reference to any probability distribution, which is central to the definition of information entropy.\n\nThe connection between thermodynamics and what is now known as information theory was first made by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and expressed by his [[Boltzmann's entropy formula|famous equation]]:\n\n:<math>S=k_\\text{B} \\ln(W)</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the thermodynamic entropy of a particular macrostate (defined by thermodynamic parameters such as temperature, volume, energy, etc.), ''W'' is the number of microstates (various combinations of particles in various energy states) that can yield the given macrostate, and ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]. It is assumed that each microstate is equally likely, so that the probability of a given microstate is ''p<sub>i</sub> = 1/W''. When these probabilities are substituted into the above expression for the Gibbs entropy (or equivalently ''k<sub>B</sub>'' times the Shannon entropy), Boltzmann's equation results. In information theoretic terms, the information entropy of a system is the amount of \"missing\" information needed to determine a microstate, given the macrostate.\n\nIn the view of [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Jaynes]] (1957), thermodynamic entropy, as explained by [[statistical mechanics]], should be seen as an ''application'' of Shannon's information theory: the thermodynamic entropy is interpreted as being proportional to the amount of further Shannon information needed to define the detailed microscopic state of the system, that remains uncommunicated by a description solely in terms of the macroscopic variables of classical thermodynamics, with the constant of proportionality being just the [[Boltzmann constant]]. For example, adding heat to a system increases its thermodynamic entropy because it increases the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with the measurable values of its macroscopic variables, thus making any complete state description longer. (See article: ''[[maximum entropy thermodynamics]]''). [[Maxwell's demon]] can (hypothetically) reduce the thermodynamic entropy of a system by using information about the states of individual molecules; but, as [[Rolf Landauer|Landauer]] (from 1961) and co-workers have shown, to function the demon himself must increase thermodynamic entropy in the process, by at least the amount of Shannon information he proposes to first acquire and store; and so the total thermodynamic entropy does not decrease (which resolves the paradox). [[Landauer's principle]] imposes a lower bound on the amount of heat a computer must generate to process a given amount of information, though modern computers are far less efficient.\n\n===Entropy as information content===\n{{Main|Shannon's source coding theorem}}\nEntropy is defined in the context of a probabilistic model. Independent fair coin flips have an entropy of 1 bit per flip. A source that always generates a long string of B's has an entropy of 0, since the next character will always be a 'B'.\n\nThe entropy rate of a data source means the average number of [[bit]]s per symbol needed to encode it. Shannon's experiments with human predictors show an information rate between 0.6 and 1.3 bits per character in English;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://marknelson.us/2006/08/24/the-hutter-prize/ | title=The Hutter Prize | accessdate=2008-11-27 | date=24 August 2006 | author=Mark Nelson}}</ref> the [[PPM compression algorithm]] can achieve a compression ratio of 1.5 bits per character in English text.\n\nFrom the preceding example, note the following points:\n\n# The amount of entropy is not always an integer number of bits.\n# Many data bits may not convey information. For example, data structures often store information redundantly, or have identical sections regardless of the information in the data structure.\n\nShannon's definition of entropy, when applied to an information source, can determine the minimum channel capacity required to reliably transmit the source as encoded binary digits (see caveat below in italics). The formula can be derived by calculating the mathematical expectation of the ''amount of information'' contained in a digit from the information source.  ''See also'' [[Shannon\u2013Hartley theorem]].\n\nShannon's entropy measures the information contained in a message as opposed to the portion of the message that is determined (or predictable). ''Examples of the latter include redundancy in language structure or statistical properties relating to the occurrence frequencies of letter or word pairs, triplets etc.'' See [[Markov chain]].\n\n===Entropy as a measure of diversity===\n{{Main|Diversity index}}\nEntropy is one of several ways to measure diversity.  Specifically, Shannon entropy is the logarithm of {{math|<sup>1</sup>D}}, the [[true diversity]] index with parameter equal to 1.\n\n===Data compression===\n{{Main|Data compression}}\nEntropy effectively bounds the performance of the strongest lossless compression possible, which can be realized in theory by using the [[typical set]] or in practice using [[Huffman coding|Huffman]], [[LZW|Lempel\u2013Ziv]] or [[arithmetic coding]]. See also [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. In practice, compression algorithms deliberately include some judicious redundancy in the form of [[checksum]]s to protect against errors.\n\n=== World's technological capacity to store and communicate information ===\nA 2011 study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' estimates the world's technological capacity to store and communicate optimally compressed information normalized on the most effective compression algorithms available in the year 2007, therefore estimating the entropy of the technologically available sources.<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\">[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 \"The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information\"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila L\u00f3pez (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025); free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html</ref> {{rp|60\u201365}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nAll figures in entropically compressed [[exabytes]]\n|-\n!

They break the information into three categories\u2014to store information on a medium, to receive information through a one-way [[broadcast]] networks, or to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks.<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\"/>\n\n===Limitations of entropy as information content===\nThere are a number of entropy-related concepts that mathematically quantify information content in some way:\n* the '''[[self-information]]''' of an individual message or symbol taken from a given probability distribution,\n* the '''entropy''' of a given probability distribution of messages or symbols, and\n* the '''[[entropy rate]]''' of a [[stochastic process]].\n(The \"rate of self-information\" can also be defined for a particular sequence of messages or symbols generated by a given stochastic process: this will always be equal to the entropy rate in the case of a [[stationary process]].) Other [[quantities of information]] are also used to compare or relate different sources of information.\n\nIt is important not to confuse the above concepts. Often it is only clear from context which one is meant. For example, when someone says that the \"entropy\" of the English language is about 1 bit per character, they are actually modeling the English language as a stochastic process and talking about its entropy ''rate''. Shannon himself used the term in this way.\n\nHowever, if we use very large blocks, then the estimate of per-character entropy rate may become artificially low. This is because in reality, the probability distribution of the sequence is not knowable exactly; it is only an estimate. For example, suppose one considers the text of every book ever published as a sequence, with each symbol being the text of a complete book. If there are {{math|''N''}} published books, and each book is only published once, the estimate of the probability of each book is {{math|1/''N''}}, and the entropy (in bits) is {{math|\u2212log<sub>2</sub>(1/''N'') {{=}} log<sub>2</sub>(''N'')}}. As a practical code, this corresponds to assigning each book a [[ISBN|unique identifier]] and using it in place of the text of the book whenever one wants to refer to the book. This is enormously useful for talking about books, but it is not so useful for characterizing the information content of an individual book, or of language in general: it is not possible to reconstruct the book from its identifier without knowing the probability distribution, that is, the complete text of all the books. The key idea is that the complexity of the probabilistic model must be considered. [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is a theoretical generalization of this idea that allows the consideration of the information content of a sequence independent of any particular probability model; it considers the shortest [[Computer program|program]] for a [[universal computer]] that outputs the sequence. A code that achieves the entropy rate of a sequence for a given model, plus the codebook (i.e. the probabilistic model), is one such program, but it may not be the shortest.\n\nFor example, the Fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \u2026. Treating the sequence as a message and each number as a symbol, there are almost as many symbols as there are characters in the message, giving an entropy of approximately {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''n'')}}. So the first 128 symbols of the Fibonacci sequence has an entropy of approximately 7 bits/symbol. However, the sequence can be expressed using a formula [{{math|F(''n'') {{=}} F(''n''\u22121) + F(''n''\u22122)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 3, 4, 5, \u2026}}, {{math|F(1) {{=}}1}}, {{math|F(2) {{=}} 1}}] and this formula has a much lower entropy and applies to any length of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n===Limitations of entropy in cryptography===\nIn [[cryptanalysis]], entropy is often roughly used as a measure of the unpredictability of a cryptographic key, though its real [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty]] is unmeasurable. For example, a 128-bit key that is uniformly randomly generated has 128 bits of entropy. It also takes (on average) <math>2^{128-1}</math> guesses to break by brute force. However, entropy fails to capture the number of guesses required if the possible keys are not chosen uniformly.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=James |last1=Massey |year=1994 |title=Guessing and Entropy |booktitle=Proc.

For example, consider a 1000000-digit binary [[one-time pad]] using exclusive or. If the pad has 1000000 bits of entropy, it is perfect. If the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, evenly distributed (each individual bit of the pad having 0.999999 bits of entropy) it may provide good security. But if the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, where the first bit is fixed and the remaining 999999 bits are perfectly random, then the first bit of the ciphertext will not be encrypted at all.\n\n===Data as a Markov process===\nA common way to define entropy for text is based on the [[Markov model]] of text. For an order-0 source (each character is selected independent of the last characters), the binary entropy is:\n\n:<math>\\Eta(\\mathcal{S}) = - \\sum p_i \\log_2 p_i ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the probability of {{math|''i''}}. For a first-order [[Markov source]] (one in which the probability of selecting a character is dependent only on the immediately preceding character), the '''[[entropy rate]]''' is:\n\n:<math>\\Eta(\\mathcal{S}) = - \\sum_i p_i \\sum_j  \\  p_i (j) \\log_2 p_i (j) ,</math> {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is a '''state''' (certain preceding characters) and <math>p_i(j)</math> is the probability of {{math|''j''}} given {{math|''i''}} as the previous character.\n\nFor a second order Markov source, the entropy rate is\n\n:<math>\\Eta(\\mathcal{S}) = -\\sum_i p_i \\sum_j p_i(j) \\sum_k p_{i,j}(k)\\ \\log_2 \\  p_{i,j}(k) .</math>\n\n==={{math|''b''}}-ary entropy===\nIn general the '''{{math|''b''}}-ary entropy''' of a source <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> {{math|{{=}} (''S'', ''P'')}} with [[source alphabet]] {{math|''S'' {{=}} {''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}} and [[discrete probability distribution]] {{math|''P'' {{=}} {''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}}} where {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the probability of {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} (say {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''p''(''a''<sub>''i''</sub>))}} is defined by:\n\n:<math> \\Eta_b(\\mathcal{S}) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \\log_b p_i ,</math>\n\nNote: the {{math|''b''}} in \"{{math|''b''}}-ary entropy\" is the number of different symbols of the ''ideal alphabet'' used as a standard yardstick to measure source alphabets. In information theory, two symbols are [[necessary and sufficient]] for an alphabet to encode information. Therefore, the default is to let {{math|''b'' {{=}} 2}} (\"binary entropy\"). Thus, the entropy of the source alphabet, with its given empiric probability distribution, is a number equal to the number (possibly fractional) of symbols of the \"ideal alphabet\", with an optimal probability distribution, necessary to encode for each symbol of the source alphabet. Also note that \"optimal probability distribution\" here means a [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]]: a source alphabet with {{math|''n''}} symbols has the highest possible entropy (for an alphabet with {{math|''n''}} symbols) when the probability distribution of the alphabet is uniform. This optimal entropy turns out to be {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''n'')}}.\n\n==Efficiency==\nA source alphabet with non-uniform distribution will have less entropy than if those symbols had uniform distribution (i.e. the \"optimized alphabet\"). This deficiency in entropy can be expressed as a ratio called efficiency{{Cite quote|date=July 2014}}:\n\n:<math>\\eta(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{p(x_i) \\log_b (p(x_i))}{\\log_b (n)}=\\log_n (\\prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i)^{-p(x_i)})</math>{{Clarify|date=July 2014}}\n\nEfficiency has utility in quantifying the effective use of a communications channel. This formulation is also referred to as the normalized entropy, as the entropy is divided by the maximum entropy <math>{\\log_b (n)}</math>.  Furthermore, the efficiency is indifferent to choice of (positive) base {{math|''b''}}, as indicated by the insensitivity within the final logarithm above thereto.\n\n==Characterization==\nShannon entropy is [[characterization (mathematics)|characterized]] by a small number of criteria, listed below. Any definition of entropy satisfying these assumptions has the form\n:<math>-K\\sum_{i=1}^np_i\\log (p_i)</math>\nwhere {{math|''K''}} is a constant corresponding to a choice of measurement units.\n\nIn the following, {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} Pr(''X'' {{=}} ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} and {{math|\u0397<sub>''n''</sub>(''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>) {{=}} \u0397(''X'')}}.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe measure should be [[continuous function|continuous]], so that changing the values of the probabilities by a very small amount should only change the entropy by a small amount.\n\n===Symmetry===\nThe measure should be unchanged if the outcomes {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are re-ordered.\n:<math>\\Eta_n\\left(p_1, p_2, \\ldots \\right) = \\Eta_n\\left(p_2, p_1, \\ldots \\right)</math> etc.\n\n===Maximum===\nThe measure should be maximal if all the outcomes are equally likely (uncertainty is highest when all possible events are equiprobable).\n:<math> \\Eta_n(p_1,\\ldots,p_n) \\le \\Eta_n\\left(\\frac{1}{n}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\log_b (n).</math>\n\nFor equiprobable events the entropy should increase with the number of outcomes.\n:<math>\\Eta_n\\bigg(\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{n}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{n}}_{n}\\bigg) = \\log_b(n) < \\log_b (n+1) = \\Eta_{n+1}\\bigg(\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{n+1}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{n+1}}_{n+1}\\bigg).</math>\n\nFor continuous random variables, the multivariate Gaussian is the distribution with maximum [[differential entropy]].\n\n===Additivity===\nThe amount of entropy should be independent of how the process is regarded as being divided into parts.\n\nThis last functional relationship characterizes the entropy of a system with sub-systems. It demands that the entropy of a system can be calculated from the entropies of its sub-systems if the interactions between the sub-systems are known.\n\nGiven an ensemble of {{math|''n''}} uniformly distributed elements that are divided into {{math|''k''}} boxes (sub-systems) with {{math|''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>''k''</sub>}} elements each, the entropy of the whole ensemble should be equal to the sum of the entropy of the system of boxes and the individual entropies of the boxes, each weighted with the probability of being in that particular box.\n\nFor [[positive integers]] {{math|''b''<sub>''i''</sub>}} where {{math|''b''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''b''<sub>''k''</sub> {{=}} ''n''}},\n:<math>\\Eta_n\\left(\\frac{1}{n}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\Eta_k\\left(\\frac{b_1}{n}, \\ldots, \\frac{b_k}{n}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{b_i}{n} \\, \\Eta_{b_i}\\left(\\frac{1}{b_i}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{b_i}\\right).</math>\n\nChoosing {{math|''k'' {{=}} ''n''}}, {{math|''b''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} \u2026 {{=}} ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} 1}} this implies that the entropy of a certain outcome is zero: {{math|\u0397<sub>1</sub>(1) {{=}} 0}}. This implies that the efficiency of a source alphabet with {{math|''n''}} symbols can be defined simply as being equal to its {{math|''n''}}-ary entropy. See also [[Redundancy (information theory)]].\n\n==Further properties==\nThe Shannon entropy satisfies the following properties, for some of which it is useful to interpret entropy as the amount of information learned (or uncertainty eliminated) by revealing the value of a random variable {{math|''X''}}:\n\n* Adding or removing an event with probability zero does not contribute to the entropy:\n::<math>\\Eta_{n+1}(p_1,\\ldots,p_n,0) = \\Eta_n(p_1,\\ldots,p_n)</math>.\n* The entropy of a discrete random variable is a non-negative number:\n::<math>\\Eta(X) \\ge 0</math>.<ref name=cover1991>{{cite book |author1=Thomas M.

This may be written as\n::<math> \\Eta(X,Y)=\\Eta(X|Y)+\\Eta(Y)=\\Eta(Y|X)+\\Eta(X).</math>\n* If <math>Y=f(X)</math> where <math>f</math> is a function, then <math>H(f(X)|X) = 0</math>.

The corresponding formula for a continuous random variable with [[probability density function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} with finite or infinite support <math>\\mathbb X</math> on the real line is defined by analogy, using the above form of the entropy as an expectation:\n\n:<math>h[f] = \\operatorname{E}[-\\ln (f(x))] = -\\int_\\mathbb X f(x) \\ln (f(x))\\, dx.</math>\n\nThis formula is usually referred to as the '''continuous entropy''', or [[differential entropy]]. A precursor of the continuous entropy {{math|''h''[''f'']}} is the expression for the functional {{math|''\u0397''}} in the [[H-theorem]] of [[Boltzmann]].\n\nAlthough the analogy between both functions is suggestive, the following question must be set: is the differential entropy a valid extension of the Shannon discrete entropy? Differential entropy lacks a number of properties that the Shannon discrete entropy has&nbsp;\u2013 it can even be negative&nbsp;\u2013 and thus corrections have been suggested, notably [[limiting density of discrete points]].\n\nTo answer this question, we must establish a connection between the two functions:\n\nWe wish to obtain a generally finite measure as the [[bin size]] goes to zero. In the discrete case, the bin size is the (implicit) width of each of the {{math|''n''}} (finite or infinite) bins whose probabilities are denoted by {{math|''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. As we generalize to the continuous domain, we must make this width explicit.\n\nTo do this, start with a continuous function {{math|''f''}} discretized into bins of size <math>\\Delta</math>.\n<!-- Figure: Discretizing the function $ f$ into bins of width $ \\Delta$ \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{function-with-bins.eps} --><!-- The original article this figure came from is at http://planetmath.org/shannonsentropy but it is broken there too -->\nBy the mean-value theorem there exists a value {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} in each bin such that\n\n:<math>f(x_i) \\Delta = \\int_{i\\Delta}^{(i+1)\\Delta} f(x)\\, dx</math>\n\nand thus the integral of the function {{math|''f''}} can be approximated (in the Riemannian sense) by\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\, dx = \\lim_{\\Delta \\to 0} \\sum_{i = -\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x_i) \\Delta</math>\n\nwhere this limit and \"bin size goes to zero\" are equivalent.\n\nWe will denote\n\n:<math>\\Eta^{\\Delta} := - \\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x_i)  \\Delta \\log \\left(  f(x_i)  \\Delta \\right)</math>\n\nand expanding the logarithm, we have\n\n:<math>\\Eta^{\\Delta} = - \\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty}  f(x_i)  \\Delta \\log (f(x_i)) -\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x_i) \\Delta \\log (\\Delta).</math>\n\nAs \u0394 \u2192 0, we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x_i) \\Delta &\\to \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\, dx = 1 \\\\\n\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x_i) \\Delta \\log (f(x_i)) &\\to \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\log f(x)\\, dx.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBut note that {{math|log(\u0394) \u2192 \u2212\u221e}} as {{math|\u0394 \u2192 0}}, therefore we need a special definition of the differential or continuous entropy:\n\n:<math>h[f] = \\lim_{\\Delta \\to 0} \\left(\\Eta^{\\Delta} + \\log \\Delta\\right) = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\log f(x)\\,dx,</math>\n\nwhich is, as said before, referred to as the '''differential entropy'''. This means that the differential entropy ''is not'' a limit of the Shannon entropy for {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}}. Rather, it differs from the limit of the Shannon entropy by an infinite offset (see also the article on [[information dimension]])\n\n===Limiting density of discrete points===\n{{Main|Limiting density of discrete points}}\n\nIt turns out as a result that, unlike the Shannon entropy, the differential entropy is ''not'' in general a good measure of uncertainty or information. For example, the differential entropy can be negative; also it is not invariant under continuous co-ordinate transformations. This problem may be illustrated by a change of units when ''x'' is a dimensioned variable. ''f(x)'' will then have the units of ''1/x''. The argument of the logarithm must be dimensionless, otherwise it is improper, so that the differential entropy as given above  will be improper. If ''&Delta;'' is some \"standard\" value of ''x'' (i.e. \"bin size\") and therefore has the same units, then a modified differential entropy may be written in proper form as:\n\n:<math>\nH=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\log(f(x)\\,\\Delta)\\,dx\n</math>\n\nand the result will be the same for any choice of units for ''x''. In fact, the limit of discrete entropy as <math> N \\rightarrow \\infty </math> would also include a term of <math> \\log(N)</math>, which would in general be infinite. This is expected, continuous variables would typically have infinite entropy when discretized. The [[limiting density of discrete points]] is really a measure of how much easier a distribution is to describe than a distribution that is uniform over its quantization scheme.\n\n===Relative entropy===\n{{main|Generalized relative entropy}}\nAnother useful measure of entropy that works equally well in the discrete and the continuous case is the '''relative entropy''' of a distribution. It is defined as the [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]] from the distribution to a reference measure {{math|''m''}} as follows. Assume that a probability distribution {{math|''p''}} is [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to a measure {{math|''m''}}, i.e. is of the form {{math|''p''(''dx'') {{=}} ''f''(''x'')''m''(''dx'')}} for some non-negative {{math|''m''}}-integrable function {{math|''f''}} with {{math|''m''}}-integral 1, then the relative entropy can be defined as\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p \\| m ) = \\int \\log (f(x)) p(dx) = \\int f(x)\\log (f(x)) m(dx) .</math>\n\nIn this form the relative entropy generalises (up to change in sign) both the discrete entropy, where the measure {{math|''m''}} is the [[counting measure]], and the differential entropy, where the measure {{math|''m''}} is the [[Lebesgue measure]]. If the measure {{math|''m''}} is itself a probability distribution, the relative entropy is non-negative, and zero if {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''m''}} as measures. It is defined for any measure space, hence coordinate independent and invariant under co-ordinate reparameterizations if one properly takes into account the transformation of the measure {{math|''m''}}. The relative entropy, and implicitly entropy and differential entropy, do depend on the \"reference\" measure {{math|''m''}}.\n\n==Use in combinatorics==\nEntropy has become a useful quantity in [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Loomis\u2013Whitney inequality===\nA simple example of this is an alternate proof of the [[Loomis\u2013Whitney inequality]]: for every subset {{math|''A'' \u2286 '''Z'''<sup>''d''</sup>}}, we have\n:<math> |A|^{d-1}\\leq \\prod_{i=1}^{d} |P_{i}(A)|</math>\nwhere {{math|''P''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the [[orthogonal projection]] in the {{math|''i''}}th coordinate:\n:<math> P_{i}(A)=\\{(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \\ldots, x_{d}) : (x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{d})\\in A\\}.</math>\n\nThe proof follows as a simple corollary of [[Shearer's inequality]]: if {{math|''X''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''X''<sub>''d''</sub>}} are random variables and {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are subsets of {{math|{1, \u2026, ''d''}}} such that every integer between 1 and {{math|''d''}} lies in exactly {{math|''r''}} of these subsets, then\n:<math> \\Eta[(X_{1}, \\ldots ,X_{d})]\\leq \\frac{1}{r}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\Eta[(X_{j})_{j\\in S_{i}}]</math>\nwhere <math> (X_{j})_{j\\in S_{i}}</math> is the Cartesian product of random variables {{math|''X''<sub>''j''</sub>}} with indexes {{math|''j''}} in {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub>}} (so the dimension of this vector is equal to the size of {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub>}}).\n\nWe sketch how Loomis\u2013Whitney follows from this: Indeed, let {{math|''X''}} be a uniformly distributed random variable with values in {{math|''A''}} and so that each point in {{math|''A''}} occurs with equal probability. Then (by the further properties of entropy mentioned above) {{math|\u0397(''X'') {{=}} log{{abs|''A''}}}}, where {{math|{{abs|''A''}}}} denotes the cardinality of {{math|''A''}}. Let {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} {1, 2, \u2026, ''i''\u22121, ''i''+1, \u2026, ''d''}}}. The range of <math>(X_{j})_{j\\in S_{i}}</math> is contained in {{math|''P''<sub>''i''</sub>(''A'')}} and hence <math> \\Eta[(X_{j})_{j\\in S_{i}}]\\leq \\log |P_{i}(A)|</math>. Now use this to bound the right side of Shearer's inequality and exponentiate the opposite sides of the resulting inequality you obtain.\n\n===Approximation to binomial coefficient===\nFor integers {{math|0 < ''k'' < ''n''}} let {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''k''/''n''}}. Then\n:<math>\\frac{2^{n\\Eta(q)}}{n+1} \\leq \\tbinom nk \\leq 2^{n\\Eta(q)},</math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\Eta(q) = -q \\log_2(q) - (1-q) \\log_2(1-q).</math><ref>Aoki, New Approaches to Macroeconomic Modeling.</ref>{{rp|43}}\n\nHere is a sketch proof.

For the lower bound one first shows, using some algebra, that it is the largest term in the summation. But then,\n:<math>\\tbinom nk q^{qn}(1-q)^{n-nq} \\geq \\tfrac{1}{n+1}</math>\nsince there are {{math|''n'' + 1}} terms in the summation. Rearranging gives the lower bound.\n\nA nice interpretation of this is that the number of binary strings of length {{math|''n''}} with exactly {{math|''k''}} many 1's is approximately <math>2^{n\\Eta(k/n)}</math>.<ref>Probability and Computing, M.

For nearly seven decades the institution flourished in the city of Ithaca, adding to its music curriculum the study of [[elocution]], dance, physical education, speech correction, radio, business, and the liberal arts. In 1931 the conservatory was chartered as a private college. The college was originally housed in the [[Boardman House (Ithaca, New York)|Boardman House]], that later became the Ithaca College Museum of Art, and it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1971.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Job Hall, Ithaca College campus.jpg|thumb|Job Hall]]\nBy 1960, some 2,000 students were in attendance. A modern campus was built on South Hill in the 1960s, and students were shuttled between the old and new during the construction. The hillside campus continued to grow in the ensuing 30 years to accommodate more than 6,000 students.\n\nAs the campus expanded, the college also began to expand its curriculum. By the 1990s, some 2,000 courses in more than 100 programs of study were available in the college's five schools.

Ithaca College's sports teams were originally named the Cayugas, but the name was changed to the Bombers sometime in the 1930s. Some other names that have been used for Ithaca College's teams include: Blue Team, Blues, Blue and Gold, Collegians, and the Seneca Streeters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithacalibrary.com/archives/bombers.php|title=Ithaca College Library|publisher=}}</ref> Several possibilities for the change to the \"Bombers\" have been posited. The most common explanation is that the school's baseball uniforms\u2014white with navy blue pinstripes and an interlocking \"IC\" on the left chest\u2014bear a striking resemblance to the distinctive home uniforms of the [[New York Yankees]], who are known as the Bronx Bombers. It may also have referred to the Ithaca basketball team of that era and its propensity for half-court \"bombs\". [[Grumman]] Aircraft also manufactured airplanes including bombers in Ithaca for many years. The first \u201cBombers\u201d reference on record was in the December 17, 1938 issue of the ''[[Rochester Times-Union]]'' in a men's basketball article.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/rhp/ithacan/articles/0012/07/sports/LSstories_swir.htm|title=The Ithacan|author=The Ithacan|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe name has at times sparked controversy for its perceived martial connotations. It is an occasional source of umbrage from Ithaca's prominent [[pacifist]] community, but the athletics department has consistently stated it has no interest in changing the name. The athletics logo has in the past incorporated [[World War&nbsp;II]] era fighter planes, but currently does not, and the school does not currently have a physical mascot to personify the name. In 2010 the school launched a contest to choose one. It received over 250 suggestions and narrowed the field down to three: a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], a [[flying squirrel]], and a Lake Beast. In June 2011, President Rochon announced that the school would discontinue the search due to opposition in the alumni community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/mascot/blogs/ic_mascot_search_blog/mascot_search_concluded/|title=IC Mascot Search|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIthaca College recently remodeled the Hill Center in 2013. The building features hardwood floors (Ben Light Gymnasium) as well as coaches offices. The building is home to Ithaca's men's and women's basketball teams, women's volleyball team, wrestling, and gymnastics. Ithaca also opened the Athletics & Events Center in 2011, a $65.5 million facility funded by donors. The facility is mainly used by the school's varsity athletes.

This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups, or attempt to discover general psychological processes that apply to all individuals.<ref name=\"Ergodicity\">{{cite journal |author1=Fisher, A.J.| displayauthors=etal| year = 2018 | title = Lack of group-to-individual generalizability is a threat to human subjects research| journal = PNAS | volume = 115 | issue = 27 | pages = 6106\u20136115| doi=10.1073/pnas.1711978115}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one [[Treatment and control groups|treatment group]] might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a [[placebo]] (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study.\n\nThis approach is applied because [[psychological research]] depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ. The ergodicity problem impedes correct group-to-individual generalization for most psychological phenomena.<ref name=\"Ergodicity\"/>\n\n== Importance of individual differences ==\nIndividual differences are essential whenever we wish to explain how\nindividuals differ in their behavior. In any study, significant\nvariation exists between individuals.  [[Reaction time]], preferences,\nvalues, and health-linked behaviors are just a few examples. Individual\ndifferences in factors such as [[personality]], [[intelligence]],\n[[memory]], or physical factors such as body size, sex, age, and other\nfactors can be studied and used in understanding this large source of\nvariance. Importantly, individuals can also differ not only in their\ncurrent state, but in the magnitude or even direction of response to a\ngiven [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]]. Such phenomena, often\nexplained in terms of [[Yerkes-Dodson law|inverted-U]] response curves,\nplace differential psychology at an important location in such\nendeavours as [[personalized medicine]], in which diagnoses are\ncustomised for an individual's response profile.\n\n== Areas of study ==\nIndividual differences research typically includes [[personality psychology|personality]], [[motivation]], [[intelligence]], ability, [[IQ]], [[Interest (emotion)|interests]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[self-concept]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]] (to name just a few). There are few remaining \"differential psychology\" programs in the United States, although research in this area is very active. Current researchers are found in a variety of applied and experimental programs, including [[clinical psychology]], [[educational psychology]], [[Industrial and organizational psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[behavioral genetics]], and [[developmental psychology]] programs, in the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] in particular.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Intelligence]]\n* [[Personality psychology]]\n* [[Behavioral genetics]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|about=yes|wikititle=differential psychology}}\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.wilderdom.com/personality/L1-1Introduction.html Introduction to Individual Differences] (Wilderdom)\n* {{cite book|author1=Maltby, J.|author2=Day, L.|author3=Macaskill, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Personality, Individual Differences and Intelligence|location=London|publisher=Pearson Education|url=http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/detail.asp?item=100000000090816}}\n* {{cite journal|author1=Buss, D.M.|author2=Greiling, H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1999|url=http://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/09/adapt-ID-revisited-1999-jop.pdf|title=Adaptive Individual Differences|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=67|issue=2|pages=209\u2013243|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00053}}\n* {{cite journal|author1=Chamorro-Premuzic, T. |author2=Furhnam, A. |lastauthoramp=y |year=2006 |title=Intellectual competence and the intelligent personality: A third way in differential psychology |journal=[[Review of General Psychology]] |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=251\u2013267 |url=http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/psychology/downloads/ChamorroPremuzicFurnham2006RGP.pdf |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.10.3.251 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319201449/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/psychology/downloads/ChamorroPremuzicFurnham2006RGP.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2009 }}\n* {{cite journal|author1=Kanai, R.|author2=Rees, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=The structural basis of inter-individual differences in human behaviour and cognition|journal=[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]|volume=12|pages=231\u2013241|url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v12/n4/abs/nrn3000.html|doi=10.1038/nrn3000}}\n*{{cite book|author=Tyler, L.E.|year=1965|title=The psychology of human differences|location=New York|publisher=Appleton Century Crofts}}\n*[http://www.intelltheory.com/ Timeline of researchers and brief biographies]\n\n{{Psychology|state=collapsed}}\n{{Portal bar|Psychology}}\n\n[[Category:Branches of psychology]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]\n[[Category:Behavioural sciences]]", "sha1": "kpplrbueo63998ev3x9aucy7b273cla"}}, {"title": "Industrial and organizational psychology", "ns": "0", "id": "15450", "revision": {"id": "865776860", "parentid": "865760389", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T02:23:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Amloe1", "id": "34769179"}, "comment": "/* Relation to organizational behavior */ added confusion/relation with HR and Human resources management, which is very common", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Psychology (sidebar)|all}}\n'''Industrial and organizational psychology''' ('''I/O psychology'''), which is also known as occupational psychology, organizational psychology, and work and organizational psychology, is an applied discipline within [[psychology]].

(19912). I/O psychology in Romania: Past, present and intentions. ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, 29''(4), 29\u201333.</ref> The roots of I/O psychology trace back nearly to the beginning of psychology as a science, when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded one of the first psychological laboratories in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. In the mid 1880s, Wundt trained two psychologists, [[Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg]] and [[James McKeen Cattell]], who had a major influence on the emergence of I/O psychology.<ref>Landy, F. J. (1997). Early influences on the development of industrial and organizational psychology. Journal of Applied Psychology, 82, 467\u2013477.</ref>\n\nInstead of viewing performance differences as human \"errors\", Cattell was one of the first to recognize the importance of differences among individuals as a way of better understanding work behavior. [[Walter Dill Scott]], who was a contemporary of Cattell, was elected President of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in 1919, was arguably the most prominent I/O psychologist of his time. Scott, along with [[Walter Van Dyke Bingham]], worked at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]], developing methods for selecting and training sales personnel.<ref>Feruson, L. (1965). ''The heritage of industrial psychology''. Hartford, CT: Finlay Press.</ref>\n\nThe \"industrial\" side of I/O psychology originated in research on individual differences, [[Industrial & Organizational Assessment|assessment]], and the prediction of work performance. Industrial psychology crystallized during World War I, in response to the need to rapidly assign new troops to duty. Scott and Bingham volunteered to help with the testing and placement of more than a million army recruits. In 1917, together with other prominent psychologists, they adapted a well-known intelligence test the [[Stanford\u2013Binet]], which was designed for testing one individual at a time, to make it suitable for group testing. The new test was called the [[Army Alpha]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAfter the War, the growing industrial base in the US was a source of momentum for what was then called industrial psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Private industry set out to emulate the successful testing of army personnel.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Mental ability testing soon became commonplace in the work setting.\n\n[[Elton Mayo]] found that rest periods improved morale and reduced turnover in a Philadelphia textile factory.<ref>Mayo, E.

In 1982, the unit become more independent of APA, and its name was changed again, this time to the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]].<ref name=\"Kopes\"/>\n\nThe name change of the division from \"industrial psychology\" to \"industrial and organizational psychology\" reflected the shift in the work of industrial psychologists who had originally addressed work behavior from the individual perspective, examining performance and attitudes of individual workers. Their work became broader. Group behavior in the workplace became a worthy subject of study.<ref name=\"Kopes\"/> The emphasis on \"organizational\" underlined the fact that when an individual joins an organization (e.g., the organization that hired him or her), he or she will be exposed to a common [[goal]] and a common set of operating procedures.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In the 1970s in the UK, references to occupational psychology became more common than I/O psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAccording to Bryan and Vinchur, \"while organizational psychology increased in popularity through [the 1960s and 1970s], research and practice in the traditional areas of industrial psychology continued, primarily driven by employment legislation and case law\" (p.&nbsp;53).<ref name = \"Bryan\">Bryan, L.

I/O psychologists rely on a variety of methods to conduct organizational research. Study designs employed by I/O psychologists include [[statistical survey|surveys]], [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], and [[observational studies]]. I/O psychologists rely on diverse data sources including human judgments, historical databases, objective measures of work performance (e.g., sales volume), and questionnaires and surveys.\n\nI/O researchers employ quantitative statistical methods. [[Quantitative methods]] used in I/O psychology include [[correlation]], [[multiple regression]], and [[analysis of variance]]. More advanced statistical methods employed in I/O research include [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]],<ref>Hayduk, L.A. (1987). ''Structural equations modeling with LISREL.''

A task-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the duties, tasks, and/or competencies required by the job being assessed. By contrast, a worker-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) required to successfully perform the work. Information obtained from job analyses are used for many purposes, including the creation of job-relevant selection procedures, [[performance appraisals]] and the criteria they require, and the development of training programs.\n\n===Personnel recruitment and selection===\n{{main|Personnel selection}}\nI/O psychologists typically work with human resource specialists to design (a) recruitment processes and (b) personnel selection systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Personnel [[recruitment]] is the process of identifying qualified candidates in the workforce and getting them to apply for jobs within an organization. Personnel recruitment processes include developing job announcements, placing ads, defining key qualifications for applicants, and screening out unqualified applicants.\n\nPersonnel selection is the systematic process of hiring and promoting personnel. Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates. Personnel selection involves both the newly hired and individuals who can be promoted from within the organization. Common selection tools include ability tests (e.g., cognitive, physical, or psycho-motor), knowledge tests, [[personality tests]], structured [[interviews]], the systematic collection of biographical data, and work samples. I/O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance.\n\nPersonnel selection procedures are usually validated, i.e., shown to be job relevant to personnel selection, using one or more of the following types of validity: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]]. I/O psychologists must adhere to professional standards in personnel selection efforts. SIOP (e.g., ''Principles for validation and use of personnel selection procedures''<ref>[http://www.siop.org/_Principles/principles.pdf ''The SIOP principles'']</ref>) and APA together with the [[National Council on Measurement in Education]] (e.g., ''Standards for educational and psychological testing''<ref>[''The standards for educational and psychological testing'' http://www.apa.org/science/programs/testing/standards.aspx]</ref> are sources of those standards. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s ''Uniform guidelines''<ref>[http://www.uniformguidelines.com/ ''Uniform guidelines on eemployee selection procedures'']</ref> are also influential in guiding personnel selection decisions.\n\nA meta-analysis of selection methods found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of job performance and attainment in training.<ref>Schmidt, F.L., & Hunter, J.E. (1998). The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings.

(1992). ''Industrial-organizational psychology.'' New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Performance appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for performance management. Performance management is the process of providing performance feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). Performance management may also include documenting and tracking performance information for organizational evaluation purposes.\n\nAn I/O psychologist would typically use information from the job analysis to determine a job's performance dimensions, and then construct a [[rating scale]] to describe each level of performance for the job.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Often, the I/O psychologist would be responsible for training organizational personnel how to use the performance appraisal instrument, including ways to minimize bias when using the rating scale, and how to provide effective performance feedback.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Individual assessment and psychometrics===\n{{main|Individual assessment|Psychometrics}}\n[[Individual assessment]] involves the measurement of [[individual differences]]. I/O psychologists perform individual assessments in order to evaluate differences among candidates for employment as well as differences among employees.<ref name=\"A and U\">Anastasi, A., & Urbina, S. (1997). ''Psychological testing. 7th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</ref> The constructs measured pertain to job performance. With candidates for employment, individual assessment is often part of the personnel selection process. These assessments can include written tests, aptitude tests, physical tests, psycho-motor tests, [[personality test]]s, integrity and reliability tests, work samples, [[simulation]]s, and [[assessment centre]]s.<ref name=\"A and U\"/>\n\n===Occupational health and well-being===\n\nI/O psychologists are concerned with occupational health and [[well-being]]. Early in the 20th century [[Arthur Kornhauser]] examined the impact on productivity of hiring mentally unstable workers.<ref name=\"Zickar\">Zickar, M. J. (2003).

Job mobility as predictor of health and burnout. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 82''(2), 317\u2013329.</ref>\n\nMore recently, I/O researchers have found that staying vigorous during working hours is associated with better work-related behaviour and subjective well-being as well as more effective functioning in the family domain.<ref name = \"Sonnen2008\">Sonnentag, S., & Niessen, C.

(2013). Employee relations and motivation. In Lewis, R., &  Zibarris, R. (Eds.), Work and Occupational Psychology: Integrating Theory and Practice. Sage</ref> For example, I/O research found that exposure to workplace violence elicited ruminative thinking, and ruminative thinking, in turn, is associated with poor well-being.<ref>Niven, K., Sprigg, C., Armitage, J., & Satchwell, A . (2013). Ruminative thinking exacerbates the negative effects of workplace violence ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 86(1), 67\u201384.</ref> I/O research has found that interpersonal aggressive behaviours is associated with worse team performance.<ref>Aube, C, & Rousseau, V . (2011). Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(3), 565\u2013580.</ref>\n\n===Remuneration and compensation===\n{{main|Remuneration}}\nCompensation includes wages or salary, bonuses, pension/retirement contributions, and [[employee benefits]] that can be converted to cash or replace living expenses. I/O psychologists may be asked to conduct a [[job evaluation]] for the purpose of determining compensation levels and ranges. I/O psychologists may also serve as [[expert witness]]es in pay discrimination cases, when disparities in pay for similar work are alleged by employees.\n\n===Training and training evaluation===\n{{main|Training}}\nTraining involves the systematic teaching of skills, concepts, or attitudes that results in improved performance in another environment.<ref name=\"Goldstein, I. L. 2002\">Goldstein, I. L., & Ford, J. K. (2002). ''Training in organizations: Needs assessment, development, and evaluation'' (4th ed). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</ref> Because many people hired for a job are not already versed in all the tasks the job requires, training may be needed to help the individual perform the job effectively. Evidence indicates that training is often effective, and that it succeeds in terms of higher net sales and gross profitability per employee.<ref>Arthur, W., Bennett, W., Edens, P.S., & Bell, S.T. (2003). Effectiveness of training in organizations: A meta-analysis of design and evaluation features. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 234\u2013245.</ref>\n\nSimilar to performance management (see above), an I/O psychologist would employ a [[job analysis]] in concert with the application of the principles of [[instructional design]] to create an effective training program.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} A training program is likely to include a [[summative evaluation]] at its conclusion in order to ensure that trainees have met the training objectives and can perform the target work tasks at an acceptable level. Training programs often include [[formative assessments|formative evaluations]] to assess the effect of the training as the training proceeds. Formative evaluations can be used to locate problems in training procedures and help I/O psychologists make corrective adjustments while training is ongoing.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe foundation for training programs is [[learning]]. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes.<ref>Kraiger, K., Ford, J. K., & Salas, E. (1993). Application of cognitive, skill-based, and affective theories of learning outcomes to new methods of training evaluation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 78'', 311 \u2013 328.</ref> Cognitive training is aimed at instilling declarative knowledge or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart procedural knowledge (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).<ref>Campbell, J. P., McCloy, R. A., Oppler, S.H., & Sager, C. E. (1993). A theory of performance. In N. Schmitt & W. C. Borman (Eds.), ''Personnel selection in organizations'' (pp. 35\u201370). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</ref>\n\nA [[needs assessment]], an analysis of corporate and individual goals, is often undertaken prior to the development of a training program.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P. Schultz, Sydney Ellen|title=''Psychology and work today: An introduction to industrial and organizational psychology''|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-205-68358-4|edition=10th}}</ref>{{rp|page=164}} In addition, a careful [[needs analysis]] is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained.<ref name=\"Goldstein, I. L. 2002\"/> A [[training needs analysis]] typically involves a three-step process that includes [[organizational analysis]], [[task analysis]] and person analysis.<ref>Dierdorff, E. C., & Surface, E. A. (2008). Assessing training needs: Do work experience and capability matter? Human Performance, 21, 28\u201348.</ref>\n\nAn organizational analysis is an examination of organizational goals and resources as well as the organizational environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The results of an organizational analysis help to determine where training should be directed. The analysis identifies the training needs of different departments or subunits.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It systematically assesses manager, peer, and technological support for [[transfer of training]]. An organizational analysis also takes into account the [[organisation climate|climate]] of the organization and its subunits. For example, if a climate for safety is emphasized throughout the organization or in subunits of the organization (e.g., production), then training needs will likely reflect an emphasis on safety.<ref>Zohar, D. (2002a). Modifying supervisory practices to improve subunit safety: A leadership-based intervention model. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 87'', 587\u2013596.</ref> A task analysis uses the results of a job analysis to determine what is needed for successful job performance, contributing to training content. With organizations increasingly trying to identify \"core competencies\" that are required for all jobs, task analysis can also include an assessment of competencies.<ref>Shippmann, J. S. et al. (2000). The practice of competency modeling. ''Personnel Psychology, 53'', 703\u2013740.</ref> A person analysis identifies which individuals within an organization should receive training and what kind of instruction they need. Employee needs can be assessed using a variety of methods that identify weaknesses that training can address.\n\n===Motivation in the workplace===\n{{main|Work motivation}}\nWork motivation reflects the energy an individual applies \"to initiate work-related behavior, and to determine its form, direction, intensity, and duration\"<ref name=\"Pin\">Pinder, C. C.(2008). ''Work motivation in organizational behavior'' (2nd edition). New York: Psychology Press</ref> Understanding what motivates an organization's employees is central to I/O psychology. [[Motivation]] is generally thought of as a theoretical construct that fuels behavior. An [[incentive]] is an anticipated reward that is thought to incline a person to behave a certain way.<ref name=\"Dec\">Deckers, L. (2010). ''Motivation: Biological, psychological and environmental'' (3rd ed., pp. 2\u20133). Boston, MA: Pearson.</ref> Motivation varies among individuals. Studying its influence on behavior, it must be examined together with ability and environmental influences. Because of motivation's role in influencing workplace behavior and performance, many organizations structure the work environment to encourage productive behaviors and discourage unproductive behaviors.<ref name=\"jex\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\">Mitchell, T.R.; Daniels, D. 2003. Motivation. ''Handbook of Psychology'', Vol. 12. Industrial Organizational Psychology, ed. W.C. Borman, D.R. Ilgen, R.J. Klimoski, pp. 225\u201354. New York: Wiley.</ref>\n\nMotivation involves three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Arousal is what initiates action. It is often fueled by a person's need or desire for something that is missing from his or her life, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Intensity is the amount of energy employees put into goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity often reflects the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes involve four factors.  First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. Second, it serves to stimulate effort. Third, motivation influences persistence. Finally, motivation influences the choice and application of task-related strategies.<ref name=Mitchell/>\n\n===Occupational stress===\n{{main|Occupational stress}}\nI/O psychologists are involved in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing.<ref>Vinchur, A.J, & Koppes, L.L.

Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.\n\nIn addition to an overall culture, organizations also have subcultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Examples of subcultures include corporate culture, departmental culture, local culture, and issue-related culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} While there is no single \"type\" of organizational culture, some researchers have developed models to describe different organizational cultures.\n\n===Group behavior===\n{{main|Group behavior}}\nGroup behavior involves the interactions among individuals in a collective.

During the chartering of new teams, organizational enabling resources are first identified. Examples of enabling resources include facilities, equipment, information, training, and leadership.<ref name=jex/> Team-specific resources (e.g., budgetary resources, human resources) are typically made available. Team-specific human resources represent the individual contributors who are selected to be  team members. Intra-team processes (e.g., task design, task assignment) involve these team-specific resources.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nTeams also function in dynamic multi-team environments. Teams often must respond to shifting organizational contingencies.<ref>Salas, E., Stagl, K., & Burke, C.

Chichester, UK: Wiley</ref> Contingencies affecting teams include constraints arising from conditions in which organizational resources are not exclusively earmarked for certain teams. When resources are scarce, they must be shared by multiple teams.\n\n====Team rewards====\nOrganizational reward systems drive the strengthening and enhancing of individual team member efforts; such efforts contribute towards reaching team goals.<ref>Luthans, F., & Kreitner, R. (1985). ''Organizational behavior modification and beyond: An operant and social learning approach'' (2nd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman</ref> In other words, rewards that are given to individual team members should be contingent upon the performance of the entire team.<ref name = \"Sun1990\"/>\n\nSeveral design elements are needed to enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If this is not the case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment.<ref>Wageman, R., & Baker, G. (1997). Incentives and cooperation: The joint effects of task and reward interdependence on group performance.

(1998). Team-based rewards: Current empirical evidence and directions for future research. ''Research in Organizational Behavior, 20'', 141\u201383.</ref> For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.<ref>Haines, V.Y., & Taggar, S. (2006). Antecedents of team reward attitude.

(1997). ''Job satisfaction: Application, assessment, causes and consequences''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology.

It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.<ref>Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., &  Wang, Q (2010).

To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee.<ref name=jex /> I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role ''and'' extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.<ref name=jex />\n\n====Job performance====\n{{main|Job performance}}\n[[Job performance]] represents behaviors employees engage in while at work which contribute to organizational goals.<ref name=\"campbell1990\">Campbell, J.P. (1990). Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology. In M.D. Dunnette & L.M. Hough (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (2nd ed., Vol 1, pp. 687\u2013732). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press.</ref> These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization as part of an employee's responsibilities.<ref name=\"campbell1990\"/> In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, it is important to be precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).<ref name=jex />\n\nTo model job performance, researchers have attempted to define a set of dimensions that are common to all jobs. Using a common set of dimensions provides a consistent basis for assessing performance and enables the comparison of performance across jobs. Performance is commonly broken into two major categories: in-role (technical aspects of a job) and extra-role (non-technical abilities such as communication skills and being a good team member). While this distinction in behavior has been challenged<ref>Morrison, E.W. (1994). Role definitions and organizational citizenship behavior: The importance of the employee's perspective.

(1989).  Dimensions of job performance. In R. Dillon & J.W. Pelligrino (Eds.), ''Testing: Theoretical and applied perspectives'' (pp. 218\u201347). New York: Praeger</ref> These various tools are often used to evaluate performance on specific tasks and overall job performance.<ref name=jex /> Van Dyne and LePine developed a measurement model in which overall job performance was evaluated using Campbell's in-role and extra-role categories.<ref name=\"VanDyneLePine1998\"/> Here, in-role performance was reflected through how well \"employees met their performance expectations and performed well at the tasks that made up the employees' job.\"<ref name=\"jex2008104\">Jex, S.M. & Britt, T.W.

While there are many sources of error with [[Performance Rating (Work Measurement)|performance ratings]], error can be reduced through rater training<ref name= \"Pulakos1984\">Pulakos, E.D. (1984). A comparison of rater training programs: Error training and accuracy training. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 69, 581\u201388)</ref> and through the use of behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance.<ref name=\"campbell1990\"/> Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself<ref name=\"Murphy1994\"/> and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.\n\nThe determinants of job performance consist of factors having to do with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance,<ref name=\"campbell1990\"/><ref name=\"Campbell1994\"/> job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen).<ref name=jex /> The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.\n\nRegardless of the job, three determinants stand out as predictors of performance: (1) general mental ability (especially for jobs higher in complexity); (2) job experience (although there is a law of diminishing returns); and (3) the personality trait of conscientiousness (people who are dependable and achievement-oriented, who plan well).<ref name=jex /> These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job knowledge and the motivation to do well. Further, an expanding area of research in job performance determinants includes emotional intelligence.<ref name= \"Baron\">Baron, R.; Handley R. & Fund S. (2006).

OCBs tend to be beneficial to both the organization and other workers. Dennis Organ (1988) defines OCBs as \"individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization.\"<ref name=\"Organ1988\">Organ, D.W.

While these behaviors are not formally part of the job description, performing them can influence performance appraisals.<ref name=jex /> Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of \"impression management,\" a term coined by [[Erving Goffman]].<ref>Goffman, E. (1959). ''The presentation of self in everyday life''. New York: Anchor Books.</ref> Goffman defined impression management as \"the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.<ref name=\"Bolino\">Bolino, M.C.

Nonetheless, I/O psychologists see the value of that variable where its consideration would, were its reliability and validity questioned, achieve a statistically significant probability that its results are not due to chance, and that it can be replicated reliably with a statistically significant ratio of reliability, and that were a court to raise a question on its reliability and validity testing, the I/O psychologist behind its use would be able to defend it before a court of justice with the belief that it will stand before such a court as reliable, and valid{{clarify|pre-text=remove or|date=February 2018}}{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.\n\nFour qualities are generally linked to creative and innovative behaviour by individuals:<ref name=jex /> \n* Task-relevant skills (general mental ability and job specific knowledge). Task specific and subject specific knowledge is most often gained through higher education; however, it may also be gained by mentoring and experience in a given field.<ref name=jex />\n* Creativity-relevant skills (ability to concentrate on a problem for long periods of time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex & Britt as productive forgetting.<ref name=jex /> Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an Operation Manager analyzing a reporting issue and developing an innovative solution would consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.\n* Task motivation (internal desire to perform task and level of enjoyment).<ref name=jex />\n\nAt the organizational level, a study by Damanpour identified four specific characteristics that may predict innovation:<ref>Damanpour, F. (1991). Organizational innovation: A meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 34, 555\u201390.</ref>\n\n# A population with high levels of technical knowledge\n# The organization's level of specialization\n# The level an organization communicates externally\n# Functional Differentiation.<ref name=jex />\n\n===Counterproductive work behavior===\n{{main|Counterproductive work behavior}}\nCounterproductive work behavior (CWB) can be defined as employee behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result from a wide range of underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft).<ref name = \"Spector and Fox\"/> It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.<ref name = \"Spector and Fox\"/>\n\nThe forms of counterproductive behavior with the most empirical examination are ineffective [[job performance]], [[absenteeism]], [[job turnover]], and [[accident]]s. Less common but potentially more detrimental forms of counterproductive behavior have also been investigated including violence and [[sexual harassment]].\n\n===Leadership===\n{{main|Leadership}}\nIn I/O psychology, leadership can be defined as a process of influencing others to agree on a shared purpose, and to work towards shared objectives.<ref>Yukl, G. (2010). Leadership in organizations (7th Ed.). New Jersey: Pearson</ref> A distinction should be made between leadership and [[management]]. Managers process administrative tasks and organize work environments. Although leaders may be required to undertake managerial duties as well, leaders typically focus on inspiring followers and creating a shared organizational culture and values. Managers deal with complexity, while leaders deal with initiating and adapting to change. Managers undertake the tasks of planning, budgeting, organizing, staffing, controlling and problem solving. In contrast, leaders undertake the tasks of setting a direction or vision, aligning people to shared goals, communicating, and motivating.<ref>Daft, R.L. (2011). ''Leadership'' (5th Ed.). Australia: Cengage.</ref>\n\nApproaches to studying leadership in I/O psychology can be broadly classified into three categories: Leader-focused approaches, contingency-focused approaches, and follower-focused approaches.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Leader-focused approaches====\nLeader-focused approaches look to organizational leaders to determine the characteristics of effective [[leadership]]. According to the [[Trait theory|trait approach]], more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach is being used to predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive.<ref>Hughes, R.L.; Ginnett, R.C. & Curphy, G.J. (2009). ''Leadership: Enhancing the lessons of experience'' (6th Ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Another leader-focused approached is the '''behavioral approach''' which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|consideration]]; and (2) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|initiating structure]]. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is '''[[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[social influence|influence]]'''. To be most effective a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: [[French & Raven's Five bases of Power|coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power]], and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational [[persuasion]], inspirational appeal, consultation, [[ingratiation]], exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.<ref name=\"Jex, S. M. 2008\">Jex, S.M. & Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational Psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach'' (2nd Ed.). New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons.</ref>\n\n====Contingency-focused approaches====\nOf the 3 approaches to leadership, contingency-focused approaches have been the most prevalent over the past 30 years. Contingency-focused theories base a leader's effectiveness on their ability to assess a situation and adapt their behavior accordingly.<ref name=\"Jex, S. M. 2008\"/> These theories assume that an effective leader can accurately \"read\" a situation and skillfully employ a leadership style that meets the needs of the individuals involved and the task at hand. A brief introduction to the most prominent contingency-focused theories will follow.\n\n[[Fiedler contingency model|Fiedler's Contingency Theory]] holds that a leader's effectiveness depends on the interaction between their characteristics and the characteristics of the situation. [[Path\u2013Goal Theory]] asserts that the role of the leader is to help his or her subordinates achieve their goals. To effectively do this, leaders must skillfully select from four different leadership styles to meet the situational factors. The situational factors are a product of the characteristics of subordinates and the characteristics of the environment. The [[Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX)|Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Model]] focuses on how leader\u2013subordinate relationships develop. Generally speaking, when a subordinate performs well or when there are positive exchanges between a leader and a subordinate, their relationship is strengthened, performance and job satisfaction are enhanced, and the subordinate will feel more commitment to the leader and the organization as a whole.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goleman |first= Daniel |title=Primal Leadership |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |location=USA}}</ref> [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|Vroom-Yetton-Jago Model]] focuses on decision making with respect to a ''feasibility set''<ref name=\"Jex, S. M. 2008\"/> which is composed of the situational attributes.\n\nIn addition to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, there has been a high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is [[transformational leadership]], which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is [[transactional leadership]], which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.\n\n====Follower-focused approaches====\nFollower-focused approaches look at the processes by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature in the domain of [[motivation]] in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in [[team]]s and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders need to be aware of the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.\n\nAn emerging area of I/O research in the area of team leadership is in leading [[virtual team]]s, where people in the team are geographically-distributed across various distances and sometimes even countries. While technological advances have enabled the leadership process to take place in such virtual contexts, they present new challenges for leaders as well, such as the need to use technology to build relationships with followers, and influencing followers when faced with limited (or no) face-to-face interaction.\n\n====Organizational development====\n{{Main|Organization development}}\nI/O psychologists are also concerned with organizational change. This effort, called organizational development (OD). Tools used to advance organization development include the survey feedback technique. The technique involves the periodic assessment (with surveys) of employee attitudes and feelings. The results are conveyed to organizational stakeholders, who may want to take the organization in a particular direction. Another tool is the team building technique. Because many if not most  tasks within the organization are completed by small groups and/or teams, team building is important to organizational success. In order to enhance a team's morale and problem-solving skills, I/O psychologists help the groups to build their self-confidence, group cohesiveness, and working effectiveness.<ref name=schultz>\n{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P.

Normally, this degree requires about 2\u20133 years to complete. Of all the degrees granted in I/O psychology each year, approximately two thirds are at the master's level.<ref name=schultz />{{rp|page=18}}\n \nA comprehensive list of US and Canadian master's and doctoral programs can be found at the web site of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP).<ref name=\"siop.org\">[http://www.siop.org/gtp/gtplookup.asp Graduate Training Programs (visited web site on March 22, 2009)]</ref> Admission into I/O psychology PhD programs is highly competitive given that many programs accept a small number of applicants every year.\n \nThere are graduate degree programs in I/O psychology outside of the US and Canada. The SIOP web site<ref name=\"siop.org\"/> also provides a comprehensive list of I/O programs in many other countries.\n\nIn Australia, Organizational Psychologists must be accredited by the [[Australian Psychological Society|Australia Psychological Society]] (APS). To become an Organizational Psychologist, one must meet the criteria for a general psychologist's licence: 3 years studying bachelor's degree in Psychology, 4th year Honours degree or Postgraduate Diploma in Psychology, and two-year full-time supervised practice plus 80 hours of professional development. There are other avenues available, such as a two year supervised training program after Honours (i.e. 4+2 pathway), or one year of postgraduate coursework and practical placements followed by a one year supervised training program (i.e. 5+1 pathway)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/psychology/psychology-internships/|title=Psychology Internship Pathways - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Registration/Provisional.aspx|title=Psychology Board of Australia - Provisional registration|website=www.psychologyboard.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref>. After this, psychologists can elect to specialize as Organizational Psychologists.\n\n===Competencies===\n\nThere are many different sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while he or she might not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, [[interpersonal skills]] (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).<ref>Cummings, T.G., & Worley, C.G.

The highest paid PhD I/O psychologists in private industry worked in pharmaceuticals and averaged approximately $151,000 per year; the median salary for self-employed consultants was $150,000; those employed in retail, energy, and manufacturing followed closely behind, averaging approximately $133,000. The lowest earners were found in state and local government positions, averaging approximately $77,000. In 2005, I/O psychologists whose primary responsibility is teaching at private and public colleges and universities often earn additional income from consulting with government and industry.<ref>Medsker, G.

(Ed.) (2007). The ethics of the business. ''The business of consulting: The basics and beyond'' (pp. 231\u2013244). San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer.</ref> The APA's ethical principles apply to I/O psychologists. For example, ethically, the I/O psychologist should only accept projects for which he or she is qualified. With more organizations becoming global, it is important that when an I/O psychologist works outside her or his home country, the psychologist is aware of rules, regulations, and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works, while adhering to the ethical standards set at home.<ref>Mobley, W.

Some groups represent only a few hundred people; while the largest, the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], has over 160,000 members<ref name=MembersDecline>{{cite news|last=Deakin|first=Michelle Bates|title=UUA membership declines again|url=http://www.uuworld.org/news/articles/183612.shtml|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=UUWorld.org|date=May 23, 2011}}</ref>  and is larger than all the other groups put together.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==History==\nThe original initiative for its establishment was contained in a resolution of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]] (British Unitarians) in 1987. This led to the establishment of the Advocates for the Establishment of an International Organization of Unitarians (AEIOU), which worked towards creating the council. However, the General Assembly resolution provided no funding.\n\nThe [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) became particularly interested in the establishment of a council when it had to deal with an increasing number of applications for membership from congregations outside [[North America]]. It had already granted membership to congregations in [[Adelaide]], [[Auckland]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Pakistan]], and congregations in [[Sydney]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] had applied for membership. Rather than admit congregations from all over the world, the UUA hoped that they would join a world council instead. The UUA thus became willing to provide funding for the council's establishment.\n\nAs a result, the council was finally established at a meeting in [[Essex, Massachusetts]], United States on 23\u201326 March 1995.\n\n==Principles and purposes==\nThe Preamble to the Constitution of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists reads:\n\nWe, the member groups of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists, affirming our belief in religious community based on:\n\n*liberty of conscience and individual thought in matters of faith,\n*the inherent worth and dignity of every person.\n*justice and compassion in human relations,\n*responsible stewardship in human relations,\n*and our commitment to democratic principles,\n\ndeclare our purposes to be:\n*to serve the Infinite Spirit of Life and the human community by strengthening the worldwide Unitarian and Universalist faith,\n*to affirm the variety and richness of our living traditions,\n*to facilitate mutual support among member organizations,\n*to promote our ideals and principles around the world,\n*to provide models of liberal religious response to the human condition which upholds our common values.\n\n==Members==\n\n===Full members===\n*[[Australian and New Zealand Unitarian Universalist Association]] (ANZUUA), 500 members\n*[[Brazilian Unitarian Association]]\n*[[Burundi Unitarian Church]]\n*[[Canadian Unitarian Council]], 5,150<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuc.ca/archive/whos_who//Admin/phil/InfoTopics2008February.pdf |title=Membership - The more it changes, the more it stays the same |publisher=Cuc.ca |accessdate=2013-09-16}}</ref>\n*Czech Republic: [[N\u00e1bo\u017eensk\u00e1 spole\u010dnost \u010desk\u00fdch unit\u00e1\u0159\u016f]] (Religious Society of Czech Unitarians)\n*Denmark: [[Unitarisk Kirkesamfund]], 55 families\n*[[European Unitarian Universalists]], 120 members across Europe\n*Finland: [[Unitarian Universalist Society of Finland]], 22 members\n*Germany: [[Deutsche Unitarier Religionsgemeinschaft|Unitarier - Religionsgemeinschaft freien Glaubens]]\n*Hungary: [[Unitarian Church of Hungary]], 25,000 members\n*India: The Indian Council of Unitarian Churches, which includes the [[Khasi Unitarian Union]], 9,000 members, and the [[Unitarian Christian Church of Madras]], 225 members\n*[[Unitarian Christian Church of Indonesia (also known as Jemaat Allah Global Indonesia)|Indonesia Global Church of God]], around 200 members\n*Netherlands: [[Vrijzinnige Geloofsgemeenschap NPB]], 4,385 members (2011), 60 congregations\n*Nigeria: [[First Unitarian Church of Nigeria]] and [[Ijo Isokan Gbogbo Eda]] (Unitarian Brotherhood Church)\n*[[Norwegian Unitarian Church]]\n*Philippines: [[Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines]] founded 1954, 2000 members\n*Romania: [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]], 80,000 members\n*South Africa: [[Unitarian Church of South Africa]], 110 members\n*Spain: [[Unitarian Universalist Society of Spain]], 55 members\n*UK: [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]], 6,000 members\n*USA: [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA), 162,796 (adult members)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|last=Bates |first=Michelle |url=http://www.uuworld.org/news/articles/183612.shtml |title=uua membership declines again |publisher=uuworld.org |date=2011-02-01 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref>\n\n===Reorganizing===\n*[[Kosciol Unitarianski]] (Unitarian Church in Poland), 80 attendees and friends.\n\nPolish Unitarians have reported a need for a period of reorganization, and that at this time they are unable to maintain the level of activity needed to be full Council members, be it moved that membership of these groups be suspended.

HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named [[Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing]] (EPIC), that allows the processor to execute multiple [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the [[compiler]] determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.<ref name=\"HP_Labs\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2001/apr-jun/itanium.html\n | title=Inventing Itanium: How HP Labs Helped Create the Next-Generation Chip Architecture\n | accessdate=March 23, 2007\n | last=\n | first=\n | authorlink=\n | date=June 2001\n | work=[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] Labs\n}}</ref>\nThe goal of this approach is twofold: to enable deeper inspection of the code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution, and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by eliminating the need for runtime scheduling circuitry.\n\nHP believed that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers.

This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long. Thus, major categories are designed to include a set of similar diseases. ICD-11 is a major step forward, because it has the necessary terminological and ontological elements for seamless use in digital health.\n\nThe ICD is published by the WHO and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, [[reimbursement]] systems, and automated decision support in health care. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. Like the analogous ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (which is limited to psychiatric disorders and almost exclusive to the United States), the ICD is a major project to statistically classify all health disorders, and provide diagnostic assistance. The ICD is a core statistically based classificatory diagnostic system for health care related issues of the [[Medical classification#WHO Family of International Classifications|WHO Family of International Classifications]] (WHO-FIC).<ref name=\"WHO-FIC\">{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/classifications/en/|title = The WHO Family of International Classifications|publisher = World Health Organization|accessdate = 14 March 2014|deadurl = no|archivedate = 22 December 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222042324/http://www.who.int/classifications/en/|undefined = }}</ref>\n\nThe ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its 10th revision. [[ICD-10]], as it is therefore known, is from 1992 and the WHO publishes annual minor updates and triennial major updates.

In 1893, a French physician, [[Jacques Bertillon]], introduced the ''Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death'' at a congress of the [[International Statistical Institute]] in Chicago.<ref>[https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28%28subject%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20Jacques%22%20OR%20subject%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20Jacques%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20J%2E%22%20OR%20title%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%20OR%20description%3A%22Bertillon%2C%20Jacques%22%20OR%20description%3A%22Jacques%20Bertillon%22%29%20OR%20%28%221851-1922%22%20AND%20Bertillon%29%29%20AND%20%28-mediatype:software%29 Works of Jacques Bertillon], Internet Archive.</ref><ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icd/en/HistoryOfICD.pdf|title=''History of the development of the ICD''.|website=Who.int|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nA number of countries adopted Bertillon's system, which was based on the principle of distinguishing between general diseases and those localized to a particular organ or anatomical site, as used by the City of Paris for classifying deaths. Subsequent revisions represented a synthesis of English, German, and Swiss classifications, expanding from the original 44 titles to 161 titles. In 1898, the [[American Public Health Association]] (APHA) recommended that the registrars of Canada, Mexico, and the United States also adopt it. The APHA also recommended revising the system every 10 years to ensure the system remained current with medical practice advances. As a result, the first international conference to revise the International Classification of Causes of Death took place in 1900, with revisions occurring every ten years thereafter. At that time, the classification system was contained in one book, which included an Alphabetic Index as well as a Tabular List. The book was small compared with current coding texts.\n\nThe revisions that followed contained minor changes, until the sixth revision of the classification system. With the sixth revision, the classification system expanded to two volumes. The sixth revision included morbidity and mortality conditions, and its title was modified to reflect the changes: International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD). Prior to the sixth revision, responsibility for ICD revisions fell to the Mixed Commission, a group composed of representatives from the International Statistical Institute and the Health Organization of the [[League of Nations]]. In 1948, the WHO assumed responsibility for preparing and publishing the revisions to the ICD every ten years. WHO sponsored the seventh and eighth revisions in 1957 and 1968, respectively. It later became clear that the established ten year interval between revisions was too short.\n\nThe ICD is currently the most widely used statistical classification system for diseases in the world.<ref>International health statistics using this system are available at the [http://www.who.int/gho/en/ Global Health Observatory] (GHO) and the [http://www.who.int/whosis/en/ WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS)].</ref> In addition, some countries\u2014including Australia, Canada, and the United States\u2014have developed their own adaptations of ICD, with more [[procedure code]]s for classification of operative or diagnostic procedures.\n\n==Versions of ICD==\n\n===ICD-6===\nThe ICD-6, published in 1949, was the first to be shaped to become suitable for morbidity reporting. Accordingly, the name changed from International List of Causes of Death to International Statistical Classification of Diseases. The combined code section for injuries and their associated accidents was split into two, a chapter for injuries, and a chapter for their external causes. With use for morbidity there was a need for coding mental conditions, and for the first time a section on mental disorders was added .<ref name=Katsching>{{cite journal|last=Katsching|first=Heinz|title=Are psychiatrists an endangered species?

This revision was more radical than the Seventh but left unchanged the basic structure of the Classification and the general philosophy of classifying diseases, whenever possible, according to their [[etiology]] rather than a particular manifestation.\nDuring the years that the Seventh and Eighth Revisions of the ICD were in force, the use of the ICD for indexing hospital medical records increased rapidly and some countries prepared national adaptations which provided the additional detail needed for this application of the ICD. \nIn the USA, a group of consultants was asked to study the 8th revision of ICD (ICD-8a) for its applicability to various users in the United States. This group recommended that further detail be provided for coding hospital and morbidity data. The American Hospital Association's \"Advisory Committee to the Central Office on ICDA\" developed the needed adaptation proposals, resulting in the publication of the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted (ICDA). In 1968, the United States Public Health Service published the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted, 8th Revision for use in the United States (ICDA-8a). Beginning in 1968, ICDA-8a served as the basis for coding diagnostic data for both official morbidity [and mortality] statistics in the United States.<ref name=\"volume2\"/><ref name=\"cdc\">{{cite web|url=http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/sci_data/codes/icd9/type_txt/icd9cm.asp|title=International Classification Of Diseases - 9 - CM, (1979)|website=Wonder.cdc.gov|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===ICD-9{{Anchor|ICDM 9|ICDM-9}}===\n{{see also|List of ICD-9 codes}}<!--The above anchor has incoming links from other articles; please don't remove it from the section header.-->\n\nThe International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death, convened by WHO, met in Geneva from 30 September to 6 October 1975. In the discussions leading up to the conference, it had originally been intended that there should be little change other than updating of the classification. This was mainly because of the expense of adapting data processing systems each time the classification was revised.\n\nThere had been an enormous growth of interest in the ICD and ways had to be found of responding to this, partly by modifying the classification itself and partly by introducing special coding provisions. A number of representations were made by specialist bodies which had become interested in using the ICD for their own statistics. Some subject areas in the classification were regarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for more detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant for the evaluation of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters concerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with the underlying generalized disease.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nAt the other end of the scale, there were representations from countries and areas where a detailed and sophisticated classification was irrelevant, but which nevertheless needed a classification based on the ICD in order to assess their progress in health care and in the control of disease. A field test with a bi-axial classification approach\u2014one axis (criterion) for anatomy, with another for etiology\u2014showed the impracticability of such approach for routine use.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe final proposals presented to and accepted by the Conference in 1978<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1361216 | pmid=16178999 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00444.x | volume=40 | title=Measuring diagnoses: ICD code accuracy | year=2005 | journal=Health Serv Res | pages=1620\u201339 |vauthors=O'Malley KJ, Cook KF, Price MD, Wildes KR, Hurdle JF, Ashton CM }}</ref> retained the basic structure of the ICD, although with much additional detail at the level of the four digit subcategories, and some optional five digit subdivisions. For the benefit of users not requiring such detail, care was taken to ensure that the categories at the three digit level were appropriate.\n\nFor the benefit of users wishing to produce statistics and indexes oriented towards medical care, the 9th Revision included an optional alternative method of classifying diagnostic statements, including information about both an underlying general disease and a manifestation in a particular organ or site. This system became known as the dagger and asterisk system and is retained in the Tenth Revision. A number of other technical innovations were included in the Ninth Revision, aimed at increasing its flexibility for use in a variety of situations.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIt was eventually replaced by ICD-10, the version currently in use by the WHO and most countries.

ICPM is published separately from the ICD disease classification as a series of supplementary documents called fascicles (bundles or groups of items).

Its ontological infrastructure allows for an improved user guidance compared to ICD-10.\n* The systematic reliance on the use of code combinations and extension codes makes ICD finally clinically relevant. With the combinations any condition can be coded to the desired level of detail.\n* Primary care, cancer coding, traditional medicine (currently module 1: ancient Chinese medicine - China, Korea and Japan), and a section for assessment of functioning are now included.\n* Specialty versions, as for mental health, primary care, or dermatology are produced from the common core, the foundation.\n* ICD-11 is truly multilingual. ICD-10 exists in 43 Languages in electronic versions and ICD-11 has already 15 translations in progress. The tooling produces all files and formats from the core translation tooling on the [https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en maintenance platform] .  For authorization of  translations, requests have to be made to WHO.\n* ICD-11 is digital health (formerly e-health) ready due to the use of uniform resource identifiers and its ontological underpinning.  The system allows connection of any software through a standard API.  The same package is also prepared for use offline.\n* ICD-11 is based on the electronic foundation component that contains all content, structural information, references and discriptors in a machine readable format. The content is then rendered for machine or human use, electronically or in print.\n* In ICD-11, each disease entity has a description that give key descriptions and guidance on what the meaning of the entity/category is in human-readable terms, to guide users. This is an advancement over ICD-10, which had only title headings. The Definitions have a standard structure according to a template with standard definition templates and further features exemplified in a \"Content Model\". The Content Model is a structured framework that captures the knowledge that underpins the definition of an ICD entity.  The Content Model therefore allows computerization (with links to ontologies and [[SNOMED CT]]). Each ICD entity can be seen from different dimensions or \"parameters\". For example, there are currently 13 defined main parameters in the Content Model (see below) to describe a category in ICD.\n\nAn external review of the ICD-11 Revision has been completed. The report notes the progress in the ICD Revision, and makes clear recommendations about forward progress in the revision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclive.in/international-classification-diseases/|title=Revision of International Classification Diseases by 2018 - ABC Live|website=Abclive.in|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n# ICD Entity Title - ''<small>Fully Specified Name</small>''\n# Classification Properties - ''<small>disease, disorder, injury, etc</small>''.\n# Textual Definitions - ''<small>short standard description</small>''\n# Terms - ''<small>synonyms, other inclusion and exclusions</small>''\n# Body System/Structure Description - ''<small>anatomy and physiology</small>''\n# Temporal Properties - ''<small>acute, chronic or other</small>''\n# Severity of Subtypes Properties - ''<small>mild, moderate, severe, or other scales</small>''\n# Manifestation Properties - ''<small>signs, symptoms</small>''\n# Causal Properties - ''<small>etiology: infectious, external cause, etc</small>.''\n# Functioning Properties - ''<small>impact on daily life: activities and participation</small>''\n# Specific Condition Properties - ''<small>relates to pregnancy etc.</small>''\n# Treatment Properties - ''<small>specific treatment considerations: e.g. resistance</small>''\n# Diagnostic Criteria - ''<small>operational definitions for assessment</small>''\n\nICD-11 invokes a more sophisticated architecture than historical versions, consistent with its generation as a digital resource.  The core content of the system, called the Foundation Component, is a semantic network of words and terms, where any given term can have more than one parent.  To address the requirement that statistical classifications exhibit mutual exclusiveness (so events are not counted more than once) and exhaustiveness (so there is a place to tally all events), ICD11 supports the serialization of the Foundation Component into an arbitrary number of linearizations, optimized for use cases.  The main linearization, presently called the Joint Linearization for Morbidity and Mortality Statistics, is the tabular format with which most traditional users will become familiar. However, other linearizations, for primary care, multiple sub-specialty derivatives, or applications such as clinical decision support are possible.  Finally, preliminary work in partnership with the [[IHTSDO]] is underway to ensure that the ICD-11 Foundation Component is semantically coherent through development of the Common Ontology, a subset of [[SNOMED CT]] which will anchor the Foundation Component to terms defined through [[description logic]].\n\n== Usage in the United States ==\nIn the United States, the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] published ''The International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Indexing of Hospital Records and Operation Classification (ICDA),'' completed in 1962 and expanding the ICD-7 in a number of areas to more completely meet the indexing needs of [[hospital]]s. The U.S. Public Health Service later published the ''Eighth Revision, International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States,'' commonly referred to as ICDA-8, for official national morbidity and mortality statistics. This was followed by the ''ICD, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification'', known as ICD-9-CM, published by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] and used by hospitals and other healthcare facilities to better describe the clinical picture of the [[patient]]. The diagnosis component of ICD-9-CM is completely consistent with ICD-9 codes, and remains the data standard for reporting morbidity. National adaptations of the ICD-10 progressed to incorporate both clinical code (ICD-10-CM) and procedure code (ICD-10-PCS) with the revisions completed in 2003. In 2009, the U.S. [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] announced that it would begin using ICD-10 on April 1, 2010, with full compliance by all involved parties by 2013.<ref Name=\"CMS_PressAug2008\">{{cite press release\n  | last =CMS Office of Public Affairs\n  | authorlink =Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n  | title =HHS Proposes Adoption of ICD-10 Code Sets and Updated Electronic Transaction Standards\n  | publisher =[[U.S. Department of Health & Human Services]]\n  | date =February 11, 2008\n  | url =https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/otheract/icd9/abticd10.htm\n  | accessdate = 2009-02-11 }}</ref>\n\nThe years for which causes of death in the United States have been classified by each revision as follows:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* ICD-1  \u2013 1900\n* ICD-2  \u2013 1910\n* ICD-3  \u2013 1921\n* ICD-4  \u2013 1930\n* ICD-5  \u2013 1939\n{{col-2}}\n* ICD-6  \u2013 1949\n* ICD-7  \u2013 1958\n* ICD-8A \u2013 1968\n* ICD-9  \u2013 1979\n* ICD-10 \u2013 1999\n{{col-end}}\n\nCause of death on United States death certificates, statistically compiled by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), are coded in the ICD, which does not include codes for human and system factors commonly called [[medical errors]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Makary|first1=MA|last2=Daniel|first2=M|title=Medical error\u2014the third leading cause of death in the US|journal=BMJ|date=3 May 2016|pages=i2139|doi=10.1136/bmj.i2139|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Moriyama|first1=IM|last2=Loy|first2=RM|last3=Robb-Smith|first3=AHT|editor1-last=Rosenberg|editor1-first=HM|editor2-last=Hoyert|editor2-first=DL|title=History of the Statistical Classification of Diseases and Causes of Death|date=2011|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics|location=Hyattsville, MD|isbn=978-0-8406-0644-0|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/classification_diseases2011.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Mental health issues==\nThe ICD includes a section classifying mental and behavioral disorders ([[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|Chapter V]]).

Elements ''r'' with this property are called ''regular'', so it is equivalent to require that every nonzero element of the ring be regular.\n\nA fundamental property of integral domains is that every [[subring]] of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] is an integral domain, and that, conversely, given any integral domain, one may construct a field that contains it as a subring, the [[field of fractions]]. This characterization may be viewed as a further equivalent definition:\n* An integral domain is a ring that is ([[isomorphic]] to) a subring of a field.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* The archetypical example is the ring <math>\\Z</math> of all [[integer]]s.\n* Every [[field (mathematics)|field]] is an integral domain. For example, the field <math>\\R</math> of all [[real number]]s is an integral domain.  Conversely, every [[artinian ring|Artinian]] integral domain is a field. In particular, all finite integral domains are [[finite field]]s (more generally, by [[Wedderburn's little theorem]], finite [[Domain (ring theory)|domains]] are [[finite field]]s). The ring of integers <math>\\Z</math> provides an example of a non-Artinian infinite integral domain that is not a field, possessing infinite descending sequences of ideals such as:\n\n::<math>\\Z \\supset 2\\Z \\supset \\cdots \\supset 2^n\\Z \\supset 2^{n+1}\\Z \\supset \\cdots</math>\n\n* Rings of [[polynomial]]s are integral domains if the coefficients come from an integral domain. For instance, the ring <math>\\Z[x]</math> of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is an integral domain; so is the ring <math>\\Complex[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</math> of all polynomials in ''n''-variables with [[Complex number|complex]] coefficients.\n\n* The previous example can be further exploited by taking quotients from prime ideals. For example, the ring <math>\\Complex[x,y]/(y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2))</math>corresponding to a plane [[elliptic curve]] is an integral domain. Integrality can be checked by showing <math>y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2)</math>is an [[irreducible polynomial]].\n\n* The ring <math>\\Z[x]/(x^2 - n) \\cong \\Z[\\sqrt{n}]</math> is an integral domain for any non-square integer <math>n</math>. If <math>n > 0</math>, then this ring is always a subring of <math>\\R</math>, otherwise, it is a subring of <math>\\Complex.</math>\n\n* The ring of [[p-adic number|p-adic integers]] <math>\\Z_p</math> is an integral domain.\n\n* If <math>U</math> is a [[connectedness|connected]] [[open subset]] of the [[complex number|complex plane]] <math>\\Complex</math>, then the ring <math>\\mathcal{H}(U)</math> consisting of all [[holomorphic function]]s is an integral domain. The same is true for rings of [[analytic function]]s on connected open subsets of analytic [[manifold]]s.\n\n* A [[regular local ring]] is an integral domain.

Indeed, choose a proper factorization <math>m = xy</math> (meaning that <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are not equal to <math>1</math> or <math>m</math>). Then <math>x \\not\\equiv 0 \\bmod{m}</math> and <math>y \\not\\equiv 0 \\bmod{m}</math>, but <math>xy \\equiv 0 \\bmod{m}</math>.\n\n* If ''R'' and ''S'' are commutative rings, then the [[product ring]] <math>R \\times S</math> is never an integral domain, because <math>(1, 0) \\cdot (0, 1) = (0, 0)</math> is the zero element.\n\n* When <math>n</math> is a square, the ring <math>\\Z[x]/(x^2 - n)</math> is not an integral domain. Write <math>n = m^2</math>, and note that there is a factorization <math>x^2 - n = (x - m)(x + m)</math> in <math>\\Z[x]</math>. By the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], there is an isomorphism <math>\\Z[x]/(x^2 - n) \\cong \\Z[x]/(x - m) \\times \\Z[x]/(x + m) \\cong \\Z \\times \\Z.</math>\n\n* The [[matrix ring|ring]] of ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over any [[zero ring|nonzero ring]] when ''n'' \u2265 2. If <math>M</math> and <math>N</math> are matrices such that the image of <math>N</math> is contained in the kernel of <math>M</math>, then <math>MN = 0</math>.  For example, this happens for <math>M = N = (\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix})</math>.\n\n* A geometric non-example is the [[quotient ring]] <math>k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/(fg)</math> for any field <math>k</math>, since <math>(fg)</math> is not a [[prime ideal]]. This is geometric because the underlying [[topological space]] of the [[affine scheme]] <math>\\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]/(fg)</math> is reducible, since it is the union of the closed subsets <math>\\{f = 0\\}</math> and <math>\\{g = 0\\}</math>.\n\n* The ring of [[continuous function]]s on the [[unit interval]].  Consider the functions\n::<math> f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1-2x & x \\in \\left [0, \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right ] \\\\ 0 & x \\in \\left [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1 \\right ] \\end{cases} \\qquad g(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & x \\in \\left [0, \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right ] \\\\ 2x-1 & x \\in \\left [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1 \\right ] \\end{cases}</math>\n:Neither <math>f</math> nor <math>g</math> is everywhere zero, but <math>fg</math> is.\n\n* The [[tensor product of algebras|tensor product]] <math>\\Complex \\otimes_{\\R} \\Complex</math>. This ring has two non-trivial [[idempotent (ring theory)|idempotent]]s, <math>e_1 = \\tfrac{1}{2}(1 \\otimes 1) - \\tfrac{1}{2}(i \\otimes i)</math> and <math>e_2 = \\tfrac{1}{2}(1 \\otimes 1) + \\tfrac{1}{2}(i \\otimes i)</math>. They are orthogonal, meaning that <math>e_1e_2 = 0</math>, and hence <math>\\Complex \\otimes_{\\R} \\Complex</math> is not a domain. In fact, there is an isomorphism <math>\\Complex \\times \\Complex \\to \\Complex \\otimes_{\\R} \\Complex</math> defined by <math>(z, w) \\mapsto z \\cdot e_1 + w \\cdot e_2</math>.

This example shows that a [[fiber product of schemes|fiber product]] of irreducible affine schemes need not be irreducible.\n\n== Divisibility, prime elements, and irreducible elements ==<!-- This section is redirected from [[Associate elements]] -->\n{{see also|Divisibility (ring theory)}}\nIn this section, ''R'' is an integral domain.\n\nGiven elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''R'', we say that ''a'' '''divides''' ''b'', or that ''a'' is a '''[[Divisibility (ring theory)|divisor]]''' of ''b'', or that ''b'' is a '''multiple''' of ''a'', if there exists an element ''x'' in ''R'' such that ''ax'' = ''b''.\n\nThe elements that divide 1 are called the '''[[unit (ring theory)|unit]]s''' of ''R''; these are precisely the invertible elements in ''R''. Units divide all other elements.\n\nIf ''a'' divides ''b'' and ''b'' divides ''a'', then we say ''a'' and ''b'' are '''associated elements''' or '''associates'''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Durbin |first=John R. |title=Modern Algebra: An Introduction |edition=3rd |date=1993 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-471-51001-7 |page=224 |quote=Elements ''a'' and ''b'' of [an integral domain] are called ''associates'' if ''a'' &#124; ''b'' and ''b'' &#124; ''a''.}}</ref>  Equivalently, ''a'' and ''b'' are associates if ''a'' = ''ub'' for some [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] ''u''.\n\nIf ''q'' is a nonzero non-unit, we say that ''q'' is an '''[[irreducible element]]''' if ''q'' cannot be written as a product of two non-units.\n\nIf ''p'' is a nonzero non-unit, we say that ''p'' is a '''prime element''' if, whenever ''p'' divides a product ''ab'', then ''p'' divides ''a'' or ''p'' divides ''b''. Equivalently, an element ''p'' is prime if and only if the [[principal ideal]] (''p'') is a nonzero prime ideal. The notion of '''[[prime element]]''' generalizes the ordinary definition of [[prime number]] in the ring <math>\\Z,</math> except that it allows for negative prime elements.\n\nEvery prime element is irreducible. The converse is not true in general: for example, in the [[quadratic integer]] ring <math>\\Z\\left[\\sqrt{-5}\\right]</math> the element 3 is irreducible (if it factored nontrivially, the factors would each have to have norm 3, but there are no norm 3 elements since <math>a^2+5b^2=3</math> has no integer solutions), but not prime (since 3 divides <math>\\left(2 + \\sqrt{-5}\\right)\\left(2 - \\sqrt{-5}\\right)</math> without dividing either factor). In a unique factorization domain (or more generally, a [[GCD domain]]), an irreducible element is a prime element.\n\nWhile [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique factorization]] does not hold in <math>\\Z\\left[\\sqrt{-5}\\right]</math>, there is unique factorization of [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].  See [[Lasker\u2013Noether theorem]].\n\n== Properties ==\n* A commutative ring ''R'' is an integral domain if and only if the ideal (0) of ''R'' is a prime ideal. This implies the associated affine scheme is reduced and irreducible. If <math>R</math> is graded, then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible.\n* If ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''P'' is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ''R'', then the [[quotient ring]] ''R/P'' is an integral domain if and only if ''P'' is a [[prime ideal]].\n* Let ''R'' be an integral domain. Then there is an integral domain ''S'' such that ''R'' \u2282 ''S'' and ''S'' has an element which is transcendental over ''R''.\n* The cancellation property holds in any integral domain: for any ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in an integral domain, if ''a'' \u2260 ''0'' and ''ab'' = ''ac'' then ''b'' = ''c''. Another way to state this is that the function ''x'' {{mapsto}} ''ax'' is injective for any nonzero ''a'' in the domain.\n* The cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain: if ''xI'' = ''xJ'', then either ''x'' is zero or ''I'' = ''J''.\n* An integral domain is equal to the intersection of its [[localization of a ring|localizations]] at maximal ideals.\n* An [[inductive limit]] of integral domains is an integral domain.\n\n== Field of fractions ==\n{{Main|Field of fractions}}\n\nThe [[field of fractions]] ''K'' of an integral domain ''R'' is the set of fractions ''a''/''b'' with ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'' and ''b'' \u2260 0 modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations.  It is \"the smallest field containing ''R''&thinsp;\" in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''R'' \u2192 ''K''}} such that any injective ring homomorphism from ''R'' to a field factors through ''K''. The field of fractions of the ring of integers <math>\\Z</math> is the field of [[rational number]]s <math>\\Q.</math> The field of fractions of a field is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the field itself.\n\n== Algebraic geometry ==\n\nIntegral domains are characterized by the condition that they are [[reduced ring|reduced]] (that is ''x''<sup>2</sup> = 0 implies ''x'' = 0) and [[irreducible ring|irreducible]] (that is there is only one [[minimal prime ideal]]). The former condition ensures that the [[nilradical of a ring|nilradical]] of the ring is zero, so that the intersection of all the ring's minimal primes is zero. The latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime. It follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal, so such rings are integral domains. The converse is clear: an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements, and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal.\n\nThis translates, in [[algebraic geometry]], into the fact that the [[coordinate ring]] of an [[affine algebraic set]] is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an [[algebraic variety]].\n\nMore generally, a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] is an [[integral scheme|integral]] [[affine scheme]].\n\n== Characteristic and homomorphisms ==\n\nThe [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of an integral domain is either 0 or a [[prime number]].\n\nIf ''R'' is an integral domain of prime characteristic ''p'', then the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> is [[injective]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikibooks|Abstract algebra|Integral domains}}\n* [[Dedekind\u2013Hasse norm]] \u2013 the extra structure needed for an integral domain to be principal\n* [[Zero-product property]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=Adamson |first=Iain T. | title=Elementary rings and modules | series=University Mathematical Texts | publisher=Oliver and Boyd | year=1972 | isbn=0-05-002192-3 }}\n* {{Cite book | last=Bourbaki | first=Nicolas | authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki | title=Algebra, Chapters 1\u20133 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-3-540-64243-5 | year=1998}}\n* {{Cite book | last1=Mac Lane | first1=Saunders | authorlink1=Saunders Mac Lane | last2=Birkhoff | first2=Garrett | authorlink2=Garrett Birkhoff | title=Algebra | publisher=The Macmillan Co. | location=New York | mr=0214415 | year=1967 | isbn=1-56881-068-7}}\n* {{Cite book | last1=Dummit | first1=David S. | last2=Foote | first2=Richard M. | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] | location=New York | edition=3rd | isbn=978-0-471-43334-7 | year=2004}}\n* {{Cite book | last=Hungerford | first=Thomas W. | authorlink=Thomas W.

For many operating systems, devices are serviced as soon as the device's [[interrupt handler]] is executed. Interrupt latency may be affected by [[microprocessor]] design, [[interrupt controller]]s, [[interrupt mask]]ing, and the [[operating system]]'s (OS) interrupt handling methods.\n\n==Background==\nThere is usually a trade-off between interrupt latency, [[throughput]], and processor utilization. Many of the techniques of [[microprocessor|CPU]] and [[operating system|OS]] design that improve interrupt latency will decrease throughput and increase processor utilization. Techniques that increase throughput may increase interrupt latency and increase processor utilization. Lastly, trying to reduce processor utilization may increase interrupt latency and decrease throughput.\n\nMinimum interrupt latency is largely determined by the [[interrupt controller]] circuit and its configuration. They can also affect the [[jitter]] in the interrupt latency, which can drastically affect the [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[Scheduling (computing)|schedulability]] of the system. The [[Intel APIC Architecture]] is well known for producing a huge amount of interrupt latency jitter.{{cn|date=November 2015}}\n\nMaximum interrupt latency is largely determined by the methods an OS uses for interrupt handling. For example, most processors allow programs to disable interrupts, putting off the execution of interrupt handlers, in order to protect [[critical section]]s of code. During the execution of such a critical section, all interrupt handlers that cannot execute safely within a critical section are blocked (they save the minimum amount of information required to restart the interrupt handler after all critical sections have exited).  So the interrupt latency for a blocked interrupt is extended to the end of the critical section, plus any interrupts with equal and higher priority that arrived while the block was in place.\n\nMany computer systems require low interrupt latencies, especially [[embedded system]]s that need to [[Control system|control]] machinery in real-time.  Sometimes these systems use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS). An RTOS makes the promise that no more than a specified maximum amount of time will pass between executions of [[subroutine]]s. In order to do this, the RTOS must also guarantee that interrupt latency will never exceed a predefined maximum.\n\n==Considerations==\nThere are many methods that hardware may use to increase the interrupt latency that can be tolerated. These include buffers, and [[flow control (data)|flow control]]. For example, most network cards implement transmit and receive [[ring buffer]]s, interrupt rate limiting, and hardware flow control. Buffers allow data to be stored until it can be transferred, and flow control allows the network card to pause communications without having to discard data if the buffer is full.\n\nModern hardware also implements interrupt rate limiting. This helps prevent [[interrupt storm]]s or ''live lock'' by having the hardware wait a programmable minimum amount of time between each interrupt it generates. Interrupt rate limiting reduces the amount of time spent servicing interrupts, allowing the processor to spend more time doing useful work.

We have been around this block several times before.\n\nPlease refrain from entering text that comes down conclusively on the question of whether or not child sacrifice was, in fact, practiced in Carthage. This question has been the subject of long and heated debate among editors of this article and has occasioned edit warring, semi-protection, etc.\n\nThe current consensus is that nobody knows for sure and that we should simply report both sides of the question without asserting which one is right. Any departure from this stance is likely to get edited out fairly quickly.\n\nParts of this section may be canted towards the assertion that child sacrifice ''was'' practiced in Carthage. It is reasonable to put in qualifying text that asserts that the details of the child sacrifice are based on accounts which may not be altogether reliable.\n\nWe are in the process of looking for sources for these details so that the descriptions can be based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].\n\nSee [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]] for details of past debate on this topic.\n\n-->\n\n{{Main|Religion in Carthage#Child sacrifice|l1=Carthaginian religion - Child Sacrifice Question}}\n\nAccording to Shelby Brown, [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]s, descendants of the [[Phoenicia]]ns, sacrificed infants to their gods.<ref name=\"Brown 1991\">{{Cite book| last = Brown | first = Shelby | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context| publisher = Sheffield Academic Press| year = 1991| location = Sheffield | pages = }}</ref> Charred bones of hundreds of infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites.

Families did not always keep their new child. After a woman had a baby, she would show it to her husband. If the husband accepted it, it would live, but if he refused it, it would die. Babies would often be rejected if they were illegitimate, unhealthy or deformed, the wrong sex, or too great a burden on the family.

Infanticide is one of the few forms of violence more often done by women than men. Cross-cultural research has found that this is more likely to occur when the child has deformities or illnesses as well as when there are lacking resources due to factors such as poverty, other children requiring resources, and no male support. Such a child may have a low chance of reproductive success in which case it would decrease the mother's [[inclusive fitness]], in particular since women generally have a greater [[parental investment]] than men, to spend resources on the child.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Liddle | first1 = J.

It is commonly known as '''TCP/IP''' because the foundational protocols in the suite are the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). It is occasionally known as the '''Department of Defense''' ('''DoD''') '''model''' because the development of the networking method was funded by the [[United States Department of Defense]] through [[DARPA]].\n\nThe Internet protocol suite provides [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end data communication]] specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, [[routing|routed]], and received. This functionality is organized into four [[abstraction layer]]s, which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved.<ref>RFC 1122, ''Requirements for Internet Hosts \u2013 Communication Layers'', R.

In 1972, [[Robert E. Kahn]] joined the DARPA [[Information Processing Technology Office]], where he worked on both satellite packet networks and ground-based radio packet networks, and recognized the value of being able to communicate across both. In the spring of 1973, [[Vinton Cerf]], the developer of the existing ARPANET [[Network Control Program]] (NCP) protocol, joined Kahn to work on [[open-architecture]] interconnection models with the goal of designing the next protocol generation for the ARPANET.\n\nBy the summer of 1973, Kahn and Cerf had worked out a fundamental reformulation, in which the differences between local network protocols were hidden by using a common [[internetwork protocol]], and, instead of the network being responsible for reliability, as in the ARPANET, this function was delegated to the hosts. Cerf credits [[Hubert Zimmermann]] and [[Louis Pouzin]], designer of the [[CYCLADES]] network, with important influences on this design. The protocol was implemented as the '''Transmission Control Program''', first published in 1974.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf|first1=Vinton G.|last1=Cerf|first2=Robert E.|last2=Kahn|last-author-amp=yes|title=A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication|series=5|date=1974}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the TCP managed both [[datagram]] transmissions and routing, but as the protocol grew, other researchers recommended a division of functionality into protocol layers.  Advocates included [[Jonathan Postel]] of the University of Southern California's [[Information Sciences Institute]], who edited the [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs), the technical and strategic document series that has both documented and catalyzed Internet development.<ref>Internet Hall of Fame</ref> Postel stated, \"We are screwing up in our design of Internet protocols by violating the principle of layering.\"<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien2.txt|first=Jon|last=Postel|title=Comments on Internet Protocol and TCP|date=1977|chapter=Section 3.3.3.2}}</ref> Encapsulation of different mechanisms was intended to create an environment where the upper layers could access only what was needed from the lower layers. A monolithic design would be inflexible and lead to scalability issues. The Transmission Control Program was split into two distinct protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.\n\nThe design of the network included the recognition that it should provide only the functions of efficiently transmitting and routing traffic between end nodes and that all other intelligence should be located at the edge of the network, in the end nodes. This design is known as the [[end-to-end principle]]. Using this design, it became possible to connect almost any network to the ARPANET, irrespective of the local characteristics, thereby solving Kahn's initial internetworking problem. One popular expression is that TCP/IP, the eventual product of Cerf and Kahn's work, can run over \"two tin cans and a string.\"{{cn|reason=I can only find possibly circular references for this phrase.|date=November 2017}} Years later, as a joke, the [[IP over Avian Carriers]] formal protocol specification was created and successfully tested.\n\nA computer called a [[Router (computing)|router]] is provided with an interface to each network. It forwards [[network packet]]s back and forth between them.<ref>RFC 1812, ''Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers'', F.

Cerf et al. (December 1974)</ref> A significant technical influence was the early networking work at [[Xerox PARC]], which produced the [[PARC Universal Packet]] protocol suite, much of which existed around that time.\n\nDARPA then contracted with [[BBN Technologies]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[University College London]] to develop operational versions of the protocol on different hardware platforms. Four versions were developed: TCP v1, TCP v2, TCP v3 and IP v3, and TCP/IP v4. The last protocol is still in use today.\n\n===Early Implementation===\nIn 1975, a two-network TCP/IP communications test was performed between Stanford and University College London (UCL). In November, 1977, a three-network TCP/IP test was conducted between sites in the US, the UK, and Norway. Several other TCP/IP prototypes were developed at multiple research centers between 1978 and 1983. The migration of the ARPANET to TCP/IP was officially completed on [[Flag day (software)|flag day]] January 1, 1983, when the new protocols were permanently activated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_tcpip.htm |title=TCP/IP Internet Protocol |access-date=2017-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===Adoption===\nIn March 1982, the US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/other/tcpdigest_paper.txt | title = From the ARPANET to the Internet | author = Ronda Hauben | publisher = TCP Digest (UUCP) | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, the Internet Advisory Board (later renamed the [[Internet Architecture Board]]) held a three-day workshop on TCP/IP for the computer industry, attended by 250 vendor representatives, promoting the protocol and leading to its increasing commercial use. In 1985, the first [[Interop]] conference focused on network interoperability by broader adoption of TCP/IP. The conference was founded by Dan Lynch, an early Internet activist. From the beginning, large corporations, such as IBM and DEC, attended the meeting.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ISOC-History-of-the-Internet_1997.pdf |title=Brief History of the Internet |date=1997 |author=Barry M.

In IBM, from 1984, [[Barry Appelman]]'s group did TCP/IP development. They navigated the corporate politics to get a stream of TCP/IP products for various IBM systems, including [[MVS]], [[VM (operating system)|VM]], and [[OS/2]]. At the same time, several smaller companies, such as [[FTP Software]] and the [[Wollongong Group]], began offering TCP/IP stacks for [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/108007 Wollongong]</ref> The first [[VM/CMS]] TCP/IP stack came from the University of Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weblab.isti.cnr.it/education/ssfs/lezioni/slides/archives/cern.htm |title=A Short History of Internet Protocols at CERN|publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2016}}{{dl|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of the early TCP/IP stacks were written single-handedly by a few programmers. Jay Elinsky and [[Oleg Vishnepolsky]] of IBM Research wrote TCP/IP stacks for VM/CMS and OS/2, respectively.{{cn|reason=previously cited [[Barry Appelman]] as a reference for this and it is indeed stated there but without citation and we can't use ourselves as a reliable source.|date=July 2018}} In 1984 Donald Gillies at MIT wrote a ''ntcp'' multi-connection TCP which ran atop the IP/PacketDriver layer maintained by John Romkey at MIT in 1983-4.

Various vendors, including IBM, included this code in their own TCP/IP stacks.  Microsoft released a native TCP/IP stack in Windows 95. This event was a little late in the evolution of the Internet, but it cemented TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols, which began to lose ground. These protocols included [[IBM Systems Network Architecture]] (SNA), [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[DECnet]], [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI), and [[Xerox Network Systems]] (XNS).\n\n==Key architectural principles==\n[[Image:IP stack connections.svg|thumb|350px|Two Internet hosts connected via two routers and the corresponding layers used at each hop. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. Every other detail of the communication is hidden from each process. The underlying mechanisms that transmit data between the host computers are located in the lower protocol layers.]]\n[[Image:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|350px|Encapsulation of application data descending through the layers described in RFC 1122]]\n\nThe [[end-to-end principle]] has evolved over time. Its original expression put the maintenance of state and overall intelligence at the edges, and assumed the Internet that connected the edges retained no state and concentrated on speed and simplicity. Real-world needs for firewalls, network address translators, web content caches and the like have forced changes in this principle.<ref>[http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy558/papers/Rethinking_2001.pdf Rethinking the design of the Internet: The end-to-end arguments vs. the brave new world], Marjory S. Blumenthal, David D. Clark, August 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[robustness principle]] states: \"In general, an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior. That is, it must be careful to send well-formed datagrams, but must accept any datagram that it can interpret (e.g., not object to technical errors where the meaning is still clear).\"<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=791 |page=23 |title=Internet Protocol DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification |date=September 1981 |editor=Jon Postel Editor}}</ref> \"The second part of the principle is almost as important: software on other hosts may contain deficiencies that make it unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features.\"<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=1122 |page=13 |title=Requirements for Internet Hosts \u2013 Communication Layers |date=October 1989 |editor=R. Braden}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n[[Encapsulation (networking)|Encapsulation]] is used to provide abstraction of protocols and services. Encapsulation is usually aligned with the division of the protocol suite into layers of general functionality. In general, an application (the highest level of the model) uses a set of protocols to send its data down the layers, being further encapsulated at each level.\n\nAn early architectural document, {{IETF RFC|1122}}, emphasizes architectural principles over layering.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=1958 |title=Architectural Principles of the Internet |editor=B. Carpenter |date=June 1996}}</ref> RFC 1122, titled ''Host Requirements'', is structured in paragraphs referring to layers, but the document refers to many other architectural principles not emphasizing layering. It loosely defines a four-layer model, with the layers having names, not numbers, as follows:\n; Application layer\n: The [[application layer]] is the scope within which applications create user data and communicate this data to other applications on another or the same host. The applications, or processes, make use of the services provided by the underlying, lower layers, especially the Transport Layer which provides reliable or unreliable ''pipes'' to other processes. The communications partners are characterized by the application architecture, such as the [[client-server model]] and [[peer-to-peer]] networking. This is the layer in which all ''higher level'' protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, HTTP, operate. Processes are addressed via ports which essentially represent services.\n; Transport layer\n: The [[transport layer]] performs host-to-host communications on either the same or different hosts and on either the local network or remote networks separated by routers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Craig |date=2002 |title=TCP/IP Network Administration |edition=3rd |publisher=O'Reilly |pages=9\u201310 |isbn=9781449390785}}</ref> It provides a channel for the communication needs of applications. UDP is the basic transport layer protocol, providing an unreliable datagram service. The Transmission Control Protocol provides flow-control, connection establishment, and reliable transmission of data.\n; Internet layer\n: The [[internet layer]] exchanges datagrams across network boundaries. It provides a uniform networking interface that hides the actual topology (layout) of the underlying network connections.  It is therefore also referred to as the layer that establishes internetworking. Indeed, it defines and establishes the Internet. This layer defines the addressing and routing structures used for the TCP/IP protocol suite. The primary protocol in this scope is the Internet Protocol, which defines IP addresses. Its function in routing is to transport datagrams to the next IP router that has the connectivity to a network closer to the final data destination.\n; Link layer\n: The [[link layer]] defines the networking methods within the scope of the local network link on which hosts communicate without intervening routers. This layer includes the protocols used to describe the local network topology and the interfaces needed to effect transmission of Internet layer datagrams to next-neighbor hosts.\n\nThe layers of the protocol suite near the top are logically closer to the user application, while those near the bottom are logically closer to the physical transmission of the data. Viewing layers as providing or consuming a service is a method of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] to isolate upper layer protocols from the details of transmitting bits over, for example, [[Ethernet]] and [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collision detection]], while the lower layers avoid having to know the details of each and every application and its protocol.\n\nEven when the layers are examined, the assorted architectural documents\u2014there is no single architectural model such as ISO 7498, the [[OSI model|Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model]]\u2014have fewer and less rigidly defined layers than the OSI model, and thus provide an easier fit for real-world protocols. One frequently referenced document, RFC 1958, does not contain a stack of layers. The lack of emphasis on layering is a major difference between the IETF and OSI approaches. It only refers to the existence of the internetworking layer and generally to ''upper layers''; this document was intended as a 1996 snapshot of the architecture: \"The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan. While this process of evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.\"\n\nThe Internet protocol suite and the layered [[protocol stack]] design were in use before the OSI model was established. Since then, the TCP/IP model has been compared with the OSI model in books and classrooms, which often results in confusion because the two models use different assumptions and goals, including the relative importance of strict layering.\n\nThis abstraction also allows upper layers to provide services that the lower layers do not provide. While the original OSI model was extended to include connectionless services (OSIRM CL),<ref>{{citation|title=OSI: Reference Model Addendum 1: Connectionless-mode Transmission, ISO7498/AD1|publisher=ISO7498/AD1|date=May 1986}}</ref> IP is not designed to be reliable and is a [[best effort delivery]] protocol. This means that all transport layer implementations must choose whether or how to provide reliability. UDP provides data integrity via a [[checksum]] but does not guarantee delivery; TCP provides both data integrity and delivery guarantee by retransmitting until the receiver acknowledges the reception of the packet.\n\nThis model lacks the formalism of the OSI model and associated documents, but the IETF does not use a formal model and does not consider this a limitation, as illustrated in the comment by [[David D. Clark]], \"We reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.\" Criticisms of this model, which have been made with respect to the OSI model, often do not consider ISO's later extensions to that model.\n\nFor multi-access links with their own addressing systems (e.g. Ethernet) an address mapping protocol is needed. Such protocols can be considered to be below IP but above the existing link system. While the IETF does not use the terminology, this is a subnetwork dependent convergence facility according to an extension to the OSI model, the internal organization of the network layer (IONL).<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16011 \"Information processing systems \u2013 Open Systems Interconnection \u2013 Internal organization of the Network Layer\"], ISO 8648:1988.</ref>\n\nICMP & IGMP operate on top of IP but do not transport data like UDP or TCP. Again, this functionality exists as layer management extensions to the OSI model, in its ''Management Framework'' (OSIRM MF)<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=14258 \"Information processing systems \u2013 Open Systems Interconnection \u2013 Basic Reference Model \u2013 Part 4: Management framework\"], ISO 7498-4:1989.</ref>\n\nThe SSL/TLS library operates above the transport layer (uses TCP) but below application protocols. Again, there was no intention, on the part of the designers of these protocols, to comply with OSI architecture.\n\nThe link is treated as a black box. The IETF explicitly does not intend to discuss transmission systems, which is a less academic<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8vKmPUfQMaIC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=The+IETF+explicitly+does+not+intend+to+discuss+transmission+systems,+which+is+a+less+academic#v=onepage&q=The%20IETF%20explicitly%20does%20not%20intend%20to%20discuss%20transmission%20systems,%20which%20is%20a%20less%20academic&f=false|title=A Complete Guide To Internet And Web Programming|last=Shah|first=Deven N.|date=2009|publisher=Dreamtech Press|isbn=9788177229257|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} but practical alternative to the OSI model.\n\nThe following is a description of each layer in the TCP/IP networking model starting from the lowest level.\n\n===Link layer===\nThe [[link layer]] has  the networking scope of the local network connection to which a host is attached. This regime is called the ''link'' in TCP/IP literature. It is the lowest component layer of the Internet protocols, as TCP/IP is designed to be hardware independent. As a result, TCP/IP may be implemented on top of virtually any hardware networking technology.\n\nThe link layer is used to move packets between the Internet layer interfaces of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the [[software]] [[device driver]] for the [[network card]], as well as on [[firmware]] or specialized [[chipsets]]. These perform [[Data link layer|data link]] functions such as adding a [[packet header]] to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a [[Physical layer|physical]] [[transmission medium|medium]]. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link layer addresses, such as [[Media Access Control]] (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist in the link layer, but are not explicitly defined.\n\nThis is also the layer where packets may be selected to be sent over a [[virtual private network]] or other [[tunneling protocol|networking tunnel]]. In this scenario, the link layer data may be considered application data which traverses another instantiation of the IP stack for transmission or reception over another IP connection. Such a connection, or virtual link, may be established with a transport protocol or even an application scope protocol that serves as a [[tunneling protocol|tunnel]] in the link layer of the protocol stack. Thus, the TCP/IP model does not dictate a strict hierarchical encapsulation sequence.\n\nThe TCP/IP model's link layer corresponds to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model physical and data link layers, layers one and two of the OSI model.\n\n===Internet layer===\nThe [[internet layer]] has the responsibility of sending packets across potentially multiple networks. [[Internetworking]] requires sending data from the source network to the destination network. This process is called [[routing]].<!--Now a nasty spam link. no archive available. <ref>http://www.comsci.us/datacom/ippacket.html</ref>-->\n\nThe Internet Protocol performs two basic functions:\n*Host addressing and identification: This is accomplished with a hierarchical [[IP address]]ing system.\n*Packet routing: This is the basic task of sending packets of data (datagrams) from source to destination by forwarding them to the next network router closer to the final destination.\n\nThe internet layer is not only agnostic of data structures at the transport layer, but it also does not distinguish between operation of the various transport layer protocols. IP carries data for a variety of different [[upper layer protocol]]s. These protocols are each identified by a unique [[List of IP protocol numbers|protocol number]]: for example, [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) and [[Internet Group Management Protocol]] (IGMP) are protocols 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nSome of the protocols carried by IP, such as ICMP which is used to transmit diagnostic information, and IGMP which is used to manage [[IP Multicast]] data, are layered on top of IP but perform internetworking functions. This illustrates the differences in the architecture of the TCP/IP stack of the Internet and the OSI model. The TCP/IP model's internet layer corresponds to layer three of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, where it is referred to as the network layer.\n\nThe internet layer provides an unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol is the principal component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the [[ARPANET]] and its successor, the Internet, is [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit [[IP address]] and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of [[IPv6|Internet Protocol version 6]] (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.\n\n===Transport layer===\nThe transport layer establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes host-to-host connectivity, meaning it provides end-to-end message transfer services that are independent of the structure of user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose and independent of the underlying network. The protocols in this layer may provide [[Error_detection_and_correction|error control]], [[Network_segmentation|segmentation]], [[Flow_control_(data)|flow control]], [[Network_congestion|congestion control]], and application addressing ([[Port_(computer_networking)|port numbers]]). End-to-end message transmission or connecting applications at the transport layer can be categorized as either [[connection-oriented]], implemented in TCP, or [[connectionless]], implemented in UDP.\n\nFor the purpose of providing process-specific transmission channels for applications, the layer establishes the concept of the [[TCP and UDP port|network port]]. This is a numbered logical construct allocated specifically for each of the communication channels an application needs. For many types of services, these [[port number]]s have been standardized so that client computers may address specific services of a server computer without the involvement of service announcements or directory services.\n\nBecause IP provides only a [[best effort delivery]], some transport layer protocols offer reliability. However, IP can run over a reliable data link protocol such as the [[High-Level Data Link Control]] (HDLC).\n\nFor example, the TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that addresses numerous reliability issues in providing a [[reliable byte stream]]:\n* data arrives in-order\n* data has minimal error (i.e., correctness)\n* duplicate data is discarded\n* lost or discarded packets are resent\n* includes traffic congestion control\n\nThe newer [[Stream Control Transmission Protocol]] (SCTP) is also a reliable, connection-oriented transport mechanism. It is message-stream-oriented\u2014not byte-stream-oriented like TCP\u2014and provides multiple streams multiplexed over a single connection. It also provides [[multi-homed|multi-homing]] support, in which a connection end can be represented by multiple IP addresses (representing multiple physical interfaces), such that if one fails, the connection is not interrupted. It was developed initially for telephony applications (to transport [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] over IP), but can also be used for other applications.\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless [[datagram]] protocol. Like IP, it is a best effort, \"unreliable\" protocol. Reliability is addressed through [[error detection]] using a weak checksum algorithm. UDP is typically used for applications such as streaming media (audio, video, [[Voice over IP]] etc.) where on-time arrival is more important than reliability, or for simple query/response applications like [[Domain Name System|DNS]] lookups, where the overhead of setting up a reliable connection is disproportionately large. [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) is a datagram protocol that is designed for real-time data such as [[streaming media|streaming audio and video]].\n\nThe applications at any given network address are distinguished by their TCP or UDP port. By convention certain [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|''well known ports'']] are associated with specific applications.\n\nThe TCP/IP model's transport or host-to-host layer corresponds roughly to the fourth layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, also called the transport layer.\n\n===Application layer===\nThe [[application layer]] includes the protocols used by most applications for providing user services or exchanging application data over the network connections established by the lower level protocols. This may include some basic network support services such as protocols for routing and host configuration. Examples of application layer protocols include the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), the [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP), and the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP).<ref>[http://www.kohala.com/start/tcpipiv1.html ''TCP/IP Illustrated: the protocols''], {{ISBN|0-201-63346-9}}, W. Richard Stevens, February 1994</ref> Data coded according to application layer protocols are  [[encapsulation (networking)|encapsulated]] into transport layer protocol units (such as TCP or UDP messages), which in turn use [[lower layer protocol]]s to effect actual data transfer.\n\nThe TCP/IP model does not consider the specifics of formatting and presenting data, and does not define additional layers between the application and transport layers as in the OSI model (presentation and session layers). Such functions are the realm of [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and [[application programming interface]]s.\n\nApplication layer protocols generally treat the transport layer (and lower) protocols as [[black box]]es which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate, although the applications are usually aware of key qualities of the transport layer connection such as the end point IP addresses and port numbers. Application layer protocols are often associated with particular [[client-server]] applications, and common services have ''well-known'' port numbers reserved by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA). For example, the [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]] uses server port 80 and [[Telnet]] uses server port 23. [[client (computing)|Clients]] connecting to a service usually use [[ephemeral port]]s, i.e., port numbers assigned only for the duration of the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.\n\nThe transport layer and lower-level layers are unconcerned with the specifics of application layer protocols. Routers and [[network switch|switches]] do not typically examine the encapsulated traffic, rather they just provide a conduit for it. However, some [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and [[bandwidth throttling]] applications must interpret application data. An example is the [[Resource Reservation Protocol]] (RSVP). It is also sometimes necessary for [[network address translator]] (NAT) traversal to consider the application payload.\n\nThe application layer in the TCP/IP model is often compared as equivalent to a combination of the fifth (Session), sixth (Presentation), and the seventh (Application) layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.\n\nFurthermore, the TCP/IP reference model distinguishes between ''user protocols'' and ''support protocols''.<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-9 RFC 1122], ''Requirements for Internet Hosts \u2013 Communication Layers'', 1.1.3  ''Internet Protocol Suite'', 1989</ref> Support protocols provide services to a system. User protocols are used for actual user applications. For example, FTP is a user protocol and DNS is a support protocol.\n\n==Layer names and number of layers in the literature==\nThe following table shows various networking models. The number of layers varies between three and seven.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n! style=\"background:#adb\" |RFC 1122, Internet STD 3 (1989)\n! style=\"background:#adb\" | Cisco Academy<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVAk7r6jHF4C|title=Network Fundamentals, CCNA Exploration Companion Guide|first1=Mark|last1=Dye|first2=Rick|last2=McDonald|first3=Antoon|last3=Rufi|date=29 October 2007|publisher=Cisco Press|isbn=9780132877435|accessdate=12 September 2016|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#adb\" | Kurose,<ref>[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/academic/product/0,,0321497708,00%2ben-USS_01DBC.html James F.

While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as [[X.400]], also combined them, there is no requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the [[External Data Representation|eXternal Data Representation]] (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called [[Remote Procedure Call]] (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.\n\nDifferent authors have interpreted the TCP/IP model differently, and disagree whether the link layer, or the entire TCP/IP model, covers OSI layer 1 ([[physical layer]]) issues, or whether a hardware layer is assumed below the link layer.\n\nSeveral authors have attempted to incorporate the OSI model's layers 1 and 2 into the TCP/IP model, since these are commonly referred to in modern standards (for example, by [[IEEE]] and [[ITU]]). This often results in a model with five layers, where the link layer or network access layer is split into the OSI model's layers 1 and 2.\n\nThe IETF protocol development effort is not concerned with strict layering. Some of its protocols may not fit cleanly into the OSI model, although RFCs sometimes refer to it and often use the old OSI layer numbers. The IETF has repeatedly stated{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} that Internet protocol and architecture development is not intended to be OSI-compliant. RFC 3439, addressing Internet architecture, contains a section entitled: \"Layering Considered Harmful\".<ref name=R3439>{{citation |url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3439.txt |title=Some Internet Architectural Guidelines and Philosophy |author1=R. Bush |author2=D. Meyer |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |date=December 2002 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the session and presentation layers of the OSI suite are considered to be included to the application layer of the TCP/IP suite. The functionality of the session layer can be found in protocols like [[HTTP]] and [[SMTP]] and is more evident in protocols like [[Telnet]] and the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP). Session layer functionality is also realized with the port numbering of the TCP and UDP protocols, which cover the transport layer in the TCP/IP suite. Functions of the presentation layer are realized in the TCP/IP applications with the [[MIME]] standard in data exchange.\n\nConflicts are apparent also in the original OSI model, ISO 7498, when not considering the annexes to this model, e.g., the ISO 7498/4 Management Framework, or the ISO 8648 Internal Organization of the Network layer (IONL). When the IONL and Management Framework documents are considered, the ICMP and IGMP are defined as layer management protocols for the network layer. In like manner, the IONL provides a structure for \"subnetwork dependent convergence facilities\" such as [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] and [[Reverse Address Resolution Protocol|RARP]].\n\nIETF protocols can be encapsulated recursively, as demonstrated by tunneling protocols such as [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE). GRE uses the same mechanism that OSI uses for tunneling at the network layer.\n\n==Implementations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nThe Internet protocol suite does not presume any specific hardware or software environment.  It only requires that hardware and a software layer exists that is capable of sending and receiving packets on a computer network. As a result, the suite has been implemented on essentially every computing platform. A minimal implementation of TCP/IP includes the following: [[Internet Protocol]] (IP), [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP), [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP), [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), and [[Internet Group Management Protocol]] (IGMP). In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet Protocol version 6 requires [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP), ICMPv6, and IGMPv6 and is often accompanied by an integrated [[IPSec]] security layer.\n\nApplication programmers are typically concerned only with interfaces in the application layer and often also in the transport layer, while the layers below are services provided by the TCP/IP stack in the operating system. Most IP implementations are accessible to programmers through [[Internet socket|sockets]] and [[Application programming interface|APIs]].\n\nUnique implementations include [[lwIP|Lightweight TCP/IP]], an [[open source]] stack designed for [[embedded system]]s, and [[KA9Q|KA9Q NOS]], a stack and associated protocols for amateur [[packet radio]] systems and [[personal computer]]s connected via serial lines.\n\nMicrocontroller firmware in the network adapter typically handles link issues, supported by driver software in the operating system. Non-programmable analog and digital electronics are normally in charge of the physical components below the link layer, typically using an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) chipset for each network interface or other physical standard. High-performance routers are to a large extent based on fast non-programmable digital electronics, carrying out link level switching.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Computer networking|Computer Science}}\n* [[BBN Report 1822]]\n* [[FLIP (protocol)]] (fast local Internet protocol stack)\n* [[List of automation protocols]]\n* [[List of information technology acronyms]]\n* [[List of IP protocol numbers]]\n* [[List of network protocols]]\n* [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Douglas E.

Conclusion 3 of the report states the following:\n\n{{Quote|Postwar findings support the DIA February 2002 assessment that Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was likely intentionally misleading his debriefers when he said that Iraq provided two al-Qa'ida associates with chemical and biological weapons (CBW) training in 2000\u2026 Postwar findings do not support the CIA's assessment that his reporting was credible\u2026 No postwar information has been found that indicates CBW training occurred and the detainee who provided the key prewar reporting about this training recanted his claims after the war\u2026 CIA's January 2003 version of Iraqi Support for Terrorism described al-Libi's reporting for CBW training \"credible\", but noted that the individuals who traveled to Iraq for CBW training had not returned, so al-Libi was not in position to know if the training had taken place\u2026 In January 2004, al-Libi recanted his allegations about CBW training and many of his other claims about Iraq's links to al Qa'ida. He told debriefers that, to the best of his knowledge, al-Qa'ida never sent any individuals into Iraq for any kind of support in chemical or biological weapons. Al-libi told debriefers that he fabricated information while in U.S. custody to receive better treatment and in response to threats of being transferred to a foreign intelligence service which he believed would torture him\u2026 He said that later, while he was being debriefed by a (REDACTED) foreign intelligence service, he fabricated more information in response to physical abuse and threats of torture. The foreign government service denies using any pressure during al-Libi's interrogation. In February 2004, the CIA reissued the debriefing reports from al-Libi to note that he had recanted information. A CIA officer explained that while CIA believes al-Libi fabricated information, the CIA cannot determine whether, or what portions of, the original statements or the later recants are true or false.<ref name=postwarFindingsReport>{{cite book |author=United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence |date=September 8, 2006 |title=Report on Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments |url=http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921074629/http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 21, 2006 |pages=106\u2013108 |accessdate=May 13, 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nOn June 11, 2008 ''Newsweek'' published an account of material from a \"previously undisclosed CIA report written in the summer of 2002\". The article reported that on August 7, 2002 CIA analysts had drafted a high-level report that expressed serious doubts about the information flowing from al-Libi's interrogation. The information that al-Libi acknowledged being a member of al-Qaeda's executive council was not supported by other sources. According to al-Libi, in Egypt he was locked in a tiny box less than 20 inches high and held for 17 hours and after being let out he was thrown to the floor and punched for 15&nbsp;minutes. According to CIA operational cables, only then did he tell his \"fabricated\" story about al-Qaeda members being dispatched to Iraq.<ref name=Newsweek20080611>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/141009 |title=Spies, Lies and the White House |work=[[Newsweek]] |first=Michael |last=Isikoff |authorlink=Michael Isikoff |author2=[[Mark Hosenball]] |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5YYJXt7YG?url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/141009/output/print |archivedate=June 13, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==Book: ''Inside the Jihad''==\nIn November 2006, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] using the pseudonym [[Omar Nasiri]], having infiltrated al-Qaeda in the 1990s, wrote the book, ''[[Inside the Jihad: My Life with al Qaeda, a Spy's story]]''.

In an interview with [[BBC2]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'', Nasiri said Libi \"needed the conflict in Iraq because months before I heard him telling us when a question was asked in the [[mosque]] after the prayer in the evening, where is the best country to fight the jihad?\" Nasiri said that Libi had identified Iraq as the \"weakest\" [[Muslim]] country. He suggested to ''Newsnight'' that al-Libi wanted to overthrow Saddam and use Iraq as a jihadist base. Nasiri describes al-Libi as one of the leaders at the Afghan camp, and characterizes him as \"brilliant in every way.\" He said that learning how to withstand interrogations and supply false information was a key part of the training in the camps.

With regard to al-Libi, Tenet writes the following:\n\n{{Quote|We believed that al-Libi was withholding critical threat information at the time, so we transferred him to a third country for further debriefing. Allegations were made that we did so knowing that he would be tortured, but this is false. The country in question understood and agreed that they would hold al-Libi for a limited period. In the course of questioning while he was in U.S. custody in Afghanistan, al-Libi made initial references to possible al-Qa'ida training in Iraq. He offered up information that a militant known as Abu Abdullah had told him that at least three times between 1997 and 2000, the now-deceased al-Qa'ida leader [[Mohammad Atef]] had sent Abu Abdullah to Iraq to seek training in poisons and mustard gas. Another senior al-Qa'ida detainee told us that Mohammad Atef was interested in expanding al-Qa-ida's ties to Iraq, which, in our eyes, added credibility to the reporting. Then, shortly after the Iraq war got under way, al-Libi recanted his story. Now, suddenly, he was saying that there was no such cooperative training. Inside the CIA, there was sharp division on his recantation. It led us to recall his reporting, and here is where the mystery begins. Al-Libi's story will no doubt be that he decided to fabricate in order to get better treatment and avoid harsh punishment. He clearly lied. We just don't know when. Did he lie when he first said that al-Qa'ida members received training in Iraq or did he lie when he said they did not? In my mind, either case might still be true. Perhaps, early on, he was under pressure, assumed his interrogators already knew the story, and sang away. After time passed and it became clear that he would not be harmed, he might have changed his story to butt the minds of his captors. Al-Qa'ida operatives are trained to do just that. A recantation would restore his stature as someone who had successfully confounded the enemy. The fact is, we don't know which story is true, and since we don't know, we can assume nothing.<ref>{{cite book |first=George |last=Tenet |authorlink=George Tenet |author2=Bill Harlow  |title=[[At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA]] |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2007 |pages=353\u2013354 |isbn=978-0-06-114778-4}}</ref>}}\n\n==Repatriation to Libya and death==\nIn 2006 the Bush Administration announced that it was transferring high-value al-Qaeda detainees from CIA secret prisons so they could be put on trial by military commissions.\nBut the Administration was conspicuously silent about al-Libi.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.allgov.com/ViewNews/Source_for_Colin_Powells_Fake_UN_Claim_of_Iraq_al_Qaeda_Connection_Dies_in_Libyan_Prison_90513 |title=Source for Colin Powell's Fake UN Claim of Iraq-al-Qaeda Connection Dies in Libyan Prison |date=May 13, 2009 |author=Noel Brinkerhoff |publisher=[[AllGov.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h3zP2g6A?url=http://www.allgov.com/ViewNews/Source_for_Colin_Powells_Fake_UN_Claim_of_Iraq_al_Qaeda_Connection_Dies_in_Libyan_Prison_90513 |archivedate=May 26, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> In December 2014, it was revealed that he had been transferred to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in 2003 and transferred to Morocco on March 27, 2004.<ref>[http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/212-ali-muhammad-abdul-aziz-al-fakhri Ali Muhammad Abdul Aziz al Fakhri, The New York Times Guantanamo Docket]</ref>\n\nNoman Benotman, a former [[Mujahideen]] who knew Libi, told ''Newsweek'' that during a recent trip to [[Tripoli]], he met with a senior Libyan government official who confirmed to him that Libi had been transferred to Libya and was being held in prison there.

consists of several distinct organizations that are legally independent from each other, but are united within the movement through common basic principles, objectives, symbols, statutes and governing organisations. The movement's parts are:\n\n* The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) is a private humanitarian institution founded in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland, in particular by [[Henry Dunant]] and [[Gustave Moynier]].  Its 25-member committee has a unique authority under [[international humanitarian law]] to protect the life and dignity of the victims of international and internal armed conflicts. The ICRC was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] on three occasions (in 1917, 1944 and 1963).<ref name=\"NobelFactsorg\"/>\n*The [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) was founded in 1919 and today it coordinates activities between the 190 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies within the Movement. On an international level, the Federation leads and organizes, in close cooperation with the National Societies, relief assistance missions responding to large-scale emergencies. The International Federation Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1963, the Federation (then known as the League of Red Cross Societies) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the ICRC.<ref name=\"NobelFactsorg\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/organizations.html|title=Nobel Laureates Facts&nbsp;\u2014 Organizations|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>\n* [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] exist in nearly every country in the world. Currently 190 National Societies are recognized by the ICRC and admitted as full members of the Federation. Each entity works in its home country according to the principles of international humanitarian law and the statutes of the international Movement. Depending on their specific circumstances and capacities, National Societies can take on additional humanitarian tasks that are not directly defined by international humanitarian law or the mandates of the international Movement. In many countries, they are tightly linked to the respective national health care system by providing [[emergency medical services]].\n\n==History==\n\n===International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)===\n\n====Solferino, Jean-Henri Dunant and foundation====\n[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Henri Dunant]], author of ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''.]]\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, there were no organized and/or well-established army nursing systems for casualties and no safe and protected institutions to accommodate and treat those who were wounded on the battlefield.  A devout [[Reformed Christian]], the Swiss businessman [[Jean-Henri Dunant]], in June 1859, traveled to Italy to meet French emperor [[Napol\u00e9on III]] with the intention of discussing difficulties in conducting business in Algeria, at that time occupied by France.<ref name=\"YoungHoyland2016\">{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=John|last2=Hoyland|first2=Greg|title=Christianity: A Complete Introduction|date=14 July 2016|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|language=English|isbn=9781473615779|page=354}}</ref> He arrived in the small town of [[Solferino]] on the evening of 24 June after the [[Battle of Solferino]], an engagement in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War]]. In a single day, about 40,000 soldiers on both sides died or were left wounded on the field. Jean-Henri Dunant was shocked by the terrible aftermath of the battle, the suffering of the wounded soldiers, and the near-total lack of medical attendance and basic care. He completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded. He took point in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance with the local villagers to aid without discrimination.\n[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|left|Original document of the [[First Geneva Convention]], 1864]]\n\nBack in his home in [[Geneva]], he decided to write a book entitled ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'' which he published using his own money in 1862. He sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe, and people he thought could help him make a change. In addition to penning a vivid description of his experiences in Solferino in 1859, he explicitly advocated the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war, an idea that was inspired by Christian teaching regarding social responsibility, as well as his experience after the battlefield of Solferino.<ref name=\"SendingPouliot2015\">{{cite book|last1=Sending|first1=Ole Jacob|last2=Pouliot|first2=Vincent|last3=Neumann|first3=Iver B.|title=Diplomacy and the Making of World Politics|date=20 August 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9781316368787|page=181}}</ref><ref name=\"Stefon2011\">{{cite book|last=Stefon|first=Matt|title=Christianity: History, Belief, and Practice|year=2011|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|language=English|isbn=9781615304936|page=221}}</ref><ref name=\"YoungHoyland2016\"/> In addition, he called for the development of an international treaty to guarantee the protection of medics and field hospitals for soldiers wounded on the battlefield.\n\nIn 1863, [[Gustave Moynier]], a Geneva lawyer and president of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, received a copy of Dunant's book and introduced it for discussion at a meeting of that society. As a result of this initial discussion the society established an investigatory commission to examine the feasibility of Dunant's suggestions and eventually to organize an international conference about their possible implementation. The members of this committee, which has subsequently been referred to as the \"Committee of the Five,\" aside from Dunant and Moynier were physician [[Louis Appia]], who had significant experience working as a field surgeon; Appia's friend and colleague [[Th\u00e9odore Maunoir]], from the Geneva Hygiene and Health Commission; and [[Guillaume Henri Dufour|Guillaume-Henri Dufour]], a [[Swiss Army]] general of great renown. Eight days later, the five men decided to rename the committee to the \"International Committee for Relief to the Wounded\". In October (26\u201329) 1863, the international conference organized by the committee was held in Geneva to develop possible measures to improve medical services on the battlefield. The conference was attended by 36 individuals: eighteen official delegates from national governments, six delegates from other non-governmental organizations, seven non-official foreign delegates, and the five members of the International Committee. The states and kingdoms represented by official delegates were: [[Austrian Empire]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], [[Second French Empire]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], [[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]], [[Spanish Empire]], [[United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway]], and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref>Angela Bennett: The Geneva Convention.

Sixteen countries sent a total of twenty-six delegates to Geneva. On 22 August 1864, the conference adopted the first [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] \"for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field\".

Also in 1864, [[Louis Appia]] and [[Charles William Meredith van de Velde|Charles van de Velde]], a captain of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch Army]], became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the Red Cross in an armed conflict. Three years later in 1867, the first [[International Conference of National Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded]] was convened.\n\nAlso in 1867, Jean-Henri Dunant was forced to declare [[bankruptcy]] due to business failures in [[Algeria]], partly because he had neglected his business interests during his tireless activities for the International Committee. Controversy surrounding Dunant's business dealings and the resulting negative public opinion, combined with an ongoing conflict with Gustave Moynier, led to Dunant's expulsion from his position as a member and secretary. He was charged with fraudulent bankruptcy and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Thus, he was forced to leave Geneva and never returned to his home city.\n\nIn the following years, national societies were founded in nearly every country in Europe. The project resonated well with patriotic sentiments that were on the rise in the late-nineteenth-century, and national societies were often encouraged as signifiers of national moral superiority.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dromi|first1=Shai M.|title=For good and country: nationalism and the diffusion of humanitarianism in the late nineteenth century|journal=The Sociological Review|date=2016|volume=64|issue=2|pages=79\u201397|doi=10.1002/2059-7932.12003|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2059-7932.12003/abstract}}</ref> In 1876, the committee adopted the name \"International Committee of the Red Cross\" (ICRC), which is still its official designation today. Five years later, the [[American Red Cross]] was founded through the efforts of [[Clara Barton]].<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7315/ |title = The Story of My Childhood |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1907 |accessdate = 2013-10-09 }}</ref> More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts. In a rather short period of time, the Red Cross gained huge momentum as an internationally respected movement, and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work.\n\nWhen the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded in 1901, the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] opted to give it jointly to Jean-Henri Dunant and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy]], a leading international pacifist. More significant than the honor of the prize itself, this prize marked the overdue rehabilitation of Jean-Henri Dunant and represented a tribute to his key role in the formation of the Red Cross. Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of [[Heiden, Switzerland|Heiden]]. Only two months earlier his long-standing adversary Gustave Moynier had also died, leaving a mark in the history of the Committee as its longest-serving president ever.\n\nIn 1906, the 1864 Geneva Convention was revised for the first time. One year later, the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention X]], adopted at the Second International Peace Conference in [[The Hague]], extended the scope of the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Shortly before the beginning of the [[First World War]] in 1914, 50 years after the foundation of the ICRC and the adoption of the first Geneva Convention, there were already 45 national relief societies throughout the world. The movement had extended itself beyond Europe and North America to Central and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, El Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela), Asia (the Republic of China, Japan, Korea, [[Thailand|Siam]]), and Africa ([[Union of South Africa]]).\n\n====World War I====\n\n[[File:War 1914-1918. International Prisoners-of-War Agency.jpg|thumb|War 1914-1918. Geneva, Rath Museum. International Prisoners-of-War Agency. Researches department. German section. Express messages and communications to families.]]\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]], the ICRC found itself confronted with enormous challenges that it could handle only by working closely with the national Red Cross societies. Red Cross nurses from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the European countries involved in the war. On 15 August 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War ([[POW]]) Agency, which had about 1,200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914. By the end of the war, the Agency had transferred about 20 million letters and messages, 1.9 million parcels, and about 18 million [[Swiss franc]]s in monetary donations to POWs of all affected countries. Furthermore, due to the intervention of the Agency, about 200,000 prisoners were exchanged between the warring parties, released from captivity and returned to their home country. The organizational card index of the Agency accumulated about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923. The card index led to the identification of about 2 million POWs and the ability to contact their families. The complete index is on loan today from the ICRC to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum]] in Geneva. The right to access the index is still strictly restricted to the ICRC.\n\nDuring the entire war, the ICRC monitored warring parties' compliance with the [[Geneva Conventions]] of the 1907 revision and forwarded complaints about violations to the respective country. When [[chemical weapons]] were used in this war for the first time in history, the ICRC vigorously protested against this new type of warfare. Even without having a mandate from the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC tried to ameliorate the suffering of civil populations. In territories that were officially designated as \"occupied territories\", the ICRC could assist the civilian population on the basis of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]]'s \"Laws and Customs of War on Land\" of 1907. This convention was also the legal basis for the ICRC's work for prisoners of war. In addition to the work of the International Prisoner-of-War Agency as described above this included inspection visits to POW camps. A total of 524 camps throughout Europe were visited by 41 delegates from the ICRC until the end of the war.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1918, the ICRC published a number of [[postcard]]s with scenes from the POW camps. The pictures showed the prisoners in day-to-day activities such as the distribution of letters from home. The intention of the ICRC was to provide the families of the prisoners with some hope and solace and to alleviate their uncertainties about the fate of their loved ones. After the end of the war, between 1920 and 1922, the ICRC organized the return of about 500,000 prisoners to their home countries. In 1920, the task of repatriation was handed over to the newly founded [[League of Nations]], which appointed the Norwegian diplomat and scientist [[Fridtjof Nansen]] as its \"High Commissioner for Repatriation of the War Prisoners\". His legal mandate was later extended to support and care for war refugees and displaced persons when his office became that of the League of Nations \"High Commissioner for Refugees\". Nansen, who invented the [[Nansen passport]] for stateless refugees and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922, appointed two delegates from the ICRC as his deputies.\n[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|left|Red Cross ambulance from 1917]]\nA year before the end of the war, the ICRC received the 1917 Nobel Peace Prize for its outstanding wartime work. It was the only Nobel Peace Prize awarded in the period from 1914 to 1918. In 1923, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] adopted a change in its policy regarding the selection of new members. Until then, only citizens from the city of Geneva could serve in the Committee. This limitation was expanded to include Swiss citizens. As a direct consequence of World War I, a treaty was adopted in 1925 which outlawed the use of suffocating or poisonous gases and biological agents as weapons. Four years later, the original Convention was revised and the second Geneva Convention \"relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War\" was established. The events of World War I and the respective activities of the ICRC significantly increased the reputation and authority of the Committee among the international community and led to an extension of its competencies.\n\nAs early as in 1934, a draft proposal for an additional convention for the protection of the civil population in occupied territories during an armed conflict was adopted by the International Red Cross Conference. Unfortunately, most governments had little interest in implementing this convention, and it was thus prevented from entering into force before the beginning of [[World War II]].\n\n====World War II====\n\n[[File:War Agency.jpg|thumb|War 1939\u20131945. Geneva, Central Prisoners of war Agency, Electoral building / Palace of the General Council]]\n\nThe Red Cross' response to the Holocaust has been the subject of significant controversy and criticism. As early as May 1944, the ICRC was criticized for its indifference to Jewish suffering and death\u2014criticism that intensified after the end of the war, when the full extent of the Holocaust became undeniable. One defense to these allegations is that the Red Cross was trying to preserve its reputation as a neutral and impartial organization by not interfering with what was viewed as a German internal matter. The Red Cross also considered its primary focus to be [[prisoners of war]] whose countries had signed the [[Geneva Convention]].{{sfn|Farr\u00e9|Schubert|2009|p=72}}\n\nThe legal basis of the work of the ICRC during World War II were the Geneva Conventions in their 1929 revision. The activities of the Committee were similar to those during World War I: visiting and monitoring POW camps, organizing relief assistance for civilian populations, and administering the exchange of messages regarding prisoners and missing persons. By the end of the war, 179 delegates had conducted 12,750 visits to POW camps in 41 countries. The Central Information Agency on Prisoners-of-War (''Agence centrale des prisonniers de guerre'') had a staff of 3,000, the card index tracking prisoners contained 45 million cards, and 120 million messages were exchanged by the Agency. One major obstacle was that the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-controlled [[German Red Cross]] refused to cooperate with the Geneva statutes including blatant violations such as the deportation of [[Jews]] from Germany and the [[The Holocaust|mass murders]] conducted in the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Moreover, two other main parties to the conflict, the [[Soviet Union]] and Japan, were not party to the 1929 Geneva Conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions.\n\nDuring the war, the ICRC was unable to obtain an agreement with Nazi Germany about the treatment of detainees in concentration camps, and it eventually abandoned applying pressure in order to avoid disrupting its work with POWs. The ICRC was also unable to obtain a response to reliable information about the extermination camps and the mass killing of European Jews, Roma, et al. After November 1943, the ICRC achieved permission to send [[Red Cross parcel|parcels]] to concentration camp detainees with known names and locations. Because the notices of receipt for these parcels were often signed by other inmates, the ICRC managed to register the identities of about 105,000 detainees in the concentration camps and delivered about 1.1 million parcels, primarily to the camps [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Buchenwald]], [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]], and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].\n\n[[File:Children playing at Theresienstadt during the Red Cross visit.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.4|Photo taken by Rossel at Theresienstadt.

The choice of the inexperienced Rossel for this mission has been interpreted as indicative of his organization's indifference to the \"Jewish problem\", while his report has been described as \"emblematic of the failure of the ICRC\" to advocate for Jews during the Holocaust.{{sfn|Farr\u00e9|Schubert|2009|p=abstract}} Rossel's report was noted for its uncritical acceptance of [[Nazi propaganda]].{{efn|{{unordered list |[[Livia Rothkirchen]]: \"In contrast to those of the Danish delegates, Rossel\u2019s  report was phrased in positive  terms,  falling in line with German propaganda.\"{{sfn |Rothkirchen |2006|p=258}}|[[Lucy Dawidowicz]]: \"[Rossel's] acceptance of everything he had seen... and everything he had been told... was total and complacent.

This agreement was bound by the condition that these delegates would have to stay in the camps until the end of the war. Ten delegates, among them [[Louis Haefliger]] ([[Mauthausen-Gusen]]), [[Paul Dunant]] ([[Theresienstadt]]) and [[Victor Maurer]] ([[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]), accepted the assignment and visited the camps. Louis Haefliger prevented the forceful eviction or blasting of Mauthausen-Gusen by alerting American troops.\n\n[[Friedrich Born]] (1903\u20131963), an ICRC delegate in [[Budapest]] who saved the lives of about 11,000 to 15,000 Jewish people in [[Hungary]].

As in World War I, it received the only Peace Prize awarded during the main period of war, 1939 to 1945. At the end of the war, the ICRC worked with national Red Cross societies to organize relief assistance to those countries most severely affected. In 1948, the Committee published a report reviewing its war-era activities from 1 September 1939 to 30 June 1947. The ICRC opened its archives from World War II in 1996.\n\n[[File:PoW 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Budapest 1945. Repatriation of 2000 Italian [[prisoners of war]]]]\n\n====After World War II====\n[[File:IKRK Hauptquartier.jpg|thumb|The ICRC Headquarters in Geneva]]\n\nOn 12 August 1949, further revisions to the existing two Geneva Conventions were adopted. An additional convention \"for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea\", now called the second Geneva Convention, was brought under the Geneva Convention umbrella as a successor to the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1907 Hague Convention X]]. The 1929 Geneva convention \"relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War\" may have been the second Geneva Convention from a historical point of view (because it was actually formulated in Geneva), but after 1949 it came to be called the third Convention because it came later chronologically than the Hague Convention. Reacting to the experience of World War II, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], a new Convention \"relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War\", was established. Also, the additional protocols of 8 June 1977 were intended to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars. Today, the four conventions and their added protocols contain more than 600 articles, a remarkable expansion when compared to the mere 10 articles in the first 1864 convention.\n\nIn celebration of its centennial in 1963, the ICRC, together with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|League of Red Cross Societies]], received its third Nobel Peace Prize. Since 1993, non-Swiss individuals have been allowed to serve as Committee delegates abroad, a task which was previously restricted to Swiss citizens. Indeed, since then, the share of staff without Swiss citizenship has increased to about 35%.\n\nOn 16 October 1990, the [[UN General Assembly]] decided to grant the ICRC [[observer status]] for its assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings, the first observer status given to a private organization. The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the [[Italy|Italian]] ambassador, [[Vieri Traxler]], in memory of the organization's origins in the Battle of Solferino. An agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993, affirmed the already long-standing policy of full independence of the Committee from any possible interference by Switzerland. The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.\n\nAt the end of the [[Cold War]], the ICRC's work actually became more dangerous. In the 1990s, more delegates lost their lives than at any point in its history, especially when working in local and internal armed conflicts. These incidents often demonstrated a lack of respect for the rules of the Geneva Conventions and their protection symbols. Among the slain delegates were:\n\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice. He died on 19 May 1992 at the age of 39, one day after a Red Cross transport he was escorting was attacked in the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] city of [[Sarajevo]].\n* [[Fernanda Calado]] (Spain), [[Ingeborg Foss]] (Norway), [[Nancy Malloy]] (Canada), [[Gunnhild Myklebust]] (Norway), [[Sheryl Thayer]] ([[New Zealand]]), and [[Hans Elkerbout]] (Netherlands). They were murdered at point-blank range while sleeping in the early hours of 17 December 1996 in the ICRC field hospital in the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] city of [[Nowije Atagi]] near [[Grozny]]. Their murderers have never been caught and there was no apparent motive for the killings.\n* [[Rita Fox]] (Switzerland), [[V\u00e9ronique Saro]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], formerly known as Zaire), [[Julio Delgado]] ([[Colombia]]), [[Unen Ufoirworth]] (DR Congo), [[Aduwe Boboli]] (DR Congo), and [[Jean Molokabonge]] (DR Congo). On 26 April 2001, they were en route with two cars on a relief mission in the northeast of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] when they came under fatal fire from unknown attackers.\n* [[Ricardo Mungu\u00eda (aid worker)|Ricardo Munguia]] (El Salvador). He was working as a water engineer in Afghanistan and travelling with local colleagues on 27 March 2003 when their car was stopped by unknown armed men. He was killed execution-style at point-blank range while his colleagues were allowed to escape. He was 39 years old. The killing prompted the ICRC to temporarily suspend operations across Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/news/2003/03/28/swiss-icrc-delegate-murdered |title=Swiss ICRC delegate murdered |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=28 March 2003 |website=www.irinnews.org |publisher=IRIN |access-date=8 March 2016 |quote=Ricardo Munguia, a Swiss citizen of Salvadorian origin was travelling with Afghan colleagues on an assignment to improve the water supply to the district.

Their support extends to the national and international armed forces, civilians and the armed opposition. They regularly visit detainees under the custody of the Afghan government and the international armed forces, but have also occasionally had access since 2009 to people detained by the [[Taliban]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/afghanistan-news-151209.htm |title=Afghanistan: first ICRC visit to detainees in Taliban custody |publisher=Icrc.org |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> They have provided basic first aid training and aid kits to both the Afghan security forces and Taliban members because, according to an ICRC spokesperson, \"ICRC's constitution stipulates that all parties harmed by warfare will be treated as fairly as possible\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/10161136.stm |title=Red Cross in Afghanistan gives Taliban first aid help |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>\n\n===International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)===\n\n====History====\n[[File:Henry Davison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Davison]], Founding father of the League of Red Cross societies.]]\nIn 1919, representatives from the national Red Cross societies of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the US came together in Paris to found the \"League of Red Cross Societies\". The original idea was [[Henry Davison]]'s, then president of the [[American Red Cross]]. This move, led by the American Red Cross, expanded the international activities of the Red Cross movement beyond the strict mission of the ICRC to include relief assistance in response to emergency situations which were not caused by war (such as man-made or natural disasters). The ARC already had great disaster relief mission experience extending back to its foundation.\n\nThe formation of the League, as an additional international Red Cross organization alongside the ICRC, was not without controversy for a number of reasons. The ICRC had, to some extent, valid concerns about a possible rivalry between both organizations. The foundation of the League was seen as an attempt to undermine the leadership position of the ICRC within the movement and to gradually transfer most of its tasks and competencies to a multilateral institution. In addition to that, all founding members of the League were national societies from countries of the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] or from associated partners of the Entente. The original statutes of the League from May 1919 contained further regulations which gave the five founding societies a privileged status and, due to the efforts of Henry P. Davison, the right to permanently exclude the national Red Cross societies from the countries of the [[Central Powers]], namely Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and in addition to that the national Red Cross society of Russia. These rules were contrary to the Red Cross principles of universality and equality among all national societies, a situation which furthered the concerns of the ICRC.\n\nThe first relief assistance mission organized by the League was an aid mission for the victims of a famine and subsequent [[typhus]] epidemic in Poland. Only five years after its foundation, the League had already issued 47 donation appeals for missions in 34 countries, an impressive indication of the need for this type of Red Cross work. The total sum raised by these appeals reached 685 million Swiss francs, which were used to bring emergency supplies to the victims of famines in Russia, Germany, and Albania; earthquakes in Chile, [[Iran|Persia]], Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Turkey; and refugee flows in Greece and Turkey. The first large-scale disaster mission of the League came after the 1923 earthquake in Japan which killed about 200,000 people and left countless more wounded and without shelter. Due to the League's coordination, the Red Cross society of Japan received goods from its sister societies reaching a total worth of about $100 million. Another important new field initiated by the League was the creation of youth Red Cross organizations within the national societies.\n\n[[File:Timbre Turquie Croissant rouge 1928.jpg|thumb|left|A stamp from [[Turkey]] to support the Red Crescent, 1938.]]\n\nA joint mission of the ICRC and the League in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922 marked the first time the movement was involved in an internal conflict, although still without an explicit mandate from the Geneva Conventions. The League, with support from more than 25 national societies, organized assistance missions and the distribution of food and other aid goods for civil populations affected by hunger and [[disease]]. The ICRC worked with the [[Russian Red Cross]] society and later the society of the [[Soviet Union]], constantly emphasizing the ICRC's neutrality. In 1928, the \"International Council\" was founded to coordinate cooperation between the ICRC and the League, a task which was later taken over by the \"Standing Commission\". In the same year, a common statute for the movement was adopted for the first time, defining the respective roles of the ICRC and the League within the movement.\n\nDuring the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinian war]] between Ethiopia and Italy from 1935 to 1936, the League contributed aid supplies worth about 1.7 million Swiss francs. Because the Italian fascist regime under [[Benito Mussolini]] refused any cooperation with the Red Cross, these goods were delivered solely to Ethiopia. During the war, an estimated 29 people lost their lives while being under explicit protection of the Red Cross symbol, most of them due to attacks by the Italian Army. During the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War in Spain]] from 1936 to 1939 the League once again joined forces with the ICRC with the support of 41 national societies. In 1939 on the brink of the Second World War, the League relocated its headquarters from Paris to Geneva to take advantage of Swiss neutrality.\n\n[[File:Friedensnobelpreis-1963.jpg|thumb|Peace Nobel Prize ceremony in 1963; From left to right: [[Harald V of Norway|Crown Prince Harald of Norway]], [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav of Norway]], ICRC president Leopold Boissier, League Chairman John A. MacAulay.]]\n\nIn 1952, the 1928 common statute of the movement was revised for the first time. Also, the period of [[decolonization]] from 1960 to 1970 was marked by a huge jump in the number of recognized national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. By the end of the 1960s, there were more than 100 societies around the world. On December 10, 1963, the Federation and the ICRC received the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1983, the League was renamed to the \"League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\" to reflect the growing number of national societies operating under the Red Crescent symbol. Three years later, the seven basic principles of the movement as adopted in 1965 were incorporated into its statutes. The name of the League was changed again in 1991 to its current official designation the \"International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\". In 1997, the ICRC and the IFRC signed the [[Seville Agreement]] which further defined the responsibilities of both organizations within the movement. In 2004, the IFRC began its largest mission to date after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami disaster in South Asia]]. More than 40 national societies have worked with more than 22,000 volunteers to bring relief to the countless victims left without food and shelter and endangered by the risk of epidemics.\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Organization===\n[[File:Schweiz Genf IRK-Museum.jpg|thumb|Entry to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva.]]\n\nAltogether, there are about 97 million people worldwide who serve with the ICRC, the International Federation, and the National Societies, the majority with the latter.\n\nThe 1965 International Conference in [[Vienna]] adopted seven basic principles which should be shared by all parts of the Movement, and they were added to the official statutes of the Movement in 1986.\n\n===Fundamental principles===\n\nAt the 20th International Conference in Neue Hofburg, [[Vienna]], from 2\u20139 October 1965, \"proclaimed\" seven fundamental principles which are shared by all components of the Movement, and they were added to the official statutes of the Movement in 1986. The durability and universal acceptance is a result of the process through which they came into being in the form they have. Rather than an effort to arrive at agreement, it was an attempt to answer the question of what did they have in common, over the past 100 years, those operations and organisational units that were successful? As a result, the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent were not revealed, but ''found'' \u2013 through a deliberate and participative process of discovery.\n\nThat makes it even more important to note that the text that appears under each \"heading\" is an integral part of the Principle in question and not an interpretation that can vary with time and place.\n\n'''Humanity'''\n\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavours, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples.\n\n'''Impartiality'''\n\nIt makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.\n\n'''Neutrality'''\n\nIn order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.\n\n'''Independence'''\n\nThe Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement.\n\n'''Voluntary Service'''\n\nIt is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain. \n \n'''Unity'''\n\nThere can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory.\n\n'''Universality'''\n\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.\n\n==={{anchor|International Conference|Standing Commission}}Activities and organization of the International Conference and the Standing Commission ===\n{{main|Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent}}\nThe International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which occurs once every four years, is the highest institutional body of the Movement. It gathers delegations from all of the national societies as well as from the ICRC, the IFRC and the signatory states to the Geneva Conventions. In between the conferences, the [[Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent]] acts as the supreme body and supervises implementation of and compliance with the resolutions of the conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standcom.ch/role-mandate-of-the-standing-commission-2/ |title=Role and Mandate of the Standing Commission |publisher=Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent |accessdate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315032535/http://www.standcom.ch/role-mandate-of-the-standing-commission-2/ |archivedate=15 March 2014 |df= }}</ref> In addition, the Standing Commission coordinates the cooperation between the ICRC and the IFRC. It consists of two representatives from the ICRC (including its president), two from the IFRC (including its president), and five individuals who are elected by the International Conference. The Standing Commission convenes every six months on average. Moreover, a convention of the Council of Delegates of the Movement takes place every two years in the course of the conferences of the General Assembly of the International Federation. The Council of Delegates plans and coordinates joint activities for the Movement.\n\n===Activities and organization===\n====The mission of the ICRC and its responsibilities within the Movement====\n[[File:Flag of the ICRC.svg|thumb|The emblem of the International Committee of the Red Cross (French: Comit\u00e9 international de la croix-rouge).]]\n\nThe official mission of the ICRC as an impartial, neutral, and independent organization is to stand for the protection of the life and dignity of victims of international and internal armed conflicts. According to the 1997 Seville Agreement, it is the \"Lead Agency\" of the Movement in conflicts. The core tasks of the Committee, which are derived from the Geneva Conventions and its own statutes, are the following:\n\n* to monitor compliance of warring parties with the Geneva Conventions\n* to organize nursing and care for those who are wounded on the battlefield\n* to supervise the treatment of prisoners of war\n* to help with the search for missing persons in an armed conflict ([[Restoring Family Links|tracing service]])\n* to organize protection and care for civil populations\n* to arbitrate between warring parties in an armed conflict\n\n====Legal status and organization====\nThe ICRC is headquartered in the Swiss city of Geneva and has external offices in about 80 countries. It has about 12,000 staff members worldwide, about 800 of them working in its Geneva headquarters, 1,200 expatriates with about half of them serving as delegates managing its international missions and the other half being specialists like doctors, agronomists, engineers or interpreters, and about 10,000 members of individual national societies working on site.\n\nAccording to Swiss law, the ICRC is defined as a private association. Contrary to popular belief, the ICRC is not a [[non-governmental organization]] in the most common sense of the term, nor is it an international organization. As it limits its members (a process called cooptation) to Swiss nationals only, it does not have a policy of open and unrestricted membership for individuals like other legally defined NGOs. The word \"international\" in its name does not refer to its membership but to the worldwide scope of its activities as defined by the Geneva Conventions. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries or through agreements between the Committee and respective national governments.\n\nAccording to its statutes it consists of 15 to 25 Swiss-citizen members, which it coopts for a period of four years. There is no limit to the number of terms an individual member can have although a three-quarters majority of all members is required for re-election after the third term.\n\nThe leading organs of the ICRC are the Directorate and the Assembly. The Directorate is the executive body of the Committee. It consists of a general director and five directors in the areas of \"Operations\", \"Human Resources\", \"Resources and Operational Support\", \"Communication\", and \"International Law and Cooperation within the Movement\". The members of the Directorate are appointed by the Assembly to serve for four years. The Assembly, consisting of all of the members of the Committee, convenes on a regular basis and is responsible for defining aims, guidelines, and strategies and for supervising the financial matters of the Committee. The president of the Assembly is also the president of the Committee as a whole. Furthermore, the Assembly elects a five-member Assembly Council which has the authority to decide on behalf of the full Assembly in some matters. The Council is also responsible for organizing the Assembly meetings and for facilitating communication between the Assembly and the Directorate.\n\nDue to Geneva's location in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, the ICRC usually acts under its French name ''Comit\u00e9 international de la Croix-Rouge'' (CICR). The official symbol of the ICRC is the Red Cross on white background with the words \"COMITE INTERNATIONAL GENEVE\" circling the cross.\n\n====Funding and financial matters====\nThe 2009 budget of the ICRC amounts to more than 1 billion Swiss francs. Most of that money comes from the States, including Switzerland in its capacity as the depositary state of the Geneva Conventions, from national Red Cross societies, the signatory states of the Geneva Conventions, and from international organizations like the [[European Union]]. All payments to the ICRC are voluntary and are received as donations based on two types of appeals issued by the Committee: an annual ''Headquarters Appeal'' to cover its internal costs and ''Emergency Appeals'' for its individual missions.\n\nThe ICRC is asking donors for more than 1.1 billion Swiss francs to fund its work in 2010. Afghanistan is projected to become the ICRC's biggest humanitarian operation (at 86 million Swiss francs, an 18% increase over the initial 2009 budget), followed by Iraq (85 million francs) and Sudan (76 million francs). The initial 2010 field budget for medical activities of 132 million francs represents an increase of 12 million francs over 2009.\n\n===Activities and organization of the International Federation===\n\n====Mission and responsibilities====\n[[File:Emblem of the IFRC.svg|thumb|Emblem of the IFRC]]\n\nThe IFRC coordinates cooperation between national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies throughout the world and supports the foundation of new national societies in countries where no official society exists. On the international stage, the IFRC organizes and leads relief assistance missions after emergencies such as natural disasters, manmade disasters, epidemics, mass refugee flights, and other emergencies. As per the 1997 Seville Agreement, the IFRC is the Lead Agency of the Movement in any emergency situation which does not take place as part of an armed conflict. The IFRC cooperates with the national societies of those countries affected&nbsp;\u2013 each called the ''Operating National Society'' (ONS)&nbsp;\u2013 as well as the national societies of other countries willing to offer assistance&nbsp;\u2013 called ''Participating National Societies'' (PNS). Among the 187 national societies admitted to the General Assembly of the International Federation as full members or observers, about 25\u201330 regularly work as PNS in other countries. The most active of those are the [[American Red Cross]], the [[British Red Cross]], the [[German Red Cross]], and the Red Cross societies of [[Swedish Red Cross|Sweden]] and [[Norwegian Red Cross|Norway]]. Another major mission of the IFRC which has gained attention in recent years is its commitment to work towards a codified, worldwide ban on the use of [[land mine]]s and to bring medical, psychological, and social support for people injured by land mines.\n\nThe tasks of the IFRC can therefore be summarized as follows:\n* to promote humanitarian principles and values\n* to provide relief assistance in emergency situations of large magnitude, such as natural disasters\n* to support the national societies with disaster preparedness through the education of voluntary members and the provision of equipment and relief supplies\n* to support local health care projects\n* to support the national societies with youth-related activities\n\n====Legal status and organization====\n\nThe IFRC has its headquarters in Geneva. It also runs five zone offices (Africa, Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East-North Africa), 14 permanent regional offices and has about 350 delegates in more than 60 delegations around the world. The legal basis for the work of the IFRC is its constitution. The executive body of the IFRC is a secretariat, led by a secretary general. The secretariat is supported by five divisions including \"Programme Services\", \"Humanitarian values and humanitarian diplomacy\", \"National Society and Knowledge Development\" and \"Governance and Management Services\".\n\nThe highest decision making body of the IFRC is its General Assembly, which convenes every two years with delegates from all of the national societies. Among other tasks, the General Assembly elects the secretary general. Between the convening of General Assemblies, the Governing Board is the leading body of the IFRC. It has the authority to make decisions for the IFRC in a number of areas. The Governing Board consists of the president and the vice presidents of the IFRC, the chairpersons of the Finance and Youth Commissions, and twenty elected representatives from national societies.\n\nThe symbol of the IFRC is the combination of the Red Cross (left) and Red Crescent (right) on a white background surrounded by a red rectangular frame.\n\n====Funding and financial matters====\nThe main parts of the budget of the IFRC are funded by contributions from the national societies which are members of the IFRC and through revenues from its investments. The exact amount of contributions from each member society is established by the Finance Commission and approved by the General Assembly. Any additional funding, especially for unforeseen expenses for relief assistance missions, is raised by ''\"appeals\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/publications-and-reports/appeals/ |title=Appeals |publisher=IFRC |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>  published by the IFRC and comes for voluntary donations by national societies, governments, other organizations, corporations, and individuals.\n\n===Internal national societies===\n====Official recognition====\n[[File:Sjd-ambulance.jpg|thumb|An ambulance owned by the Mexican Red Cross]]\n[[File:Magen David Adom 25th anniversary.jpg|thumb|An Israeli stamp commemorating the 25th. anniversary of [[Magen David Adom]], Date of issue 01.11.1955]]\n\nNational Red Cross and Red Crescent societies exist in nearly every country in the world. Within their home country, they take on the duties and responsibilities of a national relief society as defined by [[International Humanitarian Law]]. Within the Movement, the ICRC is responsible for legally recognizing a relief society as an official national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. The exact rules for recognition are defined in the statutes of the Movement. Article 4 of these statutes contains the ''\"Conditions for recognition of National Societies.\"''\n\n: ''In order to be recognized in terms of Article 5, paragraph 2 b) as a National Society, the Society shall meet the following conditions:''\n#''Be constituted on the territory of an independent State where the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field is in force.''\n#''Be the only National Red Cross and-or Red Crescent Society of the said State and be directed by a central body which shall alone be competent to represent it in its dealings with other components of the Movement.''\n#''Be duly recognized by the legal government of its country on the basis of the Geneva Conventions and of the national legislation as a voluntary aid society, auxiliary to the public authorities in the humanitarian field.''\n#''Have an autonomous status which allows it to operate in conformity with the Fundamental Principles of the Movement.''\n#''Use the name and emblem of the Red Cross or Red Crescent in conformity with the Geneva Conventions.''\n#''Be so organized as to be able to fulfill the tasks defined in its own statutes, including the preparation in peace time for its statutory tasks in case of armed conflict.''\n#''Extend its activities to the entire territory of the State.''\n#''Recruit its voluntary members and its staff without consideration of race, sex, class, religion or political opinions.''\n#''Adhere to the present Statutes, share in the fellowship which unites the components of the Movement and co-operate with them.''\n#''Respect the Fundamental Principles of the Movement and be guided in its work by the principles of international humanitarian law.''\n\nOnce a National Society has been recognized by the ICRC as a component of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (the Movement), it is in principle admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in accordance with the terms defined in the Constitution and Rules of Procedure of the International Federation.\n\nThere are today 190 National Societies recognized within the Movement and which are members of the International Federation.\n\nThe most recent National Societies to have been recognized within the Movement are the [[Maldivian Red Crescent|Maldives Red Crescent Society]] (9 November 2011), the [[Cyprus Red Cross|Cyprus Red Cross Society]], the South Sudan Red Cross Society (12 November 2013) and, the last, the Tuvalu Red Cross Society (on 1 March 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/asia-pacific/tuvalu/tuvalu-red-cross-society-becomes-190th-member-of-the-ifrc--71977 |title=Tuvalu Red Cross Society becomes 190th member of the IFRC |publisher=IFRC |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\n====Activities of national societies on a national and international stage====\nDespite formal independence regarding its organizational structure and work, each national society is still bound by the laws of its home country. In many countries, national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies enjoy exceptional privileges due to agreements with their governments or specific \"Red Cross Laws\" granting full independence as required by the International Movement. The duties and responsibilities of a national society as defined by International Humanitarian Law and the statutes of the Movement include humanitarian aid in armed conflicts and emergency crises such as natural disasters through activities such as [[Restoring Family Links]].\n\nDepending on their respective human, technical, financial, and organizational resources, many national societies take on additional humanitarian tasks within their home countries such as [[blood donation]] services or acting as civilian [[Emergency Medical Service]] (EMS) providers. The ICRC and the International Federation cooperate with the national societies in their international missions, especially with human, material, and financial resources and organizing on-site logistics.\n\n==History of the emblems==\n{{details|Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement}}\n\n===Emblems in use===\n====The Red Cross====\n[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|frameless|upright=0.45|left|border]]\n[[File:Flag of Switzerland (Pantone).svg|upright=0.45|thumb|right|The [[flag of Switzerland]] is where the original Red Cross was derived from.]]\n\nThe '''Red Cross''' emblem was officially approved in Geneva in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/emblem-history.htm |title=The history of the emblems |publisher=ICRC |date=2007-01-14 |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Red Cross flag is not to be confused with the [[Saint George's Cross]] which is on the [[flag of England]], [[Flag of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Flag of Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], and several other places. In order to avoid this confusion the protected symbol is sometimes referred to as the \"Greek Red Cross\" (now [[Hellenic Red Cross]]); that term is also used in [[United States]] law to describe the Red Cross. The red cross of the Saint George cross extends to the edge of the flag, whereas the red cross on the Red Cross flag does not.\n\nThe Red Cross flag is the colour-switched version of the [[Flag of Switzerland]]. In 1906, to put an end to the argument of the Ottoman Empire that the flag took its roots from Christianity, it was decided to promote officially the idea that the Red Cross flag had been formed by reversing the federal colours of [[Switzerland]], although no clear evidence of this origin had ever been found.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pierre Boissier |url=https://openlibrary.org/b/OL1955293M/From-Solferino-to-Tsushima |title=From Solferino to Tsushima (1985 edition) |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\n====The Red Crescent====\n[[File:Flag of the Red Crescent.svg|left|frameless|upright=0.45|border]]\n[[File:Flag of the Ottoman Empire.svg|upright=0.45|thumb|Flag of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The symbol was officially adopted in 1929, and so far 33 states in the Muslim world have recognized it. In common with the official promotion of the red cross symbol as a colour reversal of the Swiss flag (rather than a religious symbol), the red crescent is similarly presented as being derived from a colour reversal of the flag of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nNowadays, the Red Crescent symbol is used within a few Muslim countries including [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Bangladesh]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n====The Red Crystal====\n[[File:Flag of the Red Crystal.svg|frameless|left|upright=0.45|border]]\n[[File:Red Crystal with Star.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.45|International emblem for [[Magen David Adom]] outside [[Israel]]]]\nOn 8 December 2005, in response to growing pressure to accommodate [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA), Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service, as a full member of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, a new emblem (officially the '''Third Protocol Emblem''', but more commonly known as the '''Red Crystal''') was adopted by an amendment of the [[Geneva Conventions]] known as [[Protocol III]].\n\n===Recognized emblems in disuse===\n====The Red Lion and Sun====\n[[File:Red Lion with Sun.svg|frameless|left|upright=0.45|border]]\nThe '''[[Red Lion and Sun Society]] of Iran''' was established in 1922 and admitted to the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement in 1923.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcs.ir/en/index.php?page_id%3D2%26menu_id%3D1%26menu_item_id%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110944/http://www.rcs.ir/en/index.php?page_id=2&menu_id=1&menu_item_id=3 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}</ref> However, some report the symbol was introduced at Geneva in 1864 {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcs.ir/fa/index.php?page_id%3D3%26menu_id%3D1%26menu_item_id%3D33 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404114921/http://www.rcs.ir/fa/index.php?page_id=3&menu_id=1&menu_item_id=33 |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}</ref><!-- Both \"fact\" and reference tags are appropriate; even if the Iranian Red Crescent Society claims the Red Lion and Sun was proposed in 1864 (I can't be sure as I can't read Persian, but the URL is theirs per Whois), it is inconsistent with the first recorded use of the Red Crescent in 1876\u20131878. --> as a counter example to the crescent and cross used by two of Iran's rivals, the Ottoman and the Russian empires.

He was also responsible, along with [[DuBose Heyward]], for the libretto to George's opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.\n\nThe success the Gershwin brothers had with their collaborative works has often overshadowed the creative role that Ira played. His mastery of songwriting continued, however, after the early death of George. He wrote additional hit songs with composers [[Jerome Kern]], [[Kurt Weill]], [[Harry Warren]] and [[Harold Arlen]].\n\nHis critically acclaimed 1959 book ''Lyrics on Several Occasions'', an amalgam of autobiography and annotated anthology, is an important source for studying the art of the lyricist in the golden age of American popular song.<ref name=pbs>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/gershwin_i.html Ira Gershwin biography] pbs.org, March 17, 2009</ref>\n\n== Life and career ==\nGershwin was born in New York City, the oldest of four children of Morris (Moishe) and Rose Gershovitz (n\u00e9e Rosa Bruskin), who were Russian Jews, born in St Petersburg, who had emigrated to the US in 1891. Ira's siblings were George (Jacob, b. 1898), [[Arthur Gershwin|Arthur]] (b. 1900) and [[Frances Gershwin|Frances]] (b. 1906).  Morris changed the family name to \"Gershwine\" (or alternatively \"Gershvin\") well before their children rose to fame; it was not spelled \"Gershwin\" until later. Shy in his youth, Ira spent much of his time at home reading, but from [[grammar school]] through college he played a prominent part in several school newspapers and magazines.\n\nHe graduated in 1914 from [[Townsend Harris High School]] where he met [[Yip Harburg]], with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship and a love of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].

In the plains, its left bank tributary is the [[Panjnad River|Panjnad]] which itself has five major tributaries, namely, the [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], the [[Beas River|Beas]], and the [[Sutlej]]. Its principal right bank tributaries are the [[Shyok River|Shyok]], the [[Gilgit River|Gilgit]], the [[Kabul River|Kabul]], the [[Gomal River|Gomal]], and the [[Kurram River|Kurram]]. Beginning in a mountain spring and fed with [[glaciers]] and rivers in the [[Himalayas]], the river supports [[ecosystems]] of temperate forests, [[plain]]s and arid countryside.\n\nThe northern part of the Indus Valley, with its tributaries, forms the [[Punjab]] region, while the lower course of the Indus is known as [[Sindh]] and ends in a large [[Indus River Delta|delta]]. The river has historically been important to many cultures of the region. The 3rd millennium BC saw the rise of [[Indus Valley Civilisation|a major urban civilization]] of the Bronze Age. During the 2nd millennium BC, the Punjab region was mentioned in the hymns of the [[Hindu]] [[Rigveda]] as ''[[Sapta Sindhu]]'' and the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Avesta]] as ''[[Hapta Hindu]]'' (both terms meaning \"seven rivers\"). Early historical kingdoms that arose in the Indus Valley include [[Gandhara|Gandh\u0101ra]], and the [[Ror dynasty]] of [[Sauvira|Sauv\u012bra]]. The Indus River came into the knowledge of the West early in the Classical Period, when King [[Darius I|Darius]] of [[Persia]] sent his Greek subject [[Scylax of Caryanda]] to explore the river, ca. 515&nbsp;BC.\n\n== Etymology and names ==\nThis river was known to the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|ancient Indians]] in [[Sanskrit]] as ''Sindhu'' and the [[Achaemenids]] as ''Hidu\u0161'' ([[:Wikt:\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1]], ''H-i-du-u-\u0161''), which was regarded by both of them as \"the border river\".<ref>{{citation |last=Witzel |first=Michael |chapter=Early Indian history: Linguistic and textual parameters |editor-last=Erdosy |editor-first=George |title=The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6ZRShEIFwMC |year=1995 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-014447-5 |pp=85-125}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Thieme |first=P. |chapter=Sanskrit ''sindu-/Sindhu-'' and Old Iranian ''hindu-/Hindu-'' |editor1=Mary Boyce |editor2=Ilya Gershevitch |title=W.

The Indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of [[potable water]] in Pakistan.\n\nThe ultimate source of the Indus is in [[Tibet]]; the river begins at the confluence of the [[Sengge Zangbo]] and [[Gar Tsangpo]] rivers that drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailas) mountain ranges. The Indus then flows northwest through [[Ladakh]] and [[Baltistan]] into [[Gilgit]], just south of the [[Karakoram]] range. The [[Shyok River|Shyok]], [[Shigar]] and [[Gilgit River|Gilgit]] rivers carry glacial waters into the main river. It gradually bends to the south, coming out of the hills between [[Peshawar]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. The Indus passes gigantic gorges {{convert|4500|-|5200|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} deep near the [[Nanga Parbat]] [[massif]]. It flows swiftly across [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] and is dammed at the [[Tarbela Dam|Tarbela Reservoir]]. The [[Kabul River]] joins it near [[Attock]]. The remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Indus |volume=14 |pages=507\u2013508 |first=Thomas Hungerford |last=Holdich}}</ref> and Sindh, where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided. It is joined by the [[Panjnad River|Panjnad]] at [[Mithankot]]. Beyond this confluence, the river, at one time, was named the ''Satnad River'' (''sat'' = \"seven\", ''nad\u012b'' = \"river\"), as the river now carried the waters of the [[Kabul River]], the Indus River and the five Punjab rivers. Passing by [[Jamshoro]], it ends in a large delta to the east of [[Thatta]].\n\nThe Indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a [[tidal bore]]. The Indus system is largely fed by the snows and glaciers of the [[Himalayas]], Karakoram and the [[Hindu Kush]] ranges of Tibet, the Indian states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] region of Pakistan. The flow of the river is also determined by the seasons \u2013 it diminishes greatly in the winter, while flooding its banks in the [[monsoon]] months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times \u2013 it deviated westwards from flowing into the [[Rann of Kutch]] and adjoining [[Banni grasslands]] after the 1816 [[earthquake]].<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/70-of-cattle-breeders-desert-Banni/articleshow/904446.cms 70% of cattle-breeders desert Banni]; by Narandas Thacker, TNN, 14 February 2002; ''The Times of India''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2006/564/564_c_bharwada_&_v_mahajan.htm|title=564 Charul Bharwada & Vinay Mahajan, Lost and forgotten: grasslands and pastoralists of Gujarat|publisher=}}</ref> Presently, Indus water flows in to the [[Rann of Kutch]] during its floods breaching [[flood bank]]s.<ref name=kan>{{cite web|url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indus-river-re-enters-india/1/158976.html|title=Indus re-enters India after two centuries, feeds Little Rann, Nal Sarovar|accessdate=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional source of the river is the ''Senge Khabab'' or \"Lion's Mouth\", a perennial spring, not far from the sacred [[Mount Kailash]] marked by a long low line of Tibetan [[chortens]].

As a result, damming and irrigation has made fish farming an important economic activity. Located southeast of Karachi, the large delta has been recognized by conservationists as one of the world's most important ecological regions. Here, the river turns into many marshes, streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels. Here, marine fishes are found in abundance, including [[pomfret]] and [[prawns]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe Indus is the most important supplier of water resources to the [[Punjab]] and Sindh plains \u2013 it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in Pakistan. The river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower Indus valley. Irrigation canals were first built by the people of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], and later by the engineers of the [[Kushan Empire]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. Modern irrigation was introduced by the [[British East India Company]] in 1850 \u2013 the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals. The British supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world. The [[Guddu Barrage]] is {{convert|1350|m|abbr=on}} long \u2013 irrigating [[Sukkur]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]] and [[Kalat District|Kalat]].

It supports the [[Chashma Barrage]] near Dera Ismail Khan for irrigation use and flood control and the [[Taunsa Barrage]] near [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] which also produces 100,000&nbsp;kilowatts of electricity. The [[Kotri Barrage]] near [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] is {{convert|915|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long and provides additional water supplies for Karachi. The extensive linking of tributaries with the Indus has helped spread water resources to the valley of [[Peshawar]], in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].

The eastern banks are largely populated by people of [[Indo-Aryan people|Indo-Aryan]] stock, such as the [[Punjabis]] and the [[Sindhis]]. In northern Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ethnic Pashtun tribes live alongside [[Dard people|Dardic]] people in the hills ([[Khowar people|Khowar]], [[Kalash people|Kalash]], [[Shina people|Shina]], etc.), Burushos (in [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]]), and [[Punjabi people]].\n\nThe people living along the Indus river speak Punjabi and Sindhi on the eastern side (in Punjab and Sindh provinces respectively), Pushto plus Balochi as well as Barohi (in Khyber Pakhtoonkha and Baluchistan provinces). In the province of Sindh, the upper third of the river is inhabited by people speaking Saraiki; which is a somewhat transitional dialect of the Punjabi and Sindhi languages.\n\n==Modern issues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:Pakistan Indus flooding July 2010 - MODIS.png|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Satellite images of the upper Indus River valley, comparing water-levels on 1 August 2009 (top) and 31 July 2010 (bottom)]]\nThe Indus is a strategically vital resource for Pakistan's economy and society.

The concern over India building large dams over various [[Punjab region|Punjab]] rivers that could undercut the supply flowing to Pakistan, as well as the possibility that India could divert rivers in the time of war, caused political consternation in Pakistan. Holding diplomatic talks brokered by the [[World Bank]], India and Pakistan signed the [[Indus Waters Treaty]] in 1960. The treaty gave India control of the three easternmost rivers of the Punjab, the [[Sutlej]], the [[Beas River|Beas]] and the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], while Pakistan gained control of the three western rivers, the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], the [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and the Indus.

There are also concerns that the Indus River may be shifting its course westwards \u2013 although the progression spans centuries.

If these integers are further restricted to [[prime number]]s, the process is called '''prime factorization'''.\n\nWhen the numbers are sufficiently large, no efficient, [[quantum computer|non-quantum]] integer [[factorization]] [[algorithm]] is known. An effort by several researchers, concluded in 2009, to factor a 232-digit number ([[RSA-768]]) utilizing hundreds of machines took two years and the researchers estimated that a 1024-bit RSA modulus would take about a thousand times as long.<ref name=rsa768>{{cite journal\n| url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/006.pdf\n| title = Factorization of a 768-bit RSA modulus\n| author = Kleinjung| publisher = [[International Association for Cryptologic Research]]\n| date = 2010-02-18\n| accessdate = 2010-08-09\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> However, it has not been proven that no efficient algorithm exists. The presumed difficulty of this problem is at the heart of widely used algorithms in [[cryptography]] such as [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]. Many areas of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] have been brought to bear on the problem, including [[elliptic curve]]s, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\nNot all numbers of a given length are equally hard to factor. The hardest instances of these problems (for currently known techniques) are [[semiprime]]s, the product of two prime numbers. When they are both large, for instance more than two thousand [[bit]]s long, randomly chosen, and about the same size (but not too close, e.g., to avoid efficient factorization by [[Fermat's factorization method]]), even the fastest prime factorization algorithms on the fastest computers can take enough time to make the search impractical; that is, as the number of digits of the primes being factored increases, the number of operations required to perform the factorization on any computer increases drastically.\n\nMany cryptographic protocols are based on the difficulty of factoring large composite integers or a related problem\u2014for example, the [[RSA problem]]. An algorithm that efficiently factors an arbitrary integer would render [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-based [[public-key]] cryptography insecure.\n\n==Prime decomposition==\n[[Image:PrimeDecompositionExample.svg|right|thumb|190px|This image demonstrates the prime decomposition of 864. A shorthand way of writing the resulting prime factors is 2<sup>5</sup> \u00d7 3<sup>3</sup>]]\nBy the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], every positive integer has a unique [[Prime factor|prime factorization]]. (By convention, 1 is the [[empty product]].) If the integer is prime then it can be recognized as such in [[Primality test|polynomial time]], for example, by the [[AKS primality test]]. If composite however, the theorem gives no insight into how to obtain the factors.\n\nGiven a general algorithm for integer factorization, any integer can be factored into its constituent [[prime factor]]s by repeated application of this algorithm. The situation is more complicated with special-purpose factorization algorithms, whose benefits may not be realized as well or even at all with the factors produced during decomposition. For example, if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 171 \u00d7 ''p'' \u00d7 ''q''}} where {{nowrap|''p'' < ''q''}} are very large primes, [[trial division]] will quickly produce the factors 3 and 19 but will take ''p'' divisions to find the next factor. As a contrasting example, if ''N'' is the product of the primes 13729, 1372933, and 18848997161, where {{nowrap|1=13729 \u00d7 1372933 = 18848997157}}, Fermat's factorization method will begin with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = \u2308{{sqrt|''N''}}\u2309 = 18848997159}} which immediately yields {{nowrap|1=''b'' = {{sqrt|''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''N''}} = {{sqrt|4}} = 2}} and hence the factors {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2212 ''b'' = 18848997157}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = 18848997161}}. While these are easily recognized as composite and prime respectively, Fermat's method will take much longer to factor the composite number because the starting value of {{nowrap|1=\u2308{{sqrt|18848997157}}\u2309 = 137292}} for ''a'' is nowhere near 1372933.\n\n==Current state of the art==\n{{See also|integer factorization records}}\nAmong the ''b''-bit numbers, the most difficult to factor in practice using existing algorithms are those that are products of two primes of similar size. For this reason, these are the integers used in cryptographic applications. The largest such semiprime yet factored was [[RSA numbers#RSA-768|RSA-768]], a 768-bit number with 232 decimal digits, on December 12, 2009.<ref name=rsa768 /> This factorization was a collaboration of several research institutions, spanning two years and taking the equivalent of almost 2000 years of computing on a single-core 2.2&nbsp;GHz [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Opteron]]. Like all recent factorization records, this factorization was completed with a highly optimized implementation of the [[general number field sieve]] run on hundreds of machines.\n\n===Difficulty and complexity===\nNo [[algorithm]] has been published that can factor all integers in [[polynomial time]], i.e., that can factor ''b''-bit numbers in time [[Big O notation|O]](''b''<sup>''k''</sup>) for some constant ''k''.  {{citation needed span|text=Neither the existence nor non-existence of such algorithms has been proved, but it is generally suspected that they do not exist and hence that the problem is not in class P.|date=August 2017}}   The problem is clearly in class NP but has not been proved to be or not be [[NP-complete]]. {{citation needed span|text=It is generally suspected not to be NP-complete.|date=April 2018}}\n\nThere are published algorithms that are faster than O((1+''\u03b5'')<sup>''b''</sup>) for all positive ''\u03b5'', i.e., [[Time_complexity#Sub-exponential_time|sub-exponential]].  The best published asymptotic running time is for the general number field sieve (GNFS) algorithm, which, for a ''b''-bit number ''n'', is:\n\n:<math>O\\left(\\exp\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{64}{9} b (\\log b)^2}\\right).</math>\n\nFor current computers, GNFS is the best published algorithm for large ''n'' (more than about 400 bits). For a quantum computer, however, [[Peter Shor]] discovered an algorithm in 1994 that solves it in polynomial time. This will have significant implications for cryptography if quantum computation becomes scalable. [[Shor's algorithm]] takes only {{math|O(''b''<sup>3</sup>)}} time and O(''b'') space on ''b''-bit number inputs. In 2001, the first seven-qubit quantum computer became the first to run Shor's algorithm. It factored the number 15.<ref>{{cite journal\n| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/links/011220/011220-2.html\n| title = NMR quantum computing: Realizing Shor's algorithm\n| publisher = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n| date = 2007-12-27\n| accessdate = 2010-08-09\n| last = Lieven M. K. |first=Vandersypen|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nWhen discussing what [[complexity class]]es the integer factorization problem falls into, it is necessary to distinguish two slightly different versions of the problem:\n\n* The [[function problem]] version: given an integer ''N'', find an integer ''d'' with {{nowrap|1 < ''d'' < ''N''}} that divides ''N'' (or conclude that ''N'' is prime). This problem is trivially in [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] and it's not known whether it lies in [[FP (complexity)|FP]] or not. This is the version solved by practical implementations.\n* The [[decision problem]] version: given an integer ''N'' and an integer ''M'' with {{nowrap|1 < ''M'' < ''N''}}, does ''N'' have a factor ''d'' with {{nowrap|1 < ''d'' \u2264 ''M''}}? This version is useful because most well studied complexity classes are defined as classes of decision problems, not function problems. \n\nFor {{nowrap|{{sqrt|''N''}} \u2264 ''M'' < ''N''}}, the decision problem is equivalent to asking if ''N'' is not prime. \n\nAn algorithm for either version provides one for the other. Repeated application of the function problem (applied to ''d'' and ''N''/''d'', and their factors, if needed) will eventually provide either a factor of ''N'' no larger than ''M'' or a factorization into primes all greater than ''M''. All known algorithms for the decision problem work in this way. Hence it is only of theoretical interest that, with at most log&nbsp;''N'' queries using an algorithm for the decision problem, one would isolate a factor of ''N'' (or prove it prime) by [[binary search]]. \n\nIt is not known exactly which [[computational complexity theory|complexity classes]] contain the decision version of the integer factorization problem. It is known to be in both [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and [[co-NP]]. This is because both YES and NO answers can be verified in polynomial time. An answer of YES can be certified by exhibiting a factorization {{nowrap|1=''N'' = ''d''(''N''/''d'')}} with {{nowrap|''d'' \u2264 ''M''}}. An answer of NO can be certified by exhibiting the factorization of ''N'' into distinct primes, all larger than ''M''. We can verify their primality using the [[AKS primality test]] and that their product is ''N'' by multiplication. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] guarantees that there is only one possible string that will be accepted (providing the factors are required to be listed in order), which shows that the problem is in both '''[[UP (complexity)|UP]]''' and '''co-UP'''.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Lance Fortnow\n| title = Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring\n| date = 2002-09-13\n| url = http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html\n}}</ref> It is known to be in [[BQP]] because of Shor's algorithm. It is suspected to be outside of all three of the complexity classes P, NP-complete, and [[co-NP-complete]]. It is therefore a candidate for the [[NP-intermediate]] complexity class. If it could be proved that it is in either NP-Complete or co-NP-Complete, that would imply NP = co-NP. That would be a very surprising result, and therefore integer factorization is widely suspected to be outside both of those classes. Many people have tried to find classical polynomial-time algorithms for it and failed, and therefore it is widely suspected to be outside P.\n\nIn contrast, the decision problem \"is ''N'' a composite number?\" (or equivalently: \"is ''N'' a prime number?\") appears to be much easier than the problem of actually finding the factors of ''N''. Specifically, the former can be solved in polynomial time (in the number ''n'' of digits of ''N'') with the [[AKS primality test]]. In addition, there are a number of [[randomized algorithm|probabilistic algorithm]]s that can test primality very quickly in practice if one is willing to accept the vanishingly small possibility of error. The ease of [[primality test]]ing is a crucial part of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm, as it is necessary to find large prime numbers to start with.\n\n==Factoring algorithms<!-- This section is linked from [[Factorization]] -->==\n\n===Special-purpose===\nA special-purpose factoring algorithm's running time depends on the properties of the number to be factored or on one of its unknown factors: size, special form, etc. Exactly what the running time depends on varies between algorithms.\n\nAn important subclass of special-purpose factoring algorithms is the ''Category 1'' or ''First Category'' algorithms, whose running time depends on the size of smallest prime factor. Given an integer of unknown form, these methods are usually applied before general-purpose methods to remove small factors.<ref name=\"Bressoud and Wagon\">{{cite book\n|author = [[David Bressoud]] and [[Stan Wagon]]\n| year = 2000\n| title = A Course in Computational Number Theory\n| publisher = Key College Publishing/Springer\n| isbn = 978-1-930190-10-8\n| pages = 168\u201369}}</ref> For example, [[trial division]] is a Category 1 algorithm.\n\n* [[Trial division]]\n* [[Wheel factorization]]\n* [[Pollard's rho algorithm]]\n* [[Algebraic-group factorisation algorithms]], among which are [[Pollard's p \u2212 1 algorithm|Pollard's ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 algorithm]], [[Williams' p + 1 algorithm|Williams' ''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 algorithm]], and [[Lenstra elliptic curve factorization]]\n* [[Fermat's factorization method]]\n* [[Euler's factorization method]]\n* [[Special number field sieve]]\n\n===General-purpose===\nA general-purpose factoring algorithm, also known as a ''Category 2'', ''Second Category'', or ''Kraitchik family'' algorithm (after [[Maurice Kraitchik]]),<ref name=\"Bressoud and Wagon\"/> has a running time which depends solely on the size of the integer to be factored.

In this factoring algorithm the discriminant \u0394 is chosen as a multiple of ''n'', {{nowrap|1=\u0394 = \u2212''dn''}}, where ''d'' is some positive multiplier. The algorithm expects that for one ''d'' there exist enough [[smooth number|smooth]] forms in ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>. Lenstra and Pomerance show that the choice of ''d'' can be restricted to a small set to guarantee the smoothness result.\n\nDenote by ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub> the set of all primes ''q'' with [[Kronecker symbol]] <math>\\left(\\tfrac{\\Delta}{q}\\right)=1</math>. By constructing a set of [[Generating set of a group|generators]] of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> and prime forms ''f''<sub>q</sub> of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> with ''q'' in ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub> a sequence of relations between the set of generators and ''f''<sub>q</sub> are produced.\nThe size of ''q'' can be bounded by <math>c_0(\\log|\\Delta|)^2</math> for some constant <math>c_0</math>.\n\nThe relation that will be used is a relation between the product of powers that is equal to the [[group (mathematics)|neutral element]] of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>. These relations will be used to construct a so-called ambiguous form of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>, which is an element of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> of order dividing 2. By calculating the corresponding factorization of \u0394 and by taking a [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]], this ambiguous form provides the complete prime factorization of ''n''. This algorithm has these main steps:\n\nLet ''n'' be the number to be factored.\n# Let \u0394 be a negative integer with {{nowrap|1=\u0394 = \u2212''dn''}}, where ''d'' is a multiplier and \u0394 is the negative discriminant of some quadratic form.\n# Take the ''t'' first primes <math>p_1=2,p_2=3,p_3=5, \\dots ,p_t</math>, for some <math>t\\in{\\mathbb N}</math>.\n# Let <math>f_q</math> be a random prime form of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> with <math>\\left(\\tfrac{\\Delta}{q}\\right)=1</math>.\n# Find a generating set ''X'' of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>\n# Collect a sequence of relations between set ''X'' and {{nowrap|{''f<sub>q</sub> : q'' \u2208 ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub>}}} satisfying: <math>\\left(\\prod_{x \\in X_{}} x^{r(x)}\\right).\\left(\\prod_{q \\in P_\\Delta} f^{t(q)}_{q}\\right) = 1</math>\n# Construct an ambiguous form {{tmath|(a, b, c)}} that is an element ''f'' \u2208 ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> of order dividing 2 to obtain a coprime factorization of the largest odd divisor of \u0394 in which <math>\\Delta = -4ac \\text{ or } a(a - 4c) \\text{ or } (b - 2a)(b + 2a)</math>\n# If the ambiguous form provides a factorization of ''n'' then stop, otherwise find another ambiguous form until the factorization of ''n'' is found. In order to prevent useless ambiguous forms from generating, build up the [[Sylow theorems|2-Sylow]] group Sll<sub>2</sub>(\u0394) of ''G''(\u0394).\n\nTo obtain an algorithm for factoring any positive integer, it is necessary to add a few steps to this algorithm such as trial division, and the [[Adleman\u2013Pomerance\u2013Rumely primality test|Jacobi sum test]].\n\n===Expected running time===\nThe algorithm as stated is a [[probabilistic algorithm]] as it makes random choices.

For the yard, the length of a [[pendulum]] beating [[second]]s at the latitude of Greenwich at [[Mean Sea Level]] ''in vacuo'' was defined as {{val|39.01393}} inches. For the pound, the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water at an [[atmospheric pressure]] of 30 [[inches of mercury]] and a temperature of 62\u00b0 [[Fahrenheit]] was defined as 252.458 grains, with there being 7,000 grains per pound.<ref name=\"google339\" />  However, following the destruction of the original prototypes in the [[Burning of Parliament|1834 Houses of Parliament fire]], it proved impossible to recreate the standards from these definitions, and a new [[Weights and Measures Acts of 1878 to 1893|Weights and Measures Act]] (18 & 19 Victoria. Cap. 72) was passed in 1855 which permitted the recreation of the prototypes from recognized [[Standard (metrology)|secondary standards]].<ref name=\"Britain1855\" />\n\n== Relation to other systems ==\n[[File:English length units graph.png|thumb|English units of length]]\n\nThe imperial system is one of many systems of [[English units]]. Although most of the units are defined in more than one system, some subsidiary units were used to a much greater extent, or for different purposes, in one area rather than the other. The distinctions between these systems are often not drawn precisely.\n\nOne such distinction is that between these systems and older British/English units/systems or newer additions. The term ''imperial'' should not be applied to English units that were outlawed in the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]] or earlier, or which had fallen out of use by that time, nor to post-imperial inventions, such as the [[slug (unit)|slug]] or [[poundal]].\n\nThe [[United States customary units|US customary system]] is historically derived from the English units that were in use at the time of settlement. Because the United States was already independent at the time, these units were unaffected by the introduction of the imperial system.\n\n== Current use ==\n[[Image:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|thumb|175px|A baby bottle that measures in three measurement systems\u2014metric, imperial (UK), and US customary.]]\n<!-- United States customary units are covered above. -->\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{see also|Metrication in the United Kingdom}}\nBritish law now defines each imperial unit in terms of the metric equivalent.

Metric price signs may be accompanied by imperial price signs provided that the imperial signs are no larger and no more prominent than the metric ones.\n\nThe United Kingdom completed its official partial transition to the metric system in 1995, with some imperial units still legally mandated for certain applications such as draught beer and cider,<ref name=WMbeer>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&itemId=1073792198 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720114311/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&itemId=1073792198 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |title=BusinessLink: Weights and measures: Rules for pubs, restaurants and cafes|accessdate=24 August 2009|format=online |publisher= Department for Business, Innovation & Skills }}</ref> road-signs,<ref name=WMroads>{{cite web |url=http://www.bwmaonline.com/Transport%20-%20DfT%20memo.htm |title=Department for Transport statement on metric road signs |accessdate=24 August 2009|date=12 July 2002 |format=online |publisher=BWMA }}</ref> and therefore the speedometers on vehicles sold in the UK must be capable of displaying miles per hour. Even though the [[troy weight|troy pound]] was outlawed in the UK in the Weights and Measures Act of 1878, the ''troy ounce'' ''may'' still be used for the weights of precious stones and metals. The original railways (many built in the Victorian era) are a big user of imperial units, with distances officially measured in miles and yards or miles and [[chain (length)|chains]], and also feet and inches, and speeds are in miles per hour, although more recent systems are metric, and [[London Underground]] uses metric.<ref name=\"TfL\">{{cite web|title=Facts & Figures|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/london-underground/facts-and-figures|website=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nMost British people still use imperial units in everyday life for distance (miles, yards, feet and inches) and volume in some cases (especially milk and beer in pints) but rarely for canned or bottled soft drinks or petrol.<ref name=\"BBCNews December 2011\"/><ref>{{cite news|work=The Guardian |date=1 December 2006|title=In praise of ... metric measurements|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/01/comment.britishidentity | location=London | accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> Though use of kilograms is increasing, most British people also still use imperial units in everyday life for body weight (stones and pounds for adults, pounds and ounces for babies).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Some government documents aimed at the public give body weight and height not only in metric units (kilograms centimetres) but also in imperial units (stones and pounds, feet and inches).<ref>{{cite web|title=BMI healthy weight calculator |url= http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Documents/BMI%20Healthy%20weight%20calculator.htm |publisher=[[National Health Service]] |accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> A survey in 2015 found that many people did not know their body weight or height in one system or the other.<ref>{{Cite web |access-date=29 October 2017|date = 20 June 2015 |first1=Will |last1=Dahlgreen|url= https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/20/britains-metric-muddle/ |title=Britain\u2019s metric muddle not changing any time soon|quote=even today [2015] most 18-24 year-olds still do not know how much they weigh in kilograms (60%) or how tall they are in metres and centimetres (54%). }}</ref><!--Unfortunately, they don't say how many people didn't know their weight /height in either system, and the alternative weight units were pounds, not the stones and pounds normally used in the UK; so a better source would be good)--> People under the age of 40 preferred the metric system but people aged 40 and over preferred the imperial system. <ref>{{Cite web |access-date=29 October 2017|date = 2015 |url= https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/vsi5u7fi74/InternalResults_150609_systems_of_measurement_Website.pdf|title=YouGov Survey Results }}</ref> The height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including [[Australia]],<sup>[[Hand (unit)|[1]]]</sup> [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] is usually measured in hands, standardized to 4 inches (101.6&nbsp;mm). Fuel consumption for vehicles is commonly stated in miles per gallon, though official figures always include litres per 100&nbsp;km equivalents. When sold [[draught beer|draught]] in licensed premises, beer and cider must be sold in pints and half-pints. Cow's milk is available in both litre- and pint-based containers in supermarkets and shops. Areas of land associated with farming, forestry and real estate are commonly advertised in acres and square feet, but for official government purposes the units are always hectares and square metres.\n\nOffice space and industrial units are usually advertised in square feet. Steel pipe sizes are sold in increments of inches, while copper pipe is sold in increments of millimetres. Road bicycles have their frames measured in centimetres, while off-road bicycles have their frames measured in inches. The size (diagonal) of television and computer monitor screens is always denominated in inches. Food sold by length or width e.g. pizzas or sandwiches, is generally sold in inches. Clothing is always sized in inches, with the metric equivalent often shown as a small supplementary indicator. Gas is usually measured by the cubic foot or cubic metre, but is billed like electricity by the [[kilowatt hour]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gas-meter-readings-and-bill-calculation Government website]</ref>\n\nSome pre-packaged products show both metric and imperial measures and it is also common to see imperial pack sizes with metric only labels e.g. a 1&nbsp;lb (i.e., 454 g) tin of Lyle's Golden Syrup is always labelled 454&nbsp;g with no imperial indicator. Similarly most jars of jam and packs of sausages are labelled 454&nbsp;g with no imperial indicator.\n\n===India===\n[[India]]'s conversion to the metric system from the imperial system occurred in stages between 1955 and 1962. The metric system in weights and measures was adopted by the [[Indian Parliament]] in December 1956 with the ''Standards of Weights and Measures Act'', which took effect beginning 1 October 1958. The ''Indian Coinage Act'' was passed in 1955 by the Government of India to introduce decimal coinage in the country. The new system of coins became legal tender on April 1957, where the [[rupee]] consists of 100 paise. For the next five years, both the previous and new systems were legal. In April 1962, all other systems were banned. This process of metrication is called \"big-bang\" route, which is to simultaneously outlaw the use of pre-metric measurement, metricise, reissue all government publications and laws, and change education systems to metric.<ref name=\"lamar.colostate.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/internat.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221223050/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/internat.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 February 1999 |title=internat.htm |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nToday all official measurements are made in the metric system. However, in common usage some older Indians may still refer to imperial units. Some measurements, such as the heights of mountains, are still recorded in feet. Additionally, the [[Indian numbering system]] of crores and lacs is used alongside otherwise metricated currency units, while tyre rim diameters are still measured in inches, as used worldwide.  Road widths are popularly measured in feet but official documents use metres. Body temperature is still sometimes measured in degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. Industries like the construction and the real estate industry still use both the metric and the imperial system though it is more common for sizes of homes to be given in square feet and land in acres. Bulk cotton is sold by the ''candy'' (0.35 imperial tons, or 355.62&nbsp;kg) or the ''bale'' (170&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\"lamar.colostate.edu\"/><ref name=\"Acharya, Anil Kumar 1958\">Acharya, Anil Kumar. ''History of Decimalisation Movement in India'', Auto-Print & Publicity House, 1958.</ref>\n\nIn [[Indian English|Standard Indian English]], as in [[Australian English|Australian]], [[Singaporean English|Singaporean]], and [[British English]], metric units such as the litre (liter), metre (meter), and metric tonne (ton) utilise the traditional spellings brought over from [[French language|French]], which differ from those used in the [[American English|United States]] and the [[Philippine English|Philippines]]. The imperial long ton is invariably spelt with one 'n'. (See [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations]] for more information).<ref name=\"Acharya, Anil Kumar 1958\"/>\n\n===Hong Kong===\n\n[[Hong Kong]] has three main systems of [[units of measurement]] in current use:\n\n* The [[Chinese units of measurement]] of the [[Qing Empire]] (no longer in widespread use in China);\n* British imperial units; and\n* The [[metric system]].\n\nIn 1976 the [[Hong Kong Government]] started the conversion to the metric system, and as of 2012 measurements for government purposes, such as road signs, are almost always in metric units. However, all three systems are officially permitted for trade,<ref name=\"Ordinance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/68/sch2.html|title=CAP 68 WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ORDINANCE Sched 2 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT AND PERMITTED SYMBOLS  OR ABBREVIATIONS OF UNITS OF MEASUREMENT  LAWFUL FOR USE FOR TRADE|publisher=}}</ref> and in the wider society a mixture of all three systems prevails.\n\nThe Chinese system's most commonly used units for length are {{lang|zh|\u91cc}} (li), {{lang|zh|\u4e08}} (tseung/cheung), {{lang|zh|\u5c3a}} (tsek/[[Shaku (unit)|chek]]), {{lang|zh|\u5bf8}} ([[tsun]]/chun), {{lang|zh|\u5206}} ([[fen]]/fan) in descending scale order. These units are now rarely used in daily life, the imperial and metric systems being preferred. The imperial equivalents are written with the same basic Chinese characters as the Chinese system. In order to distinguish between the units of the two systems, the units can be prefixed with \"Ying\" ({{zh|t=\u82f1|y=Y\u012bng}}) for the Imperial system and \"Wa\" ({{zh|t=\u83ef|y=W\u00e0h}}) for the Chinese system. In writing, derived characters are often used, with an additional {{lang|zh|\u53e3}} (mouth) [[Kangxi radicals|radical]] to the left of the original Chinese character, for writing imperial units. The most commonly used units are the [[mile]] or \"li\" ({{zh|t=\u54e9|y=l\u00e9ih}}), the [[yard]] or \"ma\" ({{zh|t=\u78bc|y=m\u00e1h}}), the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or \"chek\" ({{zh|t=\u544e|y=chek}}), and the [[inch]] or \"tsun\" ({{zh|t=\u540b|y=chyun}}).\n\nThe traditional measure of flat area is the square foot ({{zh|t=\u65b9\u544e, \u5e73\u65b9\u544e|y=f\u014dng chek, p\u00echng f\u014dng chek}}) of the imperial system, which is still in common use for real estate purposes. The measurement of agricultural plots and fields, however, is traditionally conducted in {{lang|zh|\u755d}} (mau) of the Chinese system.\n\nFor the measurement of volume, Hong Kong officially uses the metric system, though the gallon ({{lang|zh|\u52a0\u4f96}}, ka-lun) is also occasionally used.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{See also|Metrication in Canada}}\n[[Image:GasCan.jpg|thumb|200px|A one US gallon gas can purchased near the US-Canada border. It shows equivalences in imperial gallons and litres.]]\nDuring the 1970s, the metric system and SI units were introduced in Canada to replace the imperial system. Within the government, efforts to implement the metric system were extensive; almost any agency, institution, or function provided by the government uses SI units exclusively. Imperial units were eliminated from all road signs, although both systems of measurement will still be found on privately owned signs, such as the height warnings at the entrance of a [[Multi-storey car park|parkade]]. In the 1980s, momentum to fully convert to the metric system stalled when the government of [[Brian Mulroney]] was elected. There was heavy opposition to metrication and as a compromise the government maintains legal definitions for and allows use of imperial units as long as metric units are shown as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc:2//en#anchorsc:2 |title=Weights and Measures Act: Canadian units of measure |publisher=Justice Canada |accessdate=14 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605042528/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc%3A2//en |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch11e.shtml#11.2 \n |title=Guide to Food Labelling and Advertising \n |chapter=11 \n |publisher=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] \n |accessdate=1 December 2007 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124081159/http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch11e.shtml \n |archivedate=24 January 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._417/ |title=Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations (C.R.C., c. 417) |accessdate=15 November 2012 |publisher=Justice Canada, Legislative Services Branch}}</ref>\nThe law requires that measured products (such as fuel and meat) be priced in metric units, although an imperial price can be shown if a metric price is present.<ref name=\"Canadian compromise\">\n{{cite web |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=1&IDClip=10620&IDCat=345&IDCatPa=261 |title=A Canadian compromise |accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=CBC |quote=\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Livre\">\n{{cite web |url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=0&IDClip=9378&IDCat=216&IDCatPa=151 |title=Les livres et les pieds, toujours pr\u00e9sents (eng:The pounds and feet, always present) |accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=5 sur 5, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 [[Radio-Canada]] |quote= |language=French\n}}</ref> However, there tends to be leniency in regards to fruits and vegetables being priced in imperial units only.\n[[Environment Canada]] still offers an imperial unit option beside metric units, even though weather is typically measured and reported in metric units in the Canadian media. However, some radio stations near the United States border (such as [[CIMX]] and [[CIDR-FM|CIDR]]) primarily use imperial units to report the weather. Railways in Canada also continue to use Imperial units.\n\nImperial units are still used in ordinary conversation. Today, Canadians typically use a mix of metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. However, the use of the metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per [[hundredweight]] (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwmaonline.com/Imperial%20Origins.htm|title=BRITISHWEIGHTS AND MEASURES ASSOCIATION|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Crepes+worth+savouring/4329610/story.html]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Scoring+brownie+points/4207369/story.html]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Drinking+School/4367113/story.html]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homehardware.ca/en/cat/index.htm/Building-Supplies/Building-Materials/Fence-Products/_/N-nthr4|title=Home Hardware  - Building Supplies - Building Materials - Fence Products|publisher=|access-date=5 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629070126/http://www.homehardware.ca/en/cat/index.htm/Building-Supplies/Building-Materials/Fence-Products/_/N-nthr4|archive-date=29 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units, although initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the [[Prairie Provinces]]. The size of most apartments, condominiums and houses continues to be described in square feet rather than square metres, and carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100&nbsp;km and statute miles per imperial gallon,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/tools/fuelratings/ratings-search.cfm?attr=8|title=Fuel Consumption Ratings Search Tool - Conventional Vehicles|first=Government of Canada, Natural Resources|last=Canada|publisher=}}</ref> leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length (feet), train height (feet), capacity ([[Short ton|tons]]), speed (mph), and trackage (miles).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/rail/1996/r96w0171/r96w0171.asp|title=Railway Investigation Report R96W0171|first=Government of Canada, Transportation Safety Board of|last=Canada|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nImperial units also retain common use in firearms and ammunition. Imperial measures are still used in the description of cartridge types, even when the cartridge is of relatively recent invention (e.g., [[.204 Ruger]], [[.17 HMR]], where the calibre is expressed in decimal fractions of an inch). However, ammunition that is already classified in metric is still kept metric (e.g., [[9\u00d719mm]]). In the manufacture of ammunition, bullet and powder weights are expressed in terms of [[grain (measure)|grains]] for both metric and imperial cartridges.\n\nAs in most of the western world, air navigation is based on ''nautical'' units, e.g., the nautical mile, which is neither imperial nor metric, though altitude is still measured in imperial feet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.langleyflyingschool.com/Pages/Canadian%20Aviation%20Regulations.html#Altimeter%20Rules|title=Canadian Aviation Regulations, Langley Flying School.

The imperial system remains in limited use \u2013 for sales of beer in pubs (traditionally sold by the pint). All other goods are required by law to be sold in metric units, although old quantities are retained for some goods like butter and sausages, which are sold in 454-gram (1&nbsp;lb) packaging. The majority of cars sold pre-2005 feature speedometers with miles per hour as the primary unit, but with a kilometres per hour display as well.\n\n===Other countries===\nFull imperial measurements are used in Palau, Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Belize. Some imperial measurements remain in limited use in [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[South Africa]]. Measurements in feet and inches, especially for a person's height, are frequently encountered in conversation and non-governmental publications.\n\nPrior to metrication, it was a common practice in Malaysia for people to refer to unnamed locations and small settlements along major roads by referring to how many miles the said locations were located from the nearest major town. In some cases, these eventually became the official names of the locations; in other cases, such names have been largely or completely superseded by new names. An example of the former is Batu 32 (literally \"Mile 32\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]), which refers to the area surrounding the intersection between [[Malaysia Federal Route 22|Federal Route 22]] (the [[Tamparuli]]-[[Sandakan]] highway) and [[Malaysia Federal Route 13|Federal Route 13]] (the Sandakan-[[Tawau]] highway). The area is so named because it is 32 miles west of Sandakan, the nearest major town.\n\nPetrol is still sold by the imperial gallon in [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Montserrat]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis|St Kitts and Nevis]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]].

For example, if one takes the definition of God to be described fully from the [[Bible]], then the claims of what properties God has described therein might be argued to lead to a [[contradiction]].\n\n==Evil vs. good and omnipotence==\nThe [[problem of evil]] is the [[argument]] that the existence of evil is incompatible with the concept of an omnipotent and perfectly good God.\n\nA variation does not depend on the existence of evil.  A truly omnipotent God could create all possible worlds.  A \"good\" God can create only \"good\" worlds.  A God that created all possible worlds would have no moral qualities whatsoever, and could be replaced by a random generator.  The standard response is to argue a distinction between \"could create\" and \"would create.\"  In other words, God \"could\" create all possible worlds but that is simply not in God's nature.  This has been argued by theologians for centuries.  However, the result is that a \"good\" God is incompatible with some possible worlds, thus incapable of creating them without losing the property of being a totally different God. Yet, it is not necessary for God to be \"good\". He simply is good, but is capable of evil.\n\n==Purpose vs. timelessness==\nOne argument based on incompatible properties rests on a definition of God that includes a will, plan or purpose and an existence outside of [[time]].  To say that a being possesses a purpose implies an inclination or tendency to steer events toward some state that does not yet exist.  This, in turn, implies a privileged direction, which we may call \"[[time]]\".  It may be one direction of [[causality]],  the direction of increasing [[entropy]], or some other [[emergent property]] of a world.  These are not identical, but one must exist in order to progress toward a goal.  \n\nIn general, God's time would not be related to our time.  God might be able to operate within our time without being constrained to do so.  However, God could then step outside this game for any purpose.  Thus God's time must be aligned with our time if human activities are relevant to God's purpose.  (In a relativistic universe, presumably this means\u2014at any point in spacetime\u2014time measured from t=0 at the [[Big Bang]] or end of [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].)\n\nA God existing outside of any sort of time could not create anything because creation substitutes one thing for another, or for nothing.  Creation requires a creator that existed, by definition, prior to the thing created.\n\n==Omniscience vs. indeterminacy or free will==\n{{main| Argument from free will}}\n\nAnother pair of alleged incompatible properties is [[omniscience]] and either [[indeterminism|indeterminacy]] or [[free will]].  Omniscience concerning the past and present (properly defined relative to Earth) is not a problem, but there is an argument that omniscience regarding the future implies it has been determined, what seems possible only in a deterministic world.{{fact|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Simplicity vs. omniscience==\nAnother pair is [[divine simplicity]] and omniscience.{{fact|date=November 2015}} An omniscient God must necessarily encompass all information in the universe. Information is not \"ineffable\" and cannot be reduced to something simpler.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Existence of God]]\n*[[Theological noncognitivism]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/philo/drange_1_2.htm A description of 10 more incompatibilities]\n*[http://www.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/papers/omniscienceandeternityareplytocraig.htm A response to William Craig] \u2014 Technical paper on omniscience and time.\n*[http://students.washington.edu/tmetcalf/oamp.htm Omniscience and Omnipotence]\n\n{{Theology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Incompatible-Properties Argument}}\n[[Category:Arguments against the existence of God]]", "sha1": "azq16m509hxil5axiwbhg0mjaybyeuf"}}, {"title": "International Society of Olympic Historians", "ns": "0", "id": "15495", "revision": {"id": "810440393", "parentid": "753109476", "timestamp": "2017-11-15T07:18:53Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v1.6.1)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Onesource|date=December 2007}}\n\nThe '''International Society of Olympic Historians''' ('''ISOH''') is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1991 with the purpose of promoting and studying the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games.

The idea of forming an Olympic historical society had been the subject of correspondence &ndash; mainly between [[Bill Mallon]] ([[United States]]) and Ture Widlund ([[Sweden]]) &ndash; for many years. On Thursday, 5 December 1991, a group of potential members met at the Duke of Clarence, a small pub in the Kensington section of [[London]].  Those present were Ian Buchanan ([[Great Britain]]), Stan Greenberg ([[Great Britain]]), [[Ove Karlsson (sports journalist)|Ove Karlsson]] ([[Sweden]]), Bill Mallon ([[United States]]), Peter Matthews ([[Great Britain]]), [[David Wallechinsky]] ([[United States]]), and Ture Widlund ([[Sweden]]). The invited guests who sent regrets were: Anthony Bijkerk ([[Netherlands]]), Peter Diamond ([[United States]]), Pim Huurman ([[Netherlands]]), Erich Kamper ([[Austria]]), Volker Kluge ([[Germany]]), John Lucas ([[United States]]), and Wolf Lyberg ([[Sweden]]).<REF NAME=\"ISOH-2007-ORG\" />\n\nISOH was formed with the purpose of promoting and studying the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games. This purpose is achieved primarily through research into their history, through the gathering of historical and statistical data concerning the Olympic Movement and Olympic Games, through the publication of the research via journals and other publications, and through the cooperation of the membership.<REF NAME=\"ISOH-2007-ORG\" />\n\nFrom its inception to 2000, Ian Buchanan has been the president of the ISOH. In 2000, this function was taken over by Bill Mallon. From 2004 to 2012 Dr. Karl Lennartz (Germany) served as president and since 2012 David Wallechinsky (United States) has been president.\n\n==Journal of Olympic History==\n\nThe ISOH publishes the ''Journal of Olympic History'' (formerly ''Citius, Altius, Fortius'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Journal of Olympic History|url=http://www.isoh.org/pages/journal.html|publisher=International Society of Olympic Historians|accessdate=23 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831045040/http://www.isoh.org/pages/journal.html|archivedate=31 August 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Membership==\n\n{{As of|2007}}, the ISOH has about 340 members from 48 nations.<REF NAME=\"ISOH-2007-ORG\">ISOH 2007, cited.</REF> The membership includes well-known Olympic historians and researchers on Olympic topics.
