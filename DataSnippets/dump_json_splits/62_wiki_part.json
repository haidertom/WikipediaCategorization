It consists of a [[Circle of stars|circle of]]  twelve five-pointed [[Or (heraldry)|yellow (''or'')]] [[star (heraldry)|stars]] on a [[azure (heraldry)|blue (''azure'')]] field.\n\nThe flag was designed in 1955, and officially launched later that year by the Council of Europe as a symbol for the whole of Europe.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/the-european-flag The European flag], Council of Europe. Retrieved 27 October 2016.</ref> The Council of Europe urged it to be adopted by other European organisations, and in 1985 the [[European Communities]] (EC) adopted it.\n\nThe EU inherited the flag's use when it was formed in 1993, being the successor organisation to the EC. It has been in wide official use by the EU since the 1990s, but it has never been given official status in any of the [[Treaties of the European Union|EU's treaties]]. Its adoption as an official symbol of the EU was planned as part of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], which failed to be ratified in 2005. Alternatively, it is sometimes called the ''Flag of the European Union'' when representing the EU.<ref>The name \"flag of the European Union\" is used in e.g. the Italian [http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/98022l.htm law no. 22 of 5 February  1998] (''bandiera  dell'Unione europea''), and by the ''[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe]]'' (''[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/le_drapeau_de_l_union_europeenne-fr-c0e88f08-81df-47ff-9d03-38d4a06e12d7.html Le drapeau de l'Union europ\u00e9enne]'', 2016) \n</ref>\n\nSince its adoption by the European Union, it has become broadly associated with the supranational organisation, due to its high profile and heavy usage of the emblem.  It has also been used by pro-EU protestors in the [[colour revolutions]] of the 2000s, e.g., in [[Belarus]] (2004)<ref name=\"Mite\">{{citation|last=Mite|firstvalentinas=|title=Belarus: Scores Arrested, Opposition Leader Hospitalized After Minsk Protests|date=20 October 2004|publisher=rferl.org|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/10/340afaf0-ebf7-4a03-8a25-ebda21070598.html|accessdate=5 August 2007}}</ref> or [[Moldova]].{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}.<ref name=\"Romania slams Moldova's sanctions\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7992259.stm|title=Romania slams Moldova's sanctions|date=9 April 2009|accessdate=12 December 2017|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:EU Flag specification.svg|thumb|300px|Construction sheet]]\n\nThe graphical specifications given by the EU in 1996 describe the design as: \"On an [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] field a circle of twelve golden [[Mullet (heraldry)|mullets]], their points not touching.\"<ref name=1996guide>\n''[https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/guide_graphique_relatif_a_l_embleme_europeen_1996-fr-93eedaa0-b431-4ca8-ac7b-113ca01c0395.html Guide graphique relatif \u00e0 l'embl\u00e8me europ\u00e9en]'' (1996), p. 3:\n''{{lang|fr|Description symbolique: Sur le fond bleu du ciel, les \u00e9toiles figurant les peuples d'Europe forment un cercle en signe d'union.

He claimed that the circle of stars was based on the iconographic tradition of showing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], wearing a \"crown of twelve stars\".<ref name=\"Economist religious\"/><ref name=\"Gialdino\">Carlo Curti Gialdino, ''I Simboli dell'Unione europea, Bandiera - Inno - Motto - Moneta - Giornata''.

G. Levy and the recent reconstruction by Susan Hood, crediting Ars\u00e8ne Heitz with the original design still seems to me the soundest option.  In particular, Ars\u00e8ne Heitz himself, in 1987, laid claim to his own role in designing the flag and to its religious inspiration when he said that 'the flag of Europe is the flag of Our Lady' [''Magnificat'' magazine, 1987]\n\n\"Secondly, it is worth noting the testimony of Father Pierre Caillon, who refers to a meeting with Ars\u00e8ne Heitz. Caillon tells of having met the former Council of Europe employee by chance in August 1987 at Lisieux in front of the Carmelite monastery. It was Heitz who stopped him and declared 'I was the one who designed the European flag. I suddenly had the idea of putting the 12 stars of the Miraculous Medal of the Rue du Bac on a blue field. My proposal was adopted unanimously on 8 December 1955, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. I am telling you this, Father, because you are wearing the little blue cross of the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima'\"</ref>\nThe French satirical magazine ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9]]}}'' reacted to Heitz's statement with an article entitled ''{{lang|fr|L\u2019Europe viol\u00e9e par la Sainte Vierge}}'' (\"Europe Raped by the Blessed Virgin\") in the edition of 20 December 1989.\nHeitz also made a connection to the date of the flag's adoption, 8 December 1955, coinciding with the Catholic [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n[[Paul M. G. L\u00e9vy]], then Director of Information at the Council of Europe responsible for designing the flag, in a 1989 statement maintained that he had not been aware of any religious connotations.<ref>{{citation |title=European Union: Myths on the flag |origyear=1995 |year=2002 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu!myt.html |accessdate=4 August 2007 }}\n\"While Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in a personal statement maintained that three leading Catholics within the Council had subconsciously chosen the twelve stars on the model of Apocalypse 12:1, Paul M.G. L\u00e9vy, Press Officer of the Council from 1949 to 1966, explained in 1989 that there was no religious intention whatsoever associated with the choice of the circle of twelve stars.\" Peter Diem, 11 June 2002</ref>\n\nIn an interview given 26 February 1998, L\u00e9vy denied not only awareness of the \"Marian\" connection, but also denied that the final design of a circle of twelve stars was Heitz's. To the question \"Who really designed the flag?\" L\u00e9vy replied:\n\n: \"I did, and I calculated the proportions to be used for the geometric design. Ars\u00e8ne Heitz, who was an employee in the mail service, put in all sorts of proposals, including the 15-star design. But he submitted too many designs. He wanted to do the European currencies with 15 stars in the corner.

The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] officially announced the European Anthem on 19 January 1972 at Strasbourg: the prelude to \"Ode to Joy\", 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th symphony. In 1974 the same piece of music was adopted as the [[National anthem of Rhodesia|national anthem]] of the unrecognized state of [[Rhodesia]].\n\nConductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] was asked to write three instrumental arrangements \u2013 for solo piano, for wind instruments and for symphony orchestra and he conducted the performance used to make the official recording. He wrote his decisions on the score, notably those concerning the tempo. Karajan decided on [[Half note|minim]] (half note) = 80 whereas Beethoven had written [[Quarter note|crotchet]] (quarter note) = 120.\n\nThe anthem was launched via a major information campaign on [[Europe Day]] in 1972. In 1985, it was adopted by EU heads of state and government as the official anthem of the then European Community \u2013 since 1993 the European Union. It is not intended to replace the national anthems of the member states but rather to celebrate the values they all share and their unity in diversity.

The European Parliament seeks to make greater use of the music; then-[[President of the European Parliament|Parliament President]] [[Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering]] stated he was moved when the anthem was played for him on his visit to [[Israel]] and ought to be used in Europe more often.<ref name=\"Parl use\"/>\n\nIn 2008 it was used by [[Kosovo]] as [[National anthem of Kosovo|its national anthem]] until it adopted its own, and it was played at [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|its declaration of independence]], as a nod to the EU's role in its independence from Serbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-17-kosovo-independence_N.htm|title=Kosovo declares independence|work=USA Today|date=17 February 2008|accessdate=2008-03-12}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2007 [[Signing of the Treaty of Lisbon|signing ceremony]] for the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], the [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] of the European Union's twenty-seven member states stood in attendance while the \"Ode to Joy\" was played and a choir of 26 Portuguese children sang the original German lyrics.<ref>{{YouTube|ljK58EK8vxI|Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Lisbon (Full) 1/6}}</ref>\n\nThe German public radio station [[Deutschlandfunk]] has broadcast the anthem together with the [[Deutschlandlied]] shortly before midnight since New Year's Eve 2006.

The European Ryder Cup captain [[Colin Montgomerie]] decided to break with tradition and play the European anthem by itself instead of the individual anthems from participating European nations. It was similarly employed at the 2014 Ryder Cup prizegiving ceremony on 28 September, after Europe had beaten America under its captain, [[Paul McGinley]]. It was also played at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Ryder Cup, right after the anthem of the USA.\n\n\"Ode to Joy\" is used as the theme song to the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|2016 UEFA Euro qualifying]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|European qualifying of the 2018 FIFA World Cup]] football competition at the introduction of every match.<ref>{{YouTube|_fgdXBEhNNc|European Qualifiers Intro \u2013 UEFA EURO 2016}}</ref>\n\n\"Ode to Joy\", automatically orchestrated in seven different styles, has been used on 18 June 2015 during the ceremony celebrating the 5000th ERC grantee as anthem of the [[European Research Council]] to represent achievements of European research.<ref>{{YouTube|0qnTaAz-xtQ|Machine Learning Techniques for Reorchestrating the European Anthem}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Members of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from the [[Scottish National Party]] first whistled and then sang \"Ode to Joy\" at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to protest against the [[Brexit]] referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/snp-mps-parliament-ode-to-joy-ludwig-van-beethoven-european-union-article-50-brexit-a7570486.html|title=The SNP staged a musical protest as MPs voted on whether to trigger Article 50|date=8 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Unofficial lyrics==\nDue to the large number of languages used in the European Union, the anthem is purely instrumental, and the German lyrics that [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote and on which Beethoven based [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|the melody]] have no official status. Despite this, the German lyrics are often sung by choirs or ordinary people when the anthem is played: for example, at the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement on the German-Polish border]], the crowd watching the ceremony playing the music sang along with the German lyrics.\n\nAside from this, several translations of the poem used by Beethoven as well as original works have attempted to provide lyrics to the anthem in various languages. Versions of the anthem including lyrics have been sung outside official EU occasions.\n\nIn France, several adaptations of Beethoven's composition were known long before the onset of European Union. A version by the librettist [[Maurice Bouchor]] (1855\u20131929) entitled \"Hymn to Universal Humanity\" (\"[[:s:fr:Hymne \u00e0 l\u2019universelle humanit\u00e9|Hymne \u00e0 l'universelle humanit\u00e9]]\") adding several verses to a preceding version of Jean Ruault, was published. This version and another by Bouchor, published with Julien Thiersot under the title \"Hymn for future times\" (\"Hymne des temps futurs\") in a music book which was widespread among basic schools,<ref>''Chants populaires pour les \u00e9coles'', librairie Hachette, published in several editions between 1902 and 1911</ref> is performed unofficially by school choirs during European events. Another version by the Catholic writer {{ill|Joseph Folliet|fr}} (1903\u20131972) is also known.\n\nIn 2004, Austrian Professor Peter Roland of the Europa Academy in Vienna presented new, Latin lyrics to European Commission President [[Romano Prodi]], although it has yet to be made official.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n<poem lang=\"la\" style=\"float:left;\">Est Europa nunc unita\nEt unita maneat\nUna in diversitate\nPacem mundi augeat.\nSemper regnant in Europa\nFides et iustitia\nEt libertas populorum\nIn majore patria.\nCives, floreat Europa\nOpus magnum vocat vos\nStellae signa sunt in caelo\nAureae, quae iungant nos.</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\">Europe is united now\nUnited it may remain\nOur unity in diversity\nMay contribute to world peace.\nMay there forever reign in Europe\nFaith and justice\nAnd freedom for its people\nIn a bigger fatherland.\nCitizens, Europe shall flourish\nA great task calls on you\nGolden stars in the sky are\nThe symbols that shall unite us.</poem>{{clear|left}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Europe}}\n* [[National symbol]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/078124.html Beethoven's Ninth: A Political History], Esteban Buch (Trans.

Burke criticized British treatment of the [[British America|American colonies]], including through its taxation policies.

Burke is remembered for his support for [[Catholic emancipation]], the impeachment of [[Warren Hastings]] from the [[East India Company]] and for his staunch opposition to the [[French Revolution]]. In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society, traditional institutions of state and society and condemned the persecution of the [[Catholic Church]] that resulted from it.

Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the [[Middle Temple]], before soon giving up legal study to travel in [[Continental Europe]].

This provoked Burke into writing his first published work, ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society|A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind]]'', appearing in Spring 1756. Burke imitated Bolingbroke's style and ideas in a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of his arguments for [[atheistic]] [[rationalism]], in order to demonstrate their [[absurdity]].<ref name=\"Prior, p. 45\">Prior, p. 45.</ref><ref>Jim McCue, ''Edmund Burke and Our Present Discontents'' (The Claridge Press, 1997), p. 14.</ref>\n[[File:Edmund Burke2 c.jpg|left|thumb|\"The writers against religion, whilst they oppose every system, are wisely careful never to set up any of their own.\" ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]'']]\n\nBurke claimed that Bolingbroke's arguments against [[Revelation|revealed religion]] could apply to all social and civil institutions as well. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] and [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]] (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a [[satire]].<ref name=\"Prior, p. 45\"/><ref>McCue, p. 145.</ref> All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing.

Later he explained that he'd intended his argument ironically, but many have doubted this. His argument for anarchy was too powerful, passionate, and cogent to be a joke. Later, as a professional politician, Burke seems to have come to terms with the state, believing that no matter how bloody its origins, it could be tamed and civilized, as in Europe, by \"the spirit of a gentleman, and the spirit of religion\". But even as he wrote, the old order he loved was already breaking down. \"</ref>\n\nIn 1757, Burke published a treatise on [[aesthetics]], ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', which attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].

Although the [[Estate (land)|estate]] included saleable assets such as [[art work]]s by [[Titian]], ''Gregories'' proved a heavy financial burden in the following decades and Burke was never able to repay its purchase price in full. His speeches and writings, having made him famous, led to the suggestion that he was the author of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''.\n\nAt about this time, Burke joined the circle of leading intellectuals and artists in London of whom [[Samuel Johnson]] was the central luminary. This [[Social circle|circle]] also included [[David Garrick]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and [[Joshua Reynolds]]. [[Edward Gibbon]] described Burke as 'the most eloquent and rational madman that I ever knew'.<ref>''Private Letters of Edward Gibbon, II (1896)'' Prothero, P.

He argued strongly against unrestrained royal power and for the role of political parties in maintaining a principled opposition capable of preventing abuses, either by the monarch, or by specific factions within the government. His most important publication in this regard was his ''Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents'' of 23 April 1770.<ref>{{cite book |url= |title=Burke: Select Works of Edmund Burke, Vol. 1, Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> Burke identified the \"discontents\" as stemming from the \"secret influence\" of a neo-Tory group he labelled as, the \"king's friends\", whose system \"comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, ''Double Cabinet''\".<ref>Lock, ''Burke.

Burke spoke in favour of the Bill but it was opposed by some, including [[Charles James Fox]] thus not becoming law. Fox, when introducing [[Libel Act 1792|his own Bill]] in 1791 in Opposition, repeated almost verbatim the text of Burke's Bill without acknowledgement.<ref>Prior, p. 127 + pp. 340\u201342.</ref> Burke also was prominent in securing the right to publish debates held in Parliament.<ref>Prior, p. 127.</ref>\n\nSpeaking in a parliamentary debate on the prohibition on the export of grain on 16 November 1770, Burke argued in favour of a [[free market]] in corn: \"There are no such things as a high, & a low price that is encouraging, & discouraging; there is nothing but a natural price, which grain brings at an universal market.\"<ref>Lock, ''Burke.

He saw it as \"the first very great breach in the modern political system of Europe\" and as upsetting the balance of power in Europe.<ref>[[Brendan Simms]], ''Three Victories and a Defeat.

His constituents, citizens of the great trading city of Bristol, however urged Burke to oppose [[free trade]] with Ireland. Burke resisted their protestations and said: \"If, from this conduct, I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election, it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England, that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong\".<ref>Prior, p. 175.</ref>\n\nBurke published, ''Two Letters to Gentlemen of Bristol on the Bills relative to the Trade of Ireland'', in which he espoused \"some of the chief principles of commerce; such as the advantage of free intercourse between all parts of the same kingdom...the evils attending restriction and monopoly...and that the gain of others is not necessarily our loss, but on the contrary an advantage by causing a greater demand for such wares as we have for sale\".<ref>Prior, pp. 175\u201376.</ref>\n\nBurke also supported the attempts of [[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet|Sir George Savile]] to repeal some of the [[penal laws]] against Catholics.<ref>Prior, p. 176.</ref> Burke also called capital punishment \"the Butchery which we call justice\" in 1776 and in 1780 he condemned the use of the [[pillory]] for two men convicted for attempting to practice [[sodomy]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nThis support for unpopular causes, notably free trade with Ireland and [[Catholic Emancipation]], led to Burke losing his [[Legislative seat|seat]] in 1780. For the remainder of his parliamentary career, Burke represented [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]], another pocket borough under the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]]'s patronage.\n\n==American War of Independence==\nBurke expressed his support for the grievances of the [[American Colonies]] under the government of [[King George III]] and his appointed representatives. On 19 April 1774 Burke made a speech, \"[[On American Taxation]]\" (published in January 1775), on a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to repeal the [[Tea Act|tea duty]]:\n\n<blockquote>Again and again, revert to your old principles\u2014seek peace and ensue it; leave America, if she has taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor attempting to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.<ref>Prior, pp. 142\u201343.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 22 March 1775, in the House of Commons, Burke delivered a speech (published during May 1775) on reconciliation with America. Burke appealed for peace as preferable to civil war and reminded the House of America's growing population, its industry, and its wealth. He warned against the notion that the Americans would back down in the face of force, since most Americans were of British descent:\n\n<blockquote>... the people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen... They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles. The people are Protestants... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government\u2014they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation\u2014the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke prized peace with America above all else, pleading with the House of Commons to remember that the interest by way of money received from the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] was far more attractive than any sense of putting the [[colonist]]s in their place:\n\n<blockquote>The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war, not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations, not peace to arise out of universal discord... it is simple peace, sought in its natural course and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke was not merely presenting a [[Peace treaty|peace agreement]] to Parliament; rather, he stepped forward with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned. He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in [[British America|Colonial America]] would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. \"An armament\", Burke said, \"is not a victory\".<ref name=\"National Humanities Center\">{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Edmund|title=Speech to Parliament on Reconciliation with the American Colonies|url=http://americainclass.org/sources/makingrevolution/war/text1/burkereconspeech.pdf|website=America in Class|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home.<ref name=\"National Humanities Center\"/> Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic\u2014the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil.\n\nIt was not temporary force, uncertainty, impairment, or even experience that Burke cited as the number one reason for avoiding war with the American colonies, however; it was the character of the American people themselves: \"In this character of Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole... this fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies, probably, than in any other people of the earth... [the] men [are] acute, inquisitive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defense, full of resources...\"<ref name=\"National Humanities Center\"/> Burke concludes with another plea for peace, and a prayer that Britain might avoid actions which, in Burke's words, \"may bring on the destruction of this Empire\".<ref name=\"National Humanities Center\"/>\n\nBurke proposed six resolutions to settle the American conflict peacefully:\n# Allow the American colonists to elect their own representatives, thus settling the dispute about taxation without representation;\n# Acknowledge this wrongdoing and apologise for grievances caused;\n# Procure an efficient manner of choosing and sending these delegates;\n# Set up a General Assembly in America itself, with powers to regulate taxes;\n# Stop gathering taxes by imposition (or law), and start gathering them only when they are needed; and\n# Grant needed aid to the colonies.<ref name=\"National Humanities Center\"/>\n\nThe effect of these resolutions, had they been passed, can never be known. Unfortunately, Burke delivered this speech just less than a month before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lexington and Concord|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/11c.asp|website=USHistory.org|publisher=Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict.\n\nAmong the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]] (1684\u20131775); Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: \"Young man, There is America\u2014which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world\".<ref name=\"Lock, Burke.

Vol. I, p. 384\" />\n\nThe administration of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] (1770\u20131782) tried to defeat the colonist rebellion by military force. British and American forces clashed in 1775 and, in 1776, came the [[American Declaration of Independence]]. Burke was appalled by celebrations in Britain of the defeat of the Americans at New York and Pennsylvania. He claimed the English national character was being changed by this authoritarianism.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Burke wrote: \"As to the good people of England, they seem to partake every day more and more of the Character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate. I am satisfied, that within a few years there has been a great Change in the National Character. We seem no longer that eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery people, which we have been formerly\".<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 394.</ref>\n\nIn Burke's view, the British Government was fighting \"the American English\" (\"our English Brethren in the Colonies\"), with a [[House of Hanover|Germanic king]] employing \"the hireling sword of German boors and vassals\" to destroy the English liberties of the colonists.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> On [[American independence]], Burke wrote: \"I do not know how to wish success to those whose Victory is to separate from us a large and noble part of our Empire. Still less do I wish success to injustice, oppression and absurdity\".<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 399.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Gordon Riots]] in 1780, Burke became a target of hostility and his home was placed under armed guard by the military.<ref>Hibbert pp. 48\u201373</ref>\n\n==Paymaster of the Forces==\n[[File:Cincinnatus in retirement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In ''Cincinnatus in Retirement'' (1782), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Burke's support of rights for Catholics.]]\n\nThe fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power in March 1782. Burke was appointed [[Paymaster of the Forces]] and a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], but without a seat in Cabinet. Rockingham's unexpected death in July 1782 and replacement with Shelburne as Prime Minister, put an end to his administration after only a few months, however, Burke did manage to introduce two Acts.\n\nThe [[Paymaster General Act 1782]] ended the post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. This act was repealed by Shelburne's administration, but the act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act.<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 511 + n. 65.</ref>\n\nThe [[Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782]] was a watered down version of Burke's original intentions as outlined in his famous ''Speech on Economical Reform'' of 11 February 1780. He managed, however, to abolish 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration.<ref>McCue, p. 21.</ref> The third [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] and the [[Board of Trade]] were abolished and pensions were limited and regulated. The Act was anticipated to save \u00a372,368 a year.<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', pp. 511\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn February 1783, Burke resumed the post of Paymaster of the Forces when Shelburne's government fell and was replaced by a coalition headed by North that included Charles James Fox. That coalition fell in 1783, and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of [[William Pitt the Younger]], which lasted until 1801. Accordingly, having supported Fox and North, Burke was in opposition for the remainder of his political life.\n\n==Democracy==\nIn 1774, Burke's ''Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll'' was noted for its defence of the principles of [[Representation (politics)|representative]] government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates:\n\n<blockquote>... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.<ref>''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume I'' (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), pp. 446\u201348.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPolitical scientist [[Hanna Pitkin]] points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, \"Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve.\"<ref>Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, ''The concept of representation'' (1972) p. 174</ref>\n\nBurke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over [[Tyranny of the majority|unpopular minorities]], who needed the protection of the upper classes.<ref>Joseph Hamburger, \"Burke, Edmund\" in Seymour Martin Lipset, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Democracy'' (Congressional Quarterly, 1995) 1:147\u201349</ref>\n\n==India and the impeachment of Warren Hastings==\n{{main|Impeachment of Warren Hastings}}\n\nFor years Burke pursued impeachment efforts against [[Warren Hastings]], formerly Governor-General of Bengal, that resulted in the trial during 1786. His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation.<ref>Siraj Ahmed, \"The Theater of the Civilized Self: Edmund Burke and the East India Trials\". ''[[Representations]]'' 78 (2002): 30.</ref> In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the [[East India Company]] when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs\u2014from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke's primary concern. This committee was charged \"to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties\".<ref>Russell Kirk, ''Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered'' (1988), 2.</ref> While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the [[Maharaja|Indian princes]] that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the East India Company should recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that \"began 'in commerce' but 'ended in empire.'\"<ref>Elizabeth D. Samet, \"A Prosecutor and a Gentleman: Edmund Burke's Idiom of Impeachment\", ''[[ELH]]'' 68, no. 2 (2001): 402.</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1785, Burke delivered a now-famous speech, ''The [[Nabob of Arcot]]'s Debts'', wherein he condemned the damage to [[India]] by the East India Company. In the province of the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]] the Indians had constructed a system of reservoirs to make the soil fertile in a naturally dry region, and centred their society on the husbandry of water:\n\n<blockquote>These are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own. These are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers of mankind.<ref>McCue, p. 155.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke held that the advent of British dominion, and in particular the conduct of the East India Company, had destroyed much that was good in these traditions and that, as a consequence of this, and the lack of new customs to replace them, the Indians were suffering. He set about establishing a set of British expectations, whose moral foundation would, in his opinion, warrant the empire.<ref>McCue, p. 156.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1786, Burke presented the Commons with the ''Article of Charge of [[High Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' against Hastings. The [[impeachment]] in Westminster Hall, which did not begin until 14 February 1788, would be the \"first major public discursive event of its kind in England\",<ref>Mithi Mukherjee, \"Justice, War, and the Imperium: India and Britain in Edmund Burke's Prosecutorial Speeches\", ''Law and History Review'' 23, no. 3 (2005): 589.</ref> bringing the morality and duty of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke already was known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance.<ref>Mukherjee, ''Justice, War, and the Imperium'', 590.</ref> Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'.<ref>Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781\u20131998'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2007), p. 35. {{ISBN|978-0-224-06222-0}}</ref> The House of Commons eventually [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|impeached Hastings]], but subsequently, the House of Lords acquitted him of all charges.\n\n==French Revolution: 1688 versus 1789==\n[[File:Smelling out a rat.jpg|thumb|''Smelling out a Rat;\u2014or\u2014The Atheistical-Revolutionist disturbed in his Midnight \"Calculations\"'' (1790) by Gillray, depicting a caricature of Burke holding a crown and a cross; the seated man, Dr. Richard Price, is writing \"On the Benefits of Anarchy Regicide Atheism\" beneath a picture of the execution of [[Charles I of England]].]]\n[[File:BurkeReflections.jpg|thumb|''Reflections on the Revolution in France, And on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris. By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke.'']]\n\nInitially, Burke did not condemn the [[French Revolution]]. In a letter of 9 August 1789, he wrote: \"England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner\".<ref>Clark, p. 61.</ref> The events of 5\u20136 October 1789, when [[Women's March on Versailles|a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles]] to compel [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: \"This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France\u2014where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it\u2014where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable\".<ref>Clark, pp. 61\u201362.</ref> On 4 November Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken \"as no more than the expression of doubt\" but he added: \"You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom\".<ref>Clark, p. 62.</ref> In the same month he described France as \"a country undone\". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:\n\n<blockquote>Since the House had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in France. The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world. In that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground, their monarchy; their church; their nobility; their law; their revenue; their army; their navy; their commerce; their arts; and their manufactures... [there was a danger of] an imitation of the excesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious, bloody and tyrannical democracy... [in religion] the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but from Atheism; a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind; which seems in France, for a long time, to have been embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed.<ref>Clark, pp. 66\u201367.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn January 1790, Burke read Dr. [[Richard Price]]'s sermon of 4 November 1789 entitled, ''[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]'', to the [[Revolution Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/price/price_8.htm |title=A Discourse on the Love of our Country |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> That society had been founded to commemorate the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. In this sermon Price espoused the philosophy of universal [[human rights|\"Rights of Men\"]]. Price argued that love of our country \"does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government\".<ref>Clark, p. 63.</ref> Instead, Price asserted that Englishmen should see themselves \"more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community\".\n\nA debate between Price and Burke ensued that was \"the classic moment at which two fundamentally different conceptions of national identity were presented to the English public\".<ref>Clark, ''English Society'', p. 233.</ref> Price claimed that the principles of the Glorious Revolution included \"the right to choose our own governors, to cashier them for misconduct, and to frame a government for ourselves\".\n\nImmediately after reading Price's sermon, Burke wrote a draft of what eventually became ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/241734 |title=The Genesis of Burke's Reflections |year=1978 |author=Dreyer, Frederick |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |volume=50|issue=3 |page=462}}</ref> On 13 February 1790, a notice in the press said that shortly, Burke would publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its British supporters, however he spent the year revising and expanding it. On 1 November he finally published the ''Reflections'' and it was an immediate best-seller.<ref>Clark, p. 68.</ref><ref>Prior, p. 311.</ref> Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, but by the end of 1790, it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator, Pierre-Ga\u00ebton Dupont, wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold. The French translation ran to ten printings by June 1791.<ref>F. P. Lock, ''Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: Allen & Unwin, 1985), p. 132.</ref>\n\nWhat the Glorious Revolution had meant was as important to Burke and his contemporaries as it had been for the last one hundred years in British politics.<ref>Clark, p. 39.</ref> In the ''Reflections'', Burke argued against Price's interpretation of the Glorious Revolution and instead, gave a classic Whig defence of it.<ref>Clark, pp. 24\u201325, 34, 43.</ref> Burke argued against the idea of abstract, metaphysical rights of humans and instead advocated national tradition:\n\n<blockquote> The Revolution was made to preserve our ''antient'' indisputable laws and liberties, and that ''antient'' constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty... The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as ''an inheritance from our forefathers''. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon [scion] alien to the nature of the original plant... Our oldest reformation is that of [[Magna Carta|Magna Charta]]. You will see that Sir [[Edward Coke]], that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove that the ancient charter... were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom... In the famous law... called the ''[[Petition of Right]]'', the parliament says to the king, \"Your subjects have ''inherited'' this freedom\", claiming their franchises not on abstract principles \"as the rights of men\", but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers.<ref>Clark, pp. 181\u201383.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke said  \"We fear God, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is ''natural'' to be so affected\".<ref>Clark, pp. 250\u201351.</ref> Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is \"the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages\" and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. \"Prejudice\", Burke claimed, \"is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit\".<ref>Clark, pp. 251\u201352.</ref> Burke criticised [[social contract]] theory by claiming that society is indeed, a contract, but \"a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born\".<ref>Clark, p. 261.</ref>\n\nThe most famous passage in Burke's ''Reflections'' was his description of the events of 5\u20136 October 1789 and the part of [[Marie-Antoinette]] in them. Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources.<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 289\u201390.</ref> His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. [[Philip Francis (politician)|Philip Francis]] wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was \"pure foppery\".<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 297.</ref> [[Edward Gibbon]], however, reacted differently: \"I adore his chivalry\".<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 300.</ref> Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the [[Armand Louis de Gontaut|Duchesse de Biron]], that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it.<ref>Alfred Cobban and Robert A. Smith (eds.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 204.</ref> Price had rejoiced that the French king had been \"led in triumph\" during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror\u2014that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette\u2014was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 296.</ref>\n\nLouis XVI translated the ''Reflections'' \"from end to end\" into French.<ref>Prior, pp. 313\u201314.</ref> Fellow Whig MPs [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] and [[Charles James Fox]], disagreed with Burke and split with him. Fox thought the ''Reflections'' to be \"in very bad taste\" and \"favouring Tory principles\".<ref>L. G. Mitchell, ''Charles James Fox'' (Penguin, 1997), p. 113.</ref> Other Whigs such as the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] and [[William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam|Earl Fitzwilliam]] privately agreed with Burke, but did not wish for a public breach with their Whig colleagues.<ref>Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 134.</ref> Burke wrote on 29 November 1790: \"I have received from the Duke of Portland, [[Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], the [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], [[Lord John Cavendish]], Montagu ([[Frederick Montagu]] MP), and a long et cetera of the old Stamina of the Whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution\".<ref>Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 178.</ref> The Duke of Portland said in 1791 that when anyone criticised the ''Reflections'' to him, he informed them that he had recommended the book to his sons as containing the true Whig creed.<ref>Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 161, n. 2.</ref>\n\nIn the opinion of [[Paul Langford]],<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Burke [[crossing the Rubicon|crossed something of a Rubicon]] when he attended a levee on 3 February 1791 to meet the king, later described by Jane Burke:\n\n<blockquote>On his coming to Town for the Winter, as he generally does, he went to the Levee with the Duke of ''Portland'', who went with [[Lord William Bentinck|Lord William]] to [[Kissing hands|kiss hands]] on his going into the [[Coldstream Guards|Guards]]\u2014while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, but his Eyes were fixed on [Burke] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for [Burke]'s coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of how long have you been in Town and the weather, He said you have been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [Burke] said, no, Sir, not more than usual\u2014You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see\u2014[Burke] made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done\u2014You cannot be vain\u2014You have been of ''use to us all'', it is a general opinion, is it not so [[John Dalrymple, 6th Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]]? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;\u2014Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said [Burke]\u2014I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen\u2014You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.<ref>Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 239.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke's ''Reflections'' sparked a [[Revolution Controversy|pamphlet war]]. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was one of the first into print, publishing ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' a few weeks after Burke. [[Thomas Paine]] followed with the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' in 1791. [[James Mackintosh]], who wrote ''Vindiciae Gallicae'', was the first to see the ''Reflections'' as \"the manifesto of a Counter Revolution\". Mackintosh later agreed with Burke's views, remarking in December 1796 after meeting him, that Burke was \"minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relating to the French Revolution\".<ref>Clark, p. 49.</ref> Mackintosh later said: \"Burke was one of the first thinkers as well as one of the greatest orators of his time. He is without parallel in any age, excepting perhaps Lord Bacon and Cicero; and his works contain an ampler store of political and moral wisdom than can be found in any other writer whatever\".<ref>Prior, p. 491.</ref>\n\n[[File:Charles James Fox00.jpg|thumb|[[Charles James Fox]]]]\n\nIn November 1790, Fran\u00e7ois-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the [[National Assembly of France]], wrote to Burke, praising ''Reflections'' and requesting more \"very refreshing mental food\" that he could publish.<ref>Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 162\u201369.</ref> This Burke did in April 1791 when he published ''A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly''. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \"a considerable insight into human nature\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766\u201367 Burke was a friend of [[David Hume]], with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding\u2014but ''vanity''\"\u2014which he \"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\". He also cited Rousseau's ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \"obscure and vulgar vices\" that was not \"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\".<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 356\u201367.</ref>\n\nThese events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox. In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was \"overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House\".<ref>Prior, p. 327.</ref> When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and \"the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man\".<ref name=\"McCue, p. 23\">McCue, p. 23.</ref> Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions.<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Whig Party and the French Revolution'' (Macmillan, 1967), p. 65.</ref> Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] and seconded by Fox.<ref>Prior, p. 328.</ref> Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech\u2014both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.\n\nBurke's response was:\n\n<blockquote>It certainly was indiscreet at any period, but especially at his time of life, to parade enemies, or give his friends occasion to desert him; yet if his firm and steady adherence to the British constitution placed him in such a dilemma, he would risk all, and, as public duty and public experience taught him, with his last words exclaim, \"Fly from the French Constitution\".<ref name=\"McCue, p. 23\" /></blockquote>\n\nAt this point, Fox whispered that there was \"no loss of friendship\". \"I regret to say there is\", Burke replied, \"I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend. There is something in the detested French constitution that envenoms every thing it touches\".<ref name=\"Prior, p. 329\">Prior, p. 329.</ref> This provoked a reply from Fox, yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered \"unusually bitter sarcasms\".<ref name=\"Prior, p. 329\" /> This only aggravated the rupture between the two men. Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him.<ref name=\"O'Gorman, p. 75\">O'Gorman, p. 75.</ref>\n\nBurke was dismayed that some Whigs, instead of reaffirming the principles of the Whig Party he laid out in the ''Reflections'', had rejected them in favour of \"French principles\" and that they criticised Burke for abandoning Whig principles. Burke wanted to demonstrate his fidelity to Whig principles and feared that acquiescence to Fox and his followers would allow the Whig Party to become a vehicle for Jacobinism.\n\nBurke knew that many members of the Whig Party did not share Fox's views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the French Revolution. Burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole Whig party \"as tolerating, and by a toleration, countenancing those proceedings\" so that he could \"stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be...their sentiments\".<ref>O'Gorman, p. 74.</ref> Therefore, on 3 August 1791 Burke published his ''Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs'', in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them, as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the Whig party.\n\nBurke owned two copies of what has been called \"that practical compendium of Whig political theory\", ''The Tryal of Dr. [[Henry Sacheverell]]'' (1710).<ref name=\"Clark, p. 40\">Clark, p. 40.</ref> Burke wrote of the trial: \"It rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a clear, authentic, recorded, declaration of their political tenets upon the subject of a great constitutional event like that of the [Glorious] Revolution\".<ref name=\"Clark, p. 40\" /> Writing in the third person, Burke asserted in his ''Appeal'':\n\n<blockquote>... that the foundations laid down by the Commons, on the trial of Doctor Sacheverel, for justifying the revolution of 1688, are the very same laid down in Mr. Burke's Reflections; that is to say,\u2014a breach of the ''original contract'', implied and expressed in the constitution of this country, as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in King, Lords and Commons.\u2014That the fundamental subversion of this antient constitution, by one of its parts, having been attempted, and in effect accomplished, justified the Revolution. That it was justified ''only'' upon the ''necessity'' of the case; as the ''only'' means left for the recovery of that ''antient'' constitution, formed by the ''original contract'' of the British state; as well as for the future preservation of the ''same'' government. These are the points to be proved.<ref name=\"Clark, p. 40\" /></blockquote>\n\nBurke then provided quotations from Paine's ''Rights of Man'' to demonstrate what the New Whigs believed. Burke's belief that Foxite principles corresponded to Paine's was genuine.<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 383.</ref> Finally, Burke denied that a majority of \"the people\" had, or ought to have, the final say in politics and alter society at their pleasure. People had rights, but also duties, and these duties were not voluntary. Also, the people could not overthrow morality derived from God.<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 384.</ref>\n\nAlthough Whig [[grandee]]s such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke's ''Appeal'', they wished he had used more moderate language. Fitzwilliam saw the ''Appeal'' as containing \"the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since\".<ref name=\"Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386\">Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 386.</ref> [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset|Francis Basset]], a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: \"...though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox & from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution\".<ref name=\"Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386\" /> Burke sent a copy of the ''Appeal'' to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it \"with great Satisfaction\".<ref name=\"Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386\" /> Burke wrote of its reception: \"Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice\".<ref name=\"O'Gorman, p. 75\" /> [[Charles Burney]] viewed it as \"a most admirable book\u2014the best & most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen\" but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.<ref>Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 385\u201386.</ref>\n\nEventually, most of the Whigs sided with Burke and gave their support to Pitt's \"conservative\" government, which, in response to France's declaration of war against Britain, declared war on France's Revolutionary Government in 1793.\n\nIn December 1791, Burke sent Government ministers his ''Thoughts on French Affairs'' where he put forward three main points: no counter-revolution in France would come about by purely domestic causes; the longer the Revolutionary Government exists the stronger it becomes; and the Revolutionary Government's interest and aim is to disturb all of the other governments of Europe.<ref>Prior, pp. 357\u201358.</ref>\n\nBurke, as a Whig, did not wish to see an [[absolute monarchy]] again in France after the extirpation of Jacobinism. Writing to an ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' in 1791, Burke expressed his views against a restoration of the ''ancien r\u00e9gime'':\n\n<blockquote>When such a complete convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, or in the Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness as well as other inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien R\u00e9gime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien R\u00e9gime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.<ref>Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 479\u201380.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke delivered a speech on the debate of the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Bill]] on 28 December 1792. He supported the Bill as it would exclude \"murderous atheists, who would pull down Church and state; religion and God; morality and happiness\".<ref name=\"Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439\">Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 439.</ref> The peroration included a reference to a French order for 3,000 daggers. Burke revealed a dagger he had concealed in his coat and threw it to the floor: \"This is what you are to gain by an alliance with France\". Burke picked up the dagger and continued:\n\n<blockquote>When they smile, I see blood trickling down their faces; I see their insidious purposes; I see that the object of all their cajoling is\u2014blood! I now warn my countrymen to beware of these execrable philosophers, whose only object it is to destroy every thing that is good here, and to establish immorality and murder by precept and example\u2014'Hic niger est hunc tu Romane caveto' ['Such a man is evil; beware of him, Roman'. Horace, ''Satires'' I. 4. 85.].<ref name=\"Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439\" /></blockquote>\n\nBurke supported the war against revolutionary France, seeing Britain as fighting on the side of the [[royalist]]s and ''\u00e9migres'' in a civil war, rather than fighting against the whole nation of France.<ref name=\"Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453\">Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 453.</ref> Burke also supported the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|royalist uprising]] in [[Vend\u00e9e|La Vend\u00e9e]], describing it on 4 November 1793 in a letter to [[William Windham]], as \"the sole affair I have much heart in\".<ref name=\"Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453\" /> Burke wrote to [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] on 7 October urging him to send reinforcements there, as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on Paris. Dundas did not follow Burke's advice, however.\n\nBurke believed the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] was not taking the uprising seriously enough, a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the [[Charles X of France|Prince Charles of France]] (''S.A.R. le comte d'Artois''), dated 23 October, requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the Government. Burke was forced to reply on 6 November: \"I am not in His Majesty's Service; or at all consulted in his Affairs\".<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 168\u201369.</ref> Burke published his ''Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France'', begun in October, where he said: \"I am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners. La Vend\u00e9e is a proof of this\".<ref>Edmund Burke, ''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume VII'' (F. C. and J. Rivington, 1815), p. 141.</ref>\n\nOn 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son [[Richard Burke Jr.|Richard]]. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise,<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for [[Catholic emancipation]]). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him [[Earl of Beaconsfield]], but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and the [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale|Earl of Lauderdale]], to whom Burke replied in his ''Letter to a Noble Lord'' (1796):<ref>Prior, pp. 425\u201326.</ref> \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, ''To innovate is not to reform''\".<ref>Edmund Burke, ''A Letter from The Right Honourable Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord, on the Attacks made upon him and his pension, in the House of Lords, by The Duke of Bedford and The Earl of Lauderdale, Early in the present Sessions of Parliament.'' (F. and C. Rivington, 1796), p. 20.</ref> He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\".<ref>Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', p. 41.</ref> Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:\n\n<blockquote>But as to ''our'' country and ''our'' race, as long as the well compacted structure of our church and state, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress at once and a temple, shall stand inviolate on the brow of the British Sion\u2014as long as the British Monarchy, not more limited than fenced by the orders of the State, shall, like the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers, as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land\u2014so long as the mounds and dykes of the low, fat, Bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of France.<ref>Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', pp. 52\u201353.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke's last publications were the ''[[Letters on a Regicide Peace]]'' (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as [[appeasement]], injurious to national dignity and honour.<ref>Prior, pp. 439\u201340.</ref> In his ''Second Letter'', Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary Government: \"Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects\u2014dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms\".<ref>Steven Blakemore, 'Burke and the Revolution: Bicentennial Reflections', in Blakemore (ed.), ''Burke and the French Revolution. Bicentennial Essays'' (The [[University of Georgia Press]], 1992), p. 158.</ref>\n\nThis is held to be the first explanation of the modern concept of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state.<ref>Blakemore, p. 158.</ref> Burke regarded the war with France as ideological, against an \"armed doctrine\". He wished that France would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in Europe, and that the war was not against France, but against the revolutionaries governing her.<ref>Prior, pp. 443\u201344.</ref> Burke said: \"It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning with the conquest of France\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Later life==\nIn November 1795, there was a debate in Parliament on the high price of corn and Burke wrote a memorandum to Pitt on the subject. In December [[Samuel Whitbread (1764\u20131815)|Samuel Whitbread]] MP introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and Fox said he would vote for it. This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the [[Board of Agriculture (1793\u20131822)|Board of Agriculture]], [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]; but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as, ''[[Thoughts and Details on Scarcity]]''.<ref>Robert Eccleshall, ''English Conservatism since the Restoration'' (London: Unwin Hyman, 1990), p. 75.</ref> In it, Burke expounded \"some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade\".<ref>Prior, p. 419.</ref> Burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages, and set out what the limits of government should be:\n\n<blockquote>That the State ought to confine itself to what regards the State, or the creatures of the State, namely, the exterior establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing that is ''truly and properly'' public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity.<ref>Eccleshall, p. 77.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe economist [[Adam Smith]] remarked that Burke was \"the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do, without any previous communications having passed between us\".<ref>E. G. West, ''Adam Smith'' (New York: Arlington House, 1969), p. 201.</ref>\n\nWriting to a friend in May 1795, Burke surveyed the causes of discontent: \"I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency, as they affect Ireland; or of Indianism [i.e. corporate tyranny, as practiced by the British East Indies Company], as they affect these countries, and as they affect Asia; or of Jacobinism, as they affect all Europe, and the state of human society itself. The last is the greatest evil\".<ref>R. B. McDowell (ed.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 254.</ref> By March 1796, however Burke had changed his mind: \"Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism, and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all ''formal'' Government\".<ref>McDowell (ed.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'', p. 432.</ref>\n\nFor more than a year prior to his death, Burke knew that his 'stomach' was \"irrecoverably ruind\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> After hearing that Burke was nearing death, Fox wrote to Mrs. Burke enquiring after him. Fox received the reply the next day:\n\n<blockquote>Mrs. Burke presents her compliments to Mr. Fox, and thanks him for his obliging inquiries. Mrs. Burke communicated his letter to Mr. Burke, and by his desire has to inform Mr. Fox that it has cost Mr. Burke the most heart-felt pain to obey the stern voice of his duty in rending asunder a long friendship, but that he deemed this sacrifice necessary; that his principles continue the same; and that in whatever of life may yet remain to him, he conceives that he must live for others and not for himself. Mr. Burke is convinced that the principles which he has endeavoured to maintain are necessary to the welfare and dignity of his country, and that these principles can be enforced only by the general persuasion of his sincerity.<ref>Prior, p. 456</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurke died in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, on 9 July 1797,<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Cavendish |first=Richard |date=1997-07-07 |title=Edmund Burke, Political Writer and Philosopher Dies  |url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/edmund-burke-political-writer-and-philosopher-dies |magazine=History Today |volume=47 |issue=7 |access-date=2018-07-07 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was buried there alongside his son and brother.<ref>{{Find a Grave|12496191|Edmund Burke}}</ref> His wife survived him by nearly fifteen years.<ref>Lock, Burke.

Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural\u2014part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence. As [[Christopher Hitchens]] summarises, \"If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=Reactionary Prophet|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/04/reactionary-prophet/302914/?single_page=true|website=www.theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nBurke's support for Irish Catholics and Indians often led him to be criticised by [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]].<ref>J.

Hirst, ''Liberty and Tyranny'' (London: Duckworth, 1935), pp. 105\u201306.</ref> Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a [[manifesto]] for Conservative thinking.\n\nTwo contrasting assessments of Burke also were offered long after his death by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe sycophant\u2014who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the romantic ''laudator temporis acti'' against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of the North American colonies at the beginning of the American troubles, he had played the liberal against the English oligarchy\u2014was an out-and-out vulgar [[bourgeois]]. \"The laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God.\" (E. Burke, l.c., pp. 31, 32) No wonder that, true to the laws of God and Nature, he always sold himself in the best market.\n</blockquote>\n\nWinston Churchill, in ''Consistency in Politics'', wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nOn the one hand [Burke] is revealed as a foremost apostle of Liberty, on the other as the redoubtable champion of Authority. But a charge of political inconsistency applied to this life appears a mean and petty thing. History easily discerns the reasons and forces which actuated him, and the immense changes in the problems he was facing which evoked from the same profound mind and sincere spirit these entirely contrary manifestations. His soul revolted against tyranny, whether it appeared in the aspect of a domineering Monarch and a corrupt Court and Parliamentary system, or whether, mouthing the watch-words of a non-existent liberty, it towered up against him in the dictation of a brutal mob and wicked sect. No one can read the Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority without feeling that here was the same man pursuing the same ends, seeking the same ideals of society and Government, and defending them from assaults, now from one extreme, now from the other.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe historian [[Piers Brendon]] asserts that Burke laid the moral foundations for the [[British Empire]], epitomised in the trial of [[Warren Hastings]], that was ultimately to be its undoing: when Burke stated that \"The British Empire must be governed on a plan of freedom, for it will be governed by no other\",<ref>K. Brittlebank, ''Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy'' (Delhi, 1997), p. 27.</ref> this was \"...an ideological bacillus that would prove fatal. This was Edmund Burke's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust. It was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright\u2014freedom\".<ref>Brendon, p. xviii.</ref> As a consequence of this opinion, Burke objected to the opium trade, which he called a \"smuggling adventure\" and condemned \"the great Disgrace of the British character in India\".<ref>F. G. Whelan, ''Edmund Burke and India'' (Pittsburgh, 1996), p. 96.</ref>\n\nA [[Royal Society of Arts]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Burke at [[Gerrard Street, London|37 Gerrard Street]] now in [[Chinatown, London|London's Chinatown]].<ref name='EngHet'>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/burke-edmund-1729-1797|title=BURKE, EDMUND (1729\u20131797)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism of Edmund Burke==\nOne of Burke's largest and most developed critics was [[Leo Strauss]], who was thoroughly analyzed by Steven Lenzner. Strauss in his book ''Natural Right and History'' makes a series of points in which he somewhat harshly evaluates Burke's writings.\n\nOne of the topics that he first addresses is the fact that Burke creates a definitive separation between happiness and virtue, and explains that \"Burke, therefore, seeks the foundation of government 'in a conformity to our duties' and not in 'imaginary rights of man\"<ref name=\"Strauss\">{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Leo|title=Natural Right and History|publisher=University of Chicago Publication|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo3643753.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Lenzner\">{{cite journal|last1=Lenzner|first1=Steven|title=Strauss's Three Burkes: The Problem of Edmund Burke in Natural Right and History|jstor=191417|publisher=Sage Publications}}</ref>\nStrauss views Burke as believing that government should focus solely on the duties that a man should have in society as opposed to trying to address any additional needs or desires. Government is simply a practicality to Burke, and not necessarily meant to function as a tool to help individuals live their best lives. Strauss also argues that in a sense, Burke's theory could be seen as opposing the very idea of forming such philosophies. Burke expresses the view that theory cannot adequately predict future occurrences, and thus, men need to have instincts that can't be practiced or derived from ideology.<ref name=\"Strauss\" /><ref name=\"Lenzner\" />\n\nThis leads to an overarching criticism that Strauss holds regarding Burke, which is his rejection of the use of logic. Burke dismisses a widely held view amongst theorists that reason should be the primary tool in the forming of a constitution or contract.<ref name=\"Strauss\" /><ref name=\"Lenzner\" /> Burke instead believes that constitutions should be made based on 'natural processes' as opposed to rational planning for the future. Strauss points out, however, that criticising rationality actually works against Burke's original stance of returning to traditional ways because some amount human reason is inherent, and therefore is in part grounded in tradition.<ref name=\"Strauss\" /> In regards to this formation of legitimate social order, Strauss does not necessarily support Burke's opinion\u2014 that order cannot be established by individual wise people, but exclusively by a culmination of individuals with historical knowledge of past functions to use as a foundation.<ref name=\"Strauss\" /><ref name=\"Lenzner\" /> Strauss notes that Burke would oppose more newly formed republics due to this thought,<ref name=\"Strauss\" /> although Lenzner adds the fact that he did seem to believe that America's constitution could be justified given the specific circumstances.<ref name=\"Lenzner\" /> France's constitution, on the other hand, was much too radical as it relied too heavily on enlightened reasoning as opposed to traditional methods and values.<ref name=\"Strauss\" />\n\n==Religious thought of Edmund Burke==\n{{main|Religious thought of Edmund Burke}}\nBurke's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion. Burke's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society.<ref>Edmund Burke, ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, 1964), 87.</ref> He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress.<ref>Ian Harris, \"Burke and Religion,\" in David Dwan and Christopher J Insole eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Edmund Burke'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), 103.</ref> Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns.<ref name=\"Ibid\" /> He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity's benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to political arrangements.<ref name=\"Ibid\">Harris, 98.</ref>\n\n==False quotations==\n===When good men do nothing===\nThe statement that \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\" is often attributed to Burke despite the debated origin of this quote.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Bromwich|title=The Intellectual Life of Edmund Burke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wWMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA175|year=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=175\u201376}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Garson|title=The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/12/04/good-men-do/|website=Quote Investigator|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> In 1770, however, it is known that in \"[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]\", Burke wrote that:\n{{quote|\u2026when bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrGAIvlkf-sC&pg=PR13 |year=1990 |title=Edmund Burke: appraisals and applications |isbn=978-0-88738-328-1 |author=Daniel Ritchie}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbouAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA106| title=Thoughts on the cause of the present discontents |year=1770 |author=Edmund Burke}}</ref>}}\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]] later made a similar statement in an inaugural address delivered before the University of St. Andrews during 1867:\n{{quote|Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DFNAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA36 ''Inaugural Address Delivered to the University of St. Andrews, Feb. 1st 1867'' (1867)], p. 36</ref>}}\n\n===Those who don't know history===\nBurke is sometimes credited with [[George Santayana]]'s quote: \"Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it\", but scholars have not found any reliable evidence indicating that Burke actually spoke (or wrote) those words.<ref>It is not among the 67 authentic Burke quotes in ''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations''.

Additionally, there has been a rise in the use of original or reproduction [[period instruments]] as part of the performance of Early music, such as the revival of the [[harpsichord]] or the [[viol]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lawson|first1=Colin|last2=Stowell|first2=Robin|title=The historical performance of music : an introduction|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521627382|page=17-18|edition=5th printing.}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of \"[[historically informed performance]]\" is nevertheless dependent on stylistic inference. According to Margaret Bent, Renaissance [[music notation|notation]] is not as prescriptive as modern scoring, and there is much that was left to the performer's interpretation: \"Renaissance [[music notation|notation]] is under-prescriptive by our standards; when translated into modern form it acquires a prescriptive weight that overspecifies and distorts its original openness.

Moon]] and published by [[Amigo Spiele]] in German and [[Rio Grande Games]] in English in 1998.\n\nIt is originally based on his earlier game ''Elfenroads'' (published by [[White Wind]]), but since ''Elfenroads'' took about four hours for a game, the play was simplified to reduce the time closer to an hour, making it appeal more as a family game.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alan Moon wins Game of the Year|url = http://www.gamecabinet.com/news/AlanMoonInterview2.html|website = www.gamecabinet.com|access-date = 2016-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIt won the [[Spiel des Jahres]] award in 1998 and won the third place [[Deutscher Spiele Preis]] award in 1998.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is played by 2\u20136 players, with 4\u20135 making for the best game.  \nEach player tries to reach as many cities as possible and then return to his \"home city.\"  \nHome cities are drawn at the beginning of the game from a pack of city cards and they remain hidden throughout the game.\nThe game is thus reminiscent of the [[traveling salesman problem]].\n\nPlayers move using transportation cards.  \nElves can travel on a wide variety of vehicles including troll wagons, elf cycles, rafts, giant pigs, unicorns, dragons and [[Magic (game)|magic]] clouds.  \nDifferent types of transportation will travel better over different terrain, and some methods of transport cannot cross certain terrains at all.  \nThere is only one problem:  you cannot travel over a route (except water) unless there is a tile on that road, and only the type of transport shown on the tile can be used to move along that road.   Before anyone can move, tiles are drawn and laid out across the board. This part is the one that calls for the most strategy, as players try to line up their tiles to set up a nice route for themselves and a difficult one for their opponents at the same time.\n\nAs well as normal tiles, each player receives one trouble tile for use during the game.\nThese hinder other players by forcing them to use an extra transportation card at that point.  \nAlso, any player can simply use any three cards to pass over any route that has a tile already there, allowing the type of transport shown on the tile to be ignored.\n\nThe game has subtle strategies to make others navigate through the cities.  \nWhen a player puts a transportation type you don't want in your path then you have to find a way around it.  \nAll of the aspects of the game make for a very exciting race to visit the most cities while never quite being sure who is winning until the last round.\n\n==Expansion==\nThere was an expansion for ''Elfenland'' published, called ''Elfengold''. \nNote that this is different from the original ''Elfengold'' published by White Wind. \nThe expansion, however, is hard to find.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{bgg|10|''Elfenland''|711|''Elfenroads''}}\n\n{{Spiel des Jahres}}\n\n[[Category:Fantasy board games]]\n[[Category:Spiel des Jahres winners]]\n[[Category:Alan R.

Support for the EU was up in 26 out of 28 EU countries, the exceptions being Germany and the UK, where support had dropped by about 2% since the previous survey. Almost half (48%) of the 27,601 EU citizens surveyed agreed that their voice counted in the EU, up from 37% in 2016, whereas 46% disagreed with this statement. Two-thirds (67%) of respondents felt that their country had benefited from EU membership and 60% said that being part of the bloc was a good thing, as opposed to 12% who felt the opposite. At the height of the EU's financial and economic crises in 2011, just 47% had been of the view that EU membership was a good thing.

When asked which issues should be a priority for the European Parliament, survey respondents picked terrorism as the most pressing topic of discussion, ahead of youth unemployment and immigration. Not all countries shared the same priorities, however. Immigration topped the list in Italy (66% of citizens surveyed considered it a priority issue), Malta (65%) and [[Hungary]] (62%) but fighting youth unemployment and support for economic growth were top concerns in [[Spain]], Greece, Portugal, Cyprus and [[Croatia]].

The [[point estimator]]s yield single-valued results, although this includes the possibility of single vector-valued results and results that can be expressed as a single function. This is in contrast to an [[interval estimator]], where the result would be a range of plausible values (or vectors or functions).\n\n[[Estimation theory]] is concerned with the properties of estimators; that is, with defining properties that can be used to compare different estimators (different rules for creating estimates) for the same quantity, based on the same data. Such properties can be used to determine the best rules to use under given circumstances. However, in [[robust statistics]], statistical theory goes on to consider the balance between having good properties, if tightly defined assumptions hold, and having less good properties that hold under wider conditions.\n\n==Background==\nAn \"estimator\" or \"[[point estimate]]\" is a [[statistic]] (that is, a function of the data) that is used to infer the value of an unknown [[parameter]] in a [[statistical model]]. The parameter being estimated is sometimes called the ''[[estimand]]''. It can be either finite-dimensional (in [[parametric model|parametric]] and [[semi-parametric model]]s), or infinite-dimensional ([[semi-parametric model|semi-parametric]] and [[non-parametric model]]s).<ref>Kosorok (2008), Section 3.1, pp 35\u201339.</ref> If the parameter is denoted <math> \\theta </math> then the estimator is traditionally written by adding a [[circumflex]] over the symbol: <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math>. Being a function of the data, the estimator is itself a [[random variable]]; a particular realization of this random variable is called the \"estimate\". Sometimes the words \"estimator\" and \"estimate\" are used interchangeably.\n\nThe definition places virtually no restrictions on which functions of the data can be called the \"estimators\". The attractiveness of different estimators can be judged by looking at their properties, such as [[unbiasedness]], [[mean square error]], [[Consistent estimator|consistency]], [[asymptotic distribution]], etc. The construction and comparison of estimators are the subjects of the [[estimation theory]]. In the context of [[decision theory]], an estimator is a type of [[decision rule]], and its performance may be evaluated through the use of [[loss function]]s.\n\nWhen the word \"estimator\" is used without a qualifier, it usually refers to point estimation. The estimate in this case is a single point in the parameter space. There also exists an other type of estimator: [[interval estimator]]s, where the estimates are subsets of the parameter space.\n\nThe problem of [[density estimation]] arises in two applications. Firstly, in estimating the [[probability density function]]s of random variables and secondly in estimating the [[Spectral density|spectral density function]] of a [[time series]]. In these problems the estimates are functions that can be thought of as point estimates in an infinite dimensional space, and there are corresponding interval estimation problems.\n\n==Definition==\nSuppose there is a fixed ''parameter'' <math> \\theta </math> that needs to be estimated. Then an \"estimator\" is a function that maps the [[sample space]] to a set of ''sample estimates''. An estimator of <math> \\theta </math> is usually denoted by the symbol <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math>. It is often convenient to express the theory using the [[algebra of random variables]]: thus if ''X'' is used to denote a [[random variable]] corresponding to the observed data, the estimator (itself treated as a random variable) is symbolised as a function of that random variable, <math>\\widehat{\\theta}(X)</math>. The estimate for a particular observed data value <math>x</math> (i.e. for <math>X=x</math>) is then  <math>\\widehat{\\theta}(x)</math>, which is a fixed value. Often an abbreviated notation is used in which <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is interpreted directly as a random variable, but this can cause confusion.\n\n==Quantified properties==\nThe following definitions and attributes are relevant.<ref>Jaynes (2007), p.172.</ref>\n\n===Error===\nFor a given sample <math> x </math>, the \"[[Errors and residuals in statistics|error]]\" of the estimator <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is defined as\n:<math>e(x)=\\widehat{\\theta}(x) - \\theta,</math>\nwhere <math>\\theta </math> is the parameter being estimated. Note that the error, ''e'', depends not only on the estimator (the estimation formula or procedure), but also on the sample.\n\n===Mean squared error===\nThe ''[[mean squared error]]'' of <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is defined as the expected value (probability-weighted average, over all samples) of the squared errors; that is,\n:<math>\\operatorname{MSE}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\operatorname{E}[(\\widehat{\\theta}(X) - \\theta)^2].</math>\nIt is used to indicate how far, on average, the collection of estimates are from the single parameter being estimated. Consider the following analogy. Suppose the parameter is the bull's-eye of a target, the estimator is the process of shooting arrows at the target, and the individual arrows are estimates (samples). Then high MSE means the average distance of the arrows from the bull's-eye is high, and low MSE means the average distance from the bull's-eye is low. The arrows may or may not be clustered. For example, even if all arrows hit the same point, yet grossly miss the target, the MSE is still relatively large. Note, however, that if the MSE is relatively low, then the arrows are likely more highly clustered (than highly dispersed) around the target.\n\n===Sampling deviation===\nFor a given sample <math> x </math>, the ''sampling deviation'' of the estimator <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is defined as\n:<math>d(x) =\\widehat{\\theta}(x) - \\operatorname{E}( \\widehat{\\theta}(X) ) =\\widehat{\\theta}(x) - \\operatorname{E}( \\widehat{\\theta} ),</math>\nwhere <math> \\operatorname{E}( \\widehat{\\theta}(X) ) </math> is the [[expected value]] of the estimator. Note that the sampling deviation, ''d'', depends not only on the estimator, but also on the sample.\n\n===Variance===\nThe ''[[variance]]'' of <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is simply the expected value of the squared sampling deviations; that is, <math>\\operatorname{var}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\operatorname{E}[(\\widehat{\\theta} - \\operatorname{E}[\\widehat{\\theta}]) ^2]</math>. It is used to indicate how far, on average, the collection of estimates are from the ''expected value'' of the estimates. Note the difference between MSE and variance. If the parameter is the bull's-eye of a target, and the arrows are estimates, then a relatively high variance means the arrows are dispersed, and a relatively low variance means the arrows are clustered. Some things to note: even if the variance is low, the cluster of arrows may still be far off-target, and even if the variance is high, the diffuse collection of arrows may still be unbiased. Finally, note that even if all arrows grossly miss the target, if they nevertheless all hit the same point, the variance is zero.\n\n===Bias===\nThe ''[[bias of an estimator|bias]]'' of <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is defined as <math>B(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\operatorname{E}(\\widehat{\\theta}) - \\theta</math>. It is the distance between the average of the collection of estimates, and the single parameter being estimated. Note that the bias of <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is a function of the true value of <math>\\theta</math> so saying that the bias of <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is <math>b</math> means that for every <math>\\theta</math> the bias of <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is <math>b</math>.\n\nThe bias also is the expected value of the error, since <math> \\operatorname{E}(\\widehat{\\theta}) - \\theta = \\operatorname{E}(\\widehat{\\theta} - \\theta ) </math>.   If the parameter is the bull's-eye of a target, and the arrows are estimates, then a relatively high absolute value for the bias means the average position of the arrows is off-target, and a relatively low absolute bias means the average position of the arrows is on target. They may be dispersed, or may be clustered.  The relationship between bias and variance is analogous to the relationship between [[accuracy and precision]].\n\nThe estimator <math>\\widehat{\\theta}</math> is an ''[[estimator bias|unbiased estimator]]'' of <math> \\theta </math> [[if and only if]] <math>B(\\widehat{\\theta}) = 0</math>.  Note that bias is a property of the estimator, not of the estimate. Often, people refer to a \"biased estimate\" or an \"unbiased estimate,\" but they really are talking about an \"estimate from a biased estimator,\" or an \"estimate from an unbiased estimator.\" Also, people often confuse the \"error\" of a single estimate with the \"bias\" of an estimator. Just because the error for one estimate is large, does not mean the estimator is biased. In fact, even if all estimates have astronomical absolute values for their errors, if the expected value of the error is zero, the estimator is unbiased. Also, just because an estimator is biased, does not preclude the error of an estimate from being zero (we may have gotten lucky). The ideal situation, of course, is to have an unbiased estimator with low variance, and also try to limit the number of samples where the error is extreme (that is, have few outliers). Yet unbiasedness is not essential. Often, if just a little bias is permitted, then an estimator can be found with lower MSE and/or fewer outlier sample estimates.\n\nAn alternative to the version of \"unbiased\" above, is \"median-unbiased\", where the [[median]] of the distribution of estimates agrees with the true value; thus, in the long run half the estimates will be too low and half too high. While this applies immediately only to scalar-valued estimators, it can be extended to any measure of [[central tendency]] of a distribution: see [[Bias of an estimator#Median-unbiased estimators, and bias with respect to other loss functions|median-unbiased estimators]].\n\n===Relationships among the quantities===\n*The MSE, variance, and bias, are related: <math>\\operatorname{MSE}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\operatorname{var}(\\widehat\\theta) + (B(\\widehat{\\theta}))^2,</math> i.e.  mean squared error = variance + square of bias. In particular, for an unbiased estimator, the variance equals the MSE.\n*The [[standard deviation]] of an estimator of ''\u03b8'' (the [[square root]] of the variance), or an estimate of the standard deviation of an estimator of ''\u03b8'', is called the ''[[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]]'' of ''\u03b8''.\n\n==Behavioral properties==\n===Consistency===\n{{Main|Consistent estimator}}\nA consistent sequence of estimators is a sequence of estimators that [[convergence in probability|converge in probability]] to the quantity being estimated as the index (usually the [[sample size]]) grows without bound. In other words, increasing the sample size increases the probability of the estimator being close to the population parameter.\n\nMathematically, a sequence of estimators {{nowrap|{''t<sub>n</sub>''; ''n'' \u2265 0}}} is a consistent estimator for [[parameter]] ''\u03b8'' if and only if, for all {{nowrap|''\u03f5'' > 0}}, no matter how small, we have\n:<math>\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\Pr\\left\\{\n\\left|\nt_n-\\theta\\right|<\\epsilon\n\\right\\}=1.\n</math>\n\nThe consistency defined above may be called weak consistency. The sequence is ''strongly consistent'', if it [[Almost sure convergence|converges almost surely]] to the true value.\n\nAn estimator that converges to a ''multiple'' of a parameter can be made into a consistent estimator by multiplying the estimator by a [[scale factor]], namely the true value divided by the asymptotic value of the estimator. This occurs frequently in [[Scale parameter#Estimation|estimation of scale parameters]] by [[Statistical dispersion#Measures of statistical dispersion|measures of statistical dispersion]].\n\n===Asymptotic normality===\n{{Main|Asymptotic normality}}\nAn [[asymptotic distribution#Asymptotic normality|asymptotically normal]] estimator is a consistent estimator whose distribution around the true parameter ''\u03b8'' approaches a [[normal distribution]] with standard deviation shrinking in proportion to <math>1/\\sqrt{n}</math> as the sample size ''n'' grows.  Using <math>\\xrightarrow{D}</math> to denote [[Convergence of random variables#Convergence in distribution|convergence in distribution]], ''t<sub>n</sub>'' is [[Asymptotic normality|asymptotically normal]] if\n:<math>\\sqrt{n}(t_n - \\theta) \\xrightarrow{D} N(0,V),</math>\nfor some ''V''.\n\nIn this formulation ''V/n'' can be called the ''asymptotic variance'' of the estimator. However, some authors also call ''V'' the ''asymptotic variance''.\nNote that convergence will not necessarily have occurred for any finite \"n\", therefore this value is only an approximation to the true variance of the estimator, while in the limit the asymptotic variance (V/n) is simply zero. Stated a little more accurately, the distribution of the estimator ''t<sub>n</sub>'' converges weakly to a [[dirac delta function]] centered at <math>\\theta</math>.\n\nThe [[central limit theorem]] implies asymptotic normality of the [[sample mean]] <math>\\bar X</math> as an estimator of the true mean.\nMore generally, [[maximum likelihood]] estimators are asymptotically normal under fairly weak regularity conditions \u2014 see the [[maximum likelihood#Asymptotics|asymptotics section]] of the maximum likelihood article. However, not all estimators are asymptotically normal; the simplest examples are found when the true value of a parameter lies on the boundary of the allowable parameter region.\n\n===Efficiency===\n{{Main|Efficiency (statistics)}}\n\nTwo naturally desirable properties of estimators are for them to be unbiased and have minimal [[mean squared error]] (MSE). These cannot in general both be satisfied simultaneously: a biased estimator may have lower [[mean squared error]] (MSE) than any unbiased estimator; see [[estimator bias]].\n\nAmong unbiased estimators, there often exists one with the lowest variance, called the minimum variance unbiased estimator ([[MVUE]]). In some cases an unbiased [[efficiency (statistics)|efficient estimator]] exists, which, in addition to having the lowest variance among unbiased estimators, satisfies the [[Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound]], which is an absolute lower bound on variance for statistics of a variable.\n\nConcerning such \"best unbiased estimators\", see also [[Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound]], [[Gauss\u2013Markov theorem]], [[Lehmann\u2013Scheff\u00e9 theorem]], [[Rao\u2013Blackwell theorem]].\n\n===Robustness===\n{{main|Robust estimator}}\n{{further|Robust regression}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Refbegin|3}}\n* [[Best linear unbiased estimator]] (BLUE)\n* [[Invariant estimator]]\n* [[Kalman filter]]\n* [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC)\n* [[Maximum a posteriori]] (MAP)\n* [[Method of moments (statistics)|Method of moments]], [[generalized method of moments]]\n* [[Minimum mean squared error]] (MMSE)\n* [[Particle filter]]\n* [[Pitman closeness criterion]]\n* [[Sensitivity and specificity]]\n* [[Shrinkage estimator]]\n* [[Signal Processing]]\n* [[Testimator]]\n* [[Wiener filter]]\n* [[Well-behaved statistic]]\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{SpringerEOM | title=Statistical Estimator | id=s/s087360 | first=Login Nikolaevich | last=Bol'shev}}.\n* {{Citation |last1=Jaynes|first1=E.

Normally, in the grading of colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of emeralds, clarity is considered a close second. A fine emerald must possess not only a pure verdant green [[hue]] as described below, but also a high degree of [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] to be considered a top gem.<ref name=Wise>Wise, R.

Brunswick House Press, p. 108, {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, the American jewelry industry changed the definition of ''emerald'' to include the green vanadium-bearing beryl. As a result, ''vanadium emeralds'' purchased as emeralds in the United States are not recognized as such in the UK and Europe. In America, the distinction between traditional emeralds and the new vanadium kind is often reflected in the use of terms such as \"[[Colombian Emeralds|Colombian emerald]]\".<ref name=Read>Read, Peter (2008) ''Gemmology'', 3rd rev. ed., NAG Press, p. 218, {{ISBN|0719803616}}.</ref>\n\n===Color===\nIn gemology,<ref>[http://gia4cs.gia.edu/EN-US/gr-colored-diamonds-gemstones.htm Grading Fancy-Color Diamonds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102115539/http://gia4cs.gia.edu/en-us/gr-colored-diamonds-gemstones.htm |date=November 2, 2014 }}. Gemological Institute of America</ref> color is divided into three components: ''[[hue]]'', ''[[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]]'', and ''[[Lightness (color)|tone]]''. Emeralds occur in hues ranging from yellow-green to blue-green, with the primary hue necessarily being green. Yellow and blue are the normal secondary hues found in emeralds. Only gems that are medium to dark in tone are considered emeralds; light-toned gems are known instead by the species name ''green beryl''. The finest emeralds are approximately 75% tone on a scale where 0% tone is colorless and 100% is opaque black. In addition, a fine emerald will be saturated and have a hue that is bright (vivid). Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in emeralds;  a grayish-green hue is a dull-green hue.<ref name=Wise/>\n\n===Clarity===\n[[File:Emerald in a quartz and pegmatite matrix.JPG|thumb|Brazilian emerald (grass-green variety of the mineral beryl) in a quartz-pegmatite matrix with typical hexagonal, prismatic crystals.<ref>\nBonewitz, R.

Unlike diamonds, where the [[loupe]] standard, i.e. 10\u00d7 magnification, is used to grade clarity, emeralds are graded by eye. Thus, if an emerald has no visible [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] to the eye (assuming normal visual acuity) it is considered flawless. Stones that lack surface breaking fissures are extremely rare and therefore almost all emeralds are treated (\"oiled\", see below) to enhance the apparent clarity. The inclusions and fissures within an emerald are sometime described as ''jardin'' (French for ''garden''), because of their mossy appearance.<ref>[http://www.gia.edu/emerald-quality-factor Emerald Quality Factors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223032811/http://www.gia.edu/emerald-quality-factor |date=February 23, 2014 }}. Gemological Institute of America.</ref> Imperfections are unique for each emerald and can be used to identify a particular stone. Eye-clean stones of a vivid primary green hue (as described above), with no more than 15% of any secondary hue or combination (either blue or yellow) of a medium-dark tone, command the highest prices.<ref name=Wise/> The relative non-uniformity motivates the cutting of emeralds in [[cabochon]] form, rather than faceted shapes. Faceted emeralds are most commonly given an oval cut, or the signature emerald cut, a rectangular cut with facets around the top edge.\n\n===Treatments===\nMost emeralds are oiled as part of the post-[[lapidary]] process, in order to fill in surface-reaching cracks so that clarity and stability are improved. [[Cedar oil]], having a similar [[refractive index]], is often used in this widely adopted practice. Other liquids, including synthetic oils and polymers with refractive indexes close to that of emeralds, such as ''Opticon'', are also used. These treatments are typically applied in a vacuum chamber under mild heat, to open the pores of the stone and allow the fracture-filling agent to be absorbed more effectively.<ref>Liccini, Mark.

These categories reflect levels of enhancement, not ''clarity''. A gem graded ''none'' on the enhancement scale may still exhibit visible inclusions. Laboratories apply these criteria differently. Some gemologists consider the mere presence of oil or polymers to constitute enhancement. Others may ignore traces of oil if the presence of the material does not improve the look of the gemstone.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matlins|first1=Antoinette Leonard|last2=Bonanno|first2=Antonio C.|title=Jewelry & Gems, the Buying Guide: How to Buy Diamonds, Pearls, Colored Gemstones, Gold & Jewelry with Confidence and Knowledge|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=9780943763712|page=126|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WUBWz22wRtEC&pg=PA126&dq=gemstone+enhancement+traces+of+oil&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ruzuuv3SAhUT3mMKHXM_CdwQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=gemstone%20enhancement%20traces%20of%20oil&f=false|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330180745/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WUBWz22wRtEC&pg=PA126&dq=gemstone+enhancement+traces+of+oil&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ruzuuv3SAhUT3mMKHXM_CdwQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=gemstone%20enhancement%20traces%20of%20oil&f=false|archivedate=March 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Emerald mines==\n[[File:Trapiche emerald (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Colombian [[trapiche emerald]]]]\nEmeralds in antiquity were mined in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] at locations on Mount Smaragdus since 1500 BCE, and India, and Austria since at least the 14th century CE.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.631|url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_53-54/010020866.pdf|title=Oxygen Isotopes and Emerald Trade Routes Since Antiquity|journal=Science|year=2000|vauthors=Giuliani G, Chaussidon M, Schubnel HJ, Piat DH, Rollion-Bard C, France-Lanord C, Giard D, de Narvaez D, Rondeau B|pages=631\u20133|bibcode=2000Sci...287..631G|pmid=10649992|volume=287|issue=5453|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807120139/http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_53-54/010020866.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Egyptian mines were exploited on an industrial scale by the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and later by Islamic conquerors.

Traditional research used qualitative guidelines such as an emerald\u2019s color, style and quality of cutting, type of fracture filling, and the anthropological origins of the artifacts bearing the mineral to determine the emerald's mine location.  More recent studies using [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] methods have uncovered trace chemical element differences between emeralds; even emeralds mined within close proximity to one another.  American gemologist David Cronin and his colleagues have extensively examined the chemical signatures of emeralds resulting from fluid dynamics and subtle precipitation mechanisms, and their research demonstrated the chemical homogeneity of emeralds from the same mining location and the statistical differences that exist between emeralds from different mining locations, including those between the three locations: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor, in Colombia, South America.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.gem-a.com/publications/journal-of-gemmology/issues-2008-to-date/cronin-2012.aspx |title=Determining the geographical origins of natural emeralds through nondestructive chemical fingerprinting |last=Cronin |first=David |date=2012 |journal=Journal of Gemmology |doi= |pmid= |access-date= |last2=Rendle |first2=Andy |pages=1\u201313 |volume=33 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015242/http://www.gem-a.com/publications/journal-of-gemmology/issues-2008-to-date/cronin-2012.aspx |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==Synthetic emerald==\n[[File:Emerald.png|thumb|100px|left|Emerald showing its hexagonal structure]]\n\nBoth hydrothermal and [[flux method|''flux-growth'']] synthetics have been produced, and a method has been developed for producing an emerald overgrowth on colorless [[beryl]].

These stones were initially sold under the names \"Emerita\" and \"Symeralds\", and they were grown as a thin layer of emerald on top of natural colorless beryl stones.  Later, from 1965 to 1970, the [[The Linde Group|Linde]] Division of [[Union Carbide]] produced completely synthetic emeralds by hydrothermal synthesis. According to their patents (attributable to [[Edith Flanigen|E.M. Flanigen]]),<ref>Geological Magazine \"Hydrothermal process for growing crystals having the structure of beryl in an alkaline halide medium\" {{US patent|3567642}} Issue date: March 2, 1971</ref> acidic conditions are essential to prevent the chromium (which is used as the colorant) from precipitating. Also, it is important that the silicon-containing nutrient be kept away from the other ingredients to prevent nucleation and confine growth to the seed crystals. Growth occurs by a diffusion-reaction process, assisted by convection. The largest producer of hydrothermal emeralds today is Tairus, which has succeeded in synthesizing emeralds with chemical composition similar to emeralds in alkaline deposits in Colombia, and whose products are thus known as \u201cColombian created emeralds\u201d or \u201cTairus created emeralds\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Schmetzer, Karl |author2=Schwartz, Dietmar |author3=Bernhardt, Heinz-Jurgen |author4=Tobias Hager |url=http://www.gem-a.com/media/27904/2006%2030%201%20to%202.pdf |title=A new type of Tairus hydrothermally-grown synthetic emerald, colored by vanadium and copper |journal=Journal of Gemmology of Gemmological Association of Great Britain |volume=30 |issue=1\u20132 |year=2006\u20132007 |pages=59\u201374 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711082633/http://www.gem-a.com/media/27904/2006%2030%201%20to%202.pdf |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> Luminescence in [[ultraviolet light]] is considered a supplementary test when making a natural versus synthetic determination, as many, but not all, natural emeralds are inert to ultraviolet light.

This was not unique to the Americas, and the problem still exists in those parts of the world where [[muscle power]] provides a primary means of transportation within a region. An equally ancient solution was implemented in many cultures \u2014 floating vessels move more easily than land vehicles since friction becomes significantly less. Close to the seacoast, rivers often provided adequate waterways, but the [[Appalachian Mountains]], {{convert|400|mi}} inland, running over {{convert|1500|mi}} long as a [[barrier range]] with just five places where [[Mule#Mule train|mule trains]] or [[wagon road]]s could be routed,<ref name=FiveXings>The five east\u2013west crossings of the Appalachians are: <br />{{bull\n}}Plains of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi (around the bottom), <br />{{bull\n}}the [[Cumberland Gap]] pass connecting [[North Carolina]]/Southern [[Virginia]] with [[Kentucky]]/[[Tennessee]], <br />{{bull\n}}the [[Cumberland Narrows]] pass connecting [[Cumberland, Maryland]] (in [[Western Maryland]]) and [[Northern Virginia]] with [[West Virginia]] and [[Western Pennsylvania]] via [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]] and the [[Monongahela River]] or the [[Youghiogheny River]] valley (both of the Ohio & Mississippi river system), <br />{{bull\n}}the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] connecting the [[Susquehanna River]] Valley in central Pennsylvania with the [[Allegheny River]] valley (and again the [[Ohio Country]]), <br />{{bull\n}}and lastly, the [[Mohawk River]] [[water gap]] and valley tributary of the [[Hudson River]], creating what later advertising would call the level water route westwards.\n\n</ref> presented a great challenge. Passengers and freight had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2-1/2 weeks to travel overland from New York to [[Cleveland, Ohio]] ({{convert|460|mi}}); 4 weeks to [[Detroit]] ({{convert|612|mi}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://railroads.unl.edu/documents/view_document.php?id=rail.str.0241 |title=Railroad Travel Rates, 1800\u20131930}}</ref>\n\nThe principal exportable product of the [[Ohio Valley]] was grain, which was a high-volume, low-priced commodity, bolstered by supplies from the coast. Frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers. This was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into [[whiskey]] for easier transport and higher sales, and later the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly.<ref>Joel Achenbach, \"America's River; From [[George Washington|Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] to the Army Corps of Engineers, everyone had grandiose plans to tame the [[Potomac River|Potomac]].

The idea of a canal to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements was discussed as early as 1724: New York provincial official [[Cadwallader Colden]] made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York.\n\n[[Gouverneur Morris]] and [[Elkanah Watson]] were early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk River. Their efforts led to the creation of the \"Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies\" in 1792, which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk and construct a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario,<ref>Calhoun, Daniel Hovey. The American civil engineer: Origins and conflict. Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960.</ref> but it was soon discovered that private financing was insufficient.\n[[Christopher Colles]] (who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal) surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784, proposing a shorter canal from [[Lake Ontario]]. The proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented.\n\n[[Jesse Hawley (merchant)|Jesse Hawley]] had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]]. However, he went [[bankrupt]] trying to ship grain to the coast. While in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]] [[debtors' prison]], Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the {{convert|90|mi|adj=on}}-long [[Mohawk River]] valley with support from [[Joseph Ellicott]] (agent for the [[Holland Land Company]] in [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia]]). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner.\n\n===Engineering requirements===\nThe Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial meltwater]] channel just north of the [[Catskills|Catskill range]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], separating them from the geologically distinct [[Adirondacks]] to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of [[Alabama]], allowing an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in the west. Along its course and from these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent's interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard.\n\nThe problem was that the land rises about {{convert|600|ft|m}} from the Hudson to Lake Erie. Locks at the time could handle up to {{convert|12|ft|m}} of lift, so even with the heftiest [[cutting (transportation)|cuttings]] and [[viaduct]]s, fifty locks would be required along the {{convert|360|mi|km|adj=on}} canal. Such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology; in 1800, the expense was barely imaginable. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] called it \"a little short of madness\" and rejected it; however, Hawley interested New York Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] in the project. There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as \"Clinton's folly\" and \"Clinton's ditch.\" In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7&nbsp;million for construction.<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nThe original canal was {{convert|363|mi|km}} long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The channel was cut {{convert|40|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|4|ft|m}} deep, with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a [[towpath]].<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nIts construction, through [[limestone]] and mountains, proved a daunting task. In 1823 construction reached the [[Niagara Escarpment]], necessitating the building of five locks along a {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} corridor to carry the canal over the escarpment. To move earth, animals pulled a \"slip scraper\" (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The stonework required hundreds of German masons, who later built many of New York's buildings. All labor on the canal depended upon human (and animal) power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] to redirect water; one aqueduct was {{convert|950|ft}} long to span {{convert|800|ft}} of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force.\n[[File:1832 Erie Canal.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.1|Profile of the original canal|alt=Elevation drawing of the canal's length.]]\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|thumb|Operations at [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]] in 1839]]\n\nCanal boats up to {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} in draft were pulled by horses and mules walking on the towpath. The canal had one towpath, generally on the north side. When [[barge|canal boats]] met, the boat with the right of way<!--How was this determined? A: good q. One would guess it was the boat traveling west as right dominates on all navigations, but one could also have afforded the bigger vessel priority, a citation is needed.--> remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or \"hoggee\", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unhitched from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom, while his boat coasted with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat's team would step over the other boat's towline, with its horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat's team would continue on its way.\n\nPulled by teams of horses, canal boats moved slowly, but methodically, shrinking time and distance. Efficiently, the smooth, nonstop method of transportation cut the travel time between Albany and Buffalo nearly in half, moving by day and by night. Men and women boarded barges to venture west, to visit relatives, or just for a relaxing excursion. Migrants took passage on freight boats, camping on deck or on top of crates. Packet boats, serving passengers exclusively, reached speeds of up to five miles an hour, and ran at much more frequent intervals than the cramped, bumpy stagecoach wagons.<ref name=\"Sheriff\">{{Cite book|title=The Artificial River: The Erie Canal and the Paradox of Progress 1817\u20131862|last=Sheriff|first=Carol|publisher=Hill & Wang|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8090-2753-8|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFG6QgAACAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|54}}\n\nPacket boats, measuring up to 78 feet long and 14.5 feet wide, made ingenious use of space, accommodating up to 40 passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|59}} The best examples, furnished with carpeted floors, stuffed chairs, and mahogany tables stocked with books and current newspapers, served as sitting rooms during the days.

At that rate, the canal would not be finished for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through [[virgin forest]] and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative [[Stump harvesting|stump puller]]. Two huge wheels were mounted loose on the ends of an axle. A third wheel, slightly smaller than the others, was fixed to the center of the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The [[mechanical advantage]] (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses and mules could build a mile in a year.<ref name = \"Hunter 1991\">{{cite book|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power |last=Hunter |first=Louis C. |authorlink= |author2=Bryant, Lynwood |year=1991 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, London |isbn=978-0-262-08198-6 |page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrFHAAAAYAAJ }}</ref>\n\nThe remaining problem was finding labor; increased [[immigration]] helped fill the need. Many of the laborers working on the canal were [[Irish people|Irish]], who had recently come to the United States as a group of about 5,000.

Buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth. Buffalo won over Black Rock, and grew into a large city, eventually encompassing its former rival.\n\nThe entire canal was officially completed on October 26, 1825. The event was marked by a statewide \"Grand Celebration,\" culminating in a series of cannon shots along the length of the canal and the Hudson, a 90-minute [[cannonade]] from Buffalo to New York City. A flotilla of boats, led by Governor Dewitt Clinton aboard ''Seneca Chief'', sailed from Buffalo to New York City over ten days.

With several miles of the Canal inland of this location still lying under 20th-century fill and urban construction, the effective western navigable terminus of the Erie Canal is found at Tonawanda.\n\nThe Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York's unique topography, which provided that area with the only break in the [[Appalachian mountains|Appalachians]] south of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The Hudson is tidal to [[Troy, New York|Troy]], and Albany is west of the Appalachians.

The port of New York became essentially the [[Atlantic]] home port for all of the Midwest\u2014because of this vital connection and others to follow, such as the railroads, New York would become known as the \"Empire State\" or \"the great Empire State\".<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\n==Enlargements and improvements==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Camillus-aqueduct1.JPG|thumb|left|Derelict [[Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct|aqueduct over Nine Mile Creek]] north of [[Camillus (town), New York|Camillus, New York]] built in 1841 and abandoned c.&nbsp;1918; one of 32 [[navigable aqueduct]]s on the Erie Canal, it has since been restored.]]\n\nProblems developed but were quickly solved. Leaks developed along the entire length of the canal, but these were sealed using [[cement]] that hardened underwater ([[hydraulic cement]]). Erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to {{convert|4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe original design planned for an annual tonnage of 1.5&nbsp;million tons (1.36 million metric tons), but this was exceeded immediately. An ambitious program to improve the canal began in 1834. During this massive series of construction projects, known as the First Enlargement, the canal was widened from {{convert|40|to|70|ft|m}} and deepened from {{convert|4|to|7|ft|m}}. Locks were widened and/or rebuilt in new locations, and many new [[navigable aqueduct]]s were constructed. The canal was straightened and slightly re-routed in some stretches, resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original 1825 canal. The First Enlargement was completed in 1862, with further minor enlargements in later decades.\n\nToday, the reconfiguration of the canal created during the First Enlargement is commonly referred to as the \"Improved Erie Canal\" or the \"[[Old Erie Canal State Historic Park|Old Erie Canal]]\", to distinguish it from the canal's modern-day course. Existing remains of the 1825 canal abandoned during the Enlargement are sometimes referred to today as \"Clinton's Ditch\" (which was also the popular nickname for the entire Erie Canal project during its original 1817\u20131825 construction).\n\n[[File:Erie Canal, Lock 32.jpg|thumb|right|Upstream view of the downstream lock at Lock 32, [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford, New York]].]]\n\nAdditional feeder canals soon extended the Erie Canal into a system. These included the Cayuga-Seneca Canal south to the [[Finger Lakes]], the Oswego Canal from Three Rivers north to Lake Ontario at [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], and the Champlain Canal from [[Troy, New York|Troy]] north to Lake Champlain. From 1833 to 1877, the short Crooked Lake Canal connected [[Keuka Lake]] and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]. The [[Chemung Canal]] connected the south end of Seneca Lake to [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]] in 1833, and was an important route for Pennsylvania [[coal]] and [[timber]] into the canal system. The [[Chenango Canal]] in 1836 connected the Erie Canal at Utica to [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and caused a business boom in the [[Chenango River]] valley. The Chenango and Chemung canals linked the Erie with the [[Susquehanna River]] system. The [[Black River Canal]] connected the [[Black River (New York)|Black River]] to the Erie Canal at Rome and remained in operation until the 1920s. The [[Genesee Valley Canal]] was run along the [[Genesee River]] to connect with the [[Allegheny River]] at [[Olean, New York|Olean]], but the Allegheny section, which would have connected to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, was never built. The Genesee Valley Canal was later abandoned and became the route of the [[Genesee Valley Canal Railroad]].\n\nIn 1903 the New York State legislature authorized construction of the [[New York State Barge Canal]] as the \"Improvement of the Erie, the Oswego, the Champlain, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals\".<ref name=\"Whiteford\">{{Cite book |title=History of the Barge Canal of New York State |last=Whiteford |first=Noble E. |year=1922 |publisher=J.

Those cities and their states started projects to compete with the Erie Canal. In Pennsylvania, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] was a combined canal and railroad running west from Philadelphia to [[Pittsburgh]] on the [[Ohio River]], opened in 1834. In Maryland, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] ran west to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], also on the Ohio River, and was completed in 1853.\n\nOther competition was more direct. The [[Mohawk and Hudson Railroad]] opened in 1837, providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between Albany and Schenectady. Other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to Buffalo, and in 1842 a continuous line (which later became the [[New York Central Railroad]] and its [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] in 1853) was open the whole way to Buffalo. As the railroad served the same general route as the canal, but provided for faster travel, passengers soon switched to it. However, as late as 1852, the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in New York State combined; it continued to compete well with the railroads through 1902, when tolls were abolished.\n\nThe [[New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway]] was completed in 1884, as a route running closely parallel to both the canal and the [[New York Central Railroad]]. However, it went bankrupt and was acquired the next year by the New York Central.\n\n==Impact==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Rochester erie canal aqueduct circa 1890.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rochester, NY]] aqueduct circa 1890]]\nThe Erie Canal greatly lowered the cost of shipping between the Midwest and the Northeast, bringing much lower food costs to Eastern cities and allowing the East to economically ship machinery and manufactured goods to the Midwest. The canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of New York City, Buffalo and New York State. Its impact went much further, increasing trade throughout the nation by opening eastern and overseas markets to Midwestern farm products and by enabling migration to the West.<ref name=\"Taylor 1951\">{{cite book |title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860 |last=Taylor |first=George Rogers |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-87332-101-3 |pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHonAQAAIAAJ |year=1951 }}\n</ref><ref name=\"North1966\">\n{{cite book |title=The Economic Growth of the United States 1790\u20131860 |last=North|first=Douglas C. |authorlink= |year=1966 |publisher=W.

Tolls collected on freight had already exceeded the state's construction debt in its first year of official operation.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|52}} By 1828, import duties collected at the New York Customs House supported federal government operations and provided funds for all the expenses in Washington except the interest on the national debt.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fordham: A history of the Jesuit university of New York: 841\u20132003|last=Shelley|first=Thomas|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780823271511|location=New York|page=51|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvsmDAAAQBAJ}}</ref> Additionally, New York State's initial loan for the original canal had been paid by 1837.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|52}} Although it had been envisioned as primarily a commercial channel for freight boats, passengers also traveled on the canal's packet boats. In 1825 more than 40,000 passengers took advantage of the convenience and beauty of canal travel.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|52}} The canal's steady flow of tourists, businessmen and settlers lent it to uses never imagined by its initial sponsors. Evangelical preachers made their circuits of the upstate region, and the canal served as the last leg of the Underground Railroad ferrying runaway slaves to Buffalo near the Canada\u2013US border.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|53}} Aspiring merchants found that tourists were reliable customers. Vendors moved from boat to boat peddling items such as books, watches and fruit, while less scrupulous \"confidence men\" sold remedies for foot corns or passed off counterfeit bills.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|53}} Tourists were carried along the \"northern tour,\" which ultimately led to the popular honeymoon destination Niagara Falls, just north of Buffalo.\n\nConsisting of a massive stone aqueduct which carried boats over incredible cascades, Little Falls was one of the most popular stops for American and foreign tourists. This is shown in Scene 4 of William Dunlap's play ''A Trip to Niagara'', where he depicts the general preference of tourists to travel by canal so that they could experience a combination of artificial and natural sights.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|55}} Canal travel was, for many, an opportunity to take in the sublime and commune with nature. The play also reflects the less enthusiastic view of some who saw movement on the canal as tedious.\n\nNew ethnic Irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force. Earth extracted from the canal was transported to the New York City area and used as landfill in New York and New Jersey.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A plaque honoring the canal's construction is located in [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] in southern Manhattan.\n\nBecause so many immigrants traveled on the canal, many [[genealogist]]s have sought copies of canal passenger lists. Apart from the years 1827\u20131829, canal boat operators were not required to record passenger names or report them to the government, which, in this case, was the state of New York. Some passenger lists survive today in the New York State Archives, and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available.\n\nThe Canal also helped bind the still-new nation closer to Britain and Europe. Repeal of Britain's [[Corn Law]] resulted in a huge increase in exports of Midwestern wheat to Britain. Trade between the United States and Canada also increased as a result of the repeal and a reciprocity (free-trade) agreement signed in 1854. Much of this trade flowed along the Erie.\n\nIts success also prompted imitation: a rash of canal-building followed. Also, the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible. This led to an increased public esteem for practical education. [[Chicago]], among other [[Great Lakes]] cities, recognized the importance of the canal to its economy, and two [[Chicago Loop|West Loop]] streets are named \"Canal\" and \"Clinton\" (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton).\n\nConcern that erosion caused by logging in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]] could silt up the canal contributed to the creation in 1885 of another New York National Historic Landmark, the [[Adirondack Park]].\n\n[[File:Erie Canal Lift Bridge Lockport July 2010.JPG|thumb|right|Two \"low\" lift bridges in [[Lockport, New York]] July 2010.]]\nMany notable authors wrote about the canal, including [[Herman Melville]], [[Frances Trollope]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]] and the [[Marquis de&nbsp;Lafayette]], and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal. The popular song \"[[Low Bridge]]\" by [[Thomas S. Allen]] was written in 1905 to memorialize the canal's early heyday, when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines.\n\n==Sunday closing debate==\nThe New York State Legislature debated closing the locks of the Erie Canal on Sundays, when they convened in 1858. However, George Jeremiah and Dwight Bacheller, two of the bill's opponents, argued that the state had no right to stop canal traffic on the grounds that the Erie Canal and its tributaries had ceased to be wards of the state. The canal at its inception had been imagined as an extension of nature, an artificial river where there had been none. The canal succeeded by sharing more in common with lakes and seas than it had with public roads. Jeremiah and Bacheller argued, successfully, that just as it was unthinkable to halt oceangoing navigation on Sunday, it was so with the canal.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|172}}\n\n==20th century==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:BaldwinsvilleLock24.jpg|thumb|right|<!--max img sz-->The modern Erie Canal has 34&nbsp;locks, which are painted with the blue and gold colors of the [[New York State Canal System]].]]\nIn 1918, the Canal was replaced by the larger [[New York State Canal System|New York State Barge Canal]]. This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to [[river engineering|canalize]] rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca]], and [[Clyde River (New York)|Clyde]] rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of canalized rivers (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to {{convert|120|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep. The expansion allowed barges up to {{convert|2000|ST|t}} to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.\n\nThe new alignment began on the Hudson River at the border between Cohoes and [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]], where it ran northwest with five locks (the so-called \"Waterford Flight\"), running into the Mohawk River east of [[Crescent, New York|Crescent]]. The Waterford Flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world.<ref name=ASCE-RPI>{{cite web|title=Dedication of the Flight of Five Locks as a Civil Engineering Landmark (9/9/2012) |url=http://rpiasce.weebly.com/recent-asce-events.html |work=ASCE Rennselaer |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), RPI Chapter |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216071318/http://rpiasce.weebly.com/recent-asce-events.html |archivedate=December 16, 2013 }}</ref><!-- Previous interim reference should be improved --><ref name=\"Finch\" />{{rp|19}}<ref name=\"Williams\" />{{rp|267}}\n\n[[File:Sunset over the Erie Canal in North Tonawanda, NY..jpg|thumb|left|This photo shows the Gateway Harbor in North Tonawanda, NY about 1000 feet from the present day western terminus of the Erie Canal where it connects to the Niagara River.]]\n\nWhile the old Canal ran next to the Mohawk all the way to Rome, the new canal ran through the river, which was straightened or widened where necessary.<ref name=\"Finch\" />{{rp|13}} At [[Ilion, New York|Ilion]], the new canal left the river for good, but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with [[Fish Creek (New York)|Fish Creek]] just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.\n\nFrom Oneida Lake, the new canal ran west along the [[Oneida River]], with cutoffs to shorten the route. At [[Three Rivers, New York|Three Rivers]] the Oneida River turns northwest, and was deepened for the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario. The new Erie Canal turned south there along the Seneca River, which turns west near Syracuse and continues west to a point in the Montezuma Marsh ({{Coord|43.00296|N|76.73115|W}}). There the Cayuga and Seneca Canal continued south with the Seneca River, and the new Erie Canal again ran parallel to the old canal along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment, in some places running along the Clyde River, and in some places replacing the old canal. At [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]], southeast of Rochester, the canal turned west to run around the south side of Rochester, rather than through downtown. The canal crosses the [[Genesee River]] at the [[Genesee Valley Park]] ({{Coord|43.1215|N|77.6425|W}}), then rejoins the old path near [[North Gates, New York|North Gates]].\n\nFrom there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal, running west to Lockport. This reach of 64.2&nbsp;miles from Henrietta to Lockport is called \"the 60\u2011mile level\" since there are no locks and the water level rises only two feet over the entire segment. Diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal's level. It runs southwest to [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda]], where the new alignment discharges into the Niagara River, which is navigable upstream to the [[New York Barge Canal]]'s Black Rock Lock and thence to the Canal's original \"Western Terminus\" at Buffalo's [[Erie Canal Harbor|Inner Harbor]].\n\nThe growth of railroads and highways across the state, and the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the 20th century.\n\n===New York State Canal System===\nIn 1992, the New York State Barge Canal was renamed the [[New York State Canal System]] (including the Erie, [[Cayuga-Seneca Canal|Cayuga-Seneca]], Oswego, and Champlain canals) and placed under the newly created [[New York State Canal Corporation]], a subsidiary of the [[New York State Thruway|New York State Thruway Authority]]. While part of the Thruway, the canal system was operated using money generated by Thruway tolls.\n\n==21st century==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\n\nSince the 1990s, the canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic, although a small but growing amount of cargo traffic still uses it.\n\nToday, the [[Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor]] covers {{convert|524|mi|km}} of navigable water from Lake Champlain to the [[Capital District, New York|Capital Region]] and west to Buffalo. The area has a population of 2.7&nbsp;million: about 75% of Central and Western New York's population lives within {{convert|25|mi|km}} of the Erie Canal.\n\nThe Erie Canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from May through November each year. During winter, water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance. The Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain, and the [[Chambly Canal]], and [[Richelieu River]] in Canada form the [[Lakes to Locks Passage]], making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern Canada to the Erie Canal. In 2006 recreational boating fees were eliminated to attract more visitors.\n\nTravel on the canal's middle section (particularly in the Mohawk Valley) was severely hampered by flooding in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least $15 million.\n\nThere were some 42 commercial shipments on the canal in 2008, compared to 15 such shipments in 2007 and more than 33,000 shipments in 1855, the canal's peak year. The new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel. Canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo {{convert|514|mi}} on one gallon of diesel fuel, while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo {{convert|202|mi}} and a truck {{convert|59|mi}}. Canal barges can carry loads up to {{convert|3000|ST|LT}}, and are used to transport objects that would be too large for road or rail shipment.<ref name=\"NYTimes\" /> Today, the system is served by several commercial towing companies.<ref>[http://www.nyscanals.gov/corporation/commercial-shipping.html Commercial Shipping on the New York State Canal System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527100430/http://www.nyscanals.gov/corporation/commercial-shipping.html |date=May 27, 2010}}</ref> In 2012, the [[New York State Canal System]] (which consists of the Erie Canal and a few smaller canals) was used to ship 42,000 tons of cargo.<ref name = \"Benefit Report\">New York State Canal Corporation, [http://www.canals.ny.gov/economic-benefit-report.pdf Report on Economic Benefits of Non\u2010Tourism Use of the NYS Canal System]</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n| [[File:Erie Canal over Genesee River RochNY.jpg|thumb|upright|Erie Canal Aqueduct crossing the [[Genesee River]] in [[Rochester, New York]].

Ethanol is a [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], [[flammability|flammable]], colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It is a [[alcohol (drug)|psychoactive substance]] and is the principal type of alcohol found in [[alcoholic drink]]s.\n\nEthanol is naturally produced by the [[fermentation]] of [[sugar]]s by [[yeast]]s or via [[petrochemistry|petrochemical]] processes, and is most commonly consumed as a popular [[recreational drug]]. It also has medical applications as an [[antiseptic]] and [[disinfectant]]. The compound is widely used as a [[chemistry|chemical]] [[solvent]], either for scientific chemical testing or in [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of other [[organic compound]]s, and is a vital substance used across many different kinds of manufacturing industries.

Certain species of [[yeast]] (e.g., ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') [[metabolism|metabolize]] [[polysaccharide|sugar]], producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. The chemical equations below summarize the conversion:\n\n: [[glucose|{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}]] \u2192 2 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 2 CO<sub>2</sub>\n: [[sucrose|{{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}]] + {{chem|H|2|O}} \u2192 4 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 4 CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nFermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol. This process is carried out at around {{convert|35|-|40|C|F}}. Toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing; higher concentrations, therefore, are obtained by [[Fortified wine|fortification]] or [[distillation]]. The most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18% ethanol by volume.\n\nTo produce ethanol from starchy materials such as [[cereal grain]]s, the [[starch]] must first be converted into sugars. In brewing [[beer]], this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or [[malt]], which produces the [[enzyme]] [[amylase]]. When the malted grain is [[mashing|mashed]], the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars.\n\n====Cellulose====\n{{Main article|Cellulosic ethanol}}\n\nSugars for [[ethanol fermentation]] can be obtained from [[cellulose]]. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as [[corncob]]s, [[straw]], and [[sawdust]], into renewable energy resources.

Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the CH band at 2900&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the CH band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the [[Beer-Lambert law]]. Alternatively, by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product, using a [[hydrometer]], the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content. This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry.\n\n==Purification==\n\n===Distillation===\nEthylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol\u2013water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. [[Fractional distillation]] at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an [[azeotrope]] with a boiling point of {{convert|78.1|C|F}}, and ''cannot'' be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as [[benzene]], [[cyclohexane]], or [[heptane]], allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.<ref name=\"ullmann\">{{cite book | first1 = Naim | last1 = Kosaric | first2 = Zdravko | last2 = Duvnjak | first3 = Adalbert | last3 = Farkas | first4 = Hermann | last4 = Sahm | first5 = Stephanie | last5 = Bringer-Meyer | first6 = Otto | last6 = Goebel | first7 = Dieter | last7 = Mayer | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Ethanol | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | pages = 1\u201372 | year = 2011 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a09_587.pub2 | isbn = 9783527306732 }}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nAt pressures less than atmospheric pressure, the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures, and at pressures less than 70&nbsp;[[torr]] (9.333&nbsp;kPa), there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture. While vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical, pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research. In this technique, a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6% azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Molecular sieves and desiccants===\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n\nApart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by addition of a [[desiccant]], such as [[molecular sieves]], [[cellulose]], and [[cornmeal]].

The zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot [[carbon dioxide]]. Cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated, but where ethanol is made from grain, they are often available at low cost. Absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene, and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations.\n\n===Membranes and reverse osmosis===\nMembranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process. This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode. Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.\n\n===Other techniques===\nA variety of other techniques have been discussed, including the following:<ref name=\"ullmann\" />\n\n* Salting using [[potassium carbonate]] to exploit its insolubility will cause a phase separation with ethanol and water.

There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If [[azeotropic distillation]] is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene).<ref>{{cite book|first=Raj K. |last=Bansal |last2=Bernthsen |first2=August | name-list-format = vanc |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1B6ijcTkD5EC|page=402}}|year=2003|publisher=New Age International Limited|isbn=978-81-224-1459-2|pages=402\u2013}}</ref> Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption.

Many ethanol reactions occur at its [[hydroxyl]] group.\n\n===Ester formation===\nIn the presence of acid catalysts, ethanol reacts with [[carboxylic acid]]s to produce ethyl [[ester]]s and water:\n:[[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 [[ester|RCOOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThis reaction, which is conducted on large scale industrially, requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as [[saponification]] because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. [[Diethyl sulfate]] and [[triethyl phosphate]] are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and [[phosphorus pentoxide]] respectively. [[Diethyl sulfate]] is a useful ethylating agent in [[organic synthesis]]. [[Ethyl nitrite]], prepared from the reaction of ethanol with [[sodium nitrite]] and sulfuric acid, was formerly used as a [[diuretic]].\n\n===Dehydration===\nStrong acid desiccants cause the partial dehydration of ethanol to form [[diethyl ether]] and other byproducts. If the dehydration temperature exceeds around {{convert|160|C|F}}, full dehydration will occur and [[ethylene]] will be the main product.\n:2 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH \u2192 [[diethyl ether|CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O (ca. 120 \u00b0C)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH \u2192 [[ethylene|H2C=CH2]] + H<sub>2</sub>O (above 160 \u00b0C)\n\n===Combustion===\nComplete [[combustion]] of ethanol forms [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]:\n:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (l) + 3 O<sub>2</sub> (g) \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O (l); \u2212\u0394H<sub>c</sub> = 1371&nbsp;kJ/mol<ref>{{cite journal|title=Heats of Formation of Simple Organic Molecules | last = Rossini | first = Frederick D. | name-list-format = vanc  |journal=Ind.

In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success. He left the Yardbirds on the day that \"For Your Love\" went public, a move that left the band without its lead guitarist and most accomplished member. Clapton suggested fellow guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] to be his replacement, but Page declined out of loyalty to Clapton,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp |title=Trouser Press : Jimmy Page interview transcript |publisher=Iem.ac.ru |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> putting [[Jeff Beck]] forward.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/>\nBeck and Page played together in the Yardbirds for a while, but Beck, Page, and Clapton were never in the group together.

In June, Clapton was invited to jam with [[Jimmy Page]], recording a number of tracks that would be retroactively credited to [[All-Stars (band)|The Immediate All-Stars]]. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a [[side project]] with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Steve Winwood]] among others, recording only a few tracks under the name [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit. Although Clapton gained world fame for his playing on the influential album, ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton|Blues Breakers \u2013 John Mayall \u2013 With Eric Clapton]]'', this album was not released until he had left the band for the last time in July 1966.\n\nHaving swapped his [[Fender Telecaster]] and [[Vox AC30]] amplifier for a 1960 [[Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul Standard]] guitar and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall amplifier]], Clapton's sound and playing inspired the famous [[slogan]] \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Clapton is God]]\", spray-painted by an unknown admirer on a wall in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] in 1967.<ref>\n{{cite news\n | first= Neil\n | last=McCormick\n | title= Just how good is Eric Clapton?\n | date= 24 July 2015\n | agency= The Telegraph\n | location= London\n | work= The Daily Telegraph\n | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11501274/Just-how-good-is-Eric-Clapton.html\n}}\n</ref>\nThe [[graffiti]] was captured in a now-famous photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall.

They recorded ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' in New York from 11 to 15 May 1967. Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (\"[[I Feel Free]]\") to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (\"[[Spoonful]]\"). ''Disraeli Gears'' featured Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]].\n\n[[File:The Fool guitar (replica).jpg|thumb|upright=.65|Clapton's [[The Fool (guitar)|The Fool guitar]] ''(replica shown)'', with its bright artwork and famous \"woman tone\", was symbolic of the 1960s psychedelic rock era.]]\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the U.S. and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" ({{Numero|5}}, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" ({{Numero|6}}, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" ({{Numero|28}}, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson's]] \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream was hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining U.S. tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.<ref>Welch, Chris: \"Cream\" (2000), page 131</ref>\n\nCream's farewell album, ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]'', featuring live performances recorded at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], Los Angeles, {{nowrap|19 October}} 1968, was released shortly after Cream disbanded; it also featured the studio single \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\", co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became close friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" from the Beatles' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' (1968). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'', in 1968, became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton would go largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the [[Concert for George]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm|title=Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=25 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording/filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting the others to consider replacing him with Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to [[John Lennon]].<ref>Elliot J.

It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 4.</ref> During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by [[The Band]] and their album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', saying, \"What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity\u2014or ''pseudo''-virtuosity\u2014thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album, ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album features the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and who went crazy because he could not marry her.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William |last=McKeen |title=Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology |publisher=W.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd\u2014who was also producing the Allmans\u2014invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others), and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad\". In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\", and \"Keep on Growing\". Duane returned to record \"I am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\", and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute to Hendrix. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, the ''Layla'' album received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amidst a veritable blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nA second record was in the works when a clashing of egos took place and Clapton walked, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle would remain Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it would be 2003 before Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again (Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show). Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], who was an undiagnosed [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and years later murdered his mother during a [[Psychosis|psychotic episode]]. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remains today.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/>\n\n====Personal problems and early solo success====\nClapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>Marc Roberty, Chris Charlesworth (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qpvlUrpH_xoC&pg=PA67&dq=eric+clapton+DRUGS+1970s&hl=en&ei=0K0aTdy1DMiAhQeRqaC4Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false The complete guide to the music of Eric Clapton] p.67.

With this band Clapton recorded ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of \"[[I Shot the Sheriff]]\" was Clapton's first number one hit and was important in bringing [[reggae]] and the music of [[Bob Marley]] to a wider audience. The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood.

A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against doctors' orders. Working with Tom Dowd, he produced what he thought as his \"most forced\" album to date, ''[[Money and Cigarettes]]''.

In 2006 they performed at the Highclere Castle, in aid of the Countryside Alliance, playing two set pieces of \"[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" and \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\".

The horn-peppered \"Run\" echoed Collins' \"[[Sussudio]]\" and other work, while \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with [[Tina Turner]]) and \"Miss You\" continued Clapton's more angry sound.

'''\u00e6tiology''') is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''aitiolog\u00eda'', \"giving a reason for\" ({{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}, ''ait\u00eda'', \"cause\"; and {{lang|grc|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-log\u00eda]]'').<ref>{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}</ref>  More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.<ref>{{AHDict|etiology}}</ref> The word is commonly used in [[medicine]], (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in [[philosophy]], but also in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[geography]], [[spatial analysis]], [[theology]], and [[biology]], in reference to the causes or origins of various [[phenomena]].\n\nIn the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, [[myth]]s often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or [[origin myth]], is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, [[Virgil]]'s [[Aenead]] is a [[national myth]] written to explain and glorify the origins of the [[Roman Empire]]. In [[theology]], many religions have [[creation myths]] explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.\n\n==Medicine==\n{{Main|Cause (medicine)}}\nIn medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more  factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, [[scurvy]] was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]] suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet.  Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat [[sauerkraut]], a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he [[inferred]] that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of [[vitamin C]] in a sailor's diet.\n\n== Mythology ==\n{{Main|Origin myth}}\nAn etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}''),  propelled [[Crete|Cretans]] over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' (\"womb\"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term \"[[Amazons|Amazon]]\", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Virgil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son [[Ascanius]], also called Iulus. The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice [[trick at Mecone]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Backstory]]\n* [[Bradford Hill criteria]]\n* [[Creation myth]]\n* [[Just-so story]]\n* ''[[Just So Stories]]''\n* [[Pathology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|etiology}}\n\n{{Time in philosophy}}\n\n[[Category:Causality]]\n[[Category:Creation myths]]\n[[Category:Mythography]]\n[[Category:Mythology]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of science]]", "sha1": "rfj2f72m3micxvd2ywdluq3i0j921wm"}}, {"title": "Ehime-Maru", "ns": "0", "id": "10057", "redirect": {"title": "Ehime Maru and USS Greeneville collision"}, "revision": {"id": "145147610", "parentid": "105851135", "timestamp": "2007-07-17T03:25:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cla68", "id": "478073"}, "comment": "fixed redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Ehime Maru and USS Greeneville collision]]", "sha1": "boxropw2uby7s1dxkp9ths5b4jdbjbu"}}, {"title": "Epistles", "ns": "0", "id": "10058", "redirect": {"title": "Epistle"}, "revision": {"id": "783862382", "parentid": "772129239", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:47:33Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Epistle]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from plural}}\n}}", "sha1": "9zlhs4e4y7jlyxj6vgi3t8n4wp7otvb"}}, {"title": "Epistle to Ephesians", "ns": "0", "id": "10061", "redirect": {"title": "Epistle to the Ephesians"}, "revision": {"id": "528568495", "parentid": "15907900", "timestamp": "2012-12-18T01:49:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Epistle_to_the_Ephesians]]", "sha1": "ls6ffh0e3tsmvs9o48bzsd4p6xkumxd"}}, {"title": "Epistle to the Phillipians", "ns": "0", "id": "10062", "redirect": {"title": "Epistle to the Philippians"}, "revision": {"id": "419389296", "parentid": "15907901", "timestamp": "2011-03-18T00:42:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision from [[:nost:Epistle to the Phillipians]]: import old edit, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Epistle to the Philippians]]", "sha1": "jbuevd2vaho33q0p4daedhpzxf9f724"}}, {"title": "Epistle to Philippians", "ns": "0", "id": "10063", "redirect": {"title": "Epistle to the Philippians"}, "revision": {"id": "529146935", "parentid": "15907902", "timestamp": "2012-12-21T18:36:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Epistle_to_the_Philippians]]", "sha1": "9rign6ika4cekn0b8dsj4umt5qegnzj"}}, {"title": "Empirical formula", "ns": "0", "id": "10065", "revision": {"id": "847444468", "parentid": "833508283", "timestamp": "2018-06-25T12:04:47Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2405:204:9115:9493:F94:14CD:855B:BCF8"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|analytical chemistry|observation rather than theory|Empirical relationship}}\nIn [[chemistry]], the '''empirical formula''' of a [[chemical compound]] is the simplest positive [[integer]] [[ratio]] of [[atom]]s present in a compound.<ref>{{GoldBookRef | title = Empirical formula | file = E02063}}</ref> A simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of [[sulphur monoxide]], or SO, would simply be SO, as is the empirical formula of [[disulfur dioxide]], S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This means that [[sulfur monoxide]] and [[disulfur dioxide]], both compounds of [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]], will have the same empirical formula. However, their [[chemical formula]]s, which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound, may not be the same. \n\nAn empirical formula makes no mention of the arrangement or number of atoms. It is standard for many [[ionic compound]]s, like [[calcium chloride]] (CaCl<sub>2</sub>), and for [[macromolecule]]s, such as [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThe [[molecular formula]], on the other hand, shows the number of each type of atom in a molecule. The [[structural formula]] shows the arrangement of the molecule. It is also possible for different types of compounds to have equal empirical formulas.\n\nSamples are analyzed in specific [[elemental analysis]] tests to determine what percent of a particular element the sample is composed of.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* [[Glucose]] ({{Format molecular formula|C6H12O6}}), [[ribose]] ({{Format molecular formula|C5H10O5}}), [[acetic acid]] ({{Format molecular formula|C2H4O2}}), and [[formaldehyde]] ({{Format molecular formula|CH2O}}) all have different molecular formulas but the same empirical formula: {{Format molecular formula|CH2O}}. This is the actual molecular formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number of atoms, ribose has five times the number of atoms, and glucose has six times the number of atoms.\n* The chemical compound [[n-hexane]] has the structural formula {{Format molecular formula|CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3}}, which shows that it has 6 [[carbon]] atoms arranged in a chain, and 14 [[hydrogen]] atoms. Hexane's molecular formula is {{Format molecular formula|C6H14}}, and its empirical formula is {{Format molecular formula|C3H7}}, showing a C:H ratio of 3:7.\n\n==Calculation example==\nA chemical analysis of a sample of [[methyl acetate]] provides the following elemental data: 48.64% [[carbon]] (C), 8.16% [[hydrogen]] (H), and 43.20% [[oxygen]] (O). For the purposes of determining empirical formulas assume that we have 100 grams of the compound. If this is the case, the percentages will be equal to the mass of each element in grams.\n\n:Step 1: Change each [[percentage]] to an expression of the mass of each element in grams. That is, 48.64% C becomes 48.64 g C, 8.16% H becomes 8.16 g H, and 43.20% O becomes 43.20 g O.\n\n:Step 2: Convert the amount of each element in grams to its amount in moles.\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{48.64 \\mbox{ g C}}{1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1 \\mbox{ mol }}{12.01 \\mbox{ g C}}\\right) = 4.049\\ \\text{mol}</math>\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{8.16 \\mbox{ g H}}{1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1 \\mbox{ mol }}{1.008 \\mbox{ g H}}\\right) = 8.095\\ \\text{mol}</math>\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{43.20 \\mbox{ g O}}{1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1 \\mbox{ mol }}{16.00 \\mbox{ g O}}\\right) = 2.7\\ \\text{mol}</math>\n\n:Step 3: Divide each of the resulting values by the smallest of these values (2.7)\n:<math>\\frac{4.049 \\mbox{ mol }}{2.7 \\mbox{ mol }} = 1.5</math>\n:<math>\\frac{8.095 \\mbox{ mol }}{2.7 \\mbox{ mol }} = 3</math>\n:<math>\\frac{2.7 \\mbox{ mol }}{2.7 \\mbox{ mol }} = 1</math>\n\n:Step 4: If necessary, multiply these numbers by integers in order to get whole numbers; if an operation is done to one of the numbers, it must be done to all of them.\n:<math>1.5 \\times 2 = 3</math>\n:<math>3 \\times 2 = 6</math>\n:<math>1 \\times 2 = 2</math>\n\nThus, the empirical formula of methyl acetate is {{Format molecular formula|C3H6O2}}. This formula also happens to be methyl acetate's molecular formula.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Chemical formulas]]\n[[Category:Analytical chemistry]]", "sha1": "7qxehsf77ayybcqletoi610rqz5c0f4"}}, {"title": "Episcopalians", "ns": "0", "id": "10066", "redirect": {"title": "Anglicanism"}, "revision": {"id": "805471158", "parentid": "759518645", "timestamp": "2017-10-15T16:39:57Z", "contributor": {"ip": "142.160.131.202"}, "comment": "Americans are not the only Anglicans to be called Episcopalians (see, e.g., [[Scottish Episcopal Church]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Anglicanism]]", "sha1": "g64d9igl2bk50c975zfxlqh7fh1s2tl"}}, {"title": "Episcopal polity", "ns": "0", "id": "10067", "revision": {"id": "865529291", "parentid": "865529272", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T13:48:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/89.19.67.63|89.19.67.63]] to version by Walter G\u00f6rlitz.

(The word \"bishop\" derives, via the [[British Latin]] and [[Vulgar Latin]] term ''*ebiscopus''/''*biscopus'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}} ''ep\u00edskopos'' meaning \"overseer\".) It is the structure used by many of the major [[Christian Church]]es and [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, such as the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages.\n\nChurches with an episcopal [[polity]] are governed by bishops, practicing their authorities in the [[diocese]]s and [[Episcopal Conference|conference]]s or [[synod]]s. Their leadership is both [[sacrament]]al and constitutional; as well as performing [[ordination]]s, [[confirmation]]s, and [[consecration]]s, the bishop supervises the [[clergy]] within a local jurisdiction and is the representative both to secular structures and within the hierarchy of the church. Bishops are considered to derive their authority from an unbroken, personal [[apostolic succession]] from the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]]. Bishops with such authority are said to represent the [[historical episcopate]] or historic episcopate. Churches with this type of government usually believe that the Church requires episcopal government as described in the New Testament (see  [http://www.usccb.org/bible/1timothy/3 1 Timothy 3] and [http://www.usccb.org/bible/2timothy/1 2 Timothy 1]). In some systems, bishops may be subject to bishops holding a higher office (variously called [[archbishop]]s, [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s, or [[patriarch]]s, depending upon the tradition).  They also meet in councils or [[synods]]. These gatherings, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, usually make important decisions, though the [[synod]] or council may also be purely advisory.\n\nFor much of the [[recorded history|written history]] of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches are now organized by either [[Congregationalist polity|congregational]] or [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] church polities, both descended from the writings of [[John Calvin]], a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] precipitated by [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] of [[Martin Luther]].\n\n==Overview of episcopal churches==\n[[File:Chartres 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The government of a bishop is typically symbolized by a cathedral church, such as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chartres|bishops]]'s [[episcopal see|see]] at [[Chartres Cathedral]].]]\nThe definition of the word ''episcopal'' has variation among Christian traditions. There are subtle differences in governmental principles among episcopal churches at the present time. To some extent the separation of episcopal churches can be traced to these differences in [[ecclesiology]], that is, their theological understanding of church and church governance. For some, \"episcopal churches\" are churches that use a hierarchy of bishops that regard themselves as being in an unbroken, personal [[apostolic succession]].\n\n\"Episcopal\" is also commonly used to distinguish between the various organizational structures of [[Christian denomination|denominations]].  For instance, \"Presbyterian\" ({{lang-el|'\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}}, presb\u00edtes) is used to describe a church governed by a hierarchy of assemblies of elected [[Elder (religious)|elders]], referred to as [[Presbyterian polity]]. Similarly, \"episcopal\" is used to describe a church governed by bishops. Self-governed local congregations, governed neither by elders nor bishops, are usually described as \"[[Congregational polity|congregational]]\".\n\nMore specifically, the capitalized appellation \"Episcopal\" is applied to several churches historically based within [[Anglicanism]] (\"Episcopalianism\"), including those still in communion with the [[Church of England]].\n\nUsing these definitions, examples of specific episcopal churches include:\n* The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]\n* The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n* The [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches\n* The [[Assyrian Church of the East]]\n* The Churches of the [[Anglican Communion]]\n* The [[Old Catholic]] churches\n* Numerous smaller [[Catholic Church (disambiguation)|\"catholic\" churches]]\n* Certain national churches of the [[Lutheran]] confession\n* The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]\n* The [[United Methodist Church]]\n\nSome [[Lutheran]] churches practice congregational polity or a form of presbyterian polity.<ref>Encyclopedia of Religion and Society, William H. Swatos, Jr. Editor [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Lutharanism.htm Lutheranism] Hartford Institute for Religion Research, Hartford Seminary.  Retrieved on September 4, 2006.</ref> Others, including the [[Church of Sweden]], practice episcopal polity; the Church of Sweden also counts its bishops among the [[historical episcopate|historic episcopate]] as do some American Lutheran churches like the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]], [[Lutheran Orthodox Church]], [[Lutheran Church - International]], and the [[Lutheran Episcopal Communion]].\n\nMany [[Methodist]] churches (see The [[United Methodist Church]], among others) retain the form and function of episcopal polity, although in a modified form, called [[connexionalism]]. Since all trace their ordinations to an Anglican priest, [[John Wesley]], it is generally considered that their bishops do not share in apostolic succession, though United Methodists still affirm that their bishops share in the historic episcopate.\n\n==Before the Great Schism==\n{{Roman Catholicism}}\n{{main|Bishop#History}}\nAll orthodox Christians were in churches with an episcopal government, that is, one Church under local bishops and regional [[Patriarch]]s. Writing between ca. 85 and 110, St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]], Patriarch of Antioch, was the earliest of the Church fathers to define the importance of episcopal government. Assuming Ignatius' view was the Apostolic teaching and practice, the line of succession was unbroken and passed through the four ancient Patriarchal sees (those local churches known to be founded by apostles), Rome, Jerusalem, Antioch and Alexandria. Rome was the leading Patriarchate of the ancient four by virtue of its founding by Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and their martyrdom there, not to mention being the political center of the Roman empire at the time. Some organizations (e.g. the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]), though aloof from the political wranglings of imperial Christianity, nevertheless also practiced episcopal polity.\n\nShortly after the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] legalized Christianity in 321, he also constructed an elaborate second capital of the Roman Empire located at [[Byzantium]] and renamed it [[Constantinople]], in 324. The single Roman Empire was divided between these two autonomous administrative centers, Roman and Constantinopolitan, West and East, Latin speaking and Greek speaking. This remained the status quo through the fourth century.  A deep chasm developed between the East and West, becoming critical around 350, known as the Arian, or Nicene controversy.  The Eastern Christian Churches were thought by Constantine to believe against the Trinity; that Christ was lesser than God.  Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers, France, believed that the Eastern Church should be given the opportunity to, at least, be educated on the subject. Constantine, in his wisdom, and upset by disagreement, banished Hilary to the East.  Hilary perfected his Greek language skills while in exile, and determined the great divide between Rome and the East was actually not a disagreement at all, and was merely a linguistic ignorance on the part of his Latin speaking contemporaries.  This truth became known in the West, though some differences lingered. [[Hilary of Poitiers]] later became St. Hilary, Doctor of the Church, for exposing the true Christian beliefs of the Eastern Church.  Many of Hilary's writings were lost to time.\n\nIn the fifth century, Pope Dioscorus, the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], rejected certain Christological dogmas promulgated by the [[Council of Chalcedon]], and as a result, the Oriental Orthodox churches split from the rest; however they continued the episcopal tradition, and today in fact there is dialog between the various orthodox churches over whether the schism was due to real differences or simply translation failures. \n\nAlso during the fifth century, the Western Roman Empire declined and was overrun by German and Frankish peoples.  Although the city of Rome was in ruins, distant from the seat of secular power, and constantly harassed by invaders, the Roman Patriarchate remained the center of the Western or Latin Church. Claiming the ancient [[primacy of Peter]] and the title of \"[[Apostolic See]]\", it remained the last [[ecclesiastical court|court of episcopal appeal]] in serious matters for the whole Church, East and West. However, the center of the civilized Roman world had shifted definitively to Constantinople, or [[New Rome]], the capital of the Greek speaking Empire.  Along with this shift, the effective administration of the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire also shifted. This practical eminence of Constantinople in the East is evident, first at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] 381, and then ecumenically at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.\n\nBeginning with [[John the Faster]] (John IV, 582-595), the Bishop of Constantinople  adopted as a formal title for himself the by then customary honorific [[Ecumenical patriarch|Ecumenical Patriarch]] (\"pre-eminent father for the civilized world\") over the strong objections of Rome, a title based on the political prestige of Constantinople and its economic and cultural centrality in the Empire.  In the following years, Rome's appeals to the East were based on the unique authority of the [[Apostolic See]] and the [[primacy of Peter]], over the powers of councils as defended by the East (councils, for example, had endorsed that lofty title which Rome contested).\n\nThe sometimes subtle differences between Eastern and Western conceptions of authority and its exercise produced a gradually widening rift between the Churches which continued with some occasional relief throughout the following centuries until the final rupture of the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] (marked by two dates: 16 July 1054 and the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439).\n\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Pope Pius IX]] convened the [[First Vatican Council]] that approved the dogma of Pope as the visible head of the church, prime bishop over a hierarchy of clergy and believers<ref>Vatican I, Session 4, 1870.

[http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/20ecume3.htm Daily Catholic Online edition] retrieved on September 1, 2006.</ref>]]\n\n==Catholic Church==\n{{Main|Bishop (Roman Catholic Church)}}\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] has an episcopate, with the [[Pope]], who is the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], at the top. The Catholic Church considers that juridical oversight over the Church is not a power that derives from human beings, but strictly from the authority of Christ, which was given to his twelve [[apostle]]s.  The [[See of Rome]], as the unbroken line of apostolic authority descending from St. Peter (the \"prince and head of the apostles\"), is a visible sign and instrument of communion among the college of bishops and therefore also of the local churches around the world. In communion with the worldwide [[college of bishops]], the Pope has all legitimate juridical and teaching authority over the whole Church.  This authority given by Christ to St. Peter and the apostles is transmitted from one generation to the next by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], through the [[laying on of hands]] from the Apostles to the bishops, in unbroken succession.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox Church==\nThe conciliar idea of episcopal government continues in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In Eastern Orthodoxy, all [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[primate (bishop)|primates]] are seen as collectively gathering around Christ, with other archbishops and bishops gathering around them, and so forth, in a model called \"conciliar hierarchy\". This is based in part on the vision in the [[book of Revelation]] of the 24 elders gathered around the throne of Christ, who are believed to represent the 12 patriarchs of Israel and the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ. There is no single Patriarch with exclusive authority comparable to the Pope in Rome. However, the Patriarch of Constantinople (now Istanbul) is seen as the ''[[primus inter pares]]'', the \"first among equals\" of the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\n==Oriental Orthodox churches==\nThe [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]] affirm the ideas of apostolic succession and episcopal government. Within each national Church, the bishops form a holy [[synod]] to which even the Patriarch is subject. The [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] traces its [[apostolic succession]] to St. Peter and recognises Antioch as the original [[See of St. Peter]]. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] traces its lineage to the Apostle Bartholomew. The [[Indian Orthodox Church]] traces its lineage to the Apostle Thomas. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] received its lines of succession through the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] in the fifth century.\n\nBoth the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Greek]] and Coptic Orthodox Churches each recognise their own Pope of Alexandria ([[Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa]], and [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] respectively), both of whom trace their apostolic succession back to the [[Mark the Evangelist]].<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of an ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 AD. \"Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity\", Otto F.A. Meinardus, p. 28.</ref> There are official ongoing efforts in recent times to heal this ancient breach. Already, the two recognize each other's [[baptism]]s, [[chrismation]]s, and [[marriage]]s, making intermarriage much easier.\n\n==Church of the East==\nHistorically, the [[Church of the East]] has traced its episcopal succession to St. Thomas the Apostle. Currently the bishops of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] continue to maintain its apostolic succession.\n\n==Anglican Communion==\n{{Anglicanism}}\n[[Anglicanism]] is the most prominent of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] traditions to lay claim to the historic episcopate through [[apostolic succession]] in terms comparable to the various Roman Catholic and Orthodox Communions. Anglicans assert unbroken episcopal succession in and through the [[Church of England]] back to [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine of Canterbury]] and to the first century [[Roman province]] of [[Roman province of Britannia|Britannia]]. While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the [[Synod of Whitby]], the church in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.<ref>Marcus Holden and Andrew Pinsent, The Catholic Gift to Civilisation (London: CTS), p.13ff</ref>\n\nThe legislation of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] effectively establishing the independence from Rome of the Church of England, did not alter its constitutional or pastoral structures. [[Royal supremacy]] was exercised through the extant legal structures of the church, whose leaders were bishops. Episcopacy was thus seen as a given of the Reformed ''Ecclesia Anglicana'', and a foundation in the institution's appeal to ancient and apostolic legitimacy. What did change was that bishops were now seen to be ministers of the Crown for the spiritual government of its subjects. The influence of [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] was crucial to an evolution in this understanding in which bishops came to be seen in their more traditional role as ones who delegate to the [[presbyterate]] inherited powers, act as pastors to presbyters, and holding a particular teaching office with respect to the wider church.\n\n[[File:The Most Reverend Paul Kwong.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Paul Kwong]], Anglican Archbishop and Primate of Hong Kong]]\nAnglican opinion has differed as to the way in which episcopal government is ''de jure divino'' (by the [[Divine Right of Kings]]).  On the one hand, the seventeenth century divine, [[John Cosin]], held that episcopal authority is ''jure divino'', but that it stemmed from \"apostolic practice and the customs of the Church...[not] absolute precept that either Christ or His Apostles gave about it\" (a view maintained also by Hooker).<ref>Cosin, ''Works'', Vol. IV (Oxford, 1855), p. 402</ref> In contrast, [[Lancelot Andrewes]] and others held that episcopal government is derived from Christ via the apostles.  Regardless, both parties viewed the episcopacy as bearing the apostolic function of oversight, which both includes, and derives from the power of ordination, and is normative for the governance of the church.  The practice of apostolic succession both ensures the legitimacy of the church's mission and establishes the unity, communion, and continuity of the local church with the universal church.  This formulation, in turn, laid the groundwork for an independent view of the church as a \"sacred society\" distinct from civil society, which was so crucial for the development of local churches as non-established entities outside England, and gave direct rise to the [[Catholic Revival]] and [[disestablishmentarianism]] within England.\n\nFunctionally, Anglican episcopal authority is expressed [[synod]]ically, although individual provinces may accord their [[primate (bishop)|primate]] with more or less authority to act independently.  Called variously \"synods,\" \"councils,\" or \"conventions,\" they meet under episcopal chairmanship.  In many jurisdictions, conciliar resolutions that have been passed require episcopal assent or consent to take force.  Seen in this way, Anglicans often speak of \"the bishop-in-synod\" as the force and authority of episcopal governance.  Such conciliar authority extends to the standard areas of doctrine, [[church discipline|discipline]], and worship, but in these regards is limited by Anglicanism's tradition of the limits of authority.  Those limits are expressed in Article XXI of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of Religion, ratified in 1571 (significantly, just as the [[Council of Trent]] was drawing to a close), which held that \"General Councils...may err, and sometimes have erred...wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.\"  Hence, Anglican jurisdictions have traditionally been conservative in their approach to either innovative doctrinal development or in encompassing actions of the church as doctrinal (see [[lex orandi, lex credendi]]).\n\nAnglican synodical government, though varied in expression, is characteristically representative. Provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]], their [[ecclesiastical province]]s and [[diocese]]s are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the [[presbyterate]] and [[laity]]. The spread of increasingly [[democracy|democratic]] forms of representative governance has its origin in the formation of the first General Conventions of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|American Episcopal Church]] in the 1780s, which established a \"House of Bishops\" and a \"House of Deputies\". In many jurisdictions, there is also a third, clerical House. Resolutions may be voted on jointly or by each House, in the latter case requiring passage in all Houses to be adopted by the particular council.\n\nThere is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition's common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the [[episcopal see|See]] of [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]], along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the [[Lambeth Conference]]s of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867. These conferences, though they propose and pass resolutions, are strictly consultative, and the intent of the resolutions are to provide guideposts for Anglican jurisdictions\u2014not direction. The Conferences also express the function of the episcopate to demonstrate the ecumenical and Catholic nature of the church.\n\nThe [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] traces [[History of the Scottish Episcopal Church|its history]] back to the origins of Christianity in Scotland, and during the 16th century [[Scottish Reformation]] became a distinct church from the presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]] which rejected episcopal government. The Scottish Episcopal Church was formally incorporated in 1712, and it more recently became part of the [[Anglican Communion]].\n\nChurches that are members of the Anglican Communion are episcopal churches in polity, and some are named \"Episcopal\". However, some churches that self-identify as Anglican do not belong to the Anglican Communion, and not all episcopally-governed churches are Anglican.  The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Old Catholic Church]]es (in full communion with, but not members of, the Anglican Communion), and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]] are recognized, and also their bishops, by [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].\n\n==American Methodist churches==\n{{further|Connexionalism}}\nAs an offshoot of [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism|Methodist churches]] often use episcopal polity for historical as well as practical reasons, albeit to limited use. Methodists often use the term ''[[connexionalism]]'' or ''connexional polity'' in addition to \"episcopal\". Nevertheless, the powers of the Methodist episcopacy can be relatively strong and wide-reaching compared to traditional conceptions of episcopal polity.  For example, in the [[United Methodist Church]], bishops are elected for life, can serve up to two terms in a specific conference (three if special permission is given), are responsible for ordaining and appointing clergy to pastor churches, perform many administrative duties, preside at the annual sessions of the regional Conferences and at the quadrennial meeting of the worldwide General Conference, have authority for teaching and leading the church on matters of social and doctrinal import, and serve to represent the denomination in ecumenical gatherings. United Methodist bishops in the United States serve in their appointed conferences, being moved to a new \"Episcopal Area\" after 8 (or 12) years, until their mandated retirement at the end of the quadrenium following their sixty-sixth birthday.<ref>[http://www.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=21&mid=5860 Still in Production]. UMC.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.</ref>\nBritish Methodism holds that all ordained ministers are equal in terms of spirituality. However, for practical management lines are drawn into President of Conference, Chair of District, Superintendent Minister, Minister. However, all are ministers.\n\n==Episcopal government in other denominations==\n\nThe [[Reformed Church of Hungary]], and the [[Lutheran church]]es in [[continental Europe]] may sometimes be called \"episcopal\".  In these latter cases, the form of government is not radically different from the [[presbyterian]] form, except that their councils of bishops have hierarchical [[jurisdiction]] over the local ruling bodies to a greater extent than in most [[Presbyterian]] and other [[Reformed churches]]. As mentioned, the Lutheran Church in Sweden and Finland are exceptions, claiming apostolic succession in a pattern somewhat like the Anglican churches.  Otherwise, forms of polity are not mandated in the Lutheran churches, as it is not regarded as having doctrinal significance. [[Old World]] Lutheranism, for historical reasons, has tended to adopt [[Erastian]] theories of episcopal authority (by which church authority is to a limited extent sanctioned by secular government).  In the United States, the Lutheran churches tend to adopt a form of government more comparable to [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]]. A small minority of [[Episcopal Baptists]] exists. \n\nMost [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] churches of the [[plain dress]] tradition follow an episcopal system, at least in name. Congregational governance is strongly emphasized, and each congregation elects its pastor. Bishops enforce inter-congregational unity and may discipline pastors for breaking from traditional norms.\n\nAlthough it never uses the term, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is episcopal, rather than presbyterian or congregational, in the sense that it has a strict hierarchy of leadership from the local bishop/branch president up to a single prophet/president, believed to be personally authorized and guided by Jesus Christ.  Local congregations (branches, wards, and stakes) have ''de jure'' boundaries by which members are allocated, and membership records are centralized.  This system developed gradually from a more presbyterian polity ([[Joseph Smith]]'s original title in 1830 was \"First Elder\") for pragmatic and doctrinal reasons, reaching a full episcopacy during the [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] period (1839\u20131846).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n*[[Canon law]]\n*[[Collegiality (Catholic Church)]]\n*[[Conciliarism]]\n*[[Conciliarity]]\n*[[Magisterium]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fairweather, E.

We do not know how the writers of the preserved texts would have spoken in everyday life.\n\n===Influence of Church Slavonic===\nAfter the conversion of the East Slavic region to Christianity the people used service books borrowed from [[Bulgaria]], which were written in [[Old Church Slavonic]].{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=63\u201365}} The Church Slavonic language was strictly used only in text, while the colloquial language of the [[Bulgarians]] was communicated in its spoken form.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages (and in some way up to the present day) there existed a duality between the Church Slavonic language used as some kind of 'higher' register (not only) in religious texts and the popular tongue used as a 'lower' register for secular texts. It has been suggested to describe this situation as '''[[diglossia]]''', although there do exist mixed texts where it is sometimes very hard to determine why a given author used a popular or a Church Slavonic form in a given context. Church Slavonic was a major factor in the evolution of modern Russian, where there still exists a \"high stratum\" of words that were imported from this language.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=477\u2013478}}\n\n==Current status==\nAll of these languages are today separate in their own right. In the [[Russian Empire]] the official view was that the Belarusian (\"White Russian\"), Ukrainian (\"Little Russian\"), and Russian (\"Great Russian\") languages were dialects of one common \"Russian\" language (the common languages of Eastern Slavic countries). In the course of the 20th century, \"Great Russian\" came to be known as Russian proper, \"Little Russian\" as Ukrainian and \"White Russian\" as Belarusian.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n| chapter = East Slavonic languages\n| title = The Slavonic languages\n| publisher = Routledge\n| editor1-last= Comrie\n| editor1-first = Bernard\n| editor2-last= Corbett\n| editor2-first = Greville G\n| year = 1993\n| location = London, New York\n| pages = 827\u20131036\n| isbn = 0-415-04755-2\n| ref = harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n| last = Sussex\n| first = Roland\n| authorlink = Roland Sussex\n| last2 = Cubberley\n| first2 = Paul\n| title = The Slavic languages\n| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n| year = 2006\n| location = [[Cambridge]]\n| isbn = 978-0-521-22315-7\n| ref=harv\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Slavic languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:East Slavic Languages}}\n[[Category:East Slavic languages| ]]\n[[Category:Slavic languages]]", "sha1": "gflbmjuo2iqxzea1n0csxu1o0bq9rp2"}}, {"title": "Elizabeth Gracen", "ns": "0", "id": "10071", "revision": {"id": "863856123", "parentid": "863855629", "timestamp": "2018-10-13T14:41:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kpgjhpjm", "id": "33695565"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/Kpgjhpjm|Kpgjhpjm]] ([[User talk:Kpgjhpjm|talk]]) to last version by Kbabej", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name         = Elizabeth Gracen\n|image        = Elizabeth Gracen pic.jpg\n|image_size   = \n|alt          = \n|caption      = Grace in 2016\n|birth_name   = Elizabeth Grace Ward\n|birth_date   = {{Birth date and age|1961|4|3|mf=yes}}\n|birth_place  = [[Ozark, Arkansas]]\n|death_date   = \n|death_place  = \n|death_cause  = \n|resting_place = \n|resting_place_coordinates = \n|residence    = \n|nationality  = \n|ethnicity    = \n|citizenship  = \n|other_names  = \n|known_for    = \n|education    = \n|alma_mater   = HB Studios\n|employer     = \n|occupation   = Actress\n|years_active = \n|home_town    = \n|salary       = \n|networth     = \n|title        = Miss Arkansas 1981<br>[[Miss America]] 1982\n|predecessor  = [[Susan Powell (Miss America)|Susan Powell]]\n|successor    = [[Debra Maffett]]\n|boards       = \n|religion     = \n|spouse       = {{marriage|Jon Birmingham|1982|1984|end=divorced}}<br>{{marriage|Brendan Hughes|1989|1994|end=divorced}}<br> Adam Murphy (present)\n|partner      = \n|children     = \n|parents      = \n|relations    = \n|awards       = \n|signature    = \n|website      = {{URL|http://www.flapperfilms.com}} \n|footnotes    = \n}}\n'''Elizabeth Ward Gracen''' (born  '''Elizabeth Grace Ward''', April 3, 1961) is an [[Americans|American]] actress and beauty pageant contestant who won the title of [[Miss America]] in 1982.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nElizabeth Grace Ward was born on April 3, 1961, in [[Ozark, Arkansas|Ozark]], [[Arkansas]], the daughter of Patricia Hampe, a nurse, and Jimmy Young Ward, a poultry worker.

He was born on the Greek island of [[Samos]] to [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] parents. Influenced by [[Democritus]], [[Aristotle]], and possibly the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], he turned against the [[Platonism]] of his day and established his own school, known as \"the Garden,\" in Athens. He and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects, and he openly allowed women to join the school as a matter of policy. An extremely prolific writer, he is said to have originally written over 300 works on various subjects, but the vast majority of these writings have been lost. Only three letters written by him\u2014the ''Letters to Menoeceus'', ''Pythocles'', and ''Herodotus''\u2014and two collections of quotes\u2014the ''Principle Doctrines'' and the ''Vatican Sayings''\u2014have survived intact, along with a few fragments and quotations of his other writings. His teachings are better recorded in the writings of later authors, including the Roman poet [[Lucretius]], the philosopher [[Philodemus]], the philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]], and the biographer [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]]. \n\nFor Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ''[[ataraxia]]''\u2014peace and freedom from fear\u2014and ''[[aponia]]''\u2014the absence of pain\u2014and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neurosis is death denial, and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Likewise, Epicurus taught that the gods, though they do exist, have no involvement in human affairs and do not punish or reward people for their actions. Nonetheless, he maintained that people should still behave ethically because amoral behavior will burden them with guilt and prevent them from attaining ''ataraxia''.\n\nLike [[Aristotle]], Epicurus was an [[Empiricism|empiricist]], meaning he believed that the senses are the only reliable source of knowledge about the world. He derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher [[Democritus]] ({{circa}} 460\u2014{{circa}} 370 BC). Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as ''[[Atomism|atoms]]''. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus in his teaching of [[Clinamen|atomic \"swerve\"]], which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess [[free will]] in an otherwise [[determinism|deterministic]] universe.\n\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the [[Roman Republic]], before declining as the rival school of [[Stoicism]] grew in popularity at its expense. It finally died out in late antiquity in the wake of [[early Christianity]]. Epicurus himself was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered throughout the [[Middle Ages]] as a patron of drunkards, whoremongers, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest [[Pierre Gassendi]] revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including [[Walter Charleton]] and [[Robert Boyle]]. His influence grew considerably during and after the [[Enlightenment]], profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including [[John Locke]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], and [[Karl Marx]].\n\n==Life==\n===Upbringing and influences===\nEpicurus was born in the Athenian settlement on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] island of [[Samos]] in February 341&nbsp;BC.<ref name=laerti2/>{{sfn|Barnes|1986|page=367}}{{sfn|Gordon|2012|page=3}} His parents, Neocles and Chaerestrate, were both Athenian-born, and his father was an Athenian citizen.<ref name=laerti2/> Epicurus grew up during the final years of the Greek Classical Period.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=8\u20139}} Plato had died seven years before Epicurus was born and Epicurus was seven years old when [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the [[Hellespont]] into Persia.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=8}} As a child, Epicurus, would have received a typical ancient Greek education.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=12}} As such, according to Norman Wentworth DeWitt, \"it is inconceivable that he would have escaped the Platonic training in geometry, dialectic, and rhetoric.\"{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=12}} Epicurus is known to have studied under the instruction of a Samian Platonist named Pamphilus, probably for about four years.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=12}} His ''Letter of Menoeceus'' and surviving fragments of his other writings strongly suggest that he had extensive training in rhetoric.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=12}}{{sfn|Wasson|2016}} After the death of [[Alexander the Great]], [[Perdiccas]] expelled the Athenian settlers on Samos to [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], on the coast of what is now Turkey.<ref name=stanf/>{{sfn|Wasson|2016}} After the completion of his military service, Epicurus joined his family there.

Nonetheless, Epicurus differed from his predecessors on several key points of determinism and vehemently denied having been influenced by any previous philosophers, whom he denounced as \"confused\". Instead, he insisted that he had been \"self-taught\".<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4182030|title = Epicurus' Attitude to Democritus|journal = Phronesis|volume = 23|issue = 1|pages = 80\u201386|last1 = Huby|first1 = Pamela M.|year = 1978}}</ref>{{sfn|Erler|2011|page=9}}{{sfn|Fish|Sanders|2011|pages=1\u20132}} According to DeWitt, Epicurus's teachings also show influences from the contemporary philosophical school of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]].{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=9}} The Cynic philosopher [[Diogenes|Diogenes of Sinope]] was still alive when Epicurus would have been in Athens for his required military training and it is possible they may have met.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=9}} Diogenes's pupil [[Crates of Thebes]] ({{circa}} 365 \u2013 {{circa}} 285 BC) was a close contemporary of Epicurus.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=9}} Epicurus agreed with the Cynics' quest for honesty, but rejected their \"insolence and vulgarity\", instead teaching that honesty must be coupled with courtesy and kindness.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=9}} Epicurus shared this view with his contemporary, the comic playwright [[Menander]].{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=9\u201310}}\n\nEpicurus's ''Letter to Menoeceus'', possibly an early work of his, is written in an eloquent style similar to that of the Athenian rhetorician [[Isocrates]] (436\u2013338 BC),{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=9}} but, for his later works, he seems to have adopted the bald, intellectual style of the mathematician [[Euclid]].{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=9}} Epicurus's epistemology also bears an unacknowledged debt to the later writings of [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC), who rejected the Platonic idea of hypostatic [[Reason]] and instead relied on nature and empirical evidence for knowledge about the universe.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=10}} During Epicurus's formative years, Greek knowledge about the rest of the world was rapidly expanding due to the [[Hellenization]] of the Near East and the rise of [[Hellenistic kingdoms]].{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=10}} Epicurus's philosophy was consequently more universal in its outlook than those of his predecessors, since it took cognizance of non-Greek peoples as well as Greeks.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=10}} He may have had access to the now-lost writings of the historian and ethnographer [[Megasthenes]], who wrote during the reign of [[Seleucus I Nicator]] (ruled 305\u2013281 BC).{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=10}}\n\n===Teaching career===\n[[File:Epikur Statue.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Marble sculpture depicting Epicurus enthroned]]\n\nDuring Epicurus's lifetime, Platonism was the dominant philosophy in higher education.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=9, 11}} Epicurus's radical opposition to Platonism drove the development of a large part of his thought.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=11}}{{sfn|Long|1999|pages=239\u2013240}} Over half of the forty Authorized Doctrines of Epicureanism are flat contradictions of Platonism.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=11}} In around 311 BC, Epicurus, when he was only around thirty years old, began teaching in [[Mytilene]].{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=11}}{{sfn|Wasson|2016}} Around this time, [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], arrived in Athens at the age of about twenty-one.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=11}} Although later texts, such as the writings of the first-century BC Roman orator [[Cicero]], portray Epicureanism and Stoicism as rivals,{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=11}} this rivalry seems to have only emerged in later times and did not exist during Epicurus's own lifetime.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=11}} Zeno, however, did not begin teaching until long after Epicurus.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=11}}\n\nEpicurus's teachings caused strife in Mytilene and he was forced to leave.

His school was the first of the ancient Greek philosophical schools to admit women as a rule rather than an exception.

This has led some philosophers to think that, for Epicurus, free will was ''caused directly by chance''. In his ''On the Nature of Things'', [[Lucretius]] appears to suggest this in the best-known passage on Epicurus' position.<ref name=tufts/> In his ''Letter to Menoeceus'', however, Epicurus follows Aristotle and clearly identifies ''three'' possible causes: \"some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others through our own agency.\" Aristotle said some things \"depend on us\" (''eph'hemin''). Epicurus agreed, and said it is to these last things that [[praise]] and [[blame]] naturally attach.

Strodach, Epicurus could have easily dispensed of the gods entirely without greatly altering his materialist worldview,{{sfn|Strodach|2012|page=39}} but the gods still play one important function in Epicurus's theology as the paragons of moral virtue to be emulated and admired.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|page=39}}\n\nEpicurus rejected the conventional Greek view of the gods as anthropomorphic beings who walked the earth like ordinary people, fathered illegitimate offspring with mortals, and pursued personal feuds.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|page=39}} Instead, he taught that the gods are morally perfect, but detached and immobile beings who live in the remote regions of interstellar space.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=39\u201340}} In line with these teachings, Epicurus adamantly rejected the idea that deities were involved in human affairs in any way.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=27}}{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=42\u201343}} Epicurus maintained that the gods are so utterly perfect and removed from the world that they are incapable of listening to prayers or supplications or doing virtually anything aside from contemplating their own perfections.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=39\u201340}} In his ''Letter to Herodotus'', he specifically denies that the gods have any control over natural phenomena, arguing that this would contradict their fundamental nature, which is perfect, because any kind of worldly involvement would tarnish their perfection.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=42\u201343}} He further warned that believing that the gods control natural phenomena would only mislead people into believing the superstitious view that the gods punish humans for wrongdoing, which only instills fear and prevents people from attaining ''ataraxia''.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=42\u201343}}\n\nEpicurus himself criticizes popular religion in both his ''Letter to Menoeceus'' and his ''Letter to Herodotus'', but in a restrained and moderate tone.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=45\u201346}} Later Epicureans mainly followed the same ideas as Epicurus, believing in the existence of the gods, but emphatically rejecting the idea of divine providence.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=27}} Their criticisms of popular religion, however, are often less gentle than those of Epicurus himself.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|page=46}} The ''Letter to Pythocles'', written by a later Epicurean, is dismissive and contemptuous towards popular religion{{sfn|Strodach|2012|page=46}} and Epicurus's devoted follower, the Roman poet [[Lucretius]] ({{circa}} 99 BC \u2013 {{circa}} 55 BC), passionately assailed popular religion in his philosophical poem ''[[De rerum natura|On the Nature of Things]]''.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|page=46}} In this poem, Lucretius declares that popular religious practices not only do not instill virtue, but rather result in \"misdeeds both wicked and ungodly\", citing the mythical sacrifice of [[Iphigenia]] as an example.{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=46\u201347}} Lucretius argues that divine creation and providence are illogical, not because the gods do not exist, but rather because these notions are incompatible with the Epicurean principles of the gods' indestructability and blessedness.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=27\u201328}}{{sfn|Strodach|2012|pages=43\u201345}} The later [[Philosophical skepticism|Skeptic]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] ({{circa}} 160 \u2013 {{circa}} 210 AD) rejected the teachings of the Epicureans specifically because he regarded them as theological \"Dogmaticists\".{{sfn|Hickson|2014|page=28}}\n\n===Epicurean paradox<!--'Epicurean paradox', 'Riddle of Epicurus', and 'Epicurus' trilemma' redirect here-->===\n[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|The most famous version of the [[problem of evil]] is attributed to Epicurus by [[David Hume]] (''pictured''), who was relying on an attribution of it to him by the Christian apologist [[Lactantius]]. The trilemma does not occur in any of Epicurus's extant writings, however.

[[Lactantius]] attributes this [[trilemma]] to Epicurus in ''De Ira Dei'':\n\n<blockquote>\nGod, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or He is able, and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and unwilling, He is [[wikt:envious|envious]], which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither willing nor able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is suitable to God, from what source then are evils? Or why does He not remove them?\n</blockquote>\n\nIn ''Dialogues concerning Natural Religion'' (1779), [[David Hume]] also attributes the argument to Epicurus:\n\n<blockquote>\nEpicurus\u2019s old questions are yet unanswered. Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?\n</blockquote>\n\nNo extant writings of Epicurus contain this argument.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=26\u201327}} However, the vast majority of Epicurus's writings have been lost and it is possible that some form of this argument may have been found in his lost treatise ''On the Gods'', which Diogenes La\u00ebrtius describes as one of his greatest works.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=26\u201327}} If Epicurus really did make some form of this argument, it would not have been an argument against the existence of deities, but rather an argument against divine providence.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=26\u201327}} Epicurus's extant writings demonstrate that he did believe in the existence of deities.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=27}} Furthermore, religion was such an integral part of daily life in Greece during the early Hellenistic Period that it is doubtful anyone during that period could have been an atheist in the modern sense of the word.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=27}} Instead, the Greek word {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:\u1f04\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2|\u1f04\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2]]}} (''\u00e1theos''), meaning \"without a god\", was used as a term of abuse, not as an attempt to describe a person's beliefs.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=27}}\n\n===Politics===\nIn contrast to the [[Stoics]], Epicureans showed little interest in participating in the politics of the day, since doing so leads to trouble. He instead advocated seclusion. This principle is epitomised by the phrase ''lathe bi\u014dsas'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03b2\u03b9\u03ce\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2}}), meaning \"live in obscurity\", \"get through life without drawing attention to yourself\", i.e., live  without pursuing glory or wealth or power, but anonymously, enjoying little things like food, the company of friends, etc. [[Plutarch]] elaborated on this theme in his essay ''Is the Saying \"Live in Obscurity\" Right?'' ({{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f30 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f34\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bb\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03b2\u03b9\u03ce\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2}}, ''An recte dictum sit latenter esse vivendum'') 1128c; cf.

Justice, Epicurus said, is an agreement neither to harm nor be harmed, and we need to have such a contract in order to enjoy fully the benefits of living together in a well-ordered society. Laws and punishments are needed to keep misguided fools in line who would otherwise break the contract. But the wise person sees the usefulness of justice, and because of his limited desires, he has no need to engage in the conduct prohibited by the laws in any case. Laws that are useful for promoting happiness are just, but those that are not useful are not just.

variety of subjects.{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=26\u201327}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=94}} More original writings of Epicurus have survived to the present day than of any other Hellenistic Greek

lost{{sfn|Long|1999|page=240}}{{sfn|Hickson|2014|pages=26\u201327}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=94}} and most of what is known about Epicurus's teachings come from the writings of his later followers, particularly the Roman poet Lucretius.{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=94}} The only surviving complete works by Epicurus are three relatively lengthy letters, which are quoted in their entirety in Book X of [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]]'s ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', and two groups of quotes: the ''Principal Doctrines'' (\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 \u0394\u03cc\u03be\u03b1\u03b9), which are likewise preserved through quotation by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, and the ''Vatican Sayings'', preserved in a manuscript from the [[Vatican Library]] that was first discovered in 1888.{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=94}} In the ''Letter to Herodotus'' and the ''Letter to Pythocles'', Epicurus summarizes his philosophy on nature and, in the ''Letter to Menoeceus'', he summarizes his moral teachings.{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=94}} Numerous fragments of Epicurus's lost thirty-seven volume treatise ''[[On Nature (Epicurus)|On Nature]]'' have been found among the charred [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus fragments]] at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]].{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=94}}{{sfn|Barnes|1986|page=371}} Scholars first began attempting to unravel and decipher these scrolls in 1800, but the efforts are painstaking and are still ongoing.{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=94}}\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius (10.27-9), the major works of Epicurus

Epicureanism===\n[[Image:Epicurus Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Epicurus leaning against his disciple [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]] in the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]]]]\nEpicureanism was extremely popular from the very beginning.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=320}}{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=3}}{{sfn|Gordon|2012|page=1}} Diogenes La\u00ebrtius records that the number of Epicureans throughout the world exceeded the populations of entire cities.{{sfn|Gordon|2012|page=1}} Nonetheless, Epicurus was not universally admired and, within his own lifetime, he was vilified as an ignorant buffoon and egoistic sybarite.{{sfn|Barnes|1986|page=372}}{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=3\u20134}} He remained the most simultaneously admired and despised philosopher in the Mediterranean for the next nearly five centuries.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=3\u20134}} Epicureanism rapidly spread beyond the Greek mainland all across the Mediterranean world.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=320}} By the first century BC, it had established a strong foothold in Italy.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=320}} The Roman orator [[Cicero]] (106 \u2013 43 BC), who deplored Epicurean ethics, lamented, \"the Epicureans have taken Italy by storm.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=320}}\n\nThe overwhelming majority of surviving Greek and Roman sources are vehemently negative towards Epicureanism{{sfn|Gordon|2012|pages=1\u20132}} and, according to Gordon, they routinely depict Epicurus himself as \"monstrous or laughable\".{{sfn|Gordon|2012|pages=1\u20132}} Many Romans in particular took a negative view of Epicureanism, seeing its advocacy of the pursuit of ''voluptas'' (\"pleasure\") as contrary to the Roman ideal of ''virtus'' (\"manly virtue\").{{sfn|Gordon|2012|page=9}} The Romans therefore often stereotyped Epicurus and his followers as weak and effeminate.{{sfn|Gordon|2012|pages=9, 12\u201313}} Prominent critics of his philosophy include prominent authors such as the Roman Stoic [[Seneca the Younger]] ({{circa}} 4 BC \u2013 AD 65) and the Greek [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonist]] [[Plutarch]] ({{circa}} 46 \u2013 {{circa}} 120), who both derided it as immoral and disreputable.{{sfn|Gordon|2012|page=1}} Gordon characterizes anti-Epicurean rhetoric as so \"heavy-handed\" and misrepresentative of Epicurus's actual teachings that they sometimes come across as \"comical\".{{sfn|Gordon|2012|page=10}} In his ''De vita beata'', Seneca states that the \"sect of Epicurus... has a bad reputation\" and compares it to \"a man in a dress: your chastity remains, your virility is unimpaired, your body has not submitted sexually, but in your hand is a [[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanum]].\"{{sfn|Gordon|2012|page=1}}\n\nEpicureanism was a notoriously conservative philosophical school;{{sfn|Barnes|1986|page=367}}{{sfn|Erler|2011|page=9}}{{sfn|Fish|Sanders|2011|pages=1\u20132}} although Epicurus's later followers did expand on his philosophy, they dogmatically retained what he himself had originally taught without modifying it.{{sfn|Barnes|1986|page=367}}{{sfn|Erler|2011|page=9}}{{sfn|Fish|Sanders|2011|pages=1\u20132}} Epicureans and admirers of Epicureanism revered Epicurus himself as a great teacher of ethics, a savior, and even a god.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=3, 31\u201332}} His image was worn on finger rings, portraits of him were displayed in living rooms, and wealthy followers venerated likenesses of him in marble sculpture.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=3, 32}} His admirers revered his sayings as divine oracles, carried around copies of his writings, and cherished copies of his letters like the letters of an apostle.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=3, 32}} On the twentieth day of every month, admirers of his teachings would perform a solemn ritual to honor his memory.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=3}} At the same time, opponents of his teachings denounced him with vehemence and persistence.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|page=3}}\n\nHowever, in the first and second centuries AD, Epicureanism gradually began to decline as it failed to compete with Stoicism, which had an ethical system more in line with traditional Roman values.{{sfn|Jones|2010|pages=320\u2013321}} Epicureanism also suffered decay in the wake of [[Christianity]], which was also rapidly expanding throughout the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Of all the Greek philosophical schools, Epicureanism was the one most at odds with the new Christian teachings, since Epicureans believed that the soul was mortal, denied the existence of an afterlife, denied that the divine had any active role in human life, and advocated pleasure as the foremost goal of human existence.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} As such, Christian writers such as [[Justin Martyr]] ({{circa}} 100\u2013{{circa}} 165 AD), [[Athenagoras of Athens]] ({{circa}} 133\u2013{{circa}} 190), [[Tertullian]] ({{circa}} 155\u2013{{circa}} 240), and [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa}} 150\u2013{{circa}} 215), [[Arnobius]] (died {{circa}} 330), and Lactantius all singled it out for the most vitriolic criticism.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}}\n\nIn spite of this, DeWitt argues that Epicureanism and Christianity share much common language, calling Epicureanism \"the first missionary philosophy\" and \"the first world philosophy\".{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=8, 26\u201333}} Both Epicureanism and Christianity placed strong emphasis on the importance of love and forgiveness{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=31\u201332}} and early Christian portrayals of [[Jesus]] are often similar to Epicurean portrayals of Epicurus.{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=31\u201332}} DeWitt argues that Epicureanism, in many ways, helped pave the way for the spread of Christianity by \"helping to bridge the gap between Greek intellectualism and a religious way of life\" and \"shunt[ing] the emphasis from the political to the social virtues and offer[ing] what may be called a religion of humanity.\"{{sfn|DeWitt|1954|pages=8, cf. 26\u201333}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:DVinfernoUbertiAddressesDante m.jpg|thumb|[[Dante Alighieri]] meets Epicurus in his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''

by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\nBy the early fifth century AD, Epicureanism was virtually extinct.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} The Christian [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354\u2013430 AD) declared, \"its ashes are so cold that not a single spark can be struck from them.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} While the ideas of Plato and Aristotle could easily be adapted to suit a Christian worldview, the ideas of Epicurus were not nearly as easily amenable.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} As such, while Plato and Aristotle enjoyed a privileged place in Christian philosophy throughout the [[Middle Ages]], Epicurus was not held in such esteem.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Information about Epicurus's teachings was available, through Lucretius's ''On the Nature of Things'', quotations of it found in medieval Latin grammars and ''[[florilegium|florilegia]]'', and encyclopedias, such as [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (seventh century) and [[Hrabanus Maurus]]'s ''De universo'' (ninth century),{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} but there is little evidence that these teachings were systematically studied or comprehended.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Epicurus was remembered by the educated as a philosopher,{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} but he frequently appeared in popular culture as a gatekeeper to the Garden of Delights, the \"proprietor of the kitchen, the tavern, and the brothel.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} He appears in this guise in [[Martianus Capella]]'s ''Marriage of Mercury and Philology'' (fifth century), [[John of Salisbury]]'s ''[[Policraticus]]'' (1159), [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Mirour de l'Omme]]'', and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Epicurus and his followers appear in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' in the Sixth Circle of Hell, where they are imprisoned in flaming

Italian Renaissance painter [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'' (1509\u20131511).{{sfn|Frischer|1982|page=155}} Epicurus's genuine busts were unknown prior to 1742, so early modern artists who wanted to depict him were forced to make up their own iconographies.{{sfn|Frischer|1982|pages=155\u2013156}}]]\n\nIn 1417, a manuscript-hunter named [[Poggio Bracciolini]] discovered a copy of Lucretius's ''On the Nature of Things'' in a monastery near [[Lake Constance]].{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} The discovery of this manuscript was met with immense excitement, because scholars were eager to analyze and study the teachings of classical philosophers and this previously-forgotten text contained the most comprehensive account of Epicurus's teachings known in Latin.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} The first scholarly dissertation on Epicurus, ''De voluptate'' (''On Pleasure'') by the Italian Humanist and Catholic priest [[Lorenzo Valla]] was published in 1431.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Valla made no mention of Lucretius or his poem.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Instead, he presented the treatise as a discussion on the nature of the highest good between an Epicurean, a Stoic, and a Christian.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Valla's dialogue ultimately rejects Epicureanism,{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} but, by presenting an Epicurean as a member of the dispute, Valla lent Epicureanism credibility as a philosophy that deserved to be taken seriously.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}}\n\nNone of the [[Quattrocento]] Humanists ever clearly endorsed Epicureanism,{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} but scholars such as [[Francesco Zabarella]] (1360\u20131417), [[Francesco Filelfo]] (1398\u20131481), [[Cristoforo Landino]] (1424\u20131498), and [[Leonardo Bruni]] ({{circa}} 1370\u20131444) did give Epicureanism a fairer analysis than it had traditionally received and provided a less overtly hostile assessment of Epicurus himself.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Nonetheless, \"Epicureanism\" remained a pejorative, synonymous with extreme egoistic pleasure-seeking, rather than a name of a philosophical school.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} This reputation discouraged orthodox Christian scholars from taking what others might regard as an inappropriately keen interest in Epicurean teachings.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=321}} Epicureanism did not take hold in Italy, France, or England until the seventeenth century.{{sfn|Jones|2010|pages=321\u2013322}} Even the liberal religious skeptics who might have been expected to take an interest in Epicureanism evidently did not;{{sfn|Jones|2010|pages=321\u2013322}} [[\u00c9tienne Dolet]] (1509\u20131546) only mentions Epicurus once in all his writings and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]] (between 1483 and 1494\u20131553) never mentions him at all.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533\u20131592) is the exception to this trend, quoting a full 450 lines of Lucretius's ''On the Nature of Things'' in his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]''.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} His interest in Lucretius, however, seems to have been primarily literary and he is ambiguous about his feelings on Lucretius's Epicurean worldview.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} During the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], the label \"Epicurean\" was bandied back and forth as an insult between [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}}\n\n===Revival===\n[[File:PierreGassendi.jpg|thumb|The French priest and philosopher [[Pierre Gassendi]] is responsible for reviving Epicureanism in modernity as an alternative to Aristotelianism.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}}]]\n\nIn the seventeenth century, the French Catholic priest and scholar [[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592 \u2013 1655) sought to dislodge Aristotelianism from its position of the highest dogma by presenting Epicureanism as a better and more rational alternative.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} In 1647, Gassendi published his book ''De vita et moribus Epicuri'' (''The Life and Morals of Epicurus''), a passionate defense of Epicureanism.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} In 1649, he published a commentary on Diogenes Laertius's ''Life of Epicurus''.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} He left ''Syntagma philosophicum'' (''Philosophical Compendium''), a synthesis of Epicurean doctrines, unfinished at the time of his death in 1655.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} It was finally published in 1658, after undergoing revision by his editors.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} Gassendi modified Epicurus's teachings to make them palatable for a Christian audience.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} For instance, he argued that atoms were not eternal, uncreated, and infinite in number, instead contending that an extremely large but finite number of atoms were created by God at creation.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}}\n\nAs a result of Gassendi's modifications, his books were never censored by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} They came to exert profound influence on later writings about Epicurus.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} Gassendi's version of Epicurus's teachings became popular among some members of English scientific circles.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} For these scholars, however, Epicurean atomism was merely a starting point for their own idiosyncratic adaptations of it.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} To orthodox thinkers, Epicureanism was still regarded as immoral and heretical.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} For instance, [[Lucy Hutchinson]] (1620 \u2013 1681), the first translator of Lucretius's ''On the Nature of Things'' into English, railed against Epicurus as \"a lunatic dog\" who formulated \"ridiculous, impious, execrable doctrines\".{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}}\n\nEpicurus's teachings were made respectable in England by the natural philosopher [[Walter Charleton]] (1619 \u2013 1707), whose first Epicurean work, ''The Darkness of Atheism Dispelled by the Light of Nature'' (1652), advanced Epicureanism as a \"new\" atomism.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} He next work ''Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charletoniana, or a Fabrick of Science Natural, upon a Hypothesis of Atoms, Founded by Epicurus, Repaired by Petrus Gassendus, and Augmented by Walter Charleton'' (1954) emphasized this idea.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} These works, together with Charleton's ''Epicurus's Morals'' (1658), provided the English public with readily available descriptions of Epicurus's philosophy and assured orthodox Christians that Epicureanism was no threat to their beliefs.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=322}} The [[Royal Society]], chartered in 1662, advanced Epicurean atomism.{{sfn|Jones|2010|pages=322\u2013323}} One of the most prolific defenders of atomism was the chemist [[Robert Boyle]] (1627 \u2013 1691), who argued for it in publications such as ''The Origins of Forms and Qualities'' (1666), ''Experiments, Notes, etc. about the Mechanical Origin and Production of Divers Particular Qualities'' (1675), and ''Of the Excellency and Grounds of the Mechanical Hypothesis'' (1674).{{sfn|Jones|2010|pages=322\u2013323}} By the end of the seventeenth century, Epicurean atomism was widely accepted by members of the English scientific community as the best model for explaining the physical world,{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} but it had been modified so greatly that Epicurus was no longer seen as its original parent.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}}\n\n===Enlightenment and after===\nThe Anglican bishop [[Joseph Butler]]'s  anti-Epicurean polemics in his ''Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel'' (1726) and ''Analogy of Religion'' (1736) set the tune for what most orthodox Christians believed about Epicureanism for the remainder of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} Nonetheless, there are a few indications from this time period of Epicurus's improving reputation.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} Epicureanism was beginning to lose its associations with indiscriminate and insatiable gluttony, which had been characteristic of its reputation ever since antiquity.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} Instead, the word \"epicure\" began to refer to a person with extremely refined taste in food.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}}{{sfn|Brewer|Evans|1989|page=388}} Examples of this usage include \"Epicurean cooks / sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite\" from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (Act II. scene i; {{circa}} 1607){{sfn|Brewer|Evans|1989|page=388}} and \"such an epicure was [[Potiphar]]\u2014to please his tooth and pamper his flesh with delicacies\" from [[William Whately]]'s ''Prototypes'' (1646).{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}}\n\nAround the same time, the Epicurean injunction to \"live in obscurity\" was beginning to gain popularity as well.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} In 1685, [[Sir William Temple]] (1628 \u2013 1699) abandoned a promising career as a diplomat and instead retired to his garden, devoting himself to writing essays on Epicurus's moral teachings.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} That same year, [[John Dryden]] translated the celebrated lines from Book II of Lucretius's ''On the Nature of Things'': \"'Tis pleasant, safely to behold from shore / The rowling ship, and hear the Tempest roar.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} Meanwhile, [[John Locke]] (1632 \u2013 1704) adapted Gassendi's modified version of Epicurus's epistemology, which became highly influential on English empiricism.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} Many thinkers with sympathies towards the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] endorsed Epicureanism as an admirable moral philosophy.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743 \u2013 1826), one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], declared in 1819, \"I too am an Epicurean. I consider the genuine (not imputed) doctrines of Epicurus as containing everything rational in moral philosophy which Greece and Rome have left us.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}}\n\nThe German philosopher [[Karl Marx]] (1818 \u2013 1883), whose ideas are basis of [[Marxism]], was profoundly influenced as a young man by the teachings of Epicurus{{sfn|Schafer|2003|page=127}} and his [[doctoral thesis]] was a [[Hegelian dialectic]]al analysis of the differences between the natural philosophies of Democritus and Epicurus.{{sfn|Schafer|2003|pages=127\u2013128}} Marx viewed Democritus as a rationalist skeptic, whose epistemology was inherently contradictory, but saw Epicurus as a dogmatic empiricist, whose worldview is internally consistent and practically applicable.{{sfn|Schafer|2003|pages=127\u2013129}} The British poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (1809 \u2013 1892) praised \"the sober majesties / of settled, sweet, Epicurean life\" in his 1868 poem \"Lucretius\".{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} Epicurus's ethical teachings also had an indirect impact on the philosophy of [[Utilitarianism]] in England during the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}}\n\nAcademic interest in Epicurus and other Hellenistic philosophers increased over the course of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, with an unprecedented number of monographs, articles, abstracts, and conference papers being published on the subject.{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} The texts from the library of [[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]] in the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]], first discovered between 1750 and 1765, are being deciphered, translated, and published by scholars part of the Philodemus Translation Project, funded by the [[United States]] [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and part of the Centro per lo Studio dei Papiri Ercolanesi in [[Naples]].{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} Epicurus's popular appeal among non-scholars is difficult to gauge,{{sfn|Jones|2010|page=323}} but it seems to be relatively comparable to the appeal of more traditionally popular ancient Greek philosophical subjects such as Stoicism, Aristotle, and Plato.{{sfn|Jones|2010|pages=323\u2013324}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Epikoros (Judaism)]]\n* [[Philosophy of happiness]]\n* [[Separation of church and state]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em|refs=\n\n<ref name=buyu>{{cite book |url = |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |last=Bunnin & Yu |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford: Blackwell Publishing}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=jones>{{cite book |url= |title=Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary. 17th edition |first=Daniel |last=Jones |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge UP |isbn= |page= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=laerti2>[[Apollodorus of Athens]] (reported by [[Diogenes Laertius]], ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', [http://www.attalus.org/old/diogenes10a.html#14 10.14\u201315]) gives his birth on the fourth day of the month February in the third year of the 109th [[Olympiad]], in the [[Archon of Athens|archonship]] of Sosigenes</ref>\n\n\n<ref name=stanf>{{Cite book |author= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/#2 |title=Epicurus -

Strictly speaking, it refers to text that is inscribed on a tombstone or plaque, but it may also be used in a figurative sense. Some epitaphs are specified by the person themselves before their death, while others are chosen by those responsible for the burial.  An epitaph may be written in [[prose]] or in [[verse (poetry)|poem verse]]; [[poets]] have been known to compose their own epitaphs prior to their death, [[#Notable epitaphs|as did William Shakespeare]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[commons:File:Shakespeare grave -Stratford-upon-Avon -3June2007.jpg|Photograph of William Shakespear's grave, 3 June 2007]]</ref>\n\nMost epitaphs are brief records of the family, and perhaps the career, of the deceased, often with a common expression of love or respect\u2014for example, \"beloved father of ...\"\u2014but others are more ambitious.  From the [[Renaissance]] to the 19th century in Western culture, epitaphs for notable people became increasingly lengthy and pompous descriptions of their family origins, career, virtues and immediate family, often in Latin.  Notably, the [[Laudatio Turiae]], the longest known [[Ancient Roman]] epitaph, exceeds almost all of these at 180 lines; it celebrates the virtues of an honored wife, probably of a [[consul]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nSome are quotes from holy texts, or [[aphorisms]]. One approach of many epitaphs is to 'speak' to the reader and warn them about their own mortality. A wry trick of others is to request the reader to get off their resting place, inasmuch as the reader would have to be standing on the ground above the coffin to read the inscription. Some record achievements (e.g., past politicians note the years of their terms of office). Nearly all (excepting those where this is impossible by definition, such as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]]) note name, year or date of birth, and date of death. Many list family members and the relationship of the deceased to them (for example, \"Father / Mother / Son / Daughter of\").{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n== Notable examples ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2015}}\n{{wikiquote|Epitaphs}}\n''Heroes and Kings your distance keep;<br>\n''In peace let one poor poet sleep,<br>\n''Who never flattered folks like you;<br>\n''Let [[Horace]] blush and [[Virgil]] too.''\n: \u2014 [[Alexander Pope]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Dickens|title=Dickens' Dictionary Of The Thames|year=1893|page=269}}</ref>\n\n''We must know.

In 2007 [[Graham Waterhouse]] composed ''[[Epitaphium (Waterhouse)|Epitaphium]]'' for string trio as a tribute to the memory of his father [[William Waterhouse (bassoonist)|William Waterhouse]]. The South African poet Gert Vlok Nel wrote an (originally) untitled song, which appeared on his first music album 'Beaufort-Wes se Beautiful Woorde' as 'Epitaph', because his producer Eckard Potgieter told him that the song sounded like an epitaph.

The word is derived from the {{lang-el|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1}} ''epigramma'' \"inscription\" from \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''epigraphein'' \"to write on, to inscribe\",<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epigram \"epigram\"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.</ref> and the [[literary device]] has been employed for over two millennia.\n\nThe presence of wit or sarcasm tends to distinguish non-poetic epigrams from [[aphorisms]] and [[adage]]s, which may lack them.\n\n==Ancient Greek==\nThe Greek tradition of epigrams began as poems inscribed on votive offerings at sanctuaries{{spaced ndash}}including statues of athletes{{spaced ndash}}and on funerary monuments, for example [[Battle of Thermopylae#Epitaph of Simonides|\"Go tell it to the Spartans, passersby...\"]]. These original epigrams did the same job as a short prose text might have done, but in verse. Epigram became a literary genre in the [[Hellenistic period]], probably developing out of scholarly collections of inscriptional epigrams.\n\nThough modern epigrams are usually thought of as very short, Greek literary epigram was not always as short as later examples, and the divide between \"epigram\" and \"[[elegy]]\" is sometimes indistinct (they share a characteristic metre, [[elegiac couplets]]). In the classical period, the clear distinction between them was that epigrams were inscribed and meant to be read, while elegies were recited and meant to be heard. Some elegies could be quite short, but only public epigrams were longer than ten lines. All the same, the origin of epigram in inscription exerted a residual pressure to keep things concise, even when they were recited in Hellenistic times. Many of the characteristic types of literary epigram look back to inscriptional contexts, particularly funerary epigram, which in the Hellenistic era becomes a literary exercise. Many \"sympotic\" epigrams combine sympotic and funerary elements{{spaced ndash}}they tell their readers (or listeners) to drink and live for today because life is short. Generally, any theme found in classical elegies could be and were adapted for later literary epigrams.\n\nHellenistic epigrams are also thought of as having a \"point\"{{spaced ndash}}that is, the poem ends in a punchline or satirical twist. By no means do all Greek epigrams behave this way; many are simply descriptive, but [[Meleager of Gadara]] and [[Philippus of Thessalonica]], the first comprehensive anthologists, preferred the short and witty epigram. Since their collections helped form knowledge of the genre in Rome and then later throughout Europe, Epigram came to be associated with 'point,' especially because the European epigram tradition takes the Latin poet [[Martial]] as its principal model; he copied and adapted Greek models (particularly the contemporary poets [[Lucillius]] and [[Nicarchus]]) selectively and in the process redefined the genre, aligning it with the indigenous Roman tradition of 'satura', hexameter [[satire]], as practised by (among others) his contemporary [[Juvenal]]. Greek epigram was actually much more diverse, as the [[Milan Papyrus]] now indicates.\n\nA major source for Greek literary epigram is the ''[[Greek Anthology]]'', a compilation from the 10th century AD based on older collections, including those of Meleager and Philippus. It contains epigrams ranging from the [[Hellenistic period]] through the Imperial period and [[Late Antiquity]] into the compiler's own [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era{{spaced ndash}}a thousand years of short elegiac texts on every topic under the sun. The ''Anthology'' includes one book of Christian epigrams as well as one book of erotic and amorous homosexual epigrams called the \u039c\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f20 (Mousa Paidike, \"The Boyish Muse\").\n\n==Ancient Roman==\nRoman epigrams owe much to their Greek predecessors and contemporaries. Roman epigrams, however, were often more satirical than Greek ones, and at times used obscene language for effect. Latin epigrams could be composed as inscriptions or [[graffiti]], such as this one from [[Pompeii]], which exists in several versions and seems from its inexact meter to have been composed by a less educated person. Its content makes it clear how popular such poems were:\n\n:''Admiror, O paries, te non cecidisse ruinis''\n:''qui tot scriptorum taedia sustineas.''\n\n:I'm astonished, wall, that you haven't collapsed into ruins,\n:since you're holding up the weary verse of so many poets.\n\nHowever, in the literary world, epigrams were most often gifts to patrons or entertaining verse to be published, not inscriptions. Many Roman writers seem to have composed epigrams, including [[Domitius Marsus]], whose collection ''Cicuta'' (now lost) was named after the poisonous plant ''[[Cicuta]]'' for its biting wit, and [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]], more famous for his epic ''[[Pharsalia]]''. Authors whose epigrams survive include [[Catullus]], who wrote both invectives and love epigrams &ndash; his poem 85 is one of the latter.\n\n:''Odi et amo.

[[Sonnet 76]] is an excellent example. The two line poetic form as a [[closed couplet]] was also used by [[William Blake]] in his poem [[Auguries of Innocence]] and also by [[Byron]] ([[Don Juan (Byron)]] XIII); [[John Gay]] (Fables); [[Alexander Pope]] (An Essay on Man).\n\nThe first work of English literature penned in North America was Robert Hayman's ''Quodlibets, Lately Come Over from New Britaniola, Old Newfoundland,'' which is a collection of over 300 epigrams, many of which do not conform to the two-line rule or trend.  While the collection was written between 1618 and 1628 in what is now Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, it was published shortly after his return to Britain.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert|last1=Hayman |last2=Reynolds|first2=David|title=Quodlibets, Lately Come Over from New Britaniola, Old Newfoundland|orig-year=First published circa 1628, copyright 2013|publisher=Problematic Press|location=Newfoundland|isbn=9780986902727|pages=5\u20136|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17627994-quodlibets-lately-come-over-from-new-britaniola-old-newfoundland|accessdate=14 September 2015|ref=Quodlibets, Lately Come Over from New Britaniola, Old Newfoundland}}</ref> \n \nIn Victorian times the epigram couplet was often used by the prolific American poet [[Emily Dickinson]].  Her poem No. 1534 is a typical example of her eleven poetic epigrams.  The novelist [[George Eliot]] also included couplets throughout her writings.  Her best example is in her sequenced sonnet poem entitled ''Brother and Sister''<ref>http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/2696.html</ref> in which each of the eleven sequenced sonnet ends with a couplet. In her sonnets, the preceding lead-in-line, to the couplet ending of each, could be thought of as a title for the couplet, as is shown in Sonnet VIII of the sequence.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the rhymed epigram couplet form developed into a fixed verse image form, with an integral title as the third line. [[Adelaide Crapsey]] codified the couplet form into a two line rhymed verse of ten syllables per line with her image couplet poem ''On Seeing Weather-Beaten Trees''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/BAE8954.0001.001|title=Verse / Adelaide Crapsey [electronic text]|first=Adelaide|last=Crapsey|date=1 January 1997|publisher=}}</ref> first published in 1915.\n\nBy the 1930s, the five-line [[cinquain]] verse form became widely known in the poetry of the Scottish poet [[William Soutar]].

He was born in [[Vivar del Cid|Vivar]], a town near the city of [[Burgos]]. After his death, he became Castile's celebrated [[Folk hero|national hero]] and the protagonist of the most significant medieval Spanish epic poem, ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid|El Cantar de Mio Cid]]''.<ref name=\"World\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDMoa4EzrcMC&pg=PA90&dq=Rodrigo+%22El+Cid%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2toH13ZfLAhXHgj4KHeh8ANAQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&q=Rodrigo%20%22El%20Cid%22&f=false | title=The World of El Cid: Chronicles of the Spanish Reconquest | publisher=Manchester University Press | author=Barton, Simon and Richard Fletcher | year=2000 | location=Manchester, UK | isbn=9780719052262}}</ref>\n\nBorn a member of the minor nobility, El Cid was brought up at the court of [[Ferdinand the Great|King Ferdinand the Great]] and served Ferdinand's son, [[Sancho II of Le\u00f3n and Castile]]. He rose to become the commander and royal standard-bearer (''armiger regis'') of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] upon Sancho's ascension in 1065. Rodrigo went on to lead the Castilian military campaigns against Sancho's brothers, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] and [[Garc\u00eda II of Galicia]], as well as in the Muslim kingdoms in [[Al-Andalus]]. He became renowned for his military prowess in these campaigns, which helped expand Castilian territory at the expense of the Muslims and Sancho's brothers' kingdoms.  When conspirators murdered Sancho in 1072, Rodrigo found himself in a difficult situation. Since Sancho was childless, the throne passed to his brother Alfonso, the same whom El Cid had helped remove from power. Although Rodrigo continued to serve the Castilian sovereign,  he lost his ranking in the new court which treated him at arm's length and suspiciously. Finally, in 1081, he was ordered into exile.<ref name=\"Mythology\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hkx472N8Bk8C&pg=PA161&dq=Rodrigo+%22El+Cid%22+suspicious+alfonso&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiD2Ji77ZfLAhXFNT4KHRpABdM4ChDoAQg7MAc#v=onepage&q=Rodrigo%20%22El%20Cid%22%20suspicious%20alfonso&f=false | title=Mythology in the Middle Ages: Heroic Tales of Monsters, Magic, and Might | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Fee, Christopher R. | year=2011 | pages=161 | isbn=9780275984069}}</ref>\n\nEl Cid found work fighting for the [[Muslim]] rulers of [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]], whom he defended from its traditional enemy, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]. While in exile, he regained his reputation as a strategist and formidable military leader. He repeatedly turned out victorious in battle against the [[Muslim]] rulers of [[L\u00e9rida]] and their Christian allies, as well as against a large Christian army under King [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez]] of Aragon. In 1086, an expeditionary army of [[North Africa]]n [[Almoravids]] inflicted a severe defeat to Castile, compelling Alfonso to overcome the resentments he harbored against El Cid. The terms for the return to the Christian service must have been attractive enough since Rodrigo soon found himself fighting for his former Lord.  Over the next several years, however, El Cid set his sights on the kingdom-city of [[Valencia]], operating more or less independently of Alfonso while politically supporting the [[Banu Hud]] and other Muslim dynasties opposed to the Almoravids. He gradually increased his control over Valencia; the Islamic ruler, {{ill|Yahya al-Qadir|es|Al-C\u00e1dir}}, became his tributary in 1092. When the Almoravids instigated an uprising that resulted in the death of al-Qadir, El Cid responded by laying siege to the city. Valencia finally fell in 1094, and El Cid established an independent principality on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. He ruled over a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] society with the popular support of Christians and Muslims alike.<ref name=\"Quest\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-MIChVmZwQC|title=The Quest for El Cid|author=Fletcher, Richard A.|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195069556|location=Oxford, UK|pages=166-168, 198}}</ref>\n\nEl Cid's final years were spent fighting the Almoravid [[Berbers]]. He inflicted upon them their first major defeat in 1094, on the plains of Caurte, outside Valencia, and continued resisting them until his death. Although Rodrigo remained undefeated in Valencia, his only son, and heir, Diego Rodr\u00edguez died fighting against the Almoravids in the service of Alfonso in 1097. After El Cid's death in 1099, his wife, [[Jimena D\u00edaz]], succeeded him as ruler of Valencia, but she was eventually forced to surrender the principality to the Almoravids in 1102.\n\nTo this day, El Cid remains a Spanish popular folk-hero and national icon, with his life and deeds remembered in plays, films, folktales, songs, and even video games.\n\n==Title==\n[[File:Carmen campidoctoris 1.jpg|thumb|First paragraph of the ''[[Carmen Campidoctoris]]'', the earliest literary treatment of El Cid's life, written  to celebrate El Cid's defeat of some counts and champions]]\n\nThe name ''El Cid'' ({{IPA-es|el \u02c8\u03b8i\u00f0|lang}}) is a modern Spanish denomination composed of the article ''el'' meaning \"the\" and ''Cid'', which derives from the Old Castilian loan word ''\u00c7id'' borrowed from the dialectal Arabic word \u0633\u064a\u062f ''[[sidi|s\u00eedi]]'' or [[sayyid]], which means \"Lord\" or \"Master\". The [[Mozarab]]s or the Arabs that served in his ranks may have addressed him in this way, which the Christians may have transliterated and adopted. Historians, however, have not yet found contemporary records referring to Rodrigo as ''Cid.''

Despite the fact that El Cid's mother's family was [[aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]], in later years the peasants would consider him one of their own. However, his relatives were not major court officials; documents show that El Cid's paternal grandfather, Lain, confirmed only five documents of [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Ferdinand I]]'s; his maternal grandfather, Rodrigo \n\u00c1lvarez, certified only two of [[Sancho II of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Sancho II]]'s; and El Cid's father confirmed only one.\n\n===Service under Sancho II===\nAs a young man in 1057, Rodrigo fought against the Moorish stronghold of [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]], making its [[emir]] [[Ahmad al-Muqtadir|al-Muqtadir]] a vassal of Sancho. In the spring of 1063, Rodrigo fought in the [[Battle of Graus]], where Ferdinand's half-brother, [[Ramiro I of Aragon]], was laying siege to the Moorish town of Cinca, which was in Zaragozan lands. Al-Muqtadir, accompanied by Castilian troops including El Cid, fought against the Aragonese. The party slew Ramiro I, setting the Aragonese army on the run, and emerged victorious. One legend has said that during the conflict, El Cid killed an Aragonese [[knight]] in [[single combat]], thereby receiving the honorific title \"''Campeador''\".\n\nWhen Ferdinand died, Sancho continued to enlarge his territory, conquering both [[Christian]] strongholds and the [[Moorish]] cities of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] and [[Badajoz]]. When Sancho learned that Alfonso was planning on overthrowing him in order to gain his territory, Sancho sent Cid to bring Alfonso back so that Sancho could speak to him.\n\n===Service under Alfonso VI===\n[[File:Jura de Santa Gadea.jpg|thumb|Marcos Gir\u00e1ldez de Acosta painting (1864) depicting the \"[[Santa Gadea]] Oath\".

He was, however, deeply suspected of having been involved in Sancho's murder. According to the epic of El Cid, the Castilian nobility led by El Cid and a dozen \"oath-helpers\" forced Alfonso to [[oath|swear]] publicly on holy relics multiple times in front of [[Santa Gadea]] ([[Saint Agatha]]) Church in [[Burgos]] that he did not participate in the plot to kill his brother. This is widely reported{{Who|date=February 2010}} as truth, but contemporary documents on the lives of both Rodrigo Diaz and Alfonso VI of Castile and Le\u00f3n do not mention any such event.

This is the generally given reason for El Cid's exile, although several others are plausible and may have been contributing factors: jealous nobles turning Alfonso against El Cid, Alfonso's own animosity towards El Cid and an accusation of pocketing some of the tribute from Seville.\n\nAt first he went to [[Barcelona]], where [[Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer II]] (1076\u20131082) and [[Berenguer Ramon II, Count of Barcelona|Berenguer Ramon II]] (1076\u20131097) refused his offer of service.\n\n==Moorish service==\n[[File:Reinos de Taifas 1080.png|thumb|During his service to the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]], he had gained a prominent reputation and the title ''El Cid'' (the Lord). He is also known to have developed links with the other [[Taifas]] in 1080.]]\n[[File:La Aljafer\u00eda - Palacio taifa 02.JPG|thumb|Detail of the [[w:es:Palacio de la Aljafer\u00eda|Aljaferia palace]], in the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]]]]\n\nThe exile was not the end of El Cid, either physically or as an important figure. After being rejected by [[Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer II]], El Cid journeyed to the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]] where he received a warmer welcome. In 1081, El Cid went on to offer his services to the Moorish king of the northeast [[Al-Andalus]] city of [[Zaragoza]], [[Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud]], and served both him and his successor, [[Al-Mustain II]]. He was given the title ''El Cid'' (''The Master'') and served as a leading figure in a diverse [[Moorish]] force consisting of [[Muladi]]s, [[Berber people|Berber]]s, [[Arab]]s and [[Mali]]ans.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAccording to Moorish accounts:\n<blockquote>[[Andalusia]]n [[Knight]]s found El Cid their foe ill, thirsty and exiled from the court of [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso]], he was presented before the elderly [[Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud]] and accepted command of the forces of the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]] as their Master.</blockquote>\n\nIn his ''History of Medieval Spain'' (Cornell University Press, 1975), Joseph F. O'Callaghan writes:\n<blockquote>That kingdom was divided between [[Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud|al-Mutamin]] (1081\u20131085) who ruled [[Zaragoza]] proper, and his brother al-Mundhir, who ruled [[Taifa of Lleida|L\u00e9rida]] and [[Tortosa]]. El Cid entered al-Mutamin's service and successfully defended Zaragoza against the assaults of al-Mundhir, [[Sancho I of Arag\u00f3n]], and Ramon Berenguer II, whom he held captive briefly in 1082.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1084, The Army of the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]] under El Cid defeated the [[Aragon]]ese at the [[Battle of Morella]] near [[Tortosa]], but in autumn the Castilians started a loose siege of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and later the next year the Christians captured [[Salamanca]], a stronghold of the [[Taifa of Toledo]].\n\nIn 1086, the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] invasion of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] through and around [[Gibraltar]] began. The Almoravids, [[Berber people|Berber]] residents of present-day [[North Africa]], led by [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], were asked to help defend the divided [[Moors]] from [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso]]. El Cid commanded a large [[Moorish]] force during the [[Battle of Sagrajas]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=XAj2BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT145&dq=El+Cid+Battle+of+Sagrajas&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ed5kVd3RMZeJuASR6oOwBw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=El+Cid+joined+them+and+commanded+a+large+moorish+force+during+the+Battle+of+Sagrajas&f=false|title=Perfect Paradores; The unique hotel chain in Spain... our best of their best hotels!: A Bill and Sarah Giles Travel Guide.

The [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] and [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian [[Taifa]]s, including the armies of [[Badajoz]], [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Granada]], [[Tortosa]] and [[Seville]], defeated a combined army of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Arag\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].\n\nIn 1087, [[Raymond of Burgundy]] and his Christian allies attempted to weaken the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]]'s northernmost stronghold by initiating the [[Siege of Tudela]] and [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso]] captured [[Aledo, Murcia]] blocking the route between the [[Taifa]]s in eastern and western [[Iberia]].\n\n==Recall from exile==\n[[File:The Cid ordering the Execution of Ahmed.jpg|thumb|El Cid ordering the execution of [[Almoravid]] allies after his conquest of Valencia in 1094]]\n[[File:Batalla de Cuarte.svg|thumb|right|Battle of [[Quart de Poblet]] (21 October 1094). El Cid's troops are in green, [[Almoravids]] troops are in red.]]\n\nTerrified after his crushing defeat, Alfonso recalled  El Cid. It has been shown that El Cid was at court on July 1087; however, what happened after that is unclear.    \nEl Cid returned to Alfonso, but now he had his own plans.  He only stayed a short while and then returned to Zaragoza.  El Cid was content to let the Almoravid armies and the armies of Alfonso fight without his help, even when there was a chance that the armies of Almoravid might defeat Alfonso and take over all of Alfonso's lands.  El Cid chose not to fight because he was hoping that both armies would become weak. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} That would make it easier for him to carry out his own plan to become ruler of the Kingdom of Valencia.\n\n===Conquest of Valencia===\nAround this time, El Cid, with a combined Christian and Moorish army, began maneuvering in order to create his own fiefdom in the Moorish [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastal city of [[Valencia]]. Several obstacles lay in his way. First was Berenguer Ramon II, who ruled nearby [[Barcelona]]. In May 1090, El Cid defeated and captured Berenguer in the Battle of T\u00e9bar (nowadays Pinar de T\u00e9var, near [[Monroyo]], [[province of Teruel|Teruel]]). Berenguer was later released and his nephew Ramon Berenguer III married El Cid's youngest daughter Maria to ward against future conflicts.\n\nAlong the way to Valencia, El Cid also conquered other towns, many of which were near Valencia, such as [[El Puig]] and [[Quart de Poblet]].\n\nEl Cid gradually came to have more influence on Valencia, then ruled by {{ill|Yahya al-Qadir|es|Al-C\u00e1dir}}, of [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Houara|Hawwara]] Dhunnunid dynasty. In October 1092 an uprising occurred in Valencia inspired by the city's chief judge Ibn Jahhaf and the Almoravids. El Cid began a siege of Valencia. A December 1093 attempt to break the siege failed. By the time the siege ended in May 1094, El Cid had carved out his own principality on the coast of the Mediterranean. Officially El Cid ruled in the name of Alfonso; in reality, El Cid was fully independent. The city was both Christian and Muslim, and both Moors and Christians served in the army and as administrators.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Burgos - Catedral 069 - Tumba del Cid.jpg|thumb|[[Tomb]] of El Cid and his wife Do\u00f1a Jimena at the [[Burgos Cathedral]], 9 August 2012]]\n\nEl Cid and his wife [[Jimena D\u00edaz]] lived peacefully in Valencia for five years until the Almoravids besieged the city. El Cid died on June 10, 1099.<ref name=\"Perea Rodr\u00edguez\">{{cite web|last=Perea Rodr\u00edguez|first=\u00d3scar|title=D\u00edaz de Vivar, Rodrigo o El Cid (1043\u20131099)|url=http://www.mcnbiografias.com|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>  His death was likely a result of the famine and deprivations caused by the siege.<ref name=\"Perea Rodr\u00edguez\"/> Valencia was captured by [[Masdali]] on May 5, 1102 and it did not become a Christian city again for over 125 years. Jimena fled to Burgos, Castile, in 1101. She rode into the town with her retinue and the body of El Cid.<ref name=\"Perea Rodr\u00edguez\"/> Originally buried in Castile in the monastery of San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a, his body now lies at the center of [[Burgos Cathedral]].\n\n===Defeat===\nAfter his demise, but still during the siege of Valencia, legend holds that Jimena ordered that the corpse of El Cid be fitted with his armour and set on his horse Babieca, to bolster the morale of his troops. In several variations of the story, the dead Rodrigo and his knights win a thundering charge against Valencia's besiegers, resulting in a war-is-lost-but-battle-is-won [[catharsis]] for generations of Christian Spaniards to follow. It is believed that the legend originated shortly after Jimena entered Burgos, and that it is derived  from the manner in which Jimena's procession rode into Burgos, i.e., alongside her deceased husband.<ref name=\"Perea Rodr\u00edguez\"/>\n\n==Warrior and general==\n\n===Battle tactics===\nDuring his campaigns, El Cid often ordered that books by classic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Greek literature|Greek]] authors on military themes be read aloud to him and his troops, for both entertainment and inspiration before battle. El Cid's army had a novel approach to planning strategy as well, holding what might be called \"[[brainstorming]]\" sessions before each battle to discuss tactics. They frequently used unexpected strategies, engaging in what modern generals would call [[psychological warfare]] \u2014 waiting for the enemy to be paralyzed with terror and then attacking them suddenly; distracting the enemy with a small group of soldiers, etc. (El Cid used this distraction in capturing the town of Castej\u00f3n as depicted in ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' (''The Song of my Cid''). El Cid accepted or included suggestions from his troops. In ''The Song'' the man who served him as his closest adviser was his vassal and kinsman [[\u00c1lvar F\u00e1\u00f1ez]] \"''Minaya''\" (meaning ''\"My brother\"'', a compound word of Spanish possessive ''Mi'' (My) and ''Anaia'', the basque word for ''brother''), although the historical \u00c1lvar F\u00e1\u00f1ez remained in Castile with Alfonso VI.\n\nTaken together, these practices imply an educated and intelligent commander who was able to attract and inspire good subordinates, and who would have attracted considerable loyalty from his followers, including those who were not Christian. It is these qualities, coupled with El Cid's legendary martial abilities, which have fueled his reputation as an outstanding battlefield commander.\n\n===Babieca===\n[[File:Carde\u00f1a tumba babieca 03320.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Babieca at the monastery of [[San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a]]]]\n\n'''Babieca''' or '''Bavieca''' was El Cid's [[warhorse]]. Several stories exist about El Cid and Babieca. One well-known legend about El Cid describes how he acquired the [[stallion]]. According to this story, Rodrigo's godfather, Pedro El Grande, was a monk at a [[Carthusian]] [[monastery]]. Pedro's coming-of-age gift to El Cid was his pick of a horse from an [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] herd. El Cid picked a horse that his godfather thought was a weak, poor choice, causing the monk to exclaim \"''Babieca''!\" (stupid!) Hence, it became the name of El Cid's horse. Another legend states that in a competition of battle to become King Sancho's \"Campeador\", or champion, a knight on horseback wished to challenge El Cid. The King wished a fair fight and gave El Cid his finest horse, Babieca, or Bavieca. This version says Babieca was raised in the royal stables of Seville and was a highly trained and loyal war horse, not a foolish stallion.  The name in this instance could suggest that the horse came from the Babia region in [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n, Spain]]. In the poem [[Carmen Campidoctoris]], Babieca appears as a gift from \"a barbarian\" to El Cid, so its name could also be derived from \"Barbieca\", or \"horse of the barbarian\".\n\nRegardless, Babieca became a great warhorse, famous to the [[Christian]]s, feared by El Cid's enemies, and loved by El Cid, who allegedly requested that Babieca be buried with him in the monastery of [[San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a]]. <ref name=\"Quest\" /> His name is mentioned in several tales and historical documents about El Cid, including ''The Lay of El Cid''.\n\n===Swords===\nA weapon traditionally identified as El Cid's [[sword]], [[Tizona]], used to be displayed in the Army Museum (Museo del Ej\u00e9rcito) in Toledo. In 1999, a small sample of the blade underwent metallurgical analysis which confirmed that the blade was made in Moorish [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] in the eleventh century and contained amounts of [[Damascus steel]].<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\">{{cite journal |last1=Alonso |first1=J.

The ''[[Historia Roderici]]'' calls her a daughter of a Count [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo]].  Tradition states that when El Cid first laid eyes on her, he was enamored by her great beauty. El Cid and Jimena had two daughters and a son. The latter, [[Diego Rodr\u00edguez (Son of El Cid)|Diego Rodr\u00edguez]], was killed while fighting against the invading Muslim Almoravids from [[North Africa]] at the [[Battle of Consuegra]] in 1097.  Like with his own marriage, El Cid would link his family to the royal families of the Iberian peninsula through the marriages of his two daughters.  [[Cristina Rodr\u00edguez (noble)|Cristina Rodr\u00edguez]] married [[Ramiro S\u00e1nchez, Lord of Monz\u00f3n|Ramiro]], Lord of [[Monz\u00f3n]] and grandson of [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre]].  Her own son, El Cid's grandson, would be elevated to the throne of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] as King [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]].  The other daughter, [[Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez de Vivar|Mar\u00eda]], is said first to have married a prince of Aragon, presumably the son of [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre|Peter I]], and she later wed [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer III]], count of [[Barcelona]].\n\n==El Cid in literature, music and film==\n\nThe figure of El Cid has been the source for many literary works, beginning with the [[Cantar del Mio Cid]], an [[epic poem]] from the [[12th century]] which gives a partly-fictionalized account of his life. This poem, along with similar later works such as the [[Mocedades de Rodrigo]], contributed to portray El Cid as a chivalric hero of the [[Reconquista]],<ref name=\"Woolf2011\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Woolf|title=A Global History of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7r7SaTXGXEC&pg=PA110|date=17 February 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-87575-2|page=110}}</ref> making him a legendary figure in Spain. In the early 17th century the Spanish writer [[Guill\u00e9n de Castro y Bellv\u00eds|Guill\u00e9n de Castro]] wrote a play called \"Las Mocedades del Cid\", on which French playwright [[Pierre Corneille]] based one of his most famous tragicomedies, [[Le Cid]].<ref name=\"Gale2016\">{{cite book|author=Gale|title=A Study Guide for Pierre Corneille's \"Le Cid\"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xtn2DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT3|year=2016|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4103-5088-6|page=3}}</ref> He was also a popular source of inspiration for Spanish writers of the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], such as [[Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch]], who wrote \"La Jura de Santa Gadea\", or [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]], who wrote a long poem called \"La Leyenda del Cid\".\n\n[[Georges Bizet]] worked on a ''[[Don Rodrigue]]'' in 1873 that was set aside and never completed.

Lines without enjambment are [[End-stopping|end-stopped]].\n\nIn reading, the delay of meaning creates a tension that is released when the word or phrase that completes the syntax is encountered (called the rejet);<ref name=litenc /> the tension arises from the \"mixed message\" produced both by the pause of the line-end, and the suggestion to continue provided by the incomplete meaning.<ref name=\"Preminger 359\">Preminger 359</ref> In spite of the apparent contradiction between rhyme, which heightens closure, and enjambment, which delays it, the technique is compatible with rhymed verse.<ref name=\"Preminger 359\" /> Even in [[couplet]]s, the closed or [[heroic couplet]] was a late development; older is the open couplet, where rhyme and enjambed lines co-exist.<ref name=\"Preminger 359\" />\n\nEnjambment has a long history in poetry. [[Homer]] used the technique, and it is the norm for [[alliterative verse]] where rhyme is unknown.<ref name=\"Preminger 359\" /> In the 32nd Psalm of the Hebrew Bible enjambment is unusually conspicuous.<ref>William R. Taylor, The Book of Psalms, The Interpreters' Bible, volume VI, 1955, Abingdon Press, Nashville, p. 169</ref> It was used extensively in England by Elizabethan poets for dramatic and narrative verses, before giving way to closed couplets. The example of [[John Milton]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' laid the foundation for its subsequent use by the English [[Romantic poets]]; in its preface he identified it as one of the chief features of his verse: \"sense variously drawn out from one verse into another\".<ref name=\"Preminger 359\" />\n\n== Examples ==\nThe start of ''[[The Waste Land]]'' by [[T.S. Eliot]], with only lines 4 and 7 end-stopped:\n{{quote|<poem>April is the cruellest month, breeding\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\nMemory and desire, stirring\nDull roots with spring rain.\nWinter kept us warm, covering\nEarth in forgetful snow, feeding\nA little life with dried tubers.</poem>}}\n\nThese lines from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (''c.'' 1611) are heavily enjambed:\n{{quote|<poem>I am not prone to weeping, as our sex\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\nPerchance shall dry your pities; but I have\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\nWorse than tears drown.</poem>}}\n\nMeaning flows as the lines progress, and the reader's eye is forced to go on to the next sentence. It can also make the reader feel uncomfortable or the poem feel like [[Train of thought|\"flow-of-thought\"]] with a sensation of urgency or disorder.  In contrast, the following lines from: ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (''c.'' 1595) are completely end-stopped:\n\n{{quote|<poem>A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\nSome shall be pardon'd, and some punish\u00e8d.</poem>}}\n\nEach line is formally correspondent with a unit of thought\u2014in this case, a clause of a sentence. End-stopping is more frequent in early Shakespeare: as his style developed, the proportion of enjambment in his plays increased. Scholars such as Goswin K\u00f6nig and [[A. C. Bradley]] have estimated approximate dates of undated works of Shakespeare by studying the frequency of enjambment.\n\n''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]'' by [[John Keats]], lines 2\u20134:\n{{quote|<poem>Its loveliness increases; it will never\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\nA bower quiet for us...</poem>}}\n\nClosely related to enjambment is the technique of \"[[broken rhyme]]\" or \"split rhyme\" which involves the splitting of an individual word, typically to allow a rhyme with one or more syllables of the split word.  In English verse, broken rhyme is used almost exclusively in [[light verse]], such as to form a [[Orange (word)#Rhyme|word that rhymes with \"orange\"]], as in this example by [[Willard Espy]], in his poem \"The Unrhymable Word: Orange\":\n{{quote|<poem>The four eng-\nineers\nWore orange\nbrassieres.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Man of my Words: Reflections on the English Language |last=Lederer |first=Richard |year=2003 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=0-312-31785-9}}</ref></poem>}}\n\nThe [[clapping game]] \"[[Miss Susie]]\", which uses the break \"...

It is a comprehensive convention of the [[Council of Europe]] dealing with the law of [[nationality]]. The Convention is open for signature by the member States of the Council of Europe and the non-member States which have participated in its elaboration and for accession by other non-member States. The Convention came into force on 1 March 2000 after ratification by 3 countries. As at 6 March 2014, the Convention has been signed by 29 countries, but has been ratified by only 20 of those countries.<ref name=status>{{cite web|title = European Convention on Nationality: Status|url = http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=166&CM=&DF=&CL=ENG|publisher = [[Council of Europe]]}}</ref>\n\n==Provisions==\nArticle 4(d) provides that neither marriage nor dissolution of marriage shall automatically affect the nationality of either spouse, nor shall a change of nationality by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the nationality of their spouse. Common practice among states at the beginning of the 20th century was that a woman was to have the nationality of her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the nationality of her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the nationality of a married woman was no longer dependent on the nationality of her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically [[Naturalization|naturalised]] married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to [[consular assistance]] (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.\n\nArticle 5 provides that no [[discrimination]] shall exist in a state's internal nationality law on the grounds of \"sex, religion, race, colour or national or ethnic origin\". It also provides that a state shall not discriminate amongst its nationals on the basis of whether they hold their nationality by birth or acquired it subsequently.\n\nArticle 6 relates to the acquisition of nationality. It provides for nationality to be acquired at birth by descent from either parent to those born within the territory of the state. (States may exclude partially or fully children born abroad). It also provides for nationality by virtue of birth in the territory of state; however, states may limit this to only children who would be otherwise stateless. It requires the possibility of [[naturalisation]], and provides that the period of residence required for eligibility cannot be more than ten years lawful and [[habitual residence]]. It also requires to \"facilitate\" the acquisition of nationality by certain persons, including spouses of nationals, children of its nationals born abroad, children one of whose parents has acquired the nationality, children adopted by a national, persons lawfully and habitually resident for a period before the age of eighteen, and [[stateless person]]s and [[refugee]]s lawfully and habitually resident on its territory.\n\nArticle 7 regulates the involuntary loss of nationality. It provides that states may deprive their nationals of their nationality in only the cases of voluntary acquisition of another nationality, fraud or failure to provide relevant information when acquiring nationality, voluntary military service in a foreign military force, or adoption as a child by foreign nationals. It also provides for the possibility of loss of nationality for nationals habitually residing abroad. Finally it provides loss of nationality for \"conduct seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the State Party\".\n\nArticle 8 provides nationals with the right to renounce their nationality, providing they do not thereby become stateless. States may however restrict this right with respect to nationals residing abroad.\n\n==Status==\n[[File:European Convention on Nationality status.svg|thumb|400px|{{legend-table|title=Members of the [[Council of Europe]] that:|#0000FF|Ratified  \n|#00ff00|Signed not ratified\n|#ff0000|Not signed\n|#c0c0c0|Non members of the Council of Europe\n}}]]\nAs at 6 March 2014, the following countries have signed or ratified the Convention:<ref name=status />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Status of European Convention on Nationality\n|- \n!

(2010). In Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

On the other hand, it also adds to the discrepancy between the way English is written and spoken in any given location.<ref name=Khansir/>\n\n== Function of the letters ==\n\n''Note: In the following discussion, only one or two common pronunciations of American and British English [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] are used in this article for each word cited. Other regional pronunciations may be possible for some words, but indicating all possible regional variants in the article is impractical. ''\n\n=== Phonemic representation ===\n{{further|Phonemic orthography}}\n\n[[Letter (alphabet)|Letters]] in English orthography usually represent a particular sound ([[phoneme]]). For example, the word ''cat'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|t}} consists of three letters {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|a}}, and {{angbr|t}}, in which {{angbr|c}} represents the sound {{IPAslink|k}}, {{angbr|a}} the sound {{IPAslink|\u00e6}}, and {{angbr|t}} the sound {{IPAslink|t}}.\n\nSequences of letters may perform this role as well as single letters. Thus, in the word ''ship'' (pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0283\u026ap/}}), the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|sh}} (two letters) represents the sound {{IPA|/\u0283/}}. In the word ''ditch'', the [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] {{angbr|tch}} represent the sound {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}.\n\nLess commonly, a single letter can represent multiple successive sounds. The most common example is the letter {{angbr|x}}, which normally represents the consonant cluster {{IPA|/ks/}} (for example, in the word ''six'', pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8s\u026aks/}}).\n\nThe same letter (or sequence of letters) may be pronounced in different ways when it occurs in different positions within a word. For instance, the digraph {{angbr|gh}} represents the sound {{IPA|/f/}} at the end of some words, such as ''rough'' {{IPA|/\u02c8r\u028cf/}}. At the beginning of syllables (i.e. the [[syllable onset]]), the digraph {{angbr|gh}} is pronounced {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, as in the word ''ghost'' (pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0261o\u028ast/}}). Conversely, the digraph {{angbr|gh}} is never pronounced {{IPA|/f/}} in syllable onsets and is almost never pronounced {{IPA|/\u0261/}} in [[syllable coda]]s (the proper name ''Pittsburgh'' is an exception).\n\nSome words contain [[silent letter]]s, which do not represent any sound in modern English pronunciation. Examples include the {{angbr|b}} in ''doubt'', ''debt'', ''dumb'', etc., the {{angbr|p}} in ''psychology'' and ''pneumatic'', and the commonly encountered [[silent e|silent {{angbr|e}}]] (discussed further below).\n\n=== Word origin ===\n{{See also|Hard and soft C|Hard and soft G|Silent k|Palatalization (phonetics)}}\n\nAnother type of spelling characteristic is related to word origin. For example, when representing a vowel, the letter {{angbr|y}} represents the sound {{IPAslink|\u026a}} in some words [[Loanword|borrowed]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] (reflecting an original [[upsilon]]), whereas the letter usually representing this sound in non-Greek words is the letter {{angbr|i}}. Thus, the word ''myth'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|\u026a|\u03b8}} is of Greek origin, while ''pith'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u026a|\u03b8}} is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word. Other examples include {{angbr|ph}} pronounced {{IPAslink|f}} (which is usually spelt {{angbr|f}}), and {{angbr|ch}} pronounced {{IPAslink|k}} (which is usually spelt {{angbr|c}} or {{angbr|k}}) \u2013 the use of these spellings for these sounds often mark [[English words of Greek origin|words that have been borrowed from Greek]].\n\nSome researchers, such as Brengelman (1970), have suggested that, in addition to this marking of word origin, these spellings indicate a more formal level of [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] or [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] in a given text, although Rollings (2004) finds this point to be exaggerated as there would be many exceptions where a word with one of these spellings, such as {{angbr|ph}} for {{IPAslink|f}} (like ''telephone''), could occur in an informal text.\n\n=== Homophone differentiation ===\n\nSpelling may also be useful to distinguish between [[homophone]]s (words with the same pronunciation but different meanings), although in most cases the reason for the difference is historical and was not introduced for the purpose of making a distinction. For example, the words ''heir'' and ''air'' are pronounced identically in most dialects, but in writing they are distinguished from each other by their different spellings. Another example is the pair of homophones ''pain'' and ''pane'', where both are pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|e\u026a|n}} but have two different spellings of the vowel {{IPAslink|e\u026a}}. Often this is because of the historical pronunciation of each word where, over time, two separate sounds become the same but the different spellings remain: ''pain'' used to be pronounced as {{IPA|/\u02c8pain/}}, with a diphthong, and ''pane'' as {{IPA|/\u02c8pe\u02d0n/}}, but the diphthong {{IPA|/ai/}} merged with the long vowel {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} in ''pane'', making ''pain'' and ''pane'' homophones ([[Phonological history of English diphthongs#Pane\u2013pain merger|''pane''\u2013''pain'' merger]]). Later {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} became a diphthong {{IPA|/e\u026a/}}.\n\nIn [[written language]], this may help to resolve potential [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] that would arise otherwise (cf. ''He's breaking the car'' vs. ''He's braking the car''). Nevertheless, many homophones remain that are unresolved by spelling (for example, the word ''[[wikt:bay|bay]]'' has at least five fundamentally different meanings).\n\n=== Marking sound changes in other letters ===\n{{See also|Silent e|Double letter}}\n\nSome letters in English provide information about the pronunciation of ''other'' letters in the word. Rollings (2004) uses the term \"markers\" for such letters. Letters may mark different types of information. For instance, the letter {{angbr|e}} in the word ''cottage'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u0252|t|\u026a|d\u0292}} indicates that the preceding {{angbr|g}} is pronounced {{IPAslink|d\u0292}}, rather than the more common value of {{angbr|g}} in word-final position as the sound {{IPAslink|\u0261}}, such as in ''tag'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|\u00e6|\u0261}}. The letter {{angbr|e}} also often marks an altered pronunciation of a preceding vowel. In the pair ''ban'' and ''bane'', the {{angbr|a}} of ''ban'' has the value {{IPAslink|\u00e6}}, whereas the {{angbr|a}} of ''bane'' is marked by the {{angbr|e}} as having the value {{IPAslink|e\u026a}}.  In this context, the {{angbr|e}} is not pronounced, and is referred to as \"[[silent e]]\".\nA single letter may even fill multiple pronunciation-marking roles simultaneously. For example, in the word ''wage'', the {{angbr|e}} marks not only the change of the {{angbr|a}} from {{IPAslink|\u00e6}} to {{IPAslink|e\u026a}}, but also of the {{angbr|g}} from {{IPAslink|\u0261}} to {{IPAslink|d\u0292}}.\n\n[[Double letter|Doubled consonants]] usually indicate that the preceding vowel is pronounced short. For example, the doubled {{angbr|t}} in ''latter'' indicates that the {{vr|a}} is pronounced {{IPAslink|\u00e6}}, while the single {{angbr|t}} of ''later'' gives {{IPAslink|e\u026a}}. Doubled consonants only indicate any lengthening or [[gemination]] of the consonant sound itself when they come from different morphemes, as with the {{angbr|nn}} in ''unnatural'' = ''un+natural''.\n\n=== Multiple functionality ===\n\nA given letter or (letters) may have dual functions. For example, the letter {{angbr|i}} in the word ''cinema'' has a sound-representing function (representing the sound {{IPAslink|\u026a}}) and a pronunciation-marking function (marking the {{angbr|c}} as having the value {{IPAslink|s}} opposed to the value {{IPAslink|k}}).\n\n=== Underlying representation ===\n\nLike many other alphabetic orthographies, English spelling does not represent non-contrastive [[phonetics|phonetic]] sounds (that is, minor differences in pronunciation which are not used to distinguish between different words). Although the letter {{angbr|t}} is pronounced by some speakers with [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} at the beginning of words, this is never indicated in the spelling, and, indeed, this phonetic detail is probably not noticeable to the average native speaker not trained in phonetics. However, unlike some orthographies, English orthography often represents a very abstract [[underlying representation]] (or [[morphophonology|morphophonemic]] form) of English words.<ref>Rollings 2004: 16-19; Chomsky & Halle 1968; Chomsky 1970</ref>\n\n{{quote| [T]he postulated underlying forms are systematically related to the conventional orthography ... and are, as is well known, related to the underlying forms of a much earlier historical stage of the language. There has, in other words, been little change in lexical representation since [[Middle English]], and, consequently, we would expect ... that [[lexicon|lexical]] representation would differ very little from dialect to dialect in [[Modern English]] ... [and] that conventional orthography is probably fairly close to optimal for all modern English dialects, as well as for the attested dialects of the past several hundred years.<ref>Chomsky & Halle 1968:54</ref>}}\n\nIn these cases, a given [[morpheme]] (i.e. a component of a word) has a fixed spelling even though it is pronounced differently in different words. An example is the [[past tense]] [[suffix]] -{{angbr|ed}}, which may be pronounced variously as {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, or {{IPA|/\u1d7bd/}}<ref name=schwi>The vowel of the suffixes -{{angbr|ed}} and -{{angbr|es}} may belong to the phoneme of either {{IPA|/\u026a/}} or {{IPA|/\u0259/}} depending on dialect, and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u1d7b}}}} is a shorthand for \"either {{IPA|/\u026a/}} or {{IPA|/\u0259/}}\". This usage of the symbol is borrowed from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.</ref> (for example, ''dip'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|\u026a|p}}, ''dipped'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|\u026a|p|t}}, ''boom'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|u\u02d0|m}}, ''boomed'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|u\u02d0|m|d}}, ''loot'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|u\u02d0|t}}, ''looted'' {{IPA|/\u02c8lu\u02d0t\u1d7bd/}}). As it happens, these different pronunciations of -{{angbr|ed}} can be predicted by a few [[phonology|phonological]] rules, but that is not the reason why its spelling is fixed.\n\nAnother example involves the vowel differences (with accompanying stress pattern changes) in several related words. For instance, the word ''photographer'' is derived from the word ''photograph'' by adding the [[Morphological derivation|derivational]] suffix -{{angbr|er}}. When this suffix is added, the vowel pronunciations change largely owing to the moveable stress:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"4\"\n\n! Spelling\n! Pronunciation\n|-\n| ''photograph''\n| {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|o\u028a|t|\u0259|\u0261|r|\u00e6|f}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|o\u028a|t|\u0259|\u0261|r|\u0251\u02d0|f}}\n|-\n| ''photographer''\n| {{IPAc-en|f|\u0259|\u02c8|t|\u0252|\u0261|r|\u0259|f|\u0259r}}\n|-\n| ''photographical''\n| {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|f|o\u028a|t|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0261|r|\u00e6|f|\u026a|k|\u0259l}}\n|}\n\nOther examples of this type are the -{{angbr|ity}} suffix (as in ''agile'' vs ''agility'', ''acid'' vs ''acidity'', ''divine'' vs ''divinity'', ''sane'' vs ''sanity''). See also: [[Trisyllabic laxing]].\n\nAnother such class of words includes ''sign'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|a\u026a|n}} and ''bomb'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u0252|m}} with \"silent\" letters {{angbr|g}} and {{angbr|b}}, respectively. However, in the related words ''signature'' and ''bombard'' these letters are pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u026a|\u0261|n|\u0259|t\u0283|\u0259r}} and {{IPAc-en|b|\u0252|m|\u02c8|b|\u0251\u02d0r|d}}, respectively. Here it could be argued that the underlying representation of ''sign'' and ''bomb'' is |{{IPA|sa\u026a\u0261n}}| and |{{IPA|b\u0252mb}}|, in which the underlying |{{IPA|\u0261}}| and |{{IPA|b}}| are only pronounced in the surface forms when followed by certain suffixes (-{{angbr|ature}}, -{{angbr|ard}}). Otherwise, the |{{IPA|\u0261}}| and |{{IPA|b}}| are not realized in the surface pronunciation (e.g. when standing alone, or when followed by suffixes like -{{angbr|ing}} or -{{angbr|er}}). In these cases, the orthography indicates the underlying consonants that are present in certain words but are absent in other related words. Other examples include the {{angbr|t}} in ''fast'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u0251\u02d0|s|t}} and ''fasten'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u0251\u02d0|s|\u0259n}}, and the {{angbr|h}} in ''heir'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b\u0259r}} and ''inherit'' {{IPAc-en|\u026a|n|\u02c8|h|\u025br|\u026a|t}}.\n\nAnother example includes words like ''mean'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|i\u02d0|n}} and ''meant'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|\u025b|n|t}}. Here the vowel spelling {{angbr|ea}} is pronounced differently in the two related words. Thus, again the orthography uses only a single spelling that corresponds to the single morphemic form rather than to the surface phonological form.\n\nEnglish orthography does not always provide an underlying representation; sometimes it provides an intermediate representation between the underlying form and the surface pronunciation. This is the case with the spelling of the regular [[plural]] morpheme, which is written as either -{{angbr|s}} (as in ''tick, ticks'' and ''mite, mites'') or -{{angbr|es}} (as in ''box, boxes''). Here the spelling -{{angbr|s}} is pronounced either {{IPAslink|s}} or {{IPAslink|z}} (depending on the environment, e.g. ''ticks'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|\u026a|k|s}} and ''pigs'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u026a|\u0261|z}}) while -{{angbr|es}} is usually pronounced {{IPA|/\u1d7bz/}}<ref name=schwi/> (e.g. ''boxes'' {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0252ks\u1d7bz/}}). Thus, there are two different spellings that correspond to the single underlying representation |{{IPA|z}}| of the plural suffix and the three surface forms. The spelling indicates the [[Epenthesis|insertion]] of {{IPA|/\u1d7b/}} before the {{IPA|/z/}} in the spelling -{{angbr|es}}, but does not indicate the [[Voice (phonetics)|devoiced]] {{IPA|/s/}} distinctly from the unaffected {{IPA|/z/}} in the spelling -{{angbr|s}}.\n\nThe abstract representation of words as indicated by the orthography can be considered advantageous since it makes etymological relationships more apparent to English readers. This makes writing English more complex, but arguably makes reading English more efficient.<ref>Chomsky 1970:294; Rollings 2004:17</ref> However, very abstract underlying representations, such as that of Chomsky & Halle (1968) or of [[underspecification]] theories, are sometimes considered too abstract to accurately reflect the [[communicative competence]] of native speakers. Followers of these arguments believe the less abstract surface forms are more \"psychologically real\" and thus more useful in terms of [[pedagogy]].<ref>Rollings 2004:17\u201319</ref>\n\n== Diacritics ==\n{{Main|English terms with diacritical marks}}\n\n{{See also|British and American keyboards|keyboard layouts}}\n\nEnglish has some words that can be written with accent marks. These words have mostly been imported from other languages, usually French.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegoodlifefrance.com/common-french-words-also-common-in-english/|title=Common French words also common in English|website=The Good Life France|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> As imported words become increasingly naturalised, there is an increasing tendency to omit the accent marks, even in formal writing. For example, words such as ''r\u00f4le'' and ''h\u00f4tel'' were first seen with accents when they were borrowed into English, but now the accent is almost never used. The words were originally considered foreign \u2013 and some people considered that English alternatives were preferable \u2013 but today their foreign origin is largely forgotten. Words most likely to retain the accent are those atypical of English morphology and therefore still perceived as slightly foreign. For example, ''caf\u00e9'' and ''p\u00e2t\u00e9'' both have a pronounced final ''e'', which would otherwise be silent under the normal English pronunciation rules. However ''caf\u00e9''{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} is now sometimes facetiously pronounced \"caff\", while in ''p\u00e2t\u00e9'', the acute accent is helpful to distinguish it from ''pate''.\n\nFurther examples of words sometimes retaining diacritics when used in English are: \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (partly because the scientific symbol for this unit of measurement is \"\u00c5\"), ''appliqu\u00e9'', ''attach\u00e9'', ''blas\u00e9'', ''bric-\u00e0-brac'', ''Br\u00f6tchen'',<ref name=\"Webster\">Included in [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]],1981</ref> ''clich\u00e9'', ''cr\u00e8me'', ''cr\u00eape'', ''fa\u00e7ade'', ''fianc\u00e9(e)'', ''flamb\u00e9'', ''na\u00efve'', ''na\u00efvet\u00e9'', ''n\u00e9(e)'', ''papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9'', ''pass\u00e9'', ''pi\u00f1ata'', ''prot\u00e9g\u00e9'', ''r\u00e9sum\u00e9'', ''risqu\u00e9'', ''\u00fcber-'', ''voil\u00e0''. [[Italic type|Italics]], with appropriate accents, are generally applied to foreign terms that are uncommonly used in or have not been assimilated into English: for example, ''[[wikt:Special:Search/adi\u00f3s|adi\u00f3s]], [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]], [[pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance]], [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]], [[\u00fcber]], [[wikt:vis-\u00e0-vis|vis-\u00e0-vis]], and [[wikt:belles-lettres|belles-lettres]].''\n\nIt was formerly common in American English to use a [[umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis mark]] to indicate a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]: for example, ''co\u00f6perate'', ''da\u00efs'', ''re\u00eblect''. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[Technology Review]]'' magazines still use it for this purpose, even though it is increasingly rare in modern English. Nowadays the diaeresis is normally left out (''cooperate''), or a hyphen is used (''co-operate'') if the hiatus is between two morphemes in a compound word. It is, however, still common in monomorphemic loanwords such as ''na\u00efve'' and ''No\u00ebl''.\n\nWritten accents are also used occasionally in [[poetry]] and scripts for [[drama]]tic performances to indicate that a certain normally unstressed syllable in a word should be stressed for dramatic effect, or to keep with the metre of the poetry. This use is frequently seen in archaic and pseudoarchaic writings with the ''-ed'' suffix, to indicate that the ''e'' should be fully pronounced, as with ''curs\u00e8d''.\n\nThe acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (r\u00e9bel vs. reb\u00e9l) or nonstandard for metrical reasons (cal\u00e9ndar); the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (warn\u00e8d, parl\u00ecament).\n\n== {{anchor|\u00e6|ae|\u0153|oe}}Ligatures ==\n{{See also|American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe}}\nIn certain older texts (typically [[British English|British]]), the use of the [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] \u00e6 and \u0153 is common in words such as ''arch\u00e6ology'', ''diarrh\u0153a'', and ''encyclop\u00e6dia''. Such words have [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] origin. Nowadays, the ligatures have been generally replaced in British English by the separated [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ae'' and ''oe'' (''encyclopaedia'', ''diarrhoea''); but usually ''economy'', ''ecology, '' and in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]] by ''e'' (''encyclopedia'', ''diarrhea''; but usually ''paean'', ''amoeba'', ''oedipal'', ''Caesar''). In some cases, usage may vary; for instance, both ''encyclopedia'' and ''encyclopaedia'' are current in the UK.\n\n== Phonic irregularities ==\n{{See also|English spelling reform}}\n\nPartly because English has never had any official regulating authority for spelling, such as the Spanish ''[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]'', the French ''[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]'', and the German ''[[Council for German Orthography|Rat f\u00fcr deutsche Rechtschreibung]]'', English spelling, compared to many other languages, is quite irregular and complex. Although French, among other languages, presents a similar degree of difficulty when ''encoding'' (writing), English is more difficult when ''decoding'' (reading), as there are clearly many more possible pronunciations of a group of letters. For example, in French, the {{IPA|/u/}} sound (as in \"food\", but short), can be spelled ''ou'', ''ous'', ''out'', or ''oux'' (''ou'', ''nous'', ''tout'', ''choux''), but the pronunciation of each of those sequences is always the same. In English, the {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} sound can be spelled in up to 18 different ways (see the [[#Sound-to-spelling correspondences|Sound-to-spelling correspondences]] section below), including ''oo'', ''u'', ''ui'', ''ue'', ''o'', ''oe'', ''ou'', ''ough'', and ''ew'' (''food'', ''truth'', ''fruit'', ''blues'', ''to'', ''shoe'', ''group'', ''through'', ''grew''), but all of these have other pronunciations as well (e.g. as in ''flood'', ''trust'', ''build'', ''bluest'', ''go'', ''hoe'', ''grout'', ''rough'', ''sew''). The [[#Spelling-to-sound correspondences|Spelling-to-sound correspondences]] section below presents a summary of pronunciation variations. Thus, in unfamiliar words and [[proper nouns]] the pronunciation of some sequences, ''[[Ough (orthography)|ough]]'' being the prime example, is unpredictable to even educated native English speakers.\n\n== Spelling irregularities ==\n\nAttempts to regularize or [[English-language spelling reform|reform the spelling]] of English have usually failed. However, [[Noah Webster]] popularized more phonetic spellings in the United States, such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and so forth. These spellings already existed as alternatives, but Webster's dictionaries helped make them standard in the US.<ref>Algeo, John. \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language\", in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.599</ref> See [[American and British English spelling differences]] for details.\n\nBesides the quirks the English spelling system has inherited from its past, there are other idiosyncrasies in spelling that make it tricky to learn. English contains, depending on [[dialect]], 24\u201327 separate [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s and 13\u201320 [[vowel]]s. However, there are only 26 letters in the modern [[English alphabet]], so there is not a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. Many sounds are spelled using different letters or multiple letters, and for those words whose pronunciation is predictable from the spelling, the sounds denoted by the letters depend on the surrounding letters. For example, the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'' represents two different sounds (the [[voiced dental fricative]] and the [[voiceless dental fricative]]) (see [[Pronunciation of English th|Pronunciation of English ''th'']]), and the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] can be represented by the letters ''s'' and ''c''.\n\nIt is, however, not the shortage of letters which makes English spelling irregular. Its irregularities are caused mainly by the use of many different spellings for some of its sounds, such as the sounds /u\u02d0/, /i\u02d0/ and /o\u028a/ (''t'''oo''''', ''tr'''ue''''', ''sh'''oe''''', ''fl'''ew''''', ''thr'''ough'''''; ''sl'''ee'''ve'', ''l'''ea'''ve'', '''''e'''ven'', ''s'''ei'''ze'', ''s'''ie'''ge''; ''st'''o'''l'''e''''', ''c'''oa'''l'', ''b'''ow'''l'', ''r'''ol'''l'', '''''o'''ld'', ''m'''ou'''ld''), and the use of identical sequences for spelling different sounds ('''''ove'''r'', '''''ove'''n'', ''m'''ove''''').\n\nFurthermore, English no longer makes any attempt to anglicise the spellings of [[loanword]]s, but preserves the foreign spellings, even when they employ exotic conventions like the [[Polish language|Polish]] ''cz'' in ''Czech'' (rather than ''*Check'') or the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''fj'' in ''fjord'' (although ''fiord'' was formerly the most common spelling). In early Middle English, until roughly 1400, most imports from French were respelt according to English rules (e.g. ''bataille''\u2013''battle'', ''bouton''\u2013''button'', but not ''double'', or ''trouble''). Instead of loans being respelled to conform to English spelling standards, sometimes the pronunciation changes as a result of pressure from the spelling. One example of this is the word ''[[ski]]'', which was adopted from Norwegian in the mid-18th century, although it did not become common until 1900. It used to be pronounced {{IPA|/\u0283i\u02d0/}}, which is similar to the Norwegian pronunciation, but the increasing popularity of the sport after the middle of the 20th century helped the {{IPA|/ski\u02d0/}} pronunciation replace it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nThere was also a period when the spelling of a small number of words was altered in what is now regarded as a misguided attempt to make them conform to what were perceived to be the etymological origins of the words. For example, the letter ''b'' was added to ''debt'' (originally ''dette'') in an attempt to link it to the Latin ''debitum'', and the letter ''s'' in ''island'' is a misplaced attempt to link it to Latin ''insula'' instead of the Old English word ''\u012b\u0121land'', which is the true origin of the English word. The letter ''p'' in ''[[Rock Ptarmigan|ptarmigan]]'' has no etymological justification whatsoever, only seeking to invoke Greek despite being a Gaelic word.\n\nThe spelling of English continues to evolve. Many loanwords come from languages where the pronunciation of vowels corresponds to the way they were pronounced in Old English, which is similar to the Italian or Spanish pronunciation of the vowels, and is the value the vowel symbols {{IPA|[a], [e], [i], [o],}} and {{IPA|[u]}} have in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. As a result, there is a somewhat regular system of pronouncing \"foreign\" words in English, {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and some borrowed words have had their spelling changed to conform to this system. For example, ''[[Hindu]]'' used to be spelled ''Hindoo'', and the name ''Maria'' used to be pronounced like the name ''Mariah'', but was changed to conform to this system.\n\nCommercial advertisers have also had an effect on English spelling. They introduced new or simplified spellings like ''lite'' instead of ''light'', ''thru'' instead of ''through'', ''smokey'' instead of ''smoky'' (for \"smokey bacon\" flavour crisps), and ''rucsac'' instead of ''rucksack''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The spellings of personal names have also been a source of spelling innovations: diminutive versions of women's names that sound the same as men's names have been spelled differently: ''Nikki'' and ''Nicky'', ''Toni'' and ''Tony'', ''Jo'' and ''Joe''.\n\nAs examples of the idiosyncratic nature of English spelling, the combination ''ou'' can be pronounced in at least nine different ways: {{IPAslink|a\u028a}} in ''out'', {{IPAslink|o\u028a}} in ''soul'', {{IPAslink|u\u02d0}} in ''soup'', {{IPAslink|\u028c}} in ''touch'', {{IPAslink|\u028a}} in ''could'', {{IPAslink|\u0254\u02d0}} in ''four'',  {{IPAslink|\u025c\u02d0}} in ''journal'', {{IPAslink|\u0252}} in ''cough'', and {{IPAslink|\u0259}} in ''famous''. See the section [[English orthography#Spelling-to-sound correspondences|Spelling-to-sound correspondences]] for a comprehensive treatment. In the other direction, the vowel sound {{IPAslink|i\u02d0}} in ''me'' can be spelt in at least 18 or 21 different ways: b'''e''' (c'''e'''d'''e'''), sk'''i''' (mach'''i'''n'''e'''), bologn'''a''' <small>(GA)</small>, alg'''ae''', qu'''ay''', b'''ea'''ch, b'''ee''', dec'''ei'''t, p'''eo'''ple, k'''ey''', voll'''eye'''d, f'''ie'''ld (hyg'''ie'''n'''e'''), am'''oe'''ba, cham'''oi'''s, deng'''ue''', beg'''ui'''ne, g'''uy'''ot, and cit'''y'''. See the section [[English orthography#Sound-to-spelling correspondences|Sound-to-spelling correspondences]] below. (These examples assume a more-or-less standard non-regional British English accent. Other accents will vary.)\n\nSometimes everyday speakers of English change a counterintuitive pronunciation simply because it is counterintuitive. Changes like this are not usually seen as \"standard\", but can become standard if used enough. An example is the word ''miniscule'', which still competes with its original spelling of ''minuscule'', though this might also be because of analogy with the word ''mini''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/minuscule-or-miniscule|title=Minuscule or miniscule? {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=minuscule|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> A further example is the modern pronunciation of ''tissue''. {{specify|date=April 2013}}\n\n=== History ===\n\nInconsistencies and irregularities in English pronunciation and spelling have gradually increased in number throughout the [[history of the English language]]. There are a number of contributing factors. First, gradual changes in pronunciation, such as the [[Great Vowel Shift]], account for a tremendous number of irregularities. Second, relatively recent [[loan word]]s from other languages generally carry their original spellings, which are often not [[phonetics|phonetic]] in English. The [[Romanization]] of languages (e.g., [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) using alphabets derived from the [[Latin alphabet]] has further complicated this problem, for example when pronouncing Chinese proper names (of people or places).\n\nThe regular spelling system of [[Old English language|Old English]] was swept away by the [[Norman Conquest]], and English itself was supplanted in some spheres by [[Norman French]] for three centuries, eventually emerging with its spelling much influenced by French. English had also borrowed large numbers of words from French, which naturally kept their French spellings as there was no reason or mechanism to change them. The spelling of [[Middle English]], such as in the writings of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], is very irregular and inconsistent, with the same word being spelled in different ways, sometimes even in the same sentence. However, these were generally much better guides to the then pronunciation than modern English spelling is.\n\nFor example, the sound {{IPAslink|\u028c}}, normally written ''u'', is spelled with an ''o'' in ''son'', ''love'', ''come'', etc., due to Norman spelling conventions which prohibited writing ''u'' before ''v'', ''m'', ''n'' due to the graphical confusion that would result. (''v'', ''u'', ''n'' were identically written with two [[minim (palaeography)|minims]] in Norman handwriting; ''w'' was written as two ''u'' letters; ''m'' was written with three [[minim (palaeography)|minims]], hence ''mm'' looked like ''vun'', ''nvu'', ''uvu'', etc.) Similarly, spelling conventions also prohibited final ''v''. Hence the identical spellings of the three different vowel sounds in ''love'', ''grove'' and ''prove'' are due to ambiguity in the [[Middle English]] spelling system, not sound change.\n\nIn 1417 [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] began using English for official correspondence, which had no standardized spelling, instead of Latin or French which had standardized spelling. For example, for the word ''right'', Latin had one spelling'', rectus;'' Old French as used in English law had 6 spellings, Middle English had 77 spellings. English, now used as the official replacement language for Latin and French, motivated writers to standardize spellings, an effort which lasted about 500 years.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=word%20by%20word%20kory%20stamper|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=38\u201339|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a series of linguistic sound changes towards the end of this period, including the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which resulted in the ''i'' in ''mine'', for example, changing from a pure vowel to a diphthong. These changes for the most part did not detract from the rule-governed nature of the spelling system; but in some cases they introduced confusing inconsistencies, like the well-known example of the many pronunciations of ''ough'' (''rough'', ''through'', ''though'', ''trough'', ''plough'', etc.). Most of these changes happened before the arrival of printing in England. However, the arrival of the printing press froze the current system, rather than providing the impetus for a realignment of spelling with pronunciation. Furthermore, it introduced further inconsistencies, partly because of the use of typesetters trained abroad, particularly in the [[Low Countries]]. For example, the ''h'' in ''ghost'' was influenced by Dutch.<ref name=\"wolman\" /> The addition and deletion of a silent ''e'' at the ends of words was also sometimes used to make the right-hand margin line up more neatly.<ref name=\"wolman\">Righting the Mother Tongue: From Olde English to Email, the Twisted Story of English Spelling, by David Wolman.

By the 19th century, most words had set spellings, though it took some time before they diffused throughout the English-speaking world. In [[The Mill on the Floss]] (1860), English novelist [[George Eliot]] satirized the attitude of the English rural gentry of the 1820s towards orthography:\n\n: Mr. Tulliver did not willingly write a letter, and found the relation between spoken and written language, briefly known as spelling, one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world. Nevertheless, like all fervid writing, the task was done in less time than usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs. Glegg's,\u2013why, she belonged, like himself, to a generation with whom spelling was a matter of private judgment.\n\nThe modern English spelling system, with its national variants, spread together with the expansion of public education later in the 19th century.\n\n=== \"Ough\" words ===\n{{Main|Ough (orthography)}}\n\nThe most notorious group of letters in the English language, ''ough'', is commonly pronounced in at least ten different ways, six of which are illustrated in the construct, ''Though the tough cough and hiccough plough him through'', which is quoted by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' to illustrate the difficulties facing automated speech transcription and reading. ''Ough'', usually representing a pronunciation of roughly {{IPAc-en|\u028a|x}}, is in fact a word in its own right, though rarely known or used: an exclamation of disgust similar to ''ugh''. The following are recorded throughout Englishes of the world:\n\n* {{IPAc-en|o\u028a}} (as in ''t'''oe''''') for ''though'' and ''dough''\n* {{IPAc-en|\u028c|f}} (as in ''c'''uff''''') for  ''tough'', ''rough'', ''enough'', and the name ''Hough''\n* {{IPAc-en|\u0252|f}} (as in '''''off''''') for ''trough'', ''cough'', and ''Gough''\n* {{IPAc-en|u\u02d0}} (as in ''bl'''ue''''') for ''through''\n* {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}} (as in ''c'''augh'''t'') for ''thought'', ''ought'', ''sought'', ''nought'', ''brought'', etc.\n* {{IPAc-en|\u0259}} (as in ''comm'''a''''') for ''thorough'', ''borough'', and names ending in ''-borough''; however, American English pronounces this as {{IPAc-en|o\u028a}}\n* {{IPAc-en|a\u028a}} (as in ''c'''ow''''') as in ''bough'', ''sough'', ''drought'', ''plough'' (''plow'' in North America), ''doughty'', and the names ''Slough'' and ''Doughty''\n\nThe following pronunciations are found in uncommon single words:\n* ''hough'': {{IPAc-en|\u0252|k}} (more commonly spelt \"hock\" now)\n* ''hiccough'' (a now uncommon variant of ''hiccup''): {{IPAc-en|\u028c|p}} as in '''''up''''' (unique)\n* ''lough'': {{IPAc-en|\u0252|x}} with a velar fricative like the '''ch''' in ''loch'', of which ''lough'' is an anglicized spelling\n\nThe place name [[Loughborough]] uses two different pronunciations of ''ough'': the first ''ough'' has the sound as in ''c'''uff''''' and the second rhymes with ''thorough''.\n\n== Spelling patterns ==\n{{see also|Help:IPA/English}}\n\n=== Spelling-to-sound correspondences ===\n\n==== Vowels ====\n\nIn a [[generative linguistics|generative]] approach to English spelling, Rollings (2004) identifies twenty main orthographic vowels of [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllables that are grouped into four main categories: \"Lax\", \"Tense\", \"Heavy\", \"Tense-R\". (As this classification is based on orthography, not all orthographic \"lax\" vowels are necessarily phonologically [[Lax vowel#Comparison between tense and lax vowels|lax]].)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

Heavy and tense-r vowels are the respective lax and tense counterparts followed by the letter ''r''.\n\nTense vowels are distinguished from lax vowels with a [[Silent e|\"silent\" ''e'']] letter that is added at the end of words. Thus, the letter ''a'' in ''hat'' is lax {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, but when the letter ''e'' is added in the word ''hate'' the letter ''a'' is tense {{IPA|/e\u026a/}}. Similarly, heavy and tense-r vowels pattern together: the letters ''ar'' in ''car'' are heavy {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0r/}}, the letters ''ar'' followed by silent ''e'' in the word ''care'' are {{IPA|/\u025b\u0259r/}}. The letter ''u'' represents two different vowel patterns, one being {{IPA|/\u028c/, /ju\u02d0/, /\u0259/, /j\u028a/}}, the other {{IPA|/\u028a/, /u\u02d0/, /\u028a/}}. There is no distinction between heavy and tense-r vowels with the letter ''o'', and the letter ''u'' in the {{IPA|/\u028a-u\u02d0-\u028a/}} pattern does not have a heavy vowel member.\n\nBesides silent ''e'', another strategy for indicating tense and tense-r vowels, is the addition of another orthographic vowel forming a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]. In this case, the first vowel is usually the main vowel while the second vowel is the \"marking\" vowel. For example, the word ''man'' has a lax ''a'' pronounced {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, but with the addition of ''i'' (as the digraph ''ai'') in the word ''main'' the ''a'' is marked as tense and pronounced {{IPA|/e\u026a/}}. These two strategies produce words that are spelled differently but pronounced identically, as in ''mane'' (silent ''e'' strategy), ''main'' (digraph strategy) and ''Maine'' (both strategies). The use of two different strategies relates to the function of distinguishing between words that would otherwise be homonyms.\n\nBesides the 20 basic vowel spellings, Rollings (2004) has a [[Unstressed and reduced vowels in English|reduced vowel]] category (representing the sounds {{IPA|/\u0259, \u026a/}}) and a miscellaneous category (representing the sounds {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a, a\u028a, a\u026a, a\u028a/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}+V, {{IPA|/w/}}+V, V+V).\n\n==== Combinations of vowel letters ====\n\nTo reduce dialectal difficulties, the sound values given here correspond to the conventions at [[Help:IPA/English]]. This table includes H, W and Y when they represent vowel sounds. If no information is given, it is assumed that the vowel is in a stressed syllable.\n\nDeriving the pronunciation of an English word from its spelling requires not only a careful knowledge of the rules given below (many of which are not explicitly known even by native speakers: speakers merely learn the spelling of a word along with its pronunciation) and their many exceptions, but also:\n\n* a knowledge of which syllables are stressed and which are unstressed (not derivable from the spelling: compare ''hallow'' and ''allow'')\n* which combinations of vowels represent monosyllables and which represent disyllables (ditto: compare ''waif'' and ''naif'', ''creature'' and ''creator'')\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! colspan=2 | Spelling || Major

His epithet does not derive from the modern word \"[[wikt:unready|unready]]\", but rather from the Old English ''unr\u00e6d'' (meaning \"poorly advised\"); it is a pun on his name, which means \"well advised\".\n\n\u00c6thelred was the son of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] and [[\u00c6lfthryth, wife of Edgar|Queen \u00c6lfthryth]]. He came to the throne at about the age of 12, following the assassination of his older half-brother, [[Edward the Martyr]]. His brother's murder was carried out by supporters of his own claim to the throne, although he was too young to have any personal involvement. The chief problem of \u00c6thelred's reign was conflict with the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]. After several decades of relative peace, Danish raids on English territory began again in earnest in the 980s. Following the [[Battle of Maldon]] in 991, \u00c6thelred  paid tribute, or [[Danegeld]], to the Danish king. In 1002, \u00c6thelred ordered what became known as the [[St. Brice's Day massacre]] of Danish settlers. In 1013, King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] of Denmark invaded England, as a result of which \u00c6thelred fled to [[Normandy]] in 1013 and was replaced by Sweyn. However, he returned as king for two years after Sweyn's death in 1014. \u00c6thelred's 37-year reign was the longest of any Anglo-Saxon king of England, and was only surpassed in the 13th century, by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. \u00c6thelred was briefly succeeded by his son, [[Edmund Ironside]], but he died after a few months and was replaced by Sweyn's son, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]]. Another of his sons, [[Edward the Confessor]], became king in 1042.\n\n==Name==\n\u00c6thelred's first name, composed of the elements ''[[Ethel|\u00e6\u00f0ele]]'', \"noble\", and ''r\u00e6d'', \"counsel, advice\",<ref name=\"bosworth1124\">Bosworth-Toller, ''An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'', with Supplement. p.1124</ref> is typical of the compound names of those who belonged to the royal [[House of Wessex]], and it characteristically alliterates with the names of his ancestors, like [[\u00c6thelwulf]] (\"noble-wolf\"), [[Alfred the Great|\u00c6lfred]] (\"elf-counsel\"), [[Edward the Martyr|Eadweard]] (\"rich-protection\"), and [[Edgar the Peaceful|Eadgar]] (\"rich-spear\").<ref>Schr\u00f6der, ''Deutsche Namenkunde''.</ref>\n\nThe story of \u00c6thelred's notorious nickname, [[Old English]] ''Unr\u00e6d'', goes a long way toward explaining how his reputation has declined through history{{dubious|date=May 2017}} It is usually translated into present-day English as \"The Unready\" (less often, though less confusingly, as \"The Redeless\").<ref>\"Ethelred the Redeless\" e.g. in {{cite book|last=Hodgkin|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Hodgkin|title=The History of England from the Earliest Times to the Norman Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUkNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA373|year=1808|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|page=373}} While ''[[wikt:rede|rede]]'' \"counsel\" survived into modern English, the negative ''unrede'' appears to fall out of use by the 15th century; c.f ''[[Richard the Redeless]]'', a 15th-century poem in reference to [[Richard II of England]].</ref> The Anglo-Saxon noun ''unr\u00e6d'' means \"evil counsel\", \"bad plan\", or \"folly\".<ref name=\"bosworth1124\"/> It most often describes decisions and deeds, and once refers to the nature of [[Fall of man|Satan's deceit]]. The element ''r\u00e6d'' in ''unr\u00e6d'' is the element in \u00c6thelred's name which means \"counsel\". Thus ''\u00c6\u00feelr\u00e6d Unr\u00e6d'' is a pun meaning \"Noble counsel, No counsel\". The nickname has alternatively been taken adjectivally as \"ill-advised\", \"ill-prepared\", \"indecisive\", thus \"\u00c6thelred the ill-advised\".\n\nBecause the nickname was first recorded in the 1180s, more than 150 years after \u00c6thelred's death, it is doubtful that it carries any implications for how the king was seen by his contemporaries or near contemporaries.<ref>Keynes, \"The Declining Reputation of King \u00c6thelred the Unready\", pp. 240\u20131. For this king's forebear of the same name, see [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex]].</ref><!--\n\n--><!-- There is much more to discuss here, and an interesting story to be told.

This would belong under \"Legacy\", not \"Name\". --><!--\n\n--><!--why is this under \"Name\"?\nAccording to  [[Chris Wickham]] (2009), \u00c6thelred was one of the most forceful kings of the 10th century, who ended the control of every one of the major magnate families over their ealdormanries in the two decades after 985, and although this was ultimately to prove to his disadvantage,  he maintained the strength to push all of them into private life in spite of the military crisis of the period.<ref>{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Wickham |chapter=Problems in Doing Comparative History |editor-last=Skinner |title=Challenging the Boundaries of Medieval History |pages=15, 22, 27 |location= |publisher= |year= 2009|isbn= }}</ref>\n-->\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Aethelred II gold mancus 1003 1006.jpg|thumb|Gold [[mancus]] of \u00c6thelred wearing armour, 1003\u20131006.]]\nSir [[Frank Stenton]] remarked that \"much that has brought condemnation of historians on King \u00c6thelred may well be due in the last resort to the circumstances under which he became king.\"<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 374.</ref> \u00c6thelred's father, King Edgar, had died suddenly in July 975, leaving two young sons behind. The elder, Edward (later [[Edward the Martyr]]), was probably illegitimate,<ref name = \"Hart\"/> and was \"still a youth on the verge of manhood\" in 975.<ref name=\"Stenton, p. 372\">Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 372.</ref> The younger son was \u00c6thelred, whose mother, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Queen of England|\u00c6lfthryth]], Edgar had married in 964. \u00c6lfthryth was the daughter of Ordgar, [[ealdorman]] of [[Devon]], and widow of [[\u00c6thelwold, Ealdorman of East Anglia]]. At the time of his father's death, \u00c6thelred could have been no more than 10 years old. As the elder of Edgar's sons, Edward \u2013 reportedly a young man given to frequent violent outbursts \u2013 probably would have naturally succeeded to the throne of England despite his young age, had not he \"offended many important persons by his intolerable violence of speech and behaviour.\"<ref name=\"Stenton, p. 372\"/> In any case, a number of English nobles took to opposing Edward's succession and to defending \u00c6thelred's claim to the throne; \u00c6thelred was, after all, the son of Edgar's last, living wife, and no rumour of illegitimacy is known to have plagued \u00c6thelred's birth, as it might have his elder brother's.<ref>Miller, \"Edward the Martyr.\"</ref>  Both boys, \u00c6thelred certainly, were too young to have played any significant part in the political manoeuvring which followed Edgar's death. It was the brothers' supporters, and not the brothers themselves, who were responsible for the turmoil which accompanied the choice of a successor to the throne. \u00c6thelred's cause was led by his mother and included [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia]] and Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester]],<ref>Higham, ''The Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 7\u20138; Stafford, ''Unification and Conquest'', p. 58.</ref> while Edward's claim was supported by [[Dunstan]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]], the [[Archbishop of York]]<ref>Phillips, \"St Edward the Martyr.\"</ref> among other noblemen, notably [[\u00c6thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia]], and [[Byrhtnoth]], ealdorman of [[Essex]]. In the end, Edward's supporters proved the more powerful and persuasive, and he was crowned king at [[Kingston upon Thames]] before the year was out.\n\nEdward reigned for only three years before he was murdered by members of his brother's household.<ref>Keynes, ''The Diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016'', p. 166.</ref> Though little is known about Edward's short reign, it is known that it was marked by political turmoil. Edgar had made extensive grants of land to monasteries which pursued the new monastic ideals of ecclesiastical reform, but these disrupted aristocratic families' traditional patronage. The end of his firm rule saw a reversal of this policy, with aristocrats recovering their lost properties or seizing new ones. This was opposed by Dunstan, but according to Cyril Hart, \"The presence of supporters of church reform on both sides indicates that the conflict between them depended as much on issues of land ownership and local power as on ecclesiastical legitimacy. Adherents of both Edward and \u00c6thelred can be seen appropriating, or recovering, monastic lands.\"<ref name = \"Hart\">{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Hart |first=Cyril |contribution= Edward the Martyr |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |chapterurl=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8515 |accessdate=9 November 2008 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> Nevertheless, favour for Edward must have been strong among the monastic communities. When Edward was killed at \u00c6thelred's estate at [[Corfe Castle]] in [[Dorset]] in March 978, the job of recording the event, as well as reactions to it, fell to monastic writers. Stenton offers a summary of the earliest account of Edward's murder, which comes from a work praising the life of St [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]]: \"On the surface his [Edward's] relations with \u00c6thelred his half-brother and \u00c6lfthryth his stepmother were friendly, and he was visiting them informally when he was killed. [\u00c6thelred's] retainers came out to meet him with ostentatious signs of respect, and then, before he had dismounted, surrounded him, seized his hands, and stabbed him. ... So far as can be seen the murder was planned and carried out by \u00c6thelred's household men in order that their young master might become king. There is nothing to support the allegation, which first appears in writing more than a century later, that Queen \u00c6lfthryth had plotted her stepson's death. No one was punished for a part in the crime, and \u00c6thelred, who was crowned a month after the murder, began to reign in an atmosphere of suspicion which destroyed the prestige of the crown. It was never fully restored in his lifetime.\"<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 373.</ref> Nevertheless, at first, the outlook of the new king's officers and counsellors seems in no way to have been bleak. According to one chronicler, the coronation of \u00c6thelred took place with much rejoicing by the councillors of the English people.<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\">Keynes, \"\u00c6thelred II ({{circa}}&nbsp;966x8\u20131016).\"</ref> [[Simon Keynes]] notes that \"[[Byrhtferth of Ramsey]] states similarly that when \u00c6thelred was consecrated king, by [[Archbishop Dunstan]] and [[Oswald of Worcester|Archbishop Oswald]], 'there was great joy at his consecration\u2019, and describes the king in this connection as 'a young man in respect of years, elegant in his manners, with an attractive face and handsome appearance'.\"<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/> \u00c6thelred could not have been older than 13 years of age in this year.\n\nDuring these early years, \u00c6thelred was developing a close relationship to \u00c6thelwold, bishop of Winchester, one who had supported his unsuccessful claim to the throne. When \u00c6thelwold died, on 1 August 984, \u00c6thelred deeply lamented the loss, and he wrote later in a [[charter]] from 993 that the event had deprived the country of one \"whose industry and pastoral care administered not only to my interest but also to that of all inhabitants of the country.\"<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/>\n\n==Conflict with the Danes==\nEngland had experienced a period of peace after the reconquest of the [[Danelaw]] in the mid-10th century by [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]], \u00c6thelred's father. However, beginning in 980, when \u00c6thelred could not have been more than 14 years old, small companies of Danish adventurers carried out a series of coastline raids against England. [[Hampshire]], [[Isle of Thanet|Thanet]] and [[Cheshire]] were attacked in 980, [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in 981, and [[Dorset]] in 982. A period of six years then passed before, in 988, another coastal attack is recorded as having taken place to the south-west, though here a famous battle was fought between the invaders and the [[thegn]]s of Devon. Stenton notes that, though this series of isolated raids had no lasting effect on England itself, \"their chief historical importance is that they brought England for the first time into diplomatic contact with [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]].\"<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 375.</ref> During this period, the Normans, who remembered their origins as a Scandinavian people, were well-disposed to their Danish cousins who, occasionally returning from a raid on England, sought port in Normandy. This led to grave tension between the English and Norman courts, and word of their enmity eventually reached [[Pope John XV]]. The pope was disposed to dissolve their hostility towards each other, and took steps to engineer a peace between England and Normandy, which was ratified in [[Rouen]] in 991.\n\n===Battle of Maldon===\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:map1000.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of England, {{circa}}&nbsp;1000]] -->\nHowever, in August of that same year, a sizeable Danish fleet began a sustained campaign in the south-east of England. It arrived off [[Folkestone]], in [[Kent]], and made its way around the south-east coast and up the [[River Blackwater, Essex|River Blackwater]], coming eventually to its estuary and occupying [[Northey Island]].<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/> About {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=off}} west of Northey lies the coastal town of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]], where [[Byrhtnoth]], ealdorman of [[Essex]], was stationed with a company of thegns. The [[Battle of Maldon|battle]] that followed between English and Danes is immortalised by the [[Old English]] poem ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]'', which describes the doomed but heroic attempt of Byrhtnoth to defend the coast of Essex against overwhelming odds. Stenton summarises the events of the poem: \"For access to the mainland they (the Danes) depended on a [[causeway]], flooded at high tide, which led from Northey to the flats along the southern margin of the estuary. Before they (the Danes) had left their camp on the island[,] Byrhtnoth, with his retainers and a force of local militia, had taken possession of the landward end of the causeway. Refusing a demand for tribute, shouted across the water while the tide was high, Byrhtnoth drew up his men along the bank, and waited for the ebb. As the water fell the raiders began to stream out along the causeway. But three of Byrthnoth's retainers held it against them, and at last they asked to be allowed to cross unhindered and fight on equal terms on the mainland. With what even those who admired him most called 'over-courage', Byrhtnoth agreed to this; the pirates rushed through the falling tide, and battle was joined. Its issue was decided by Byrhtnoth's fall. Many even of his own men immediately took to flight and the English ranks were broken. What gives enduring interest to the battle is the superb courage with which a group of Byrhtnoth's thegns, knowing that the fight was lost, deliberately gave themselves to death in order that they might avenge their lord.\"<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 376\u201377.</ref> This was the first of a series of crushing defeats felt by the English: beaten first by Danish raiders, and later by organised Danish armies.\n\n===England begins tributes===\n[[File:Silver penny of Aethelred II (YORYM 2000 632) obverse.jpg|thumb|Silver penny of \u00c6thelred II]]\nIn 991, \u00c6thelred was around 24 years old. In the aftermath of Maldon, it was decided that the English should grant the tribute to the Danes that they desired, and so a ''gafol'' of \u00a310,000 was paid them for their peace. Yet it was presumably the Danish fleet that had beaten Byrhtnoth at Maldon that continued to ravage the English coast from 991 to 993. In 994, the Danish fleet, which had swollen in ranks since 991, turned up the Thames estuary and headed toward London. The battle fought there was inconclusive. It was about this time that {{clarify |date=December 2017 |reason=Which fleet and who is  Olaf Tryggvason? |text=\u00c6thelred met with the leaders of the fleet, foremost among them [[Olaf Tryggvason]] }} and arranged an uneasy accord. A treaty was signed between \u00c6thelred and Olaf that provided for seemingly civilised arrangements between the then-settled Danish companies and the English government, such as regulation settlement disputes and trade. But the treaty also stipulated that the ravaging and slaughter of the previous year would be forgotten, and ended abruptly by stating that \u00a322,000 of gold and silver had been paid to the raiders as the price of peace.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 377\u201378.</ref> In 994, Olaf Tryggvason, already a baptised Christian, was [[Confirmation|confirmed]] as Christian in a ceremony at [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]; King \u00c6thelred stood as his sponsor. After receiving gifts, Olaf promised \"that he would never come back to England in hostility.\"<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/> Olaf then left England for Norway and never returned, though \"other component parts of the Viking force appear to have decided to stay in England, for it is apparent from the treaty that some had chosen to enter into King \u00c6thelred's service as mercenaries, based presumably on the Isle of Wight.\"<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/>\n\n===Renewed Danish raids===\nIn 997, Danish raids began again. According to Keynes, \"there is no suggestion that this was a new fleet or army, and presumably the mercenary force created in 994 from the residue of the raiding army of 991 had turned on those whom it had been hired to protect.\"<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/> It harried [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], western [[Somerset]] and south Wales in 997, [[Dorset]], [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] in 998. In 999, it raided Kent, and, in 1000, it left England for Normandy, perhaps because the English had refused in this latest wave of attacks to acquiesce to the Danish demands for ''gafol'' or tribute, which would come to be known as [[Danegeld]], 'Dane-payment'. This sudden relief from attack \u00c6thelred used to gather his thoughts, resources, and armies: the fleet's departure in 1000 \"allowed \u00c6thelred to carry out a devastation of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], the motive for which is part of the lost history of the north.\"<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 379.</ref>\n\nIn 1001, a Danish fleet \u2013 perhaps the same fleet from 1000 \u2013 returned and ravaged west [[Sussex]]. During its movements, the fleet regularly returned to its base in the Isle of Wight. There was later an attempted attack in the south of [[Devon]], though the English mounted a successful defence at [[Exeter]]. Nevertheless, \u00c6thelred must have felt at a loss, and, in the Spring of 1002, the English bought a truce for \u00a324,000. \u00c6thelred's frequent payments of immense Danegelds are often held up as exemplary of the incompetency of his government and his own short-sightedness. However, Keynes points out that such payments had been practice for at least a century, and had been adopted by [[Alfred the Great]], [[Charles the Bald]] and many others. Indeed, in some cases it \"may have seemed the best available way of protecting the people against loss of life, shelter, livestock and crops. Though undeniably burdensome, it constituted a measure for which the king could rely on widespread support.\"<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/>\n\n===St. Brice's Day massacre of 1002===\n{{Main article|St. Brice's Day massacre}}\n\u00c6thelred ordered the [[massacre]] of all Danish men in England to take place on 13 November 1002, [[St Brice]]'s Day. No order of this kind could be carried out in more than a third of England, where the Danes were too strong, but [[Gunhilde]], sister of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], King of Denmark, was said to have been among the victims. It is likely that a wish to avenge her was a principal motive for Sweyn's invasion of western England the following year.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 380.</ref> By 1004 Sweyn was in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], where he sacked [[Norwich]]. In this year, a nobleman of East Anglia, [[Ulfcytel Snillingr]] met Sweyn in force, and made an impression on the until-then rampant Danish expedition. Though Ulfcytel was eventually defeated, outside  [[Thetford]], he caused the Danes heavy losses and was nearly able to destroy their ships. The Danish army left England for Denmark in 1005, perhaps because of the losses they sustained in East Anglia, perhaps from the very severe famine which afflicted the continent and the British Isles in that year.<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/>\n\nAn expedition the following year was bought off in early 1007 by tribute money of \u00a336,000, and for the next two years England was free from attack. In 1008, the government created a new fleet of warships, organised on a national scale, but this was weakened when one of its commanders took to piracy, and the king and his council decided not to risk it in a general action. In Stenton's view: \"The history of England in the next generation was really determined between 1009 and 1012...the ignominious collapse of the English defence caused a loss of morale which was irreparable.\" The Danish army of 1009, led by [[Thorkell the Tall]] and his brother Hemming, was the most formidable force to invade England since \u00c6thelred became king. It harried England until it was bought off by \u00a348,000 in April 1012.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 381\u20134.</ref>\n\n===Invasion of 1013===\nSweyn then launched an invasion in 1013 intending to crown himself king of England, during which he proved himself to be a general greater than any other Viking leader of his generation. By the end of 1013 English resistance had collapsed and Sweyn had conquered the country, forcing \u00c6thelred into exile in Normandy. But the situation changed suddenly when Sweyn died on 3 February 1014. The crews of the Danish ships in the Trent that had supported Sweyn immediately swore their allegiance to Sweyn's son [[Cnut the Great]], but leading English noblemen sent a deputation to \u00c6thelred to negotiate his restoration to the throne. He was required to declare his loyalty to them, to bring in reforms regarding everything that they disliked and to forgive all that had been said and done against him in his previous reign. The terms of this agreement are of great constitutional interest in early English History as they are the first recorded pact between a King and his subjects and are also widely regarded as showing that many English noblemen had submitted to Sweyn simply because of their distrust of \u00c6thelred.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 384\u20136.</ref> According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'':\n:they [the counsellors] said that no lord was dearer to them than their natural (''gecynde'') lord, if he would govern them more justly than he did before. Then the king sent his son Edward hither with his messengers and bade them greet all his people and said that he would be a gracious (''hold'') lord to them, and reform all the things which they hated; and all the things which had been said and done against him should be forgiven on condition that they all unanimously turned to him (''to him gecyrdon'') without treachery. And complete friendship was then established with oath and pledge (''mid worde and mid w\u00e6dde'') on both sides, and they pronounced every Danish king an exile from England forever.<ref>Williams, \u00c6thelred, p. 123</ref>\n\n\u00c6thelred then launched an expedition against Cnut and his allies. It was only the people of the [[Kingdom of Lindsey]] (modern North Lincolnshire) who supported Cnut. \u00c6thelred first set out to recapture London apparently with the help of the Norwegian [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Haraldsson]]. According to the Icelandic historian, [[Snorri Sturluson]],  \u00d3laf led a successful attack on London bridge with a fleet of ships. He then went on to help \u00c6thelred retake London and other parts of the country. Cnut and his army decided to withdraw from England, in April 1014, leaving his Lindsey allies to suffer \u00c6thelred's revenge.  In about 1016 it is thought that  \u00d3laf left to concentrate on raiding western Europe.<ref name=lbridge>J. R. Hagland and B.

The subsequent war between Edmund and Cnut ended in a decisive victory for Cnut at the [[Battle of Assandun|Battle of Ashingdon]] on 18 October 1016. Edmund's reputation as a warrior was such that Cnut nevertheless agreed to divide England, Edmund taking Wessex and Cnut the whole of the country beyond the Thames. However, Edmund died on 30 November and Cnut became king of the whole country.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 386\u2013393.</ref>\n\n\u00c6thelred was buried in [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], London.

[[British Library]], London.]]\n\u00c6thelred's government produced extensive legislation, which he \"ruthlessly enforced.\"<ref>Wormald, \"\u00c6thelred the Lawmaker\", p. 49.</ref> Records of at least six legal codes survive from his reign, covering a range of topics.<ref>Liebermann, ed., ''Die Gesetze der Angelsaschen'', pp. 216\u201370.</ref> Notably, one of the members of his council (known as the ''Witan'') was [[Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York]], a well-known [[homilist]]. The three latest codes from \u00c6thelred's reign seemed to have been drafted by Wulfstan.<ref>Wormald, \"Wulfstan ({{abbr|d.|died}}&nbsp;1023).\"</ref> These codes are extensively concerned with ecclesiastical affairs. They also exhibit the characteristics of Wulfstan's highly rhetorical style. Wulfstan went on to draft codes for King Cnut, and recycled there many of the laws which were used in \u00c6thelred's codes.<ref>Wormald, ''The Making of English Law'', pp. 356\u201360.</ref>\n\nDespite the failure of his government in the face of the Danish threat, \u00c6thelred's reign was not without some important institutional achievements. The quality of the coinage, a good indicator of the prevailing economic conditions, significantly improved during his reign due to his numerous coinage reform laws.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|contribution = Ethelred II|year = 2009|title = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nLater perspectives of \u00c6thelred have been less than flattering. Numerous legends and anecdotes have sprung up to explain his shortcomings, often elaborating abusively on his character and failures. One such anecdote is given by [[William of Malmesbury]] (lived {{circa}}&nbsp;1080\u2013{{circa}}&nbsp;1143), who reports that \u00c6thelred had defecated in the [[baptismal font]] as a child, which led St [[Dunstan]] to prophesy that the English monarchy would be overthrown during his reign. This story is, however, a fabrication, and a similar story is told of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine V|Constantine Copronymus]], another mediaeval monarch who was unpopular among certain of his subjects.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEfforts to rehabilitate \u00c6thelred's reputation have gained momentum since about 1980. Chief among the rehabilitators has been [[Simon Keynes]], who has often argued that our poor impression of \u00c6thelred is almost entirely based upon after-the-fact accounts of, and later accretions to, the narrative of events during \u00c6thelred's long and complex reign. Chief among the culprits is in fact one of the most important sources for the history of the period, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which, as it reports events with a retrospect of 15 years, cannot help but interpret events with the eventual English defeat a foregone conclusion. Yet, as virtually no strictly contemporary narrative account of the events of \u00c6thelred's reign exists, historians are forced to rely on what evidence there is. Keynes and others thus draw attention to some of the inevitable snares of investigating the history of a man whom later popular opinion has utterly damned. Recent cautious assessments of \u00c6thelred's reign have more often uncovered reasons to doubt, rather than uphold, \u00c6thelred's later infamy. Though the failures of his government will always put \u00c6thelred's reign in the shadow of the reigns of kings Edgar, Aethelstan, and Alfred, historians' current impression of \u00c6thelred's personal character is certainly not as unflattering as it once was: \"\u00c6thelred's misfortune as a ruler was owed not so much to any supposed defects of his imagined character, as to a combination of circumstances which anyone would have found difficult to control.\"<ref>Keynes, \"A Tale of Two Kings\", p. 217.</ref>\n\n===Origin of the jury===\n\u00c6thelred has been credited with the formation of a local investigative body made up of twelve [[thegns]] who were charged with publishing the names of any notorious or wicked men in their respective districts. Because the members of these bodies were under solemn oath to act in accordance with the law and their own good consciences, they have been seen by some legal historians as the prototype for the English ''Grand Jury''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Turner, \"The Origins of the Medieval English Jury\", ''passim''.</ref> \u00c6thelred makes provision for such a body in a law code he enacted at [[Wantage]] in 997, which states:\n\n{{quote|''\u00fe\u00e6t man habbe gemot on \u00e6lcum w\u00e6pentace; & gan ut \u00fea yldestan XII \u00feegnas & se gerefa mid, & swerian on \u00feam haligdome, \u00fee heom man on hand sylle, \u00fe\u00e6t hig nellan n\u00e6nne sacleasan man forsecgean ne n\u00e6nne sacne forhelan. & niman \u00feonne \u00fea tihtbysian men, \u00fee mid \u00feam gerefan habba\u00f0, & heora \u00e6lc sylle VI healfmarc wedd, healf landrican & healf w\u00e6pentake.''<ref>\"III \u00c6thelred\" 3.1\u20133.2, in Liebermann, ed., ''Die Gesetze'', pp. 228\u201332.</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|that there shall be an assembly in every [[wapentake]],<ref>Note that this terms specifies the north and north-eastern territories in England which were at the time largely governed according to Danish custom; no mention is made of the law's application to the [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]s, the southern and English equivalent of the Danish wapentake.</ref> and in that assembly shall go forth the twelve eldest [[thegns]] and the [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] along with them, and let them swear on [[Relic#Christian relics|holy relics]], which shall be placed in their hands, that they will never knowingly accuse an innocent man nor conceal a guilty man.

He may actually have been expanding an established English custom for use among the Danish citizens in the North (the [[Danelaw]]). Previously, King Edgar had legislated along similar lines in his Whitbordesstan code:\n\n{{quote|''ic wille, \u00fe\u00e6t \u00e6lc mon sy under borge ge binnan burgum ge buton burgum. & gewitnes sy geset to \u00e6lcere byrig & to \u00e6lcum hundrode.

Throughout the 20th century, legal historians disagreed about whether the practice was English in origin, or was introduced, directly or indirectly, from either Scandinavia or Francia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Recently, the legal historians Patrick Wormald and Michael Macnair have reasserted arguments in favour of finding in practices current during the Anglo-Saxon period traces of the [[Anjou|Angevin]] practice of conducting inquests using bodies of sworn, private witnesses. Wormald has gone as far as to present evidence suggesting that the English practice outlined in \u00c6thelred's Wantage code is at least as old as, if not older than, 975, and ultimately traces it back to a [[Carolingian]] model (something Brinner had done).<ref>Wormald, \"Neighbors, Courts, and Kings\", pp. 598\u201399, ''et passim''.</ref> However, no scholarly consensus has yet been reached.\n\n==Appearance and character==\n\"[A] youth of graceful manners, handsome countenance and fine person...\"<ref>The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester</ref> as well as \"[A] tall, handsome man, elegant in manners, beautiful in countenance and interesting in his deportment.\"<ref>The Gunnlaugr Saga of Gunnlaugr the Scald</ref>\n\n==Marriages and issue==\n\u00c6thelred married first [[\u00c6lfgifu of York|\u00c6lfgifu]], daughter of [[Thored, earl of Northumbria]], in about 985.<ref name=\"Keynes 1016\"/> Their known children are:\n\n*[[\u00c6thelstan \u00c6theling]] (died 1014)\n*Ecgberht \u00c6theling (died {{circa}}&nbsp;1005)<ref name = \"Edmund II\"/>\n*[[Edmund Ironside]] (King of England, died 1016)\n*[[Eadred \u00c6theling]] (died before 1013)\n*[[Eadwig \u00c6theling]] (executed by Cnut 1017)\n*Edgar \u00c6theling (died {{circa}}&nbsp;1008)<ref name = \"Edmund II\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8502 M.

''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.</ref> 2 June 1857 \u2013 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', the ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches]]'', concertos for [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|violin]] and [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|cello]], and two [[symphony|symphonies]]. He also composed choral works, including ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'', chamber music and songs. He was appointed [[Master of the King's Musick]]<!-- Note Musick is not a typo. It was the official spelling of the title until changed during Elgar's tenure --> in 1924.\n\nAlthough Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his [[Roman Catholic]]ism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his ''Enigma Variations'' (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, ''The Dream of Gerontius'' (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.\n\nIn his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, to be seen as appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.\n\nElgar has been described as the first composer to take the [[Gramophone record|gramophone]] seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of [[acoustic recording]]s of his works. The introduction of the [[moving-coil microphone]] in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from ''The Dream of Gerontius''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Elgar-birthplace.jpg|thumb|alt=a brick country cottage with a large front garden|Elgar's birthplace, [[Broadheath, Worcestershire|Lower Broadheath]]]]\n\n===Early years===\nEdward Elgar was born in the small village of [[Broadheath, Worcestershire|Lower Broadheath]], outside [[Worcester]], England.

Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was \"very sick at heart over music\" and hoped to find a way to succeed with a larger work. His friend [[August Jaeger]] tried to lift his spirits: \"A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you.

At the age of forty-two, Elgar produced the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. In Elgar's own words, \"I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... that is to say I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written what I think they would have written \u2013 if they were asses enough to compose\".<ref>Kennedy (1987a), p. 55.</ref> He dedicated the work \"To my friends pictured within\". Probably the best known variation is \"Nimrod\", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations.<ref>McVeagh (1987), p. 51; Hughes, p. 72</ref> The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.<ref name=grove/>\n\nThe work is formally titled ''Variations on an Original Theme''; the word \"Enigma\" appears over the first six bars of music, which led to the familiar version of the title.

In Elgar's [[chromaticism]], the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]], Saint-Sa\u00ebns and, particularly, [[L\u00e9o Delibes|Delibes]], whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.<ref name=k10/><ref name=cox/>\n\nElgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration.

In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong ''The Snow'', for female voices, and ''[[Sea Pictures]]'', a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory.<ref name=\"Reed, p. 149\">Reed, p. 149</ref>\n\nElgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were ''The Black Knight'', ''King Olaf'', ''The Light of Life'', ''The Banner of St George'' and ''Caractacus''. He also wrote a ''Te Deum'' and ''Benedictus'' for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of [[leitmotif]]s, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===Peak creative years===\n[[File:Elgar-LSO-1911.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=large orchestra and their conductor seen on the platform of Victorian concert hall in long shot|Elgar and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Queen's Hall]]]]\nElgar's best-known works were composed within the twenty-one years between 1899 and 1920. Most of them are orchestral. Reed wrote, \"Elgar's genius rose to its greatest height in his orchestral works\" and quoted the composer as saying that, even in his oratorios, the orchestral part is the most important.<ref>Reed, pp. 148\u201350</ref> The ''Enigma Variations'' made Elgar's name nationally. The variation form was ideal for him at this stage of his career, when his comprehensive mastery of orchestration was still in contrast to his tendency to write his melodies in short, sometimes rigid, phrases.<ref name=grove/> His next orchestral works, ''[[Cockaigne (In London Town)|Cockaigne]]'', a concert-overture (1900\u20131901), the first two ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance]]'' marches (1901), and the gentle ''[[Dream Children (Elgar)|Dream Children]]'' (1902), are all short: the longest of them, ''Cockaigne'', lasting less than fifteen minutes. ''[[In the South (Alassio)|In the South]]'' (1903\u20131904), although designated by Elgar as a concert-overture, is, according to Kennedy, really a [[tone poem]] and the longest continuous piece of purely orchestral writing Elgar had essayed. He wrote it after setting aside an early attempt to compose a symphony.<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 30</ref> The work reveals his continuing progress in writing sustained themes and orchestral lines, although some critics, including Kennedy, find that in the middle part \"Elgar's inspiration burns at less than its brightest.\"<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 32</ref> In 1905 Elgar completed the ''[[Introduction and Allegro (Elgar)|Introduction and Allegro for Strings]]''. This work is based, unlike much of Elgar's earlier writing, not on a profusion of themes but on only three. Kennedy called it a \"masterly composition, equalled among English works for strings only by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis|Tallis Fantasia]]''.\"<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 42</ref> Nevertheless, at less than a quarter of an hour, it was not by contemporary standards a lengthy composition.

These were his [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|First Symphony]], [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|Violin Concerto]], and [[Symphony No. 2 (Elgar)|Second Symphony]], which all play for between forty-five minutes and an hour.{{refn|In a series of transfers of the composer's electrical recordings available in 2010, the timings are: Symphony No. 1: 46:28 (''Naxos Historical'' CD 8.111256); Symphony No. 2: 48:30 (''Naxos Historical'' CD 8.111260); Violin Concerto: 49:57 (''Naxos Historical'' CD 8.110902).| group= n}} McVeagh says of the symphonies that they \"rank high not only in Elgar's output but in English musical history. Both are long and powerful, without published programmes, only hints and quotations to indicate some inward drama from which they derive their vitality and eloquence. Both are based on classical form but differ from it to the extent that ... they were considered prolix and slackly constructed by some critics. Certainly the invention in them is copious; each symphony would need several dozen music examples to chart its progress.\"<ref name=grove/>\n\n[[File:Elgar-cello-concerto-manuscript.jpg|thumb|left|Fragment of manuscript of the opening of the second movement of the [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto]]|alt=manuscript music score, faded with age]]\nElgar's Violin Concerto and [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto]], in the view of Kennedy, \"rank not only among his finest works, but among the greatest of their kind\".<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 43</ref> They are, however, very different from each other. The Violin Concerto, composed in 1909 as Elgar reached the height of his popularity, and written for the instrument dearest to his heart,<ref name=\"Reed, p. 149\"/> is lyrical throughout and rhapsodical and brilliant by turns.<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 45</ref> The Cello Concerto, composed a decade later, immediately after World War I, seems, in Kennedy's words, \"to belong to another age, another world ... the simplest of all Elgar's major works ... also the least grandiloquent.\"<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 50</ref> Between the two concertos came Elgar's symphonic study ''[[Falstaff (Elgar)|Falstaff]]'', which has divided opinion even among Elgar's strongest admirers. [[Donald Tovey]] viewed it as \"one of the immeasurably great things in music\", with power \"identical with Shakespeare's\",<ref>Tovey, Donald F., \"Elgar, Master of Music\", ''Music and Letters'', January 1935, p. 1</ref> while Kennedy criticises the work for \"too frequent reliance on [[Sequence (music)|sequences]]\" and an over-idealised depiction of the female characters.<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 35</ref> Reed thought that the principal themes show less distinction than some of Elgar's earlier works.<ref>Reed, p. 151.</ref> Elgar himself thought ''Falstaff'' the highest point of his purely orchestral work.<ref>Reed, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe major works for voices and orchestra of the twenty-one years of Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'' (1900), and the oratorios ''[[The Apostles (Elgar)|The Apostles]]'' (1903) and ''[[The Kingdom (Elgar)|The Kingdom]]'' (1906); and two shorter odes, the ''[[Coronation Ode]]'' (1902) and ''[[The Music Makers (Elgar)|The Music Makers]]'' (1912). The first of the odes, as a ''pi\u00e8ce d'occasion'', has rarely been revived after its initial success, with the culminating \"Land of Hope and Glory\". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''.<ref>Burn, Andrew, [http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.557710&catNum=557710&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English Notes to Naxos recording of ''The Music Makers''] (CD 8.557710)</ref> The choral works were all successful, although the first, ''Gerontius'', was and remains the best-loved and most performed.<ref>Reed, p. 58</ref> On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting [[John Ruskin]], \"This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory.\"<ref name=grove/> All three of the large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together.

B. Yeats]] (1901), and for ''[[The Starlight Express]]'', a play based on a story by [[Algernon Blackwood]] (1916). Of the former, Yeats called Elgar's music \"wonderful in its heroic melancholy\".<ref>McVeagh (2007), p. 78</ref> Elgar also wrote a number of songs during his peak period, of which Reed observes, \"it cannot be said that he enriched the vocal repertory to the same extent as he did that of the orchestra.\"<ref name=\"Reed, p. 149\"/>\n\n===Final years and posthumous completions===\nAfter the Cello Concerto, Elgar completed no more large-scale works. He made arrangements of works by Bach, Handel and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], in distinctively Elgarian orchestration,<ref name=grove/> and once again turned his youthful notebooks to use for the ''[[Nursery Suite]]'' (1931). His other compositions of this period have not held a place in the regular repertory.<ref name=dnb/> For most of the rest of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that Elgar's creative impulse ceased after his wife's death. Anthony Payne's elaboration of the sketches for Elgar's Third Symphony led to a reconsideration of this supposition. Elgar left the opening of the symphony complete in full score, and those pages, along with others, show Elgar's orchestration changed markedly from the richness of his pre-war work. ''The Gramophone'' described the opening of the new work as something \"thrilling ... unforgettably gaunt\".<ref>Cowan, Rob, Review, ''Gramophone'', March 2000, p. 61</ref> Payne also subsequently produced a performing version of the sketches for a sixth ''Pomp and Circumstance March'', premiered at [[the Proms]] in August 2006.<ref>Clements, Andrew, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/aug/04/classicalmusicandopera1 \"BBCSO/Davis\",] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 August 2006.

Richard Strauss, as noted, hailed Elgar as a progressive composer; even the hostile reviewer in ''The Observer'', unimpressed by the thematic material of the First Symphony in 1908, called the orchestration \"magnificently modern\".<ref>\"Music \u2013 The Elgar Symphony\", ''[[The Observer]]'', 13 December 1908, p. 9</ref> Hans Richter rated Elgar as \"the greatest modern composer\" in any country, and Richter's colleague Arthur Nikisch considered the First Symphony \"a masterpiece of the first order\" to be \"justly ranked with the great symphonic models \u2013 Beethoven and Brahms.\"<ref name=mt322/> By contrast, the critic [[Walter J. Turner|W. J. Turner]], in the mid-twentieth century, wrote of Elgar's \"[[Salvation Army]] symphonies,\"<ref name=cox>Cox, pp. 15\u201316</ref> and [[Herbert von Karajan]] called the ''Enigma Variations'' \"second-hand Brahms\".<ref>Kennedy, Michael, \"Holst\", ''Gramophone'', December 1990, p. 82</ref> Elgar's immense popularity was not long-lived. After the success of his First Symphony and Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received but without the earlier wild enthusiasm. His music was identified in the public mind with the [[Edwardian era]], and after the First World War he no longer seemed a progressive or modern composer. In the early 1920s, even the First Symphony had only one London performance in more than three years.<ref name=dnb/> [[Henry J.

The features that had offended austere taste in the inter-war years were seen from a different perspective. In 1955, the reference book ''[[The Record Guide]]'' wrote of the Edwardian background during the height of Elgar's career:\n{{quote|Boastful self-confidence, emotional vulgarity, material extravagance, a ruthless philistinism expressed in tasteless architecture and every kind of expensive yet hideous accessory: such features of a late phase of Imperial England are faithfully reflected in Elgar's larger works and are apt to prove indigestible today. But if it is difficult to overlook the bombastic, the sentimental, and the trivial elements in his music, the effort to do so should nevertheless be made, for the sake of the many inspired pages, the power and eloquence and lofty pathos, of Elgar's best work. ... Anyone who doubts the fact of Elgar's genius should take the first opportunity of hearing ''The Dream of Gerontius'', which remains his masterpiece, as it is his largest and perhaps most deeply felt work; the symphonic study, ''Falstaff''; the Introduction and Allegro for Strings; the ''Enigma Variations''; and the Violoncello Concerto.<ref name=esw/>}}\n\nBy the 1960s, a less severe view was being taken of the Edwardian era. In 1966 the critic [[Frank Howes]] wrote that Elgar reflected the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but \"a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work. ... Elgar is historically important for giving to English music a sense of the orchestra, for expressing what it felt like to be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations.\"<ref name=howes/>\n\n[[File:Sibelius-strauss-RVW-stravinsky.jpg|thumb|right|Composers who admired Elgar included (top) [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] (l) and [[Richard Strauss]] and (below) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] (l) and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]|alt=head and shoulders portraits of four men. One is bald; one is balding and luxuriantly moustached; one is a drawing of a young man in full face, with a full head of hair, in collar and tie; the fourth shows a young man, balding and bespectacled looking towards the camera]]\nIn 1967 the critic and analyst David Cox considered the question of the supposed Englishness of Elgar's music. Cox noted that Elgar disliked folk-songs and never used them in his works, opting for an idiom that was essentially German, leavened by a lightness derived from French composers including Berlioz and Gounod. How then, asked Cox, could Elgar be \"the most English of composers\"? Cox found the answer in Elgar's own personality, which \"could use the alien idioms in such a way as to make of them a vital form of expression that was his and his alone. And the personality that comes through in the music is English.\"<ref name=cox/> This point about Elgar's transmuting his influences had been touched on before. In 1930 ''The Times'' wrote, \"When Elgar's first symphony came out, someone attempted to prove that its main tune on which all depends was like the Grail theme in Parsifal. ... but the attempt fell flat because everyone else, including those who disliked the tune, had instantly recognized it as typically 'Elgarian', while the Grail theme is as typically Wagnerian.\"<ref>\"Pre-war Symphonies\", ''The Times'', 1 February 1930, p. 10</ref> As for Elgar's \"Englishness\", his fellow-composers recognised it: Richard Strauss and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] made particular reference to it,<ref name=mt322/> and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] called him, \"the personification of the true English character in music ... a noble personality and a born aristocrat\".<ref name=mt322>Sibelius, Jean, Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss and Arthur Nikisch, \"Tribute and Commentary\", ''The Musical Times'', April 1934, p. 322.</ref>\n\nAmong Elgar's admirers there is disagreement about which of his works are to be regarded as masterpieces. The ''Enigma Variations'' are generally counted among them.<ref>Reed, p. 180; Kennedy (ODNB), McVeagh (Grove), Sackville-West, p. 254; and in a centenary symposium in 1957 a variety of composers, scholars and performers, include ''Enigma'' among their favourite Elgar works.

Sackville-West omitted it from the list of Elgar masterpieces in ''The Record Guide'',<ref>Sackville West, p. 254</ref> and in a long analytical article in ''The Musical Quarterly'', [[Daniel Gregory Mason]] criticised the first movement of the concerto for a \"kind of sing-songiness ... as fatal to noble rhythm in music as it is in poetry.\"<ref name=mason>Mason, Daniel Gregory, \"A Study of Elgar\", ''The Musical Quarterly'', April 1917, pp. 288\u2013303</ref> ''Falstaff'' also divides opinion. It has never been a great popular favourite,<ref>\"Elgar\", ''Music and Letters'', April 1934, p. 109</ref> and Kennedy and Reed identify shortcomings in it.<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 35; and Reed, p. 151.</ref> In a ''Musical Times'' 1957 centenary symposium on Elgar led by Vaughan Williams, by contrast, several contributors share [[Eric Blom]]'s view that ''Falstaff'' is the greatest of all Elgar's works.<ref name=sympo>Vaughan Williams, Ralph, and others, \"Elgar Today\",''The Musical Times'', June 1957, pp. 302\u201306</ref>\n\nThe two symphonies divide opinion even more sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its \"over-obvious rhythmic scheme\", but calls the First \"Elgar's masterpiece. ... It is hard to see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony.\"<ref name=mason/> However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express reservations about one or both symphonies.<ref name=sympo/> In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'', \"For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work.\"<ref>Fiske, Roger,  \"Elgar, Symphony No. 2 in E flat major, Op. 63\", ''Gramophone'', July 1957, p. 9</ref> The critic [[John Warrack]] wrote, \"There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief\",<ref>Warrack, John, \"Three English Masters\", ''Gramophone'', March 1984, p. 21</ref> whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and ''angst'' and is marked instead by a \"benevolent tranquillity.\"<ref>Kennedy (1970), p. 56</ref>\n\nDespite the fluctuating critical assessment of the various works over the years, Elgar's major works taken as a whole have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. ''The Record Guide'' in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the ''Enigma Variations'', one of ''Falstaff'', and none of ''The Dream of Gerontius''. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, and more than a dozen of ''The Dream of Gerontius''.<ref>Farach-Colton, Andrew, \"Vision of the Hereafter,\" ''Gramophone'', February 2003, p. 39</ref> Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed.

The ECU itself replaced the [[European Unit of Account]], also at parity, on 13 March 1979. The [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] attempted to minimize fluctuations between member state currencies and the ECU. The ECU was also used in some international financial transactions, where its advantage was that securities denominated in ECUs provided investors with the opportunity for foreign diversification without reliance on the currency of a single country.<ref>David L. Scott, Wall Street Words (3rd ed. 2003), p. 130.</ref>\n\nThe ECU was conceived on 13 March 1979 as an internal accounting unit. It had the [[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 currency code]] XEU.\n\n==Euro replaces ECU==\nOn 1 January 1999, the euro (with the code EUR and symbol [[Euro sign|\u20ac]]) replaced the ECU, at the value \u20ac1 = 1 ECU. Unlike the ECU, the euro is a real currency, although not all member states participate (for details on euro membership see [[Eurozone]]). Two of the countries in the ECU basket of currencies, UK and [[Denmark]], did not join the eurozone, and a third, [[Greece]], joined late. On the other hand, [[Finland]] and [[Austria]] joined the eurozone from the beginning although their currencies were not part of the ECU basket (since they had joined the EU in 1995, two years after the ECU composition was \"frozen\")\n\n===Legal implications===\nDue to the ECU being used in some international financial transactions, there was a concern that foreign courts might not recognize the euro as the legal successor to the ECU. This was unlikely to be a problem, since it is a generally accepted principle of [[private international law]] that states determine their currencies, and that therefore states would accept the [[European Union]] legislation to that effect. However, for abundant caution, several foreign jurisdictions adopted legislation to ensure a smooth transition. Of particular importance, the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Illinois]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] adopted legislation to ensure a large proportion of international financial contracts recognized the euro as the successor of the ECU.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Etymology==\nAlthough the acronym ECU is formed from English words, ''[[\u00e9cu (coin)|\u00e9cu]]'' is also the name of an ancient French coin. That was one reason that a new name was devised for its successor currency, ''euro'', which was felt not to favour any single language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ungerer|first1=Horst|title=A Concise History of European Monetary Integration: From EPU to EMU|date=1997|publisher=Quorum Books|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=089930981X|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I9ugHSjIGLIC&lpg=PA286&dq=naming%20of%20the%20euro%20madrid%201995&pg=PA286#v=onepage&q=naming%20of%20the%20euro%20madrid%201995&f=false|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Symbol==\nThe currency's symbol, \u20a0 ([[Unicode|U]]+20A0), comprises an interlaced C and E, which are the initial letters of the phrase '[[European Community]]' in many [[European languages]]. However, this symbol was not widely used: few systems at the time could render it and in any case banks preferred (as with all currencies) to use the ISO code XEU.\n\n== Coins and notes ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1 ecu coin.jpg|framed|right|A commemorative coin of the face value of 1 ECU, from 1992.]] -->\nAs the ECU was only an electronic unit of account and not a full currency, it did not have any official [[coin]]s or [[Banknote|note]]s that could be used for everyday transactions. However, various European countries and organisations like the [[European Parliament]] made [[Commemorative coin|commemorative]] and [[mock-up]] coins and notes. A common theme on the coins was usually celebrating [[Pan-European identity|European unity]], such as celebrating membership of the European Union. In 1989, the government of the [[Netherlands]] issued a series of ECU coins from \u20a02\u00bd to \u20a0200, which could be spent in shops in [[The Hague]], during the European Capital of Culture festival.

The successor to the [[British West Indies dollar]], it has existed since 1965, and it is normally abbreviated with the [[dollar sign]] ''$'' or, alternatively, ''EC$'' to distinguish it from other [[dollar]]-denominated currencies. The EC$ is subdivided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s. It has been [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the [[United States dollar]] since 7 July 1976, and the exchange rate is US$1 = EC$2.70.<ref name=ECCB>{{cite web|last=Eastern Caribbean Central Bank|title=ECCU commemorates 34th Anniversary of EC dollar pegged to the US dollar|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/eccu-commemorates-34th-anniversary-of-ec-dollar-peg-to-the-us-dollar/|accessdate=4 May 2012|date=6 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Circulation==\n\nSix of the states using the EC$ are independent states: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The other two are [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]]: [[Anguilla]] and [[Montserrat]]. These states are all members of the [[Eastern Caribbean Currency Union]]. \n\nThe other two associate members of the OECS do not use the Eastern Caribbean dollar as their official currency: the [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Martinique]]. The British Virgin Islands were always problematic for currency purposes due to their proximity to the [[Danish West Indies]] which became the [[US Virgin Islands]] in 1917. Officially, the British Virgin Islands used to use [[Pound sterling|sterling]], but in practice the situation was more complicated and involved the circulation of [[francs]]{{Clarify|FRF, CHF, BEF or some other kind of F?|date=August 2009}} and [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]]. In 1951, the British Virgin Islands adopted the [[British West Indies dollar]] which at that time operated in conjunction with the sterling coinage, and in 1959 they changed over officially to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_vi.html|title=British Virgin Islands|last=|first=|date=|website=CIA World Factbook|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMartinique, as part of France, uses the [[euro]] as its currency. \n\n[[British Guiana]] and [[Barbados]] had previously been members of the [[Eastern Caribbean Currency Union]] but withdrew in 1966 and 1972, respectively. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] had been a member of the earlier [[British West Indies]] currency union, but withdrew in 1964. \n\nThe combined population of the EC$ area is about 613,000 (2014 census and estimates<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf14/2014-world-population-data-sheet_eng.pdf|title=2014 World Population Data Sheet|author=[[Population Reference Bureau]]|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html|title=Country Population Comprasion|author=[[The World Factbook]]}}</ref>), which is comparable to [[Montenegro]] or the American capital city of [[Washington, D.C.]].

She is the [[head of state]] of all the states and territories using the EC$, except for Dominica. Dominica is nevertheless a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] which recognises Queen Elizabeth II as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].\n\n==History==\n\nQueen Anne's proclamation of 1704 introduced the gold standard to the [[British West Indies]], putting the [[West Indies]] about two hundred years ahead of the [[East Indies]] in this respect. Nevertheless, silver [[pieces of eight]] continued to form an important portion of the circulating coinage right up until the late 1870s. In 1822, the British government coined 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 fractional 'Anchor dollars' for use in [[Mauritius]] and the [[British West Indies]] (but not [[Jamaica]]). A few years later copper fractional dollars were coined for [[Mauritius]], [[Sierra Leone]], and the [[British West Indies]].\n\nThe first move to introduce British [[Pound sterling|sterling]] silver coinage to the colonies came with an imperial order-in-council dated 1825. This move was inspired by a number of factors. The [[United Kingdom]] was now operating a very successful gold standard in relation to the [[gold sovereign]] that was introduced in 1816, and there was a desire to extend this system to the colonies. In addition to this, there was the fact that the supply of [[Spanish dollars]] ([[pieces of eight]]) had been cut off as a result of the revolutions in Latin America where most of the [[Spanish dollars]] were minted. The last [[Spanish Dollar]] was in fact minted at [[Potos\u00ed|Potosi]] in 1825. There was now a growing desire to have a stable and steady supply of British shillings everywhere the British drum was beating. The 1825 order-in-council was largely a failure because it made sterling silver coinage legal tender at the unrealistic rating in relation to the [[Spanish dollar]] of $1 = 4 shillings and 4 pence. It succeeded in [[Jamaica]], [[Bermuda]], and [[British Honduras]] because the authorities in those territories set aside the official ratings and used the more realistic rating of $1 = 4 shillings. The reality of the rating between the dollar and the pound was based on the silver content of the Spanish [[pieces of eight]] as compared to the gold content of the British [[gold sovereign]].\n\nA second imperial order-in-council was passed in 1838 with the correct rating of $1 = 4 shillings 2 pence. In the years following the 1838 order-in-council, the [[British West Indies]] territories began to enact local legislation for the purposes of assimilating their monies of account with the British pound sterling. Gold discoveries in Australia in 1851 drove the silver dollar out of the West Indies, but it returned again with the great depreciation in the value of silver that followed with Germany's transition to the [[gold standard]] between 1871 and 1873. In the years immediately following 1873, there was a fear that the [[British West Indies]] might return to a silver standard. As such, legislation was passed in the individual territories to demonetize the silver dollars. Even though the British coinage was also silver, it represented fractions of the [[gold sovereign]] and so its value was based on a gold standard.\n\nDuring this period, and into the nineteenth century, accounts could be kept in either dollars or sterling. [[Jamaica]], [[Bermuda]], and the [[Bahamas]] preferred to use sterling accounts whereas [[British Guiana]] used dollar accounts. [[British Guiana]] used dollar accounts for the purpose of assisting in the transition from the Dutch [[guilder]] system of currency to the British pound sterling system. In the [[Eastern Caribbean]] territories the private sector preferred to use dollar accounts whereas the government preferred to use sterling accounts. In some of the [[Eastern Caribbean]] territories, notes were issued by various private banks, denominated in dollars equivalent to 4 [[shillings]] 2 [[penny|pence]]. See [[Antigua dollar]], [[Barbadian dollar]], [[Dominican dollar]], [[Grenadian dollar]], [[Guyanese dollar]], [[Saint Kitts dollar]], [[Saint Lucia dollar]], [[Saint Vincent dollar]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago dollar]].\n\nIn 1946, a West Indian Currency Conference saw [[Barbados]], [[British Guiana]], the [[British Leeward Islands|Leeward Islands]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the [[British Windward Islands|Windward Islands]] agree to establish a unified decimal currency system based on a West Indian dollar to replace the current arrangement of having three different Boards of Commissioners of Currency (for Barbados (which also served the Leeward and Windward Islands), British Guiana and Trinidad & Tobago).<ref name=\"The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union\">{{cite book | last1 = Van Beek | first1 = Fritz | title = The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union: Institutions, Performance, and Policy Issues | chapter = The Financial System | publisher = International Monetary Fund | year = 2000 | location = | url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=3632.0 | accessdate = 2013-02-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the British government formalized the dollar system of accounts in [[British Guiana]] and the Eastern Caribbean territories by introducing the [[British West Indies]] dollar (BWI$) at the already existing conversion rate of $4.80 per pound sterling (or $1 = 4 shillings 2 pence). It was one of the many experimental political and economic ventures tested by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government to form a uniform system within their [[British West Indies]] territories. The [[ISO 4217]] code of the currency was ''XBWD''. The symbol \"BWI$\" for frequently used and the currency was known verbally as the \"Beewee\" (slang for British West Indies) dollar. Shortly thereafter in the 1950, the British Caribbean Currency Board (BCCB) was set up in Trinidad<ref name=\"Small States, Smart Solutions\">{{cite book | last1 = Favaro | first1 = Edgardo | title = Small States, Smart Solutions: Improving Connectivity and Increasing the Effectiveness of Public Services | chapter = Banking Supervision in OECS Countries | publisher = World Bank Publications | year = 2008 | location = | url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6416 | accessdate = 2013-02-26}}</ref> with the sole right to issue notes and coins of the new unified currency and given the mandate of keeping full foreign exchange cover to ensure convertibility at $4.80 per pound sterling.<ref name = \"The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union\" /> In 1951, the [[British Virgin Islands]] joined the arrangement, but this led to discontent because that territory was more naturally drawn to the currency of the neighbouring [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].  In 1961, the [[British Virgin Islands]] withdrew from the arrangement and adopted the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]].\n\nUntil 1955, the BWI$ existed only as banknotes in conjunction with sterling fractional coinage. Decimal coins replaced the sterling coins in 1955. These decimal coins were denominated in cents, with each cent worth one halfpenny in sterling.\n\nIn 1958, the [[West Indies Federation]] was established and the BWI$ was its currency. However, although [[Jamaica]] (including the [[Cayman Islands]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]) was part of the West Indies Federation, it retained the [[Jamaican pound]], despite adopting the BWI$ as legal tender from 1954.<ref name=\"Alternative Monetary Regimes for Jamaica\">{{cite web|url=http://old.psoj.org/archives/hanke.pdf|title=Alternative Monetary Regimes for Jamaica by Steve H.

[[British Guiana]] withdrew from the currency union the following year. [[Grenada]] rejoined the common currency arrangement in 1968 having used the Trinidad and Tobago dollar from 1964.<ref name = \"The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union\" /> Barbados withdrew from the currency union in 1972, following which the ECCA headquarters were moved to St. Kitts.<ref name = \"The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union\" />\n\nBetween 1965 and 1983, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority issued the EC$, with banknotes from 1965 and coins from 1981. The EC$ is now issued by the [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]], based in the city of [[Basseterre]], in Saint Kitts and Nevis. The bank was established by an agreement (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Agreement) signed at [[Port of Spain]] on 5 July 1983.\n\nThe exchange rate of $4.80 = \u00a31 sterling (equivalent to the old $1 = 4s 2d) continued right up until 1976 for the new Eastern Caribbean dollar.\n\nFor a wider outline of the history of currency in the region see [[Currencies of the British West Indies]].\n\n==Coins==\n\nUntil 1981, the coins of the BWI$ circulated. In 1982, a new series of coins was introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 25 cents and 1 dollar. The 1- and 5-cent coins were scalloped in shape while the 2-cent coin was square. These three were struck in aluminum. The 10- and 25-cent coins were round and cupro-nickel. The dollar was aluminum bronze and also round. The round, aluminum bronze dollar coin was replaced in 1989 with a decagonal, cupro-nickel type. In 2002 new and larger round-shaped 1-, 2-, and 5-cent pieces were introduced, along with a new 1-dollar coin which was also round. The effigy of Queen Elizabeth II was also changed that same year on all coin denominations to the [[Ian Rank-Broadley]] design, making it the last commonwealth currency up to that date to discontinue the [[Arnold Machin]] portrait. Their compositions remained aluminum and cupro-nickel, respectively. Higher denominations exist, but these were issued only as [[medal-coins]]. 1- and 2-cent coins were withdrawn from circulation in July 2015, and will remain legal tender until 30 June 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eccb-centralbank.org/News/coins_withdrawal.asp|title=Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Withdraws Coins|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+ 2002 Series [http://www.eccb-centralbank.org/Currency/cur_newcoins.asp]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"3\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"3\"| Description !!rowspan=\"2\"| Date of first minting\n|-\n!

Chemotherapeutic Drugs Chapter 44. Chloramphenicol, Tetracyclines, Macrolides, Clindamycin, & Streptogramins</ref> but the mechanism is not fully understood. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial  [[rRNA]] complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the [[tRNA]] bound at the [[A site]] of the rRNA complex to the [[P site]] of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached [[amino acid]] to the nascent [[polypeptide]] chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action.\n\nErythromycin increases gut motility by binding to Motillin, thus it is a Motillin receptor agonist in addition to its antimicrobial properties.\n\n=== Pharmacokinetics ===\n\nErythromycin is easily inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally administered formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or [[ester]]s, such as erythromycin [[succinate|ethylsuccinate]]. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and [[phagocyte]]s. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported to the site of infection, where, during active [[phagocytosis]], large concentrations of erythromycin are released.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Metabolism ===\n\nMost of erythromycin is metabolised by [[demethylation]] in the [[liver]] by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the [[bile]] with little renal excretion, 2%-15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's [[elimination half-life]] ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease.  Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5-2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food.<ref name=\"online.lexi.com\">{{cite web | url = http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/74/304361#pkm | title = unknown | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140419232231/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/74/304361#pkm | archivedate = 2014-04-19 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nErythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk.

Remembering the battle of Dr. Abelardo Aguilar: Cure for millions, deprived of millions.The News Today. Retrieved 22 September 2015</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Abelardo B. Aguilar, a Filipino scientist, sent some soil samples to his employer [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] . Eli Lilly\u2019s research team, led by J. M. McGuire, managed to isolate erythromycin from the metabolic products of a strain of ''[[Saccharopolyspora erythraea|Streptomyces erythreus]]'' (designation changed to \"''Saccharopolyspora erythraea''\") found in the samples.\n\nLilly filed for patent protection of the compound and U.S. patent 2,653,899 was granted in 1953. The product was launched commercially in 1952 under the brand name Ilosone (after the [[Philippines|Philippine]] region of [[Iloilo Province|Iloilo]] where it was originally collected). Erythromycin was formerly also called Ilotycin.\n\nIn 1981, Nobel laureate (1965 in chemistry) and professor of chemistry at [[Harvard University]] [[Robert Burns Woodward|Robert B. Woodward]] (posthumously), along with a large number of members from his research group, reported the first stereocontrolled asymmetric chemical synthesis of erythromycin A.\n\nThe antibiotic [[clarithromycin]] was invented by scientists at the Japanese drug company [[Taisho Pharmaceutical]] in the 1970s as a result of their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin.\n\nScientists at [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]] discovered an erythromycin-derived [[motilin]] agonist called [[mitemcinal]] that is believed to have strong [[prokinetic]] properties (similar to erythromycin) but lacking antibiotic properties. Erythromycin is commonly used [[off-label]] for gastric motility indications such as [[gastroparesis]]. If mitemcinal can be shown to be an effective prokinetic agent, it would represent a significant advance in the gastrointestinal field, as treatment with this drug would not carry the risk of unintentional selection for [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria]].\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n=== Cost ===\n\nIt is available as a [[generic medication]] and was inexpensive for many years.<ref name=Ric2013 /> The wholesale price was between 0.03 and 0.06 USD per pill.<ref name=ERC2015 />\n\nIn the United States in 2014 the price increased to seven dollars per tablet.<ref name=\"increase\">Stahl, Stephanie (September 26, 2014) [http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/09/26/health-generic-drugs-prices-increasing/ Health: Generic Drugs Prices Increasing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409212651/http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/09/26/health-generic-drugs-prices-increasing/ |date=2016-04-09 }} ''CBS Philadelphia''.

The core environmental law regimes address environmental [[pollution]]. A related but distinct set of regulatory regimes, now strongly influenced by environmental legal principles, focus on the management of specific [[natural resources]], such as forests, minerals, or fisheries. Other areas, such as environmental impact assessment, may not fit neatly into either category, but are nonetheless important components of environmental law.<section end=scope />\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of environmental law}}\nEarly examples of legal enactments designed to consciously preserve the environment, for its own sake or human enjoyment, are found throughout history. In the [[common law]], the primary protection was found in the law of [[Nuisance in English law|nuisance]], but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from [[pig sty|pig sties]],<ref>''[[Aldred's Case]]'' (1610) 9 Co Rep 57b; (1610) 77 ER 816</ref> [[strict liability]] against dumping rubbish,<ref>''[[R v Stephens]]'' (1866) LR 1 QB 702</ref> or damage from exploding dams.<ref>''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' [1868] UKHL 1</ref> Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. During the \"[[Great Stink]]\" of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the [[River Thames]] began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. Ironically, the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848]] had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close [[cesspit]]s around the city in an attempt to \"clean up\" but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the [[London sewerage system]]. London also suffered from terrible [[air pollution]], and this culminated in the \"[[Great Smog]]\" of 1952, which in turn triggered its own legislative response: the [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning [[coal]]) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance.\n\nNotwithstanding early analogues, the concept of \"environmental law\" as a separate and distinct body of law is a twentieth-century development.<ref>See generally R. Lazarus, [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3629140.html The Making of Environmental Law (Cambridge Press 2004)]; P. Gates, [http://www.arkansasresearch.com/HistReprints/GatesLandBook.htm History of Public Land Law Development].</ref> The recognition that the natural environment was fragile and in need of special legal protections, the translation of that recognition into legal structures, the development of those structures into a larger body of \"environmental law,\" and the strong influence of environmental law on natural resource laws, did not occur until about the 1960s. At that time, numerous influences - including a growing awareness of the unity and fragility of the [[biosphere]]; increased public concern over the impact of industrial activity on natural resources and human health; the increasing strength of the regulatory state; and more broadly the advent and success of [[environmental movement|environmentalism as a political movement]] - coalesced to produce a huge new body of law in a relatively short period of time. While the modern history of environmental law is one of continuing controversy, by the end of the twentieth century environmental law had been established as a component of the legal landscape in all [[Developed country|developed nations]] of the world, many [[Developing country|developing ones]], and the larger project of [[international law]].\n\n==Pollution control==\n===Air quality===\n[[File:AlfedPalmersmokestacks.jpg|thumb|Industrial air pollution now regulated by [[air quality law]]]]\n{{main article|Air quality law}}\n\n===Water quality===\n[[File:Discharge pipe.jpg|thumb|alt=A typical stormwater outfall.|A typical stormwater outfall, subject to [[water quality law]]]]\n{{main article|Water quality law}}\nWater quality laws {{#section:Water quality law|overview}}\n\n===Waste management===\n[[File:Landfill.jpg|thumb|alt=A landfill.|A municipal landfill, operated pursuant to [[waste management law]]]]\n{{Main article|Waste management law}}\nWaste management laws {{#section:Waste management law|overview}}\n\n===Contaminant cleanup ===\n[[File:Rena oil spill cleanup.jpg|thumb|alt=Oil spill cleanup.|Oil spill emergency response, governed by [[environmental cleanup law]]]]\n{{Main article|Environmental cleanup law}}\nEnvironmental cleanup laws {{#section:Environmental cleanup law|overview}}\n\n===Chemical safety===\nChemical safety laws govern the use of [[chemicals]] in human activities, particularly man-made chemicals in modern industrial applications. As contrasted with media-oriented environmental laws (e.g., air or water quality laws), chemical control laws seek to manage the (potential) pollutants themselves. Regulatory efforts include banning specific chemical constituents in consumer products (e.g., [[Bisphenol A controversy|Bisphenol A]] in plastic bottles), and regulating [[pesticides]].\n\n==Resource sustainability==\n===Impact assessment===\n{{Main article|Environmental impact assessment}}\nEnvironmental impact assessment {{#section:Environmental impact assessment|overview}}\n\n=== Water resources ===\n[[File:Irrigation ditch.JPG|thumb|An irrigation ditch.|An irrigation ditch, operated in accordance with [[Water law|water resources law]]]]\n{{main article|Water law}}\nWater resources laws govern the ownership and use of [[water resources]], including [[surface water]] and [[ground water]]. Regulatory areas may include water conservation, use restrictions, and ownership regimes.\n\n=== Mineral resources ===\n{{main article|Mining law}}\nMineral resource laws cover {{#section:Mining law|overview}}\n\n=== Forest resources ===\n[[File:John Deere 2054 DHSP forestry swing machine, Kaibab National Forest 1.jpg|thumb|alt=A timber operation.|A timber operation, regulated by [[forestry law]]]]\n{{main article|Forestry law}}\n{{:Forestry law}}\n\n=== Wildlife and plants ===\nWildlife laws govern the potential impact of human activity on wild animals, whether directly on individuals or populations, or indirectly via habitat degradation. Similar laws may operate to protect plant species. Such laws may be enacted entirely to protect [[biodiversity]], or as a means for protecting species deemed important for other reasons. Regulatory efforts may including the creation of special [[conservation status]]es, prohibitions on killing, harming, or disturbing protected species, efforts to induce and support species recovery, establishment of wildlife refuges to support conservation, and prohibitions on trafficking in species or animal parts to combat [[poaching]].\n\n=== Fish and game ===\n{{Main article|Game law}}\n{{Further|Fisheries law}}\n\nFish and game laws regulate the right to pursue and take or kill certain kinds of [[fish]] and [[wild animal]] ([[game (food)|game]]). Such laws may restrict the days to harvest fish or game, the number of animals caught per person, the species harvested, or the weapons or fishing gear used. Such laws may seek to balance dueling needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[Population biology|populations]] of fish and game. Game laws can provide a legal structure to collect [[license]] fees and other [[Federal Duck Stamp|money]] which is used to fund [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] efforts as well as to obtain harvest information used in [[wildlife management]] practice.\n\n==Principles==\nEnvironmental law has developed in response to emerging awareness of and concern over issues impacting the entire world. While laws have developed piecemeal and for a variety of reasons, some effort has gone into identifying key concepts and guiding principles common to environmental law as a whole.<ref>For example, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has identified eleven \"emerging principles and concepts\" in international environmental law, derived from the [[Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|1972 Stockholm Conference]], the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|1992 Rio Declaration]], and more recent developments. UNEP, [http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf Training Manual on International Environmental Law] (Chapter 3).</ref> The principles discussed below are not an exhaustive list and are not universally recognized or accepted. Nonetheless, they represent important principles for the understanding of environmental law around the world.\n\n=== Sustainable development ===\n{{Main article|Sustainable development}}\nDefined by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,\" [[sustainable development]] may be considered together with the concepts of \"integration\" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and \"interdependence\" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent).<ref>[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], \u00b6\u00b6 12-19.</ref>  Laws mandating [[environmental impact assessment]] and requiring or encouraging development to minimize environmental impacts may be assessed against this principle.\n\nThe modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN [[Earth Summit]] resulted in the [[Rio Declaration]], Principle 3 of which reads: \"The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations.\" Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Earth Summit 2002), and the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20).\n\n=== Equity ===\n{{Further|Intergenerational equity}}\nDefined by UNEP to include intergenerational equity - \"the right of future generations to enjoy a fair level of the common patrimony\" - and intragenerational equity - \"the right of all people within the current generation to fair access to the current generation's entitlement to the Earth's natural resources\" - environmental equity considers the present generation under an obligation to account for long-term impacts of activities, and to act to sustain the global environment and resource base for future generations.<ref>[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.</ref> Pollution control and resource management laws may be assessed against this principle.\n\n=== Transboundary responsibility ===\nDefined in the international law context as an obligation to protect one's own environment, and to prevent damage to neighboring environments, UNEP considers transboundary responsibility at the international level as a potential limitation on the rights of the [[sovereign state]].<ref>[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], \u00b6\u00b6 24-28.</ref>  Laws that act to limit [[externalities]] imposed upon human health and the environment may be assessed against this principle.\n\n=== Public participation and transparency ===\nIdentified as essential conditions for \"accountable governments,...  industrial concerns,\" and organizations generally, public participation and transparency are presented by UNEP as requiring \"effective protection of the human right to hold and express opinions and to seek, receive and impart ideas,... a right of access to appropriate, comprehensible and timely information held by governments and industrial concerns on economic and social policies regarding the sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment, without imposing undue financial burdens upon the applicants and with adequate protection of privacy and business confidentiality,\" and \"effective judicial and administrative proceedings.\" These principles are present in [[environmental impact assessment]], laws requiring publication and access to relevant environmental data, and [[administrative procedure]].\n\n=== Precautionary principle ===\n{{Main article|Precautionary principle}}\nOne of the most commonly encountered and controversial principles of environmental law, the [[Rio Declaration]] formulated the precautionary principle as follows:\n\n:In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\n\nThe principle may play a role in any debate over the need for environmental regulation.\n\n=== Prevention ===\n:The concept of prevention . . . can perhaps better be considered an overarching aim that gives rise to a multitude of legal mechanisms, including prior assessment of environmental harm, licensing or authorization that set out the conditions for operation and the consequences for violation of the conditions, as well as the adoption of strategies and policies. Emission limits and other product or process standards, the use of best available techniques and similar techniques can all be seen as applications of the concept of prevention.<ref>[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], \u00b6\u00b6 58.</ref>\n\n=== Polluter pays principle ===\n{{Main article|Polluter pays principle}}\nThe polluter pays principle stands for the idea that \"the environmental costs of economic activities, including the cost of preventing potential harm, should be internalized rather than imposed upon society at large.\"<ref>[[Rio Declaration]] Principle 16; [http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual] \u00b6 63.</ref>  All issues related to responsibility for cost for [[environmental remediation]] and compliance with pollution control regulations involve this principle.\n\n==Theory==\nEnvironmental law is a continuing source of controversy. Debates over the necessity, fairness, and cost of environmental regulation are ongoing, as well as regarding the appropriateness of regulations vs. market solutions to achieve even agreed-upon ends.\n\nAllegations of scientific uncertainty fuel the [[Global warming controversy|ongoing debate]] over greenhouse gas regulation, and are a major factor in debates over whether to ban particular pesticides.<ref>See, e.g., [[DDT]].</ref> In cases where the science is well-settled, it is not unusual to find that corporations intentionally hide or distort the facts, or sow confusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2010/0622/Merchants-of-Doubt|title=Merchants of Doubt|author=The Christian Science Monitor|date=22 June 2010|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>\n\nIt is very common for regulated industry to argue against environmental regulation on the basis of cost.<ref>In the United States, estimates of environmental regulation total costs reach 2% of [[GDP]]. See [http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-03-06.pdf Pizer & Kopp, Calculating the Costs of Environmental Regulation, 1 (2003 Resources for the Future)].</ref> Difficulties arise in performing [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental issues.  It is [[Ecosystem valuation|difficult to quantify]] the value of an environmental value such as a healthy ecosystem, clean air, or species diversity. Many environmentalists' response to pitting economy vs. ecology is summed up by former Senator and founder of [[Earth Day]] [[Gaylord Nelson]], \"The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, not the other way around.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond Earth Day: Fulfilling the Promise|first=Gaylord|last=Nelson|date=November 2002|publisher=Wisconsin Press|url=http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/2095.htm|isbn=0-299-18040-9}}</ref> Furthermore, environmental issues are seen by many as having an [[Environmental ethics|ethical or moral]] dimension, which would transcend financial cost. Even so, there are some efforts underway to systemically recognize environmental costs and assets, and account for them properly in economic terms.\n\nWhile affected industries spark controversy in fighting regulation, there are also many environmentalists and public interest groups who believe that current regulations are inadequate, and advocate for stronger protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/can-world-really-set-aside-half-planet-wildlife-180952379/|title=Can the World Really Set Aside Half of the Planet for Wildlife?|publisher=Smithsonian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/03/09/climate-coalition-vows-peaceful-escalated-actions-until-we-break-free-fossil-fuels|title=Climate Coalition Vows 'Peaceful, Escalated' Actions Until 'We Break Free from Fossil Fuels'|work=Common Dreams}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2006/03/guide-environmental-non-profits|title=A Guide to Environmental Non-Profits|work=Mother Jones}}</ref> Environmental law conferences - such as the annual [[University of Oregon School of Law#Public Interest Environmental Law Conference|Public Interest Environmental Law Conference]] in Eugene, Oregon - typically have this focus, also connecting environmental law with class, race, and other issues.\n\nAn additional debate is to what extent environmental laws are fair to all regulated parties. For instance, researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg highlight how smaller organizations can often incur disproportionately larger costs as a result of environmental regulations, which can ultimately create an additional barrier to entry for new firms, thus stifling competition and innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development?

Debates over environmental concerns implicate core principles of international law and have been the subject of numerous international agreements and declarations.\n\n[[Customary international law]] is an important source of international environmental law.  These are the norms and rules that countries follow as a matter of custom and they are so prevalent that they bind all states in the world.  When a principle becomes customary law is not clear cut and many arguments are put forward by states not wishing to be bound.  Examples of customary international law relevant to the environment include the duty to warn other states promptly about icons of an environmental nature and environmental damages to which another state or states may be exposed, and Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration ('good neighbourliness' or sic utere).\n\nNumerous [[List of international environmental agreements|legally binding international agreements]] encompass a wide variety of issue-areas, from terrestrial, marine and atmospheric pollution through to wildlife and biodiversity protection. International environmental agreements are generally [[Multilateral treaty|multilateral]] (or sometimes [[Bilateral treaty|bilateral]]) [[Treaty|treaties]] (a.k.a. convention, agreement, protocol, etc.). [[Treaty#Protocols|Protocols]] are subsidiary agreements built from a primary treaty. They exist in many areas of international law but are especially useful in the environmental field, where they may be used to regularly incorporate recent scientific knowledge. They also permit countries to reach agreement on a framework that would be contentious if every detail were to be agreed upon in advance.  The most widely known protocol in international environmental law is the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which followed from the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].\n\nWhile the bodies that proposed, argued, agreed upon and ultimately adopted existing international agreements vary according to each agreement, certain conferences, including 1972's [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], 1983's [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1992's [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] and 2002's [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] have been particularly important. [[Multilateral environmental agreement]]s sometimes create an International Organization, Institution or Body responsible for implementing the agreement. Major examples are the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES) and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).\n\nInternational environmental law also includes the opinions of international courts and tribunals. While there are few and they have limited authority, the decisions carry much weight with legal commentators and are quite influential on the development of international environmental law. One of the biggest challenges in international decisions is to determine an adequate compensation for environmental damages.<ref>Hardman Reis, T., ''Compensation for Environmental Damages Under International Law'', Kluwer Law International, The Hague, 2011, {{ISBN|978-90-411-3437-0}}.</ref> The courts include the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), the international Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), the [[European Court of Justice]], [[European Court of Human Rights]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/0C818E19-C40B-412E-9856-44126D49BDE6/0/FICHES_Environment_EN.pdf |title=ECtHR case-law factsheet on environment |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110114815/http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/0C818E19-C40B-412E-9856-44126D49BDE6/0/FICHES_Environment_EN.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}</ref> and other regional treaty tribunals.\n\n=== Africa ===\nAccording to the [[International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement]] (INECE), the major environmental issues in Africa are \u201cdrought and [[flood]]ing, air pollution, [[deforestation]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], freshwater availability, degradation of soil and vegetation, and widespread poverty.\u201d <ref name=INECE>{{cite web |title=INECE Regions- Africa |url=http://www.inece.org/region_africa.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820012452/http://www.inece.org/region_africa.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=18 October 2012 |df= }}</ref>  The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is focused on the \u201cgrowing urban and industrial pollution, water quality, [[electronic waste]] and indoor air from cookstoves.\u201d <ref name=EPA>{{cite web|title=Africa International Programs|url=http://www.epa.gov/international/regions/Africa/|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> They hope to provide enough aid on concerns regarding pollution before their impacts contaminate the African environment as well as the global environment.

The Constitution, specifically Articles 10 and 71-74, recognizes the inalienable rights of [[ecosystem]]s to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights. The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property and legalize and manage degradation of the environment rather than prevent it.<ref name=\"Celdf\">Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). 2008. http://www.celdf.org/, accessed April, 2012.</ref> \n \nThe Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime, led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development.

All its trains traverse the [[Channel Tunnel]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]], owned and operated separately by [[Getlink]].\n\nThe London terminus is [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]], the other British calling points being [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]] in Kent. Intermediate calling points in France are [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]] and [[Gare de Lille-Europe|Lille-Europe]], with trains to Paris terminating at [[Gare du Nord]]. Trains to Belgium terminate at [[Brussels-South railway station|Midi/Zuid station]] in Brussels. The only intermediate calling point in the [[Netherlands]] is [[Rotterdam Centraal station|Rotterdam Centraal]], with trains terminating at [[Amsterdam Centraal station|Amsterdam Centraal]]. In addition, there are limited services from London to [[Disneyland Paris]] at [[Gare de Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e - Chessy|Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e \u2013 Chessy]], direct services to southern France (Lyon, Avignon and Marseille) from May to September<ref>https://content-static.eurostar.com/documents/UK_timetable.pdf</ref> (launched on 1 May 2015), and seasonal direct services to the French Alps in winter (December to April).\n\nThe service is operated by eighteen-car [[British Rail Class 373|Class 373/1 trains]] and sixteen-car {{BRC|374}} trains which run at up to {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0}} on a network of high-speed lines. The [[LGV Nord]] line in France opened before Eurostar services began in 1994, and newer lines enabling faster journeys were added later\u2014[[HSL 1]] in Belgium and [[High Speed 1]] in southern England. The French and Belgian parts of the network are shared with Paris\u2013Brussels [[Thalys]] services and also with [[TGV]] trains. In the United Kingdom the two-stage [[High Speed 1|Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] project was completed on 14 November 2007 and renamed ''High Speed 1'', when the London terminus of Eurostar changed from [[Waterloo International railway station|Waterloo International]] to [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]].\n\nUntil 2010, Eurostar was operated jointly by the national railway companies of France and Belgium, [[SNCF]] and [[SNCB/NMBS]], and [[Eurostar (UK) Ltd]] (EUKL), a subsidiary of [[London and Continental Railways]] (LCR), which also owned the high-speed infrastructure and stations on the British side. Eurostar has become the dominant operator on the routes that it operates, carrying more passengers than all airlines combined. Other operators have expressed an interest in starting competing services following deregulation in 2010. On 1 September 2010, Eurostar was incorporated as a single corporate entity called [[Eurostar International Limited]] (EIL), replacing the joint operation between EUKL, SNCF and SNCB/NMBS.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/eurostar-confirms-plans-for-senior-management-changes/ |title= Eurostar confirms plans for senior management changes |work=Breaking Travel News |date=20 August 2009}}</ref> EIL is owned by [[SNCF]] (55%), [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec]] (CDPQ) (30%), [[Hermes Infrastructure]] (10%) and [[NMBS/SNCB|NMBS]] (5%).<ref name=\"bbc-20150304-sale\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31721334 |title=UK government sells Eurostar stake for \u00a3757.1m |work=BBC News Online |date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |quote=Patina Rail LLP will acquire the UK Treasury's entire share \u2026 consortium is made up of two companies: Canadian-based Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ) and the UK's Hermes Infrastructure \u2026 will own 30% and 10% of Eurostar respectively}}</ref><ref name=\"eurostar.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/about-eurostar/our-company/behind-the-scenes|title=Behind the scenes - Eurostar |publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"realestate.ipe.com\">{{cite web |url=https://realestate.ipe.com/news/infrastructure/hermes-secures-eurostar-ownership-for-pension-funds-after-uk-sell-off/10006975.fullarticle|title=Hermes secures Eurostar ownership for pension funds after UK sell-off |publisher= }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, the UK shareholding in Eurostar International Limited was transferred from London and Continental Railways / [[Department for Transport]] to [[HM Treasury]].<ref>{{cite web |title=House of Commons Hansard Ministerial Statements for 19 Jun 2014 (pt 0001) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140619/wmstext/140619m0001.htm |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Commons |accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> That October, it was announced that the UK government planned to raise \u00a3300 million by selling that stake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29588412 |title=Eurostar rail stake touted for sale by UK government |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref> In March 2015, the UK government announced that it would be selling its 40% share to an Anglo-Canadian consortium made up of Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and Hermes Infrastructure.

In 1987, Britain, France and Belgium set up an International Project Group to specify a train to provide an international high-speed passenger service through the tunnel. France had been operating high-speed TGV services since 1981, and had begun construction of a new high-speed line between Paris and the Channel Tunnel, LGV Nord; French TGV technology was chosen as the basis for the new trains.

Compounding the difficulties in providing a similar service are the Channel Tunnel safety rules, the major ones being the \"half-train rule\" and the \"length rule\". The \"half-train rule\" stipulated that passenger trains had to be able to split in the case of emergency.<ref name=\"eurotunnrules\" /> Class 373 trains were designed as two half-sets, which when coupled form a complete train, enabling them to be split easily in the event of an emergency while in the tunnel, with the unaffected set able to be driven out. The half-train rule was finally abolished in May 2010. However, the \"length rule\", which states that passenger trains must be at least 375 metres long with a through corridor (to match the distance between the safety doors in the tunnel), was retained, preventing any potential operators from applying to run services with existing fleets (the majority of both TGV and ICE trains are only 200m long).<ref name=\"channeltunneligc.co.uk\">[http://www.channeltunneligc.co.uk/spip.php?action=acceder_document&arg=152&cle=afc9f895b3a111e715b8cca09821c197&file=pdf%2F100331_-_D15012_Parent-consultees_cons_conclusions.pdf IGC Unified Safety Rules Consultation 2010] \u2013 Intergovernmental Commission</ref>\n\n====French high-speed rail expansion====\nIn October 2009 the President of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, outlined plans to expand TGV services around Paris as well as for fleet renewal.

In other words, it is the moment at which the center of the visible Sun is [[zenith|directly above]] the Equator.\n\nHowever, because the Moon (and to a lesser extent the other planets) cause the true [[Earth's orbit|motion of the Earth]] to [[orbital eccentricity|vary]] from a perfect [[elliptical orbit|ellipse]], the equinox is now officially defined by the Sun's more regular [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] rather than declination. The instants of the equinoxes are currently defined to be when the longitude of the Sun is 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0.<ref>{{cite book |title=Astronomical Almanac 2008 |chapter=Glossary |publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory]] |date=2008}}</ref> There are tiny (up to 1\u00bc [[Minute and second of arc|arcsecond]]) variations in the Sun's latitude (discussed [[#Length of equinoctial day and night|below]]), which means the Sun's center is rarely precisely over the equator under the official definition. The two understandings of the equinox can lead to discrepancies of up to 69 seconds.\n\nOn the day of an equinox, daytime and nighttime are of approximately equal duration all over the planet. They are not exactly equal, however, due to the [[angular diameter|angular size]] of the Sun, [[atmospheric refraction]], and the rapidly changing duration of the length of day that occurs at most latitudes around the equinoxes. The word is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|aequinoctium}}'', from ''{{lang|la|aequus}}'' (equal) and ''{{lang|la|nox}}'' ([[genitive case|genitive]] ''{{lang|la|noctis}}'') (night).\n\n[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|The Sun on the equinox as seen from the site of [[Pizzo Vento]], [[Fondachelli-Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]\n\n==Equinoxes on Earth==\n\n===General===\nThe equinoxes are the only times when the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]] (the \"edge\" between night and day) is perpendicular to the equator. As a result, the northern and southern [[hemispheres of the Earth|hemisphere]]s are equally illuminated.  The word comes from Latin ''Aequus'', meaning \"equal\",  and ''Nox'', meaning \"night\".\n\nIn other words, the equinoxes are the only times when the [[subsolar point]] is on the equator, meaning that the Sun is [[Zenith|exactly overhead]] at a point on the equatorial line. The subsolar point crosses the equator moving northward at the March equinox and southward at the September equinox.\n\nThe equinoxes, along with [[solstices]], are directly related to the [[Seasons|seasons of the year]]. In the northern hemisphere, the '''vernal equinox''' (March) conventionally marks the beginning of [[Spring (season)|spring]] in most cultures and is considered the start of the New Year in Hindu calendar and the Persian calendar or [[Iranian calendars]] as [[Nowruz]] (means new day), while the '''autumnal equinox''' (September) marks the beginning of autumn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/march-equinox.html|publisher=Time and Date|title=March Equinox \u2013 Equal Day and Night, Nearly|date=2017|language=en|access-date=22 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Earth-lighting-equinox_EN.png|Illumination of [[Earth]] by the [[Sun]] at [[March_equinox|the March equinox]]\nImage:Ecliptic path.jpg|The Earth in its orbit around the Sun causes the Sun to appear on the celestial sphere moving over the [[ecliptic]] (red), which is tilted on the [[equator]] (white).\nImage:north season.jpg|Diagram of the Earth's [[season]]s as seen from the north.

Far left: June solstice.\n</gallery>\n\n===Date===\nWhen [[Julius Caesar]] established the [[Julian calendar]] in 45 BC, he set 25 March as the date of the spring equinox which was already the starting day of year in Persian and Indian calendars. Because the Julian year is longer than the [[tropical year]] by about 11.3 minutes on average (or 1 day in 128 years), the calendar \"drifted\" with respect to the two equinoxes \u2014 such that in [[First Council of Nicaea|AD 300]] the spring equinox occurred on about 21 March, and by AD 1500 it had drifted backwards to 11 March.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nThis drift induced [[Pope Gregory XIII]] to create a modern [[Gregorian calendar]]. The Pope wanted to continue to conform with the edicts concerning the [[Easter controversy#Second phase|date of Easter]] of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] of AD 325, which means he wanted to move the vernal equinox to the date on which it fell at that time (21 March is the day allocated to it in the Easter table of the Julian calendar). However, the leap year intervals in his calendar were not smooth (400 is not an exact multiple of 97). This causes the equinox to oscillate by about 53 hours around its mean position. This in turn raised the possibility that it could fall on 22 March, and thus Easter Day might theoretically commence before the equinox. The astronomers chose the appropriate number of days to omit so that the equinox would swing from 19 to 21 March but never fall on the 22nd (although it can in a handful of years fall early in the morning of that day in the Far East).{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Names===\n* Vernal equinox and autumnal equinox: these classical names are direct derivatives of Latin (ver = spring and autumnus = autumn). These are the historically universal and still most widely used terms for the equinoxes, but are potentially confusing because in the southern hemisphere the vernal equinox does not occur in spring and the autumnal equinox does not occur in autumn. The equivalent common language English terms ''spring equinox'' and ''autumn (or fall) equinox'' are even more ambiguous.<ref name=\"Skye2007\">{{cite book|author=Michelle Skye|title=Goddess Alive!: Inviting Celtic & Norse Goddesses Into Your Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1x2ATL66UcC&pg=PT69|year=2007|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=978-0-7387-1080-8|pages=69\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Curtis2013\">{{cite book|author=Howard D Curtis|title=Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2U9Z8k0TlTYC&pg=PA188|date=5 October 2013|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-097748-5|pages=188\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GrewalWeill2007\">{{cite book|author1=Mohinder S.

At that instant, the disk's centre is still below the horizon.\n# The Earth's atmosphere [[refraction|refracts]] sunlight. As a result, an observer sees daylight before the top of the Sun's disk rises above the horizon.\n\nIn sunrise/sunset tables, the assumed semidiameter (apparent [[radius]]) of the Sun is 16 [[Minute and second of arc|arcminutes]] and the [[atmospheric refraction]] is assumed to be 34 arcminutes.

(Prior to this, the word \"equilux\" was more commonly used as a synonym for [[wiktionary:isophot|isophot]], and there was no generally accepted term for the phenomenon.)<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Owens|title=Equinox, Equilux, and Twilight Times|date=20 March 2010|work=Dark Sky Diary (blog)|url=http://darkskydiary.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/equinox-equilux-and-twilight-times/|accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">This meaning of \"equilux\" is rather modern (c. 1985 to 1986) and unusual. Technical references since the beginning of the 20th century (c. 1910) use the terms \"equilux\" and \"isophot\" to mean \"of equal illumination\" in the context of curves showing how intensely lighting equipment will illuminate a surface. See for instance John William Tudor Walsh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iC46AAAAMAAJ&q=equilux+illumination&dq=equilux+illumination ''Textbook of Illuminating Engineering (Intermediate Grade)''], I. Pitman, 1947. The earliest confirmed use of the modern meaning was in a post on the [[Usenet]] group net.astro dated 14 March 1986 [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/net.astro/u1ufhWfdA00/eGRinwb18n0J ''net.astro \u2013 Spring Equilux Approaches''], which refers to \"discussion last year exploring the reasons why equilux and equinox are not coincident\". Use of this particular pseudo-latin [[protologism]] can only be traced to an extremely small (less than six) number of predominently US American people in such online media for the next 20 years until its broader adoption as a [[neologism]] (c. 2006), <!-- board.chrisisaak.com/index.php?showtopic=707 2006 September 22 --> and then its subsequent use by more mainstream organisations (c. 2012) [https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/seasons/the-equinox-and-solstice ''The Equinox and Solstice''], UK Meteorological Office.</ref> At the most precise measurements, there is no such thing as an equilux, because the lengths of day and night change more rapidly than any other time of the year around the equinoxes. In the mid-latitudes, daylight increases or decreases by about three minutes per day at the equinoxes, and thus adjacent days and nights only reach within one minute of each other. The date of the closest approximation of the equilux varies slightly by latitude; in the mid-latitudes, it occurs a few days before the spring equinox and after the fall equinox in each respective hemisphere.\n\n===Geocentric view of the astronomical seasons===\n{{main article|Sun path}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nIn the half-year centered on the June solstice, the Sun rises north of east and sets north of west, which means longer days with shorter nights for the northern hemisphere and shorter days with longer nights for the southern hemisphere. In the half-year centered on the December solstice, the Sun rises south of east and sets south of west and the durations of day and night are reversed.\n\nAlso on the day of an equinox, the Sun rises everywhere on Earth (except at the poles) at about 06:00 and sets at about 18:00 (local solar time). These times are not exact for several reasons:\n* The Sun is much larger in diameter than the Earth, so that more than half of the Earth could be in sunlight at any one time (due to unparallel rays creating tangent points beyond an equal-day-night line).\n* Most places on Earth use a [[time zone]] which differs from the local solar time by minutes or even hours. For example, if a location uses a time zone with reference meridian 15\u00b0 to the east, the Sun will rise around 07:00 on the equinox and set 12 hours later around 19:00.\n* Day length is also affected by the variable orbital speed of the Earth around the sun.  This combined effect is described as the [[equation of time]].  Thus even locations which lie on their time zone's reference meridian will not see sunrise and sunset at 6:00 and 18:00.  At the March equinox they are 7\u20138 minutes later, and at the September equinox they are about 7\u20138 minutes earlier.\n* Sunrise and sunset are commonly defined for the upper limb of the solar disk, rather than its center. The upper limb is already up for at least a minute before the center appears, and the upper limb likewise sets later than the center of the solar disk. Also, when the Sun is near the horizon, atmospheric refraction shifts its apparent position above its true position by a little more than its own diameter. This makes sunrise more than two minutes earlier and sunset an equal amount later. These two effects combine to make the equinox day 12&nbsp;h 7&nbsp;min long and the night only 11&nbsp;h 53&nbsp;min. Note, however, that these numbers are only true for the tropics. For [[Middle Latitudes|moderate latitudes]], the discrepancy increases (e.g., 12 minutes in London); and closer to the poles it becomes very much larger (in terms of time). Up to about 100&nbsp;km from either pole, the Sun is up for a full 24 hours on an equinox day.\n* Height of the horizon changes the day's length. For an observer atop a mountain the day is longer, while standing in a valley will shorten the day.\n\n====Day arcs of the Sun====\n{{main article|Sun path}}\n\nSome of the statements above can be made clearer by picturing the day arc (i.e., [[sun path|the path]] along which the Sun [[diurnal motion|appears to move]] across the sky). The pictures show this for every hour on equinox day. In addition, some 'ghost' suns are also indicated below the horizon, up to 18\u00b0 below it; the Sun in such areas still causes [[twilight]]. The depictions presented below can be used for both the northern and the southern hemispheres. The observer is understood to be sitting near the tree on the island depicted in the middle of the ocean; the green arrows give cardinal directions.\n* In the [[northern hemisphere]], north is to the left, the Sun rises in the east (far arrow), [[culmination|culminates]] in the south (right arrow), while moving to the right and setting in the west (near arrow).\n* In the [[southern hemisphere]], south is to the left, the Sun rises in the east (near arrow), culminates in the north (right arrow), while moving to the left and setting in the west (far arrow).\n\nThe following special cases are depicted:\n<gallery widths=\"240px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:equinox-0.jpg |'''Day arc at 0\u00b0 latitude (equator)'''<br />The arc passes through the [[zenith]], resulting in almost no shadows at high noon.\nFile:equinox-20.jpg|'''Day arc at 20\u00b0 latitude'''<br />The Sun culminates at 70\u00b0 altitude and its path at sunrise and sunset occurs at a steep 70\u00b0 angle to the horizon.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the term ''vernal point'' is used for the time of this occurrence and for the precise direction in space where the Sun exists at that time. This point is the origin of some [[celestial coordinate system]]s, which are usually rooted to an astronomical [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] since it gradually varies ([[Axial precession|precesses]]) over time:\n* in the [[ecliptic coordinate system]], the vernal point is the origin of the [[ecliptic longitude]];\n* in the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the vernal point is the origin of the [[right ascension]].\n\n[[File:Equinox diagram.svg|270px|thumb|Diagram illustrating the difference between the Sun's [[celestial longitude]] being zero and the Sun's [[declination]] being zero. The Sun's [[celestial latitude]] never exceeds 1.2 [[Minute and second of arc|arcseconds]], but is exaggerated in this diagram.]]\n\nStrictly speaking, at the equinox, the Sun's ecliptic longitude is zero. Its latitude will not be exactly zero, since Earth is not exactly in the plane of the ecliptic. Its declination will not be exactly zero either. (The ecliptic is defined by the [[barycenter]] of Earth and the Moon combined.) The modern definition of equinox is the instants when the Sun's apparent geocentric longitude is 0\u00b0 ([[March equinox|northward equinox]]) or 180\u00b0 ([[September equinox|southward equinox]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Astronomical Almanac 2008|last=United States Naval Observatory|date=2006}} Glossary Chapter.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Meeus|first=Jean|date=1997|title=Mathematical Astronomy Morsels}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Astronomical Algorithms, Second Edition|last=Meeus|first=Jean|date=1998}}</ref> See the adjacent diagram.\n\nBecause of the [[precession (astronomy)|precession of the Earth's axis]], the position of the vernal point on the [[celestial sphere]] changes over time, and the equatorial and the ecliptic coordinate systems change accordingly. Thus when specifying celestial coordinates for an object, one has to specify at what time the vernal point and the celestial equator are taken. That reference time is called the [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox of date]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Astronomy on the Personal Computer |first=Oliver |last=Montenbruck |first2=Thomas |last2=Pfleger |publisher=Springer-Verlag |page=17 |isbn=0-387-57700-9}}</ref>\n\nThe autumnal equinox is at ecliptic longitude 180\u00b0 and at [[right ascension]] 12h.\n\nThe upper [[culmination]] of the vernal point is considered the start of the [[sidereal time|sidereal day]] for the observer. The [[hour angle]] of the vernal point is, by definition, the observer's [[sidereal time]].\n\nUsing the current official [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] constellation boundaries \u2013 and taking into account the variable precession speed and the rotation of the celestial equator \u2013 the equinoxes shift through the constellations as follows<ref>J. Meeus; Mathematical Astronomical Morsels; {{ISBN|0-943396-51-4}}.</ref> (expressed in [[astronomical year numbering]] when the year 0 = 1 BC, \u22121 = 2 BC, etc.):\n* The March equinox passed from [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] into [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] in year \u22121865, passed into [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] in year \u221267, will pass into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] in year 2597, and then into [[Capricornus]] in year 4312. In 1489 it came within 10 [[arcminutes]] of [[Cetus]] without crossing the boundary.\n* The September equinox passed from Libra into [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] in year \u2212729, will pass into [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] in year 2439.\n\n===Cultural aspects===\n{{Main article|March equinox#Culture|September equinox#Culture}}\nThe equinoxes are sometimes regarded as the start of spring and autumn. A number of traditional [[harvest festival]]s  are celebrated on the date of the equinoxes.\n\nObservations of the equinox are frequently used in online debates between [[Flat_Earth|flat earth]] conspiracy proponents and those who support the generally-accepted [[heliocentric]] [[globe]] model.  [https://www.youtube.com/user/Wolfie6020/videos Wolfie6020], a well-known flat earth debunker on YouTube, has a semi-annual [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WPVcwEGtTU Equinox Challenge] with prizes available to any flat earther who can show a functioning flat earth model that can match observations on the equinox. As of September 2018, no flat earther has succeeded in winning the prize. Modern flat earth proponents typically cite an [[azimuthal equidistant projection]] map to explain the daily and annual movement of the sun and moon, a sort of circling pattern around the north pole, oscillating between the tropics throughout the year. However, proponents of the globe model point out that observations of the equinox sunrise and sunset azimuths (at 090 east and 270 west all over earth) match the globe model but cannot be reconciled with a localized overhead sun above a flat plane.\n\n==Effects on satellites==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n\nOne effect of equinoctial periods is the temporary disruption of [[communications satellite]]s. For all [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellites, there are a few days around the equinox when the sun goes directly behind the satellite relative to Earth (i.e. within the beam-width of the ground-station antenna) for a short period each day. The Sun's immense power and broad radiation spectrum overload the Earth station's reception circuits with noise and, depending on antenna size and other factors, temporarily disrupt or degrade the circuit. The duration of those effects varies but can range from a few minutes to an hour. (For a given frequency band, a larger antenna has a narrower beam-width and hence experiences shorter duration \"Sun outage\" windows.){{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Equinoxes on other planets==\n[[File:Saturn, its rings, and a few of its moons.jpg|right|thumb|250px|When the planet [[Saturn]] is at equinox, its [[rings of Saturn|rings]] reflect little sunlight, as seen in this image by ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' in 2009.]]\n\nEquinoxes occur on any planet with a tilted rotational axis.

He received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1963 \"for his contributions to the theory of the [[atomic nucleus]] and the [[elementary particles]], particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\".<ref name=\"Prize\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1963/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1963 |accessdate=May 19, 2015 |publisher=Nobel Foundation}}</ref>\n\nA graduate of the [[Technical University of Berlin]], Wigner worked as an assistant to [[Karl Weissenberg]] and [[Richard Becker (physicist)|Richard Becker]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in Berlin, and [[David Hilbert]] at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. Wigner and [[Hermann Weyl]] were responsible for introducing [[group theory]] into physics, particularly the theory of [[symmetry in physics]]. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work in pure mathematics, in which he authored a number of [[mathematical theorem]]s. In particular, [[Wigner's theorem]] is a cornerstone in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]]. He is also known for his research into the structure of the [[atomic nucleus]]. In 1930, [[Princeton University]] recruited Wigner, along with [[John von Neumann]], and he moved to the United States.\n\nWigner participated in a meeting with [[Leo Szilard]] and [[Albert Einstein]] that resulted in the [[Einstein-Szilard letter]], which prompted President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop [[atomic bombs]]. Wigner was afraid that the [[German nuclear weapon project]] would develop an atomic bomb first. During the Manhattan Project, he led a team whose task was to design [[nuclear reactor]]s to convert [[uranium]] into [[weapons grade plutonium]].  At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet [[Criticality (status)|gone critical]]. Wigner was disappointed that [[DuPont]] was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He became Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]) in early 1946, but became frustrated with bureaucratic interference by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], and returned to Princeton.\n\nIn the postwar period he served on a number of government bodies, including the [[National Bureau of Standards]] from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the [[National Science Foundation]], and the influential General Advisory Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'', his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Heisenberg,W. Wigner,E. 1928.jpg|thumb|left|[[Werner Heisenberg]] and Eugene Wigner (1928)]]\nWigner Jen\u0151 P\u00e1l was born in [[Budapest]], [[Austria-Hungary]] on November 17, 1902, to middle class Jewish parents, Elisabeth (Einhorn) and Anthony Wigner, a leather tanner. He had an older sister, Bertha, known as Biri, and a younger sister Margit, known as Manci,{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=9\u201312}} who later married British theoretical physicist [[Paul Dirac]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=164\u2013166}} He was home schooled by a professional teacher until the age of 9, when he started school at the third grade. During this period, Wigner developed an interest in mathematical problems.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=14\u201315}} At the age of 11, Wigner contracted what his doctors believed to be [[tuberculosis]]. His parents sent him to live for six weeks in a [[sanatorium]] in the Austrian mountains, before the doctors concluded that the diagnosis was mistaken.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nWigner's family was Jewish, but not religiously observant, and his [[Bar Mitzvah]] was a secular one. From 1915 through 1919, he studied at the secondary grammar school called [[Fasori Gimn\u00e1zium|Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium]], the school his father had attended. Religious education was compulsory, and he attended classes in [[Judaism]] taught by a rabbi.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=33\u201334, 47}} A fellow student was [[J\u00e1nos von Neumann]], who was a year behind Wigner. They both benefited from the instruction of the noted mathematics teacher [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=49\u201353}} In 1919, to escape the [[B\u00e9la Kun]] [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|communist regime]], the Wigner family briefly fled to Austria, returning to [[Hungary]] after Kun's downfall.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=40\u201343}} Partly as a reaction to the prominence of Jews in the Kun regime, the family converted to [[Lutheranism]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|p=38}} Wigner explained later in his life that his family decision to convert to Lutheranism \"was not at heart a religious decision but an anti-communist one\".{{sfn|Szanton|1992|p=38}} On religious views, Wigner was an [[atheist]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=60\u201361|quote=Neither did I want to be a clergyman. I liked a good sermon. But religion tells people how to behave and that I could never do. Clergymen also had to assume and advocate the presence of God, and proofs of God's existence seemed to me quite unsatisfactory. People claimed that He had made our earth. Well, how had He made it? With an earth-making machine? Someone once asked [[Saint Augustine]], \"What did the Lord do before he created the world?\" And Saint Augustine is said to have answered, \"He created Hell for people who ask such questions.\" A retort perhaps made in jest, but I knew of none better. I saw that I could not know anything of God directly, that His presence was a matter of belief, I did not have that belief, and preaching without belief is repulsive. So I could not be a clergyman, however many people might gain salvation. And my parents never pressed the point.}}\n\nAfter graduating from the secondary school in 1920, Wigner enrolled at the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest University of Technical Sciences]], known as the ''M\u0171egyetem''. He was not happy with the courses on offer,{{sfn|Szanton|1992|p=59}}  and in 1921 enrolled at the ''[[Technische Hochschule]] Berlin'' (now [[Technical University of Berlin]]), where he studied [[chemical engineering]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=64\u201365}}  He also attended the Wednesday afternoon colloquia of the [[German Physical Society]]. These colloquia featured such luminaries as [[Max Planck]], [[Max von Laue]], [[Rudolf Ladenburg]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Walther Nernst]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], and [[Albert Einstein]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=68\u201375}} Wigner also met the physicist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], who at once became Wigner's closest friend.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=93\u201394}} A third experience in Berlin was formative. Wigner worked at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]] (now the [[Fritz Haber Institute]]), and there he met [[Michael Polanyi]], who became, after [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz]], Wigner's greatest teacher. Polanyi supervised Wigner's [[DSc]] thesis, ''Bildung und Zerfall von Molek\u00fclen'' (\"Formation and Decay of Molecules\").{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=76\u201384}}\n\n==Middle years==\nWigner returned to Budapest, where he went to work at his father's tannery, but in 1926, he accepted an offer from [[Karl Weissenberg]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in Berlin. Weissenberg wanted someone to assist him with his work on [[x-ray]] [[crystallography]], and Polanyi had recommended Wigner. After six months as Weissenberg's assistant, Wigner went to work for [[Richard Becker (physicist)|Richard Becker]] for two semesters. Wigner explored [[quantum mechanics]], studying the work of [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]]. He also delved into the [[group theory]] of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Ferdinand Frobenius]] and  [[Eduard Ritter von Weber]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=101\u2013106}}\n\nWigner received a request from [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] to work at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as an assistant to the great mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This proved a disappointment, as the aged Hilbert's abilities were failing, and his interests had shifted to logic. Wigner nonetheless studied independently.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=109\u2013112}} He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the [[Wigner D-matrix]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=E. |year=1927 |title=Einige Folgerungen aus der Schr\u00f6dingerschen Theorie f\u00fcr die Termstrukturen  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]] |volume=43 |issue=9\u201310 |pages=624\u2013652 |doi=10.1007/BF01397327 |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..624W }}</ref> Wigner and [[Hermann Weyl]] were responsible for introducing group theory into quantum mechanics.

By 1929, his papers were drawing notice in the world of physics. In 1930, [[Princeton University]] recruited Wigner for a one-year lectureship, at 7 times the salary that he had been drawing in Europe. Princeton recruited von Neumann at the same time.  Jen\u0151 P\u00e1l Wigner and J\u00e1nos von Neumann had collaborated on three papers together in 1928 and two in 1929. They anglicized their first names to \"Eugene\" and \"John\", respectively.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=127\u2013132}} When their year was up, Princeton offered a five-year contract as visiting professors for half the year.

This was very timely, since the [[Nazi]]s soon rose to power in Germany.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=136, 153\u2013155}} At Princeton in 1934, Wigner introduced his sister Manci to the physicist [[Paul Dirac]], whom she married.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\nPrinceton did not rehire Wigner when his contract ran out in 1936.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=171\u2013172}} Through [[Gregory Breit]], Wigner found new employment at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|University of Wisconsin]]. There he met his first wife, Amelia Frank, who was a physics student there. However she died unexpectedly in 1937, leaving Wigner distraught. He therefore accepted a 1938 offer from Princeton to return there.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=173\u2013178}} Wigner became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States on January 8, 1937, and he brought his parents to the United States.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=184\u2013185}}\n\n==Manhattan Project==\n[[File:Eugene Wigner receiving Medal for Merit cph.3a38621.jpg|thumb|Wigner receiving the [[Medal for Merit]] for his work on the Manhattan Project from [[Robert P.

Weinberg]], [[Katharine Way]], Gale Young and [[Edward Creutz]]. The group's task was to design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium.  At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet [[Criticality (status)|gone critical]]. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a [[graphite]] [[neutron moderator]] and water cooling.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=217\u2013218}} Wigner was present at a converted rackets court under the stands at the [[University of Chicago]]'s abandoned [[Stagg Field]] on December 2, 1942, when the world's first atomic reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile One (CP-1)]] achieved a controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/cp1list.html |title=Chicago Pile 1 Pioneers |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] |accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:HD.5A.036 (10555475386).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Chianti]] [[Fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]] purchased by Wigner to help celebrate the first self-sustaining, controlled chain reaction.

He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it by the head of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], [[Arthur Compton]], who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when [[neutron poison]]ing became a problem.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=233\u2013235}} Without the additional tubes, the reactor could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power; but this would have set the project back a year.{{sfn|Wigner|Weinberg|1992|p=8}} During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the [[Savannah River Site]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=233\u2013235}} Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|p=249}}\n\nAn important discovery Wigner made during the project was the [[Wigner effect]].

Groves, Jr.]], had forbidden such experiments in August 1946 after the death of [[Louis Slotin]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].

Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The [[seismicity]], or '''seismic activity,''' of an area is the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word ''tremor'' is also used for [[Episodic tremor and slip|non-earthquake seismic rumbling]].\n\nAt the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the [[epicenter]] of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a [[tsunami]]. Earthquakes can also trigger [[landslide]]s, and occasionally volcanic activity.\n\nIn its most general sense, the word ''earthquake'' is used to describe any seismic event \u2014 whether natural or caused by humans \u2014 that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological [[Fault (geology)|faults]], but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and [[Underground nuclear testing|nuclear tests]]. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its [[focus (earthquake)|focus]] or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.\n\n==Naturally occurring earthquakes==\n[[File:Fault types.png|thumb|Fault types]]\n\nTectonic earthquakes occur anywhere in the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a [[Fault (geology)|fault plane]]. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and [[Aseismic creep|aseismically]] only if there are no irregularities or [[Asperity (faults)|asperities]] along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of [[Stick-slip phenomenon|stick-slip behavior]]. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the [[Potential energy|stored energy]].<ref name=\"Ohnaka\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp0gAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA234 | title=The Physics of Rock Failure and Earthquakes | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Ohnaka, M. | year=2013 | page=148 | isbn=9781107355330}}</ref> This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] [[seismic waves]], frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the [[elastic-rebound theory]]. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]] growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available [[elastic potential energy]] and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's deep interior.]]<ref name=\"USGS1\">{{cite web|last=Spence |first=William |author2=S.

Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of [[Strike and dip|dip]] and movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being [[Extensional tectonics|extended]] such as a [[divergent boundary]]. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being [[Thrust tectonics|shortened]] such as at a convergent boundary. [[Strike-slip fault]]s are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.\n\nReverse faults, particularly those along [[Convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]] are associated with the most powerful earthquakes, [[megathrust earthquake]]s, including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental [[Transform fault|transforms]], can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 30 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 900 times (30 \u00d7 30) more energy than a 5.0 magnitude of earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs like those used in [[World War II]].<ref>Geoscience Australia</ref>\n\nThis is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wyss | first1 = M. | year = 1979 | title = Estimating expectable maximum magnitude of earthquakes from fault dimensions | url = | journal = Geology | volume = 7 | issue = 7| pages = 336\u2013340 |bibcode = 1979Geo.....7..336W |doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1979)7<336:EMEMOE>2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet which can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 degrees Celsius flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.<ref>Sibson R. H.

Examples are the earthquakes in [[List of earthquakes in Chile|Chile, 1960]]; [[1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake|Alaska, 1957]]; [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Sumatra, 2004]], all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the [[San Andreas Fault]] (1857, 1906), the [[North Anatolian Fault]] in Turkey (1939) and the [[Denali Fault]] in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.\n\n[[File:Kluft-photo-Carrizo-Plain-Nov-2007-Img 0327.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photo of the San Andreas Fault in the [[Carrizo Plain]], northwest of Los Angeles]]\n\nThe most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault is however not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcmt.org/CMTsearch.html |title=Global Centroid Moment Tensor Catalog |publisher=Globalcmt.org |accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref> Thus the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can become 50 to 100&nbsp;km ([[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami|Japan, 2011]]; [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Alaska, 1964]]), making the most powerful earthquakes possible.\n\nStrike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10&nbsp;km within the brittle crust,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wgcep.org/data-inst_eq_cat |title=Instrumental California Earthquake Catalog |publisher=WGCEP |accessdate=2011-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725021215/http://wgcep.org/data-inst_eq_cat |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}</ref> thus earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible.

Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schorlemmer | first1 = D. | last2 = Wiemer | first2 = S. | last3 = Wyss | first3 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Variations in earthquake-size distribution across different stress regimes | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7058| pages = 539\u2013542 |bibcode = 2005Natur.437..539S |doi = 10.1038/nature04094 | pmid = 16177788 }}</ref> This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that 'pushes' the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (''greatest'' principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass 'escapes' in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, thus the overburden equals the ''least'' principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.\n\n===Earthquakes away from plate boundaries===\n{{main article|Intraplate earthquake}}\n[[File:Tremor(English).gif|thumb|Comparison of the 1985 and 2017 earthquakes on Mexico City, Puebla and Michoac\u00e1n/Guerrero]]\nWhere plate boundaries occur within the [[Continental crust|continental lithosphere]], deformation is spread out over a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In the case of the [[San Andreas fault]] continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace (e.g., the \"Big bend\" region). The [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]] was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the [[Arabian plate|Arabian]] and [[Eurasian plate]]s where it runs through the northwestern part of the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself.

The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than 100 m while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.<ref name=\"NRS\"/>\n\nRupture propagation is generally modeled using a [[fracture mechanics]] approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity is a function of the fracture energy in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70\u201390% of the S-wave velocity, and this is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These [[supershear earthquake]]s have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the [[2001 Kunlun earthquake]] has been attributed to the effects of the [[sonic boom]] developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as [[slow earthquake]]s.

Prior to the development of [[accelerograph|strong-motion accelerometers]] that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated on the basis of the observed effects, as categorized on various [[seismic intensity scales]].  Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the earth's crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions, but also on the strength or ''magnitude'' of the rupture, and on its distance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Seismic magnitude scales#Richter|first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes]] was developed by [[Charles F.

It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. [[Seismic waves]] travel through the [[Earth's interior]] and can be recorded by [[seismometer]]s at great distances. The [[surface wave magnitude]] was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The [[moment magnitude scale]] measures the amplitude of the shock, but also takes into account the [[seismic moment]] (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale]], the [[Medvedev\u2013Sponheuer\u2013Karnik scale]], and the [[Mercalli intensity scale]] are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.\n\nEvery tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:\n* Longitudinal [[P-waves]] (shock- or pressure waves)\n* Transverse [[S-waves]] (both body waves)\n* [[Surface wave]]s \u2014 ([[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh]] and [[Love wave|Love]] waves)\n[[Propagation velocity]] of the seismic waves ranges from approx. 3&nbsp;km/s up to 13&nbsp;km/s, depending on the [[density]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the medium. In the Earth's interior the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7 : 1). The differences in travel time from the [[epicentre|epicenter]] to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the [[hypocenter]] can be computed roughly.\n\nIn solid rock P-waves travel at about 6 to 7&nbsp;km per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to ~13&nbsp;km/s. The velocity of S-waves ranges from 2\u20133&nbsp;km/s in light sediments and 4\u20135&nbsp;km/s in the Earth's crust up to 7&nbsp;km/s in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.\n\nOn average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P and S wave '''times 8'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/PamelaSpiegel.shtml |title=Speed of Sound through the Earth |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analyses of seismograms the Earth's core was located in 1913 by [[Beno Gutenberg]].\n\nS waves and later arriving surface waves do main damage compared to P waves. P wave squeezes and expands material in the same direction it is traveling. S wave shakes the ground up and down and back and forth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsela.com/articles/govt-science-earthquakes/id/26756/|title=Newsela {{!}} The science of earthquakes|website=newsela.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>\n\nEarthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur.

Since the establishment of the first [[shogunate]] in 1199, the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander, unlike many Western [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchs]]. Japanese Emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces, to varying degrees. In fact, between 1192 and 1867, the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'', or their ''[[shikken]]'' regents in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] (1203\u20131333), were the ''de facto'' rulers of Japan, although they were nominally appointed by the Emperor. After the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1867, the Emperor was the embodiment of all sovereign power in the realm, as enshrined in the [[Meiji Constitution]] of 1889. Since the enactment of the 1947 Constitution, he has been a ceremonial head of state without even nominal political powers.\n\nSince the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] has been called ''Ky\u016bj\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u5bae\u57ce}}), later ''K\u014dkyo'' ({{lang|ja|\u7687\u5c45}}), and is on the former site of [[Edo Castle]] in the heart of [[Tokyo]] (the current capital of Japan). Earlier, Emperors resided in [[Kyoto]] (the ancient capital) for nearly eleven centuries. [[The Emperor's Birthday]] (currently December 23) is a national holiday.\n\n==Role==\nUnlike most constitutional monarchs, the Emperor is not even the ''nominal'' chief executive. [[wikisource:Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER V. THE CABINET|Article 65]] explicitly vests executive power in the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]], of which the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] is the leader. The Emperor is also not the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]. The Japan Self-Defense Forces Act of 1954 also explicitly vests this role with the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Emperor's powers are limited only to important ceremonial functions. [[wikisource:Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER I. THE EMPEROR|Article 4]] of the Constitution stipulates that the Emperor \"shall perform only such acts in matters of state as are provided for in the Constitution and he shall not have powers related to government.\" It also stipulates that \"the advice and approval of the Cabinet shall be required for all acts of the Emperor in matters of state\" (Article 3). Article 4 also states that these duties can be delegated by the Emperor as provided for by law.\n\nWhile the Emperor formally [[Imperial Investiture|appoints]] the Prime Minister to office, Article 6 of the Constitution requires him to appoint the candidate \"as designated by the [[National Diet|Diet]]\", without giving the Emperor the right to decline appointment.\n\n[[wikisource:Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER I. THE EMPEROR|Article 6]] of the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]] delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles:\n#Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet.\n#Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet.\n\nThe Emperor's other duties are laid down in article 7 of the Constitution, where it is stated that \"the Emperor, with the advice and approval of the Cabinet, shall perform the following acts in matters of state on behalf of the people.\" In practice, all of these duties are exercised only in accordance with the binding instructions of the Cabinet:\n#Promulgation of amendments of the constitution, laws, cabinet orders, and treaties.\n#Convocation of the Diet.\n#Dissolution of the House of Representatives.\n#Proclamation of general election of members of the Diet.\n#Attestation of the appointment and dismissal of Ministers of State and other officials as provided for by law, and of full powers and credentials of Ambassadors and Ministers.\n#Attestation of general and special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights.\n#Awarding of honors.\n#Attestation of instruments of ratification and other diplomatic documents as provided for by law.\n#Receiving foreign ambassadors and ministers.\n#Performance of ceremonial functions.\n\nRegular ceremonies of the Emperor with a constitutional basis are the [[Imperial Investiture]]s ''(Shinninshiki)'' in the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] and the [[Speech from the Throne]] ceremony in the [[House of Councillors]] in the [[National Diet Building]]. The latter ceremony opens ordinary and extra sessions of the Diet. Ordinary sessions are opened each January and also after new elections to the House of Representatives. Extra sessions usually convene in the autumn and are opened then.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVYP66nRSO8 The formal investiture of the Prime Minister in 2010], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBcygK0uQ7E the opening of the ordinary session of the Diet in January 2012] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEkWcXFZz2c the opening of an extra session of the Diet in the autumn of 2011.] The 120th anniversary of the Diet was commemorarated with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAY-7gl21i0 a special ceremony] in the House of Councillors in November 2010, when also the Empress and the Prince and Princess Akishino were present.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAlthough the Emperor has been a symbol of continuity with the past, the degree of power exercised by the Emperor has varied considerably throughout Japanese history.

(1896). ''Nihongi,''  pp. 109.</ref>\n\nArchaeological information about the earliest historical rulers of Japan may lie within the ancient tombs known as [[kofun]], constructed between the early 3rd century and the early 7th century AD. However, since the [[Meiji period]], the [[Imperial Household Agency]] has refused to open the kofun to the public nor to archaeologists, citing their desire not to disturb the spirits of the past Emperors. In December 2006, the Imperial Household Agency reversed its position and decided to allow researchers to enter some of the kofun with no restrictions.\n\n===Factional control===\nThere have been six non-imperial [[Japanese clans|families]] who have controlled Japanese emperors: the [[Soga clan|Soga]] (530s\u2013645), the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] (850s\u20131070), the [[Taira clan|Taira]] (1159-1180s), the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] (and [[Kamakura Bakufu|Kamakura bakufu]]) (1192\u20131333), the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Ashikaga]] (1336\u20131565), and the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] (1603\u20131867). However, every shogun from the Minamoto, Ashikaga, and Tokugawa families had to be officially recognized by the Emperors, who were still the source of sovereignty, although they could not exercise their powers independently from the Shogunate.\n\n===Disputes===\nThe growth of the [[samurai]] class from the 10th century gradually weakened the power of the imperial family over the realm, leading to a time of instability. Emperors have been known to come into conflict with the reigning shogun from time to time. Some instances, such as [[Emperor Go-Toba]]'s [[J\u014dky\u016b War|1221 rebellion]] against the [[Kamakura shogunate]] and the 1336 [[Kenmu Restoration]] under [[Emperor Go-Daigo]], show the power struggle between the imperial court and the military governments of Japan.\n\n===Territorial matters===\nUntil recent centuries, Japan's territory did not include [[List of extreme points of Japan|several remote regions]] of its modern-day territory. The name \"[[Names of Japan|Nippon]]\" came into use only many centuries after the start of the current imperial line. Centralized government only began to appear shortly before and during the time of [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] (572\u2013622). The Emperor was more like a revered embodiment of divine harmony than the head of an actual governing administration. In Japan, it has always been easy for ambitious lords to hold actual power, as such positions have not been inherently contradictory to the Emperor's position. The parliamentary government today continues a similar coexistence with the Emperor as have various shoguns, regents, warlords, guardians, etc.\n\nHistorically the titles of ''Tenn\u014d'' in Japanese have never included territorial designations as is the case with many European monarchs. The position of Emperor is a territory-independent phenomenon\u2014the Emperor is the Emperor, even if he has followers only in one province (as was the case sometimes with the southern and northern courts).\n\n===''Sh\u014dguns''===\nFrom 1192 to 1867, sovereignty of the state was exercised by the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'', or their ''[[shikken]]'' regents (1203\u20131333), whose authority was conferred by Imperial warrant. When [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers first came into contact with the Japanese (see ''[[Nanban period]]''), they described Japanese conditions in analogy, likening the Emperor with great symbolic authority but little political power, to the [[Pope]], and the ''sh\u014dgun'' to secular European rulers (e.g., the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]). In keeping with the analogy, they even used the term \"Emperor\" in reference to the ''sh\u014dguns'' and their regents, e.g. in the case of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], whom missionaries called \"Emperor Taico-sama\" (from [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|Taik\u014d]] and the honorific ''[[Japanese titles|sama]]'').\n\n===Meiji restoration===\n{{main article|Meiji Restoration}}\n\nAfter the [[United States Navy]] [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s [[Black Ships]] forcibly opened Japan to foreign trade, and the shogunate proved incapable of hindering the \"barbarian\" interlopers, the [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] began to assert himself politically. By the early 1860s, the relationship between the imperial court and the Shogunate was changing radically. Disaffected [[Han system|domains]] and ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' began to rally to the call of ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\"). The domains of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]], historic enemies of the Tokugawa, used this turmoil to unite their forces and won an important military victory outside of [[Kyoto]] against Tokugawa forces.\n\nIn 1868, imperial \"restoration\" was declared, and the Shogunate was dissolved. A new constitution described the Emperor as \"the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty\", whose rights included to sanction and promulgate laws, to execute them and to exercise \"supreme command of the Army and the Navy\". The liaison conference created in 1893 also made the Emperor the leader of the [[Imperial General Headquarters]].\n\n===World War II===\nThe role of the Emperor as head of the [[State Shinto]] religion was exploited during the war, creating an [[Imperial cult]] that led to [[kamikaze]] bombers and other [[Hirohito#Civilian deaths and suicides|fanaticism]]. This in turn led to the requirement in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] for the elimination \"for all time [of] the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest\". In [[State Shinto]], the Emperor was believed to be a [[Arahitogami]] (a living god). Following Japan's surrender, the Allies issued the [[Shinto Directive]] separating church and state within Japan.\n\n===Current constitution===\nThe constitution provides for a [[parliamentary system]] of government and guarantees certain fundamental rights. Under its terms, the Emperor of Japan is \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\" and exercises a purely ceremonial role without the possession of sovereignty.\n\nThe constitution, also known as the {{nihongo|\"[[Constitution of Japan]]\"|\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u61b2\u6cd5|Nihonkoku-Kenp\u014d|formerly written \u65e5\u672c\u570b\u61b2\u6cd5 (same pronunciation)}}, {{nihongo|\"Postwar Constitution\"|\u6226\u5f8c\u61b2\u6cd5|Sengo-Kenp\u014d}} or the {{nihongo|\"Peace Constitution\"|\u5e73\u548c\u61b2\u6cd5|Heiwa-Kenp\u014d}}, was drawn up under the [[Allied occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]] that followed World War II and was intended to replace Japan's previous militaristic and quasi-absolute monarchy system with a form of liberal democracy. Currently, it is a rigid document and no subsequent amendment has been made to it since its adoption.\n\n===Relation to Shinto===\nIn [[Japanese mythology]], according to ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the Emperor and his family are said to be direct descendants of the sun-goddess [[Amaterasu]]. During [[World War II]], the role of the Emperor as head of the [[Shinto]] religion was exploited, which resulted in the creation of [[State Shinto]] and an [[Imperial cult]]. Following the end of the Second World War, the Allies issued the [[Shinto Directive]] which abolished the state support for the Shinto religion, leading to the [[Humanity Declaration]] of the incumbent Emperor which refuted the idea that the Emperor is a living divine being, and dismissed the importance of \"myths and legends\" for the Emperor's status. However, the Emperors have continued to perform many traditional ceremonies privately.<ref>[http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/%257egln/77/7750/775004.htm \u5f79\u54e1\u3001\u7dcf\u4ee3\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58 \u5168\u56fd\u795e\u793e\u7dcf\u4ee3\u4f1a\u7de8\u96c6\u767a\u884c\u300c\u6539\u8a02\u795e\u793e\u5f79\u54e1\u3001\u7dcf\u4ee3\u5fc5\u643a\u300d]{{jp icon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Ritual Ceremonies of the Imperial Palace - The Imperial Household Agency|url=http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/kyuchu/saishi.html|website=www.kunaicho.go.jp|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=List of main ritual ceremonies of the Imperial Palace - The Imperial Household Agency|url=http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/kyuchu/saishi/saishi01.html|website=www.kunaicho.go.jp|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nThe Emperors traditionally had an education officer. In recent times, [[Emperor Taish\u014d]] had Count [[Nogi Maresuke]], [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] had Marshal-Admiral Marquis [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]], and Emperor [[Akihito]] had [[Elizabeth Gray Vining]] as well as [[:ja:\u5c0f\u6cc9\u4fe1\u4e09|Shinz\u014d Koizumi]] as their tutors.\n\n==Addressing and naming==\nThere are two Japanese words equivalent to the English word \"Emperor\": ''tenn\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u5929\u7687}}, \"heavenly sovereign\"), which is used exclusively to refer to the Emperor of Japan, and ''k\u014dtei'' (\u7687\u5e1d, the title used for all other foreign Emperors), which is used primarily to describe non-Japanese Emperors. ''Sumeramikoto'' (\"the Imperial person\") was also used in [[Old Japanese language|Old Japanese]]. The term ''tenn\u014d'' was used by the Emperors up until the Middle Ages; then, following a period of disuse, it was used again from the 19th century.<ref>Screech, (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779\u20131822,'' p. 232 n4.</ref>  In [[English language|English]], the term ''mikado'' ({{lang|ja|\u5fa1\u9580}} or {{lang|ja|\u5e1d}}), literally meaning \"the honorable gate\" (i.e. the gate of the imperial palace, which indicates the person who lives in and possesses the palace), was once used (as in ''[[The Mikado]]'', a 19th-century [[operetta]]), but this term is now obsolete.<ref name=\"Asakawa1903\">Kan\u02bcichi Asakawa.

Tokyo: Shueisha (1903), p. 25. \"We purposely avoid, in spite of its wide usage in foreign literature, the misleading term ''Mikado''. If it be not for the natural curiosity of the races, which always seeks something novel and loves to call foreign things by foreign names, it is hard to understand why this obsolete and ambiguous word should so sedulously be retained. It originally meant not only the Sovereign, but also his house, the court, and even the State, and its use in historical writings causes many difficulties which it is unnecessary to discuss here in detail. The native Japanese employ the term neither in speech nor in writing.  It might as well be dismissed with great advantage from sober literature as it has been for the official documents.\"</ref> (Compare [[Sublime Porte]], an old term for the Ottoman government.)\n\nTraditionally, the Japanese considered it disrespectful to call any person by his [[given name]], and more so for a person of noble rank. This convention is only slightly relaxed in the modern age and it is still inadvisable among friends to use the given name, use of the family name being the common form of address. In the case of the imperial family, it is considered extremely inappropriate to use the given name. Since Emperor Meiji, it has been customary to have one [[Japanese era name|era]] per Emperor and to rename each Emperor after his death using the name of the era over which he presided. Before [[Emperor Meiji]], the names of the eras were changed more frequently, and the posthumous names of the Emperors were chosen differently.\n\n[[File:Emperor of Japan - Tenno - New Years 2010.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=7|The Emperor of Japan giving a New Year's address to the people in 2010]]\n\nOutside Japan, the previous Emperor is usually called [[Hirohito]] in English, although he was never referred to as Hirohito in Japan, and was renamed ''[[Sh\u014dwa Tenn\u014d]]'' after his death, which is the only name that Japanese speakers currently use when referring to him.\n\nThe current Emperor on the throne is typically referred to as ''Tenn\u014d Heika'' ({{lang|ja|\u5929\u7687\u965b\u4e0b}}, \"His (Imperial) Majesty the Emperor\"), ''Kinj\u014d Heika'' ({{lang|ja|\u4eca\u4e0a\u965b\u4e0b}}, \"His Current Majesty\") or simply ''Tenn\u014d'', when speaking Japanese. The current Emperor will be renamed ''Daij\u014d Tenn\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u592a\u4e0a\u5929\u7687}}, Retired Emperor), often shortened to ''J\u014dk\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u4e0a\u7687}}), upon his planned retirement on 30 April 2019, and renamed ''Heisei Tenn\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u5e73\u6210\u5929\u7687}}) after his death and will then be referred to exclusively by that name in Japanese. In Japanese culture, it is considered a major faux pas to refer to a living Emperor by his posthumous name, although the posthumous name is the same as the era, which is used in official documents.\n\n===Origin of the title===\nOriginally, the ruler of Japan was known as either {{lang|ja|\u5927\u548c\u5927\u738b}}/{{lang|ja|\u5927\u541b}} (Yamato-\u014dkimi, Grand King of [[Yamato Province|Yamato]]), {{lang|ja|\u502d\u738b}}/{{lang|ja|\u502d\u56fd\u738b}} (''Wa-\u014d''/''Wakoku-\u014d'', [[Five kings of Wa|King of Wa]], used externally) or {{lang|ja|\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b}} (''Ame-no-shita shiroshimesu \u014dkimi'' or ''Sumera no mikoto'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally) in Japanese and Chinese sources before the 7th century. The oldest documented use of the word \"Tenn\u014d\" is on a wooden slat, or ''mokkan'', that was unearthed in [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture]] in 1998 and dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]].{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}\n\n==Marriage traditions==\n[[File:Empress Michiko cropped 20140424.jpg|thumb|upright|The current empress, [[Empress Michiko|Michiko]]]]\nThroughout history, Japanese Emperors and noblemen appointed the position of chief wife, rather than just keeping a [[harem]] or an assortment of female attendants.\n\nThe Japanese imperial dynasty consistently practiced official [[polygamy]], a practice that only ended in the [[Taish\u014d period]] (1912\u20131926). Besides the Empress, the Emperor could take, and nearly always took, several secondary consorts (\"[[concubine]]s\") of various hierarchical degrees. Concubines were allowed also to other dynasts ([[Shinn\u014dke]], [[\u014cke]]). After a decree by [[Emperor Ichij\u014d]], some Emperors even had two empresses simultaneously (''[[Empress of Japan|k\u014dg\u014d]]'' and ''ch\u016bg\u016b'' are the two separate titles for that situation). With the help of all this polygamy, the imperial clan thus was capable of producing more offspring. (Sons by secondary consorts were usually recognized as imperial princes, too, and could be recognized as heir to the throne if the empress did not give birth to an heir.)\n\nOf the eight female Tenn\u014d (reigning empresses) of Japan, none married or gave birth after ascending the throne. Some of them, being widows, had produced children before their reigns.\n\nIn the succession, children of the empress were preferred over sons of secondary consorts. Thus it was significant which quarters had preferential opportunities in providing chief wives to imperial princes, i.e. supplying future empresses.\n\nApparently, the oldest tradition of official marriages within the imperial dynasty were marriages between dynasty members, even half-siblings or uncle and niece. Such marriages were deemed to preserve better the imperial blood or were aimed at producing children symbolic of a reconciliation between two branches of the imperial dynasty. Daughters of others remained concubines, until [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]] (701\u2013706)&nbsp;\u2013 in what was specifically reported as the first elevation of its kind&nbsp;\u2013 elevated his [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] consort [[Empress K\u014dmy\u014d]] to chief wife.\n\nJapanese monarchs have been, as much as others elsewhere, dependent on making alliances with powerful chiefs and other monarchs. Many such alliances were sealed by marriages. The specific feature in Japan has been the fact that these marriages have been soon incorporated as elements of tradition which controlled the marriages of later generations, though the original practical alliance had lost its real meaning. A repeated pattern has been an imperial son-in-law under the influence of his powerful non-imperial father-in-law.\n\nBeginning from the 7th and 8th centuries, Emperors primarily took women of the [[Fujiwara clan]] as their highest wives \u2014 the most probable mothers of future monarchs. This was cloaked as a tradition of marriage between heirs of two ''[[kami]]'' ([[Shinto]] deities): descendants of [[Amaterasu]] with descendants of the family ''kami'' of the Fujiwara. (Originally, the Fujiwara were descended from relatively minor nobility, thus their ''kami'' is an unremarkable one in the Japanese myth world.) To produce imperial children, heirs of the nation, with two-side descent from the two kami, was regarded as desirable \u2014 or at least it suited powerful Fujiwara lords, who thus received preference in the imperial marriage market. The reality behind such marriages was an alliance between an imperial prince and a Fujiwara lord, his father-in-law or grandfather, the latter with his resources supporting the prince to the throne and most often controlling the government. These arrangements created the tradition of regents ([[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku]]), with these positions held only by a Fujiwara [[sekke]] lord.\n\nEarlier, the Emperors had married women from families of the government-holding [[Soga clan|Soga]] lords, and women of the imperial clan itself, i.e. various-degree cousins and often even their own sisters (half-sisters). Several imperials of the 5th and 6th centuries such as [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] were children of half-sibling couples. These marriages often were alliance or succession devices: the Soga lord ensured his domination of a prince who would be put on the throne as a puppet; or a prince ensured the combination of two imperial descents, to strengthen his own and his children's claim to the throne. Marriages were also a means to seal a reconciliation between two imperial branches.\n\nAfter a couple of centuries, Emperors could no longer take anyone from outside such families as primary wife, no matter what the expediency of such a marriage and power or wealth brought by such might have been. Only very rarely did a prince ascend the throne whose mother was not descended from the approved families. The earlier necessity and expediency had mutated into a strict tradition that did not allow for current expediency or necessity, but only dictated that daughters of a restricted circle of families were eligible brides, because they had produced eligible brides for centuries. Tradition had become more forceful than law.\n\nFujiwara women were often Empresses, and concubines came from less exalted noble families. In the last thousand years, sons of an imperial male and a Fujiwara woman have been preferred in the succession.\n\nThe five Fujiwara families, [[Ichij\u014d family|Ichij\u014d]], [[Kuj\u014d family|Kuj\u014d]], [[Nij\u014d family|Nij\u014d]], [[Konoe family|Konoe]], and [[Takatsukasa family|Takatsukasa]], were the primary source of imperial brides from the 8th century to the 19th century, even more often than daughters of the imperial clan itself. Fujiwara daughters were thus the usual empresses and mothers of Emperors.\n\nThis restriction on brides for the Emperor and crown prince was made explicit in the [[Meiji period|Meiji]]-era Imperial House Law of 1889. A clause stipulated that daughters of Sekke (the five main branches of the higher Fujiwara) and daughters of the imperial clan itself were primarily acceptable brides.\n\nThe law was repealed in the aftermath of [[World War II]]. The present Emperor, [[Akihito]], became the first crown prince for over a thousand years to marry a consort from outside the previously eligible circle.\n\n==Burial traditions==\n[[File:Musashiryo -01.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]] in [[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]]]\nDuring the [[Kofun period]], so-called \"archaic funerals\" were held for the dead Emperors, but only the funerary rites from the end of the period, which the chronicles describe in more detail, are known.

''Tokyo Rising,'' p. 20.</ref> From the [[Emperor Taish\u014d|Taish\u014d Emperor]] onward, the Emperors have been buried at the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]] in Tokyo.\n\n==Succession==\n[[File:Imperial place Japan 1979 air.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Tokyo Imperial Palace]]]]\nThe Japanese imperial dynasty bases its position in the expression that it has \"reigned since [[time immemorial]]\" ({{lang|ja|\u4e07\u4e16\u4e00\u7cfb}} ''bansei ikkei''). It is true that its origins are buried in the mists of time: there are no records of any Emperor who was not said to have been a descendant of other, yet earlier Emperors. There is suspicion that [[Emperor Keitai]] (c. 500 AD) may have been an unrelated outsider, though the sources state that he was a male-line descendant of [[Emperor \u014cjin]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} However, his descendants, including his successors, were according to records descended from at least one and probably several imperial princesses of the older lineage. The tradition built by those legends has chosen to recognize just the putative male ancestry as valid for legitimizing his succession, not giving any weight to ties through the said princesses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nMillennia ago, the Japanese imperial family developed its own peculiar system of hereditary succession. It has been non-primogenitural, more or less agnatic, based mostly on rotation. Today, Japan uses strict [[agnatic primogeniture]], which was adopted from [[Prussia]], by which Japan was greatly influenced in the 1870s.\n\nThe controlling principles and their interaction were apparently very complex and sophisticated, leading to even idiosyncratic outcomes. Some chief principles apparent in the succession have been:\n* Women were allowed to succeed (but there existed no known children of theirs whose father did not also happen to be an agnate of the imperial house, thus there is neither a precedent that a child of an imperial woman with a non-imperial man could inherit, nor a precedent forbidding it for children of empresses). However, female accession was clearly much more rare than male.\n* Adoption was possible and a much used way to increase the number of succession-entitled heirs (however, the adopted child had to be a child of another member agnate of the imperial house).\n* Abdication was used very often, and in fact occurred more often than death on the throne. In those days, the Emperor's chief task was priestly (or godly), containing so many repetitive rituals that it was deemed that after a service of around ten years, the incumbent deserved pampered retirement as an honored former Emperor.\n* [[Primogeniture]] was not used \u2014 rather, in the early days, the imperial house practiced something resembling a system of rotation. Very often a brother (or sister) followed the elder sibling even in the case of the predecessor leaving children. The \"turn\" of the next generation came more often after several individuals of the senior generation. Rotation went often between two or more of the branches of the imperial house, thus more or less distant cousins succeeded each other. [[Emperor Go-Saga]] even decreed an official alternation between heirs of his two sons, which system continued for a couple of centuries (leading finally to shogun-induced (or utilized) strife between these two branches, the \"southern\" and \"northern\" Emperors). Towards the end, the alternates were very distant cousins counted in degrees of male descent (but all that time, intermarriages occurred within the imperial house, thus they were close cousins if female ties are counted). During the past five hundred years, however, probably due to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] influence, inheritance by sons \u2014 but not always, or even most often, the eldest son has been the norm.\n\nHistorically, the succession to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] has always passed to descendants in male line from the imperial lineage. Generally, they have been males, though of the over one hundred monarchs there have been nine women (one pre-historical and eight historical) as Emperor on eleven occasions.\n\nOver a thousand years ago, a tradition started that an Emperor should ascend relatively young. A dynast who had passed his toddler years was regarded suitable and old enough. Reaching the age of legal majority was not a requirement. Thus, a multitude of Japanese Emperors have ascended as children, as young as 6 or 8 years old. The high-priestly duties were deemed possible for a walking child. A reign of around ten years was regarded a sufficient service. Being a child was apparently a fine property, to better endure tedious duties and to tolerate subjugation to political power-brokers, as well as sometimes to cloak the truly powerful members of the imperial dynasty. Almost all Japanese empresses and dozens of Emperors abdicated, and lived the rest of their lives in pampered retirement, wielding influence behind the scenes. Several Emperors abdicated to their entitled retirement while still in their teens. These traditions show in Japanese folklore, theater, literature, and other forms of culture, where the Emperor is usually described or depicted as an adolescent.\n\nBefore the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan had eleven reigns of [[Empress of Japan|reigning empresses]], all of them daughters of the male line of the Imperial House. None ascended purely as a wife or as a widow of an Emperor. Imperial daughters and granddaughters, however, usually ascended the throne as a sort of a \"stop gap\" measure \u2014 if a suitable male was not available or some imperial branches were in rivalry so that a compromise was needed. Over half of Japanese empresses and many Emperors abdicated once a suitable male descendant was considered to be old enough to rule (just past toddlerhood, in some cases).  Four empresses, [[Empress Suiko]], [[Empress K\u014dgyoku]] (also [[Empress Saimei]]), and [[Empress Jit\u014d]], as well as the mythical [[Empress Jing\u016b]], were widows of deceased Emperors and princesses of the blood imperial in their own right. One, [[Empress Genmei]], was the widow of a crown prince and a princess of the blood imperial. The other four, [[Empress Gensh\u014d]], [[Empress K\u014dken]] (also Empress Sh\u014dtoku), [[Empress Meish\u014d]], and [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]], were unwed daughters of previous Emperors. None of these empresses married or gave birth after ascending the throne.\n\nArticle 2 of the [[Meiji Constitution]] (the Constitution of the Empire of Japan) stated, \"The Imperial Throne shall be succeeded to by imperial male descendants, according to the provisions of the Imperial House Law.\" The 1889 Imperial Household Law fixed the succession on male descendants of the imperial line, and specifically excluded female descendants from the succession. In the event of a complete failure of the main line, the throne would pass to the nearest collateral branch, again in the male line. If the Empress did not give birth to an heir, the Emperor could take a concubine, and the son he had by that concubine would be recognized as heir to the throne. This law, which was promulgated on the same day as the [[Meiji Constitution]], enjoyed co-equal status with that constitution.\n\nArticle 2 of the [[Constitution of Japan]], promulgated in 1947 by influence of the U.S. occupation administration, provides that \"The Imperial Throne shall be dynastic and succeeded to in accordance with the Imperial Household Law passed by the Diet.\" The [[Imperial Household Law]] of 1947, enacted by the ninety-second and last session of the Imperial Diet, retained the exclusion on female dynasts found in the 1889 law. The government of Prime Minister [[Yoshida Shigeru]] hastily cobbled together the legislation to bring the Imperial Household in compliance with the American-written [[Constitution of Japan]] that went into effect in May 1947. In an effort to control the size of the imperial family, the law stipulates that only legitimate male descendants in the male line can be dynasts; that imperial princesses lose their status as Imperial Family members if they marry outside the Imperial Family;<ref>Martin, Alex, \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111216f1.html Imperial law revisited as family shrinks, Emperor ages]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', December 16, 2011, p. 3.</ref> and that the Emperor and other members of the Imperial Family may not adopt children. It also prevented branches, other than the branch descending from [[Taisho Emperor|Taish\u014d]], from being imperial princes any longer.\n\n===Current status===\n{{Main article|Line of succession to the Japanese throne}}\nSuccession is now regulated by laws passed by the [[National Diet]]. The current law excludes women from the succession. A change to this law had been considered until [[Kiko, Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] gave birth to a [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|son]].\n\nUntil the birth of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], son of [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]], on September 6, 2006, there was a potential [[Order of succession|succession]] problem, since Prince Akishino was the only male child to be born into the imperial family since 1965. Following the birth of [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|Princess Aiko]], there was public debate about amending the current Imperial Household Law to allow women to succeed to the throne. In January 2005, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] appointed a special panel composed of judges, university professors, and civil servants to study changes to the [[Imperial Household Law]] and to make recommendations to the government.\n\nThe panel dealing with the succession issue recommended on October 25, 2005, amending the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to ascend the Japanese throne. On January 20, 2006, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] devoted part of his annual keynote speech to the controversy, pledging to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne to ensure that the succession continues in the future in a stable manner. Shortly after the announcement that [[Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her third child, Koizumi suspended such plans. Her son, Prince Hisahito, is the third in line to the throne under the current law of succession. On January 3, 2007, Prime Minister [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2007-01-03-japan-female-monarch_x.htm |title=Report: Japan to drop plan to allow female monarch |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 3, 2007 |publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |location=[[McLean, VA]] |issn=0734-7456 |agency=The Associated Press |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Wealth==\nUntil World War II, the Japanese monarchy was thought to be among the wealthiest in the world.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=3 May 1989 |title=Legacy of Hirohito  |work=The Times }}</ref> Before 1911, no distinction was made between the imperial crown estates and the Emperor's personal properties, which were considerable. The Imperial Property Law, which came into effect in January 1911, established two categories of imperial properties: the hereditary or crown estates and the personal (\"ordinary\") properties of the imperial family. The Imperial Household Minister was given the responsibility for observing any judicial proceedings concerning imperial holdings. Under the terms of the law, imperial properties were only taxable in cases where no conflict with the Imperial House Law existed; however, crown estates could only be used for public or imperially-sanctioned undertakings. Personal properties of certain members of the imperial family, in addition to properties held for imperial family members who were minors, were exempted from taxation. Those family members included the Empress Dowager, the Empress, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, the Imperial Grandson and the consort of the Imperial Grandson.<ref name=\"court_wealth\">{{cite book |chapter=Japan - The Imperial Court |title=The Japan-Manchoukuo Year Book |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |publisher=The Japan-Manchoukuo Year Book Co. |publication-date=1938 |pages=50\u201351 }}</ref> As a result of the poor economic conditions in Japan, 289,259.25 acres of crown lands (about 26% of the total landholdings) were either sold or transferred to government and private-sector interests in 1921.

The imperial estates and the Emperor's personal fortune (then estimated at US$17.15 million, or roughly US$625 million in 2017 terms) were transferred to either state or private ownership, excepting 6,810 acres of landholdings. Since the 1947 constitutional reforms, the imperial family has been supported by an official civil list sanctioned by the Japanese government. The largest imperial divestments were the former imperial Kiso and Amagi forest lands in [[Gifu prefecture|Gifu]] and [[Shizuoka prefecture|Shizuoka]] prefectures, grazing lands for livestock in [[Hokkaido]] and a stock farm in the Chiba region, all of which were transferred to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]]. Imperial property holdings have been further reduced since 1947 after several handovers to the government.

'''Empress''', the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife ([[empress consort]]), mother ([[empress dowager]]), or a woman who rules in her own right ([[empress regnant]]). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher [[honour]] and [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] than [[king]]s. In [[Europe]], the title of Emperor has been used since the [[Middle Ages]], considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of [[Pope]] due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of [[Western Europe]]. The [[Emperor of Japan]] is the only currently [[List of current sovereign monarchs|reigning monarch]] whose title is translated into English as Emperor.\n\nBoth emperors and kings are [[monarch]]s, but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation, therefore a king might be obliged to pay [[tribute]] to another ruler,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts\u2014the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the [[British Raj|incorporation of India]], though she was declared Empress of India.\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of ''{{lang|la|[[translatio imperii]]}}'', i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the [[Western Roman Emperor]]s, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states. Although technically an elective title, by the late [[16th century]] the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the [[Habsburg]] [[Archdukes of Austria]] and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] their control over the states (outside the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], i.e. [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804 and was shortly followed by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who declared himself [[Emperor of Austria]] in the same year. The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated that position in 1806. In [[Eastern Europe]], the monarchs of [[Russia]] also used ''translatio imperii'' to wield imperial authority as successors to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of [[Tsar]] even after [[Peter the Great]] adopted the title of [[Emperor of All Russia]] in 1721.\n\nHistorians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. Such pre-Roman titles as [[Great King]] or [[King of Kings]], used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the [[Athenian Empire]] of the late 5th century BC, the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenets]] and the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] and [[American imperialism|American]] \"empires\" of the [[Cold War]] era. However, such \"empires\" did not need to be headed by an \"emperor\". Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.\n\nFor purposes of protocol, emperors were once given [[Order of precedence|precedence]] over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence amongst [[heads of state]] who are sovereigns\u2014whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and to a lesser degree presidents\u2014is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.\n\n==Roman tradition==\n\nIn the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition a large variety in the meaning and importance of the imperial form of monarchy developed: in ''intention'' it was always the highest office, but it could as well fall down to a redundant title for nobility that had never been near to the \"Empire\" they were supposed to be reigning. Also the ''name'' of the position split in several branches of Western tradition, see below.\n\nThe importance and meaning of [[coronation]] ceremonies and [[regalia]] also varied within the tradition: for instance [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s could only be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]], which meant the coronation ceremony usually took place in Rome, often several years after these emperors had ascended to the throne (as \"king\") in their home country. The first [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Emperors of Constantinople]] on the other hand had to be present in the newly conquered capital of their empire, because that was the only place where they could be granted to become emperor.\n\nEarly [[Roman Emperor]]s avoided any type of ceremony or regalia different from what was already usual for republican offices in the [[Roman Republic]]: the most intrusive change had been changing the color of their robe to purple. Later new symbols of worldly and/or spiritual power, like the [[Globus cruciger|orb]], became an essential part of the imperial accessories.\n\nRules for indicating successors also varied: there was a tendency towards ''male'' ''inheritance'' of the supreme office, but as well election by noblemen, as ruling empresses are known (for empires not too strictly under [[salic law]]). Ruling monarchs could additionally steer the succession by adoption, as often occurred in the two first centuries of Imperial Rome. Of course, intrigue, murder and military force could also mingle in for appointing successors; the Roman imperial tradition made no exception to other monarchical traditions in this respect. Probably the epoch best known for this part of the imperial tradition is [[Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)|Rome's third century]] rule.\n\n==Roman Empire and Byzantine emperors==\n\n===Classical Antiquity===\n{{Main|Roman emperor|Imperator}}\n[[File:Rimini083.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of the dictator [[Julius Caesar]].]]\n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Augustus]], the first emperor of the Roman Empire.]]\n\nWhen [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]] turned into a ''de facto'' [[monarchy]] in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch.  Ancient Romans abhorred the name [[King of Rome|Rex (\"king\")]], and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule.  [[Julius Caesar]] had been [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome.  Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.\n\n[[Augustus]], considered the first [[Roman emperor]], established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man.  One of these offices was ''[[princeps senatus]]'', (\"first man of the Senate\") and became changed into Augustus' chief honorific, ''[[Princeps|princeps civitatis]]'' (\"first citizen\") from which the modern English word and title [[prince]] is descended.  The first period of the [[Roman Empire]], from 27 BC \u2013 284 AD, is called the ''[[principate]]'' for this reason.  However, it was the informal descriptive of ''[[Imperator]]'' (\"commander\") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.  Previously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had ''[[imperium]]'', Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all ''imperium''.  (''Imperium'' is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)\n\nBeginning with Augustus, ''Imperator'' appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453.  After the reign of Augustus' immediate successor [[Tiberius]], being proclaimed ''imperator'' was transformed into the act of accession to the [[head of state]]. Other honorifics used by the Roman Emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor:\n\n*'''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''' (as, for example, in [[Suetonius]]' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]''). This tradition continued in many languages: in German it became \"[[Kaiser]]\"; in certain [[Slavic languages]] it became \"[[Tsar]]\"; in Hungarian it became \"[[Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r]]\", and several more variants. The name derived from [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[cognomen]] \"Caesar\": this cognomen was adopted by all Roman emperors, exclusively by the ruling monarch after the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had died out. In this tradition Julius Caesar is sometimes described as the first Caesar/emperor (following Suetonius). This is one of the most enduring titles, Caesar and its transliterations appeared in every year from the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] to Tsar [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Symeon II of Bulgaria]]'s removal from the throne in 1946.\n*'''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''' was the [[honorific]] first bestowed on Emperor Augustus: after him all Roman emperors added it to their name. Although it had a high symbolical value, something like \"elevated\" or \"sublime\", it was generally not used to indicate the office of ''Emperor'' itself. Exceptions include the title of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a semi-historical collection of Emperors' biographies of the 2nd and 3rd century. Augustus had (by his last will) granted the feminine form of this honorific ([[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]) to his wife. Since there was no \"title\" of Empress(-consort) whatsoever, women of the reigning dynasty sought to be granted this honorific, as the highest attainable goal. Few were however granted the title, and certainly not as a rule all wives of reigning Emperors.\n*'''[[Imperator]]''' (as, for example, in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''). In the [[Roman Republic]] Imperator meant \"(military) commander\". In the late Republic, as in the early years of the new monarchy, ''Imperator'' was a title granted to Roman generals by their troops and the [[Roman Senate]] after a great victory, roughly comparable to [[field marshal]] (head or commander of the entire army). For example, in AD 15 [[Germanicus]] was proclaimed ''Imperator'' during the reign of his adoptive father [[Tiberius]]. Soon thereafter \"Imperator\" became however a title reserved exclusively for the ruling monarch. This led to \"Emperor\" in English and, among other examples, \"Empereur\" in French and \"Mbreti\" in Albanian. The Latin feminine form [[Imperatrix]] only developed after \"Imperator\" had taken on the connotation of \"Emperor\".\n*'''[[Autokrator]]''' (\u0391\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or '''[[basileus#Romans and Byzantines|Basileus]]''' (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2): although the Greeks used equivalents of \"Caesar\" (\u039a\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1, ''Kaisar'') and \"Augustus\" (in two forms: transliterated as {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f54\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, ''Augoustos'' or translated as {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}, ''[[Sebastos]]'') these were rather used as part of the name of the Emperor than as an indication of the office. Instead of developing a new name for the new type of monarchy, they used {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1}} (''autokrat\u014dr'', only partly overlapping with the modern understanding of \"[[Autocracy|autocrat]]\") or {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}} (''[[basileus]]'', until then the usual name for \"[[Monarch|sovereign]]\"). ''Autokrat\u014dr'' was essentially used as a translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' in Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire, but also here there is only partial overlap between the meaning of the original Greek and Latin concepts. For the Greeks ''Autokrat\u014dr'' was not a military title, and was closer to the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' concept (\"the one with unlimited power\"), before it came to mean Emperor. ''Basileus'' appears not to have been used exclusively in the meaning of \"emperor\" (and specifically, the Roman/Byzantine emperor) before the 7th century, although it was a standard informal designation of the Emperor in the Greek-speaking East.\n\nAfter the turbulent [[Year of the four emperors]] in 69, the [[Flavian Dynasty]] reigned for three decades. The succeeding [[Nervan-Antonian Dynasty]], ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire. This epoch became known as the era of the ''[[Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]'', and was followed by the short-lived [[Severan Dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Crisis of the 3rd century]], [[Barracks Emperor]]s succeeded one another at short intervals. Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the [[Gallic Empire]], the [[Britannic Empire]], and the [[Palmyrene Empire]] though the latter used ''rex'' more regularly.\n\nThe [[Principate]] (27 BC \u2013 284 AD) period was succeeded by what is known as the [[Dominate]] (284 AD \u2013 527 AD), during which Emperor [[Diocletian]] tried to put the Empire on a more formal footing.  Diocletian sought to address the challenges of the Empire's now vast geography and the instability caused by the informality of succession by the creation of co-emperors and junior emperors.  At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the ''imperium'' (see: [[Tetrarchy]]).  In 325 AD [[Constantine I]] defeated his rivals and restored single emperor rule, but following his death the empire was divided among his sons. For a time the concept was of one empire ruled by multiple emperors with varying territory under their control, however following the death of [[Theodosius I]] the rule was divided between his two sons and increasingly became separate entities.  The areas administered from Rome are referred to by historians the [[Western Roman Empire]] and those under the immediate authority of Constantinople called the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] or (after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636 AD) the [[Byzantine Empire|Later Roman or Byzantine Empire]].  The subdivisions and co-emperor system were formally abolished by [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] in 480 AD following the death of [[Julius Nepos]] last Western Emperor and the ascension of [[Odoacer]] as the ''de facto'' King of Italy in 476 AD.\n\n===Byzantine period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Emperor}}\n\n====Before the 4th Crusade====\n[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 003.jpg|thumb|300px|Under [[Justinian I]], reigning in the 6th century, parts of Italy were for a few decades (re)conquered from the [[Ostrogoths]]: thus, this famous [[mosaic]], featuring the Byzantine emperor in the center, can be admired at [[Ravenna]].]]\n\nHistorians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after [[Byzantium]], the original name of the town that [[Constantine I]] would elevate to the Imperial capital as [[New Rome]] in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called [[Constantinople]] and is today named [[Istanbul]]). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the [[Roman Senate]] and following the death of [[Julius Nepos]], last Western Emperor. This change was a recognition of the reality that little remained of Imperial authority in the areas that had been the Western Empire, with even Rome and Italy itself now ruled by the essentially autonomous [[Odoacer]].\n\nThese Later Roman \"Byzantine\" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an [[absolute monarch]]. Of particular note was the translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' into the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'', after Emperor [[Heraclius]] changed the official language of the empire from Latin to Greek in AD 620. Basileus, a title which had long been used for [[Alexander the Great]] was already in common usage as the Greek word for the Roman emperor, but its definition and sense was \"King\" in Greek, essentially equivalent with the Latin ''Rex''. Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word \"autokrator\", meaning \"one who rules himself\", or \"monarch\", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]''. Essentially, the Greek language did not incorporate the nuances of the Ancient Roman concepts that distinguished ''imperium'' from other forms of political power.\n\nIn general usage, the Byzantine imperial title evolved from simply \"emperor\" (''basileus''), to \"emperor of the Romans\" (''basileus t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn'') in the 9th century, to \"emperor and autocrat of the Romans\" (''basileus kai autokrat\u014dr t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn'') in the 10th.<ref>[[George Alexandrovi\u010d Ostrogorsky|George Ostrogorsky]], \"Avtokrator i samodr\u017eac\", ''Glas Srpske kraljevske akadamije'' CLXIV, Drugi razdred 84 (1935), 95\u2013187</ref> In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.\n\nOne important distinction between the post Constantine I (reigned AD 306\u2013337) emperors and their pagan predecessors was [[cesaropapism]], the assertion that the Emperor (or other head of state) is also the head of the Church. Although this principle was held by all emperors after Constantine, it met with increasing resistance and ultimately rejection by bishops in the west after the effective end of Imperial power there. This concept became a key element of the meaning of \"emperor\" in the Byzantine and Orthodox east, but went out of favor in the west with the rise of [[Roman Catholicism]].\n\nThe Byzantine empire also produced three women who effectively governed the state: the Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and the Empresses [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]] and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]].\n\n====Latin emperors====\nIn 1204 Constantinople fell to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].  Following the tragedy of the horrific [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking]] of the city, the conquerors declared a new \"Empire of Romania\", known to historians as the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]], installing [[Baldwin IX]], [[Count of Flanders]], as Emperor. However, Byzantine resistance to the new empire meant that it was in constant struggle to establish itself.  Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos succeeded in recapturing Constantinople in 1261.  The [[Principality of Achaea]], a vassal state the empire had created in [[Morea]] (Greece) intermittently continued to recognize the authority of the crusader emperors for another half century.  Pretenders to the title continued among the European nobility until circa 1383.\n\n====After the 4th Crusade====\nWith Constantinople occupied, claimants to the imperial succession styled themselves as emperor in the chief centers of resistance:  The [[Laskaris|Laskarid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Komnenos|Komnenid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Doukas|Doukid]] dynasty in the [[Despotate of Epirus]].  In 1248, the Epirus recognized the Nicaean Emperors, who then recaptured Constantinople in 1261.  The Trebizond emperor formally submitted in Constantinople in 1281,<ref>Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, ''The Last Centuries of Byzantium'', second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 74</ref> but frequently flouted convention by styling themselves emperor back in Trebizond thereafter.\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n[[File:Suleiman Agostino.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Agostino Veneziano]]'s [[engraving]] of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor Suleiman the Magnificent wearing his [[S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent's Venetian Helmet|Venetian Helmet]].<ref>Agostino never saw the Sultan, but probably did see and sketch the helmet in Venice.</ref> Note the four tiers on the helmet, symbolizing his imperial power, and excelling the three-tiered [[papal tiara]].<ref>The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1968. \"Turquerie\" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series 26 (5): 229.</ref> This tiara was made for 115,000 [[ducats]] and offered to Suleiman by the French ambassador [[Antonio Rincon]] in 1532.<ref>Garnier, p.52</ref> This was a most atypical piece of headgear for a Turkish sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors.

These included:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Sultan]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]], Sovereign of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Imperial House of Osman]], [[Sultan of Sultans]], [[Khan of Khans]], [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] and [[Caliph|Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe]], Protector of the Holy Cities of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jerusalem]], Emperor of The Three Cities of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Edirne|Adrianopole]] and [[Bursa]] as well as many other cities and countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nobility of the World Volume VIII- Turkey|url=http://www.almanachdegotha.org/id244.html|website=Almanch De Saxe Gotha|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans began to style themselves '''Kaysar-i Rum''' (Emperor of the Romans) as they asserted themselves to be the heirs to the Roman empire by right of conquest.  The title was of such importance to them that it led them to eliminate the various Byzantine successor states \u2014 and therefore rival claimants \u2014 over the next eight years.  Though the term \"emperor\" was rarely used by Westerners of the Ottoman sultan, it was generally accepted by Westerners that he had imperial status.\n\n==Holy Roman Empire==\n{{Main|Holy Roman Emperor}}\nThe ''Emperor'' of the Romans' title was a reflection of the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (''transfer of rule'') principle that regarded the Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], despite the continued existence of the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] in the east.\n\nFrom the time of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] onward, much of the former [[Carolingian]] kingdom of [[Eastern Francia]] became the Holy Roman Empire. The  [[prince-elector]]s elected one of their peers as [[King of the Romans]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] before being crowned by the [[Pope]]. The Emperor could also pursue the election of his heir (usually a son) as King, who would then succeed him after his death. This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans). Although technically already ruling, after the election he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. The last emperor to be crowned by the pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; all emperors after him were technically ''emperors-elect'', but were universally referred to as ''Emperor''.\n\n==Austrian Empire==\n{{Main|Emperor of Austria}}\nThe first Austrian Emperor was the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. In the face of aggressions by [[Napoleon]], Francis feared for the future of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He wished to maintain his and his family's Imperial status in the event that the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved, as it indeed was in 1806 when an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. After which, the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old ''Reich'' by severing a good portion from the empire and turning it into a separate [[Confederation of the Rhine]].  With the size of his imperial realm significantly reduced, Francis II, ''Holy Roman Emperor'' became Francis I, ''Emperor of Austria''. The new imperial title may have sounded less prestigious than the old one, but Francis' [[dynasty]] continued to rule from Austria and a Habsburg monarch was still an emperor (''Kaiser''), and not just merely a king (''K\u00f6nig''), in name.\n\nThe title lasted just a little over one century until 1918, but it was never clear what territory constituted the \"[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]\".  When Francis took the title in 1804, the Habsburg lands as a whole were dubbed the ''Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich''.  ''Kaisertum'' might literally be translated as \"emperordom\" (on analogy with \"kingdom\") or \"emperor-ship\"; the term denotes specifically \"the territory ruled by an emperor\", and is thus somewhat more general than [[Reich]], which in 1804 carried connotations of universal rule.  Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an Archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially during the reign of Marie Therese and her son Joseph II and then finalized in the early 19th century.  When Hungary was given self-government in 1867, the non-Hungarian portions were called the Empire of Austria and were officially known as the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'')\".  The title of Emperor of Austria and the associated Empire were both abolished at the end of the First World War in 1918, when [[German Austria]] became a [[republic]] and the other kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council established their independence or adhesion to other states.\n\n==Emperors of Europe==\n[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]'s close cultural and political interaction with its Balkan neighbors [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], and with Russia (Kievan Rus', then Muscovy) led to the adoption of Byzantine imperial traditions in all of these countries.\n\n===Bulgaria===\nIn 913, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] was crowned Emperor ([[Tsar]]) by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and imperial regent [[Nicholas Mystikos]] outside the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read \"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans\" (''Tsar i samodarzhets na vsichki balgari i gartsi'' in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.\n\nByzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914\u2013924 was spent in destructive warfare between Byzantium and Bulgaria over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title \"Emperor of the Romans\" (''basileus t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn''), was eventually recognized, as \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\" (''basileus t\u014dn Boulgar\u014dn'') by the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus I|Romanos I Lakapenos]] in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian patriarch]] was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian-Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the [[pope]].  The Bulgarian imperial title \"tsar\" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denote the Bulgarian capital ([[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]) as a successor of Rome and [[Constantinople]], in effect, the \"Third Rome\".\n\nAfter Bulgaria obtained full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, its monarch, who was previously styled ''Knyaz'', [prince], took the traditional title of ''Tsar'' [king] and was recognized internationally as such.{{by whom|date=November 2016}}\n\n===France===\nThe kings of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' and the [[July Monarchy]] used the title ''Empereur de France'' in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor from at least 1673 onwards. The Ottomans insisted on this elevated style while refusing to recognize the Holy Roman Emperors or the Russian tsars because of their rival claims of the [[translatio imperii|Roman crown]]. In short, it was an indirect insult by the Ottomans to the HRE and the Russians. The French kings also used it for [[Morocco]] (1682) and [[Persia]] (1715).\n\n====First French Empire====\n{{See also|First French Empire}}\n[[File:NapoleanCoronationDavid.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the most famous Imperial coronation ceremonies was that of Napoleon, crowning himself Emperor in the presence of [[Pope Pius VII]] (who had blessed the [[regalia]]), at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris]].<br>The painting by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] commemorating the event is equally famous: the gothic cathedral restyled ''[[Empire (style)|style Empire]]'', supervised by the [[Letizia Ramolino|mother of the Emperor]] on the balcony (a fictional addition, while she had not been present at the ceremony), the pope positioned near the altar, Napoleon proceeds to crown his then wife, [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] as Empress.]]\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who was already First Consul of the French Republic (''Premier Consul de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise'') for life, declared himself '''[[Emperor of the French]]''' (''Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais'') on 18 May 1804, thus creating the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (''Empire Fran\u00e7ais'').\n\nNapoleon relinquished the title of Emperor of the French on 6 April and again on 11 April 1814.\nNapoleon's infant son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was recognized by the Council of Peers, as Emperor from the moment of his father's abdication, and therefore reigned (as opposed to ruled) as Emperor for fifteen days, 22 June to 7 July 1815.\n\n====Elba====\nSince 3 May 1814, the Sovereign Principality of [[Elba]] was created a miniature non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled French Emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon I was allowed, by the treaty of Fontainebleau with (27 April), to enjoy, for life, the imperial title. The islands were ''not'' restyled an empire.\n\nOn 26 February 1815, Napoleon abandoned Elba for France, reviving the French Empire for a [[Hundred Days]]; the Allies declared an end to Napoleon's sovereignty over Elba on 25 March 1815, and on 31 March 1815 Elba was ceded to the restored [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] by the Congress of Vienna. After his final defeat, Napoleon was treated as a general by the British authorities during his second exile to Atlantic Isle of [[St. Helena]]. His title was a matter of dispute with the governor of St Helena, who insisted on addressing him as \"General Bonaparte\", despite the \"historical reality that he had been an emperor\" and therefore retained the title.<ref>''Napoleon'', Vincent Cronin, p419, HarperCollins, 1994.</ref><ref>''Napoleon'', Frank McLynn, p644, Pimlico 1998</ref><ref>''Le M\u00e9morial de Sainte H\u00e9l\u00e8ne'', Emmanuel De Las Cases, Tome III, page101, published by Jean De Bonnot, Libraire \u00e0 l'enseigne du canon, 1969</ref>\n\n====Second French Empire====\n{{See also|Second French Empire}}\nNapoleon I's nephew, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], resurrected the title of emperor on 2 December 1852, after establishing the [[Second French Empire]] in a presidential [[coup]], subsequently approved by a plebiscite.

It was associated with the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Leonese monarchy]] perhaps as far back as [[Alfonso the Great]] (''r.'' 866\u2013910). The last two kings of its [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] were called emperors in a contemporary source.\n\nKing [[Sancho III of Navarre]] conquered Leon in 1034 and began using it. His son, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] also took the title in 1039. Ferdinand's son, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] took the title in 1077. It then passed to his son-in-law, [[Alfonso I of Aragon]] in 1109. His stepson and Alfonso VI's grandson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] was the only one who actually had an imperial coronation in 1135.\n\nThe title was not exactly hereditary but self-proclaimed by those who had, wholly or partially, united the Christian northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], often at the expense of killing rival siblings. The popes and Holy Roman emperors protested at the usage of the imperial title as a usurpation of leadership in western Christendom. After Alfonso VII's death in 1157, the title was abandoned, and the kings who used it are not commonly mentioned as having been \"emperors\", in Spanish or other historiography.\n\nAfter the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the legitimate heir to the throne, [[Andreas Palaiologos]], willed away his claim to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] in 1503.\n\n====Portugal====\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Debret - Retrato de Dom Jo\u00e3o VI (MNBA).jpg|thumb|[[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]], [[Emperor of Brazil]].]]\nAfter the independence and proclamation of the [[Empire of Brazil]] from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom of Portugal]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]], who became Emperor, in 1822, his father, King [[John VI of Portugal]] briefly held the honorific style of Titular [[Emperor of Brazil]] and the treatment of ''His Imperial and Royal Majesty'' under the 1825 [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|Treaty of Rio de Janeiro]], by which Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil. The style of Titular Emperor was a life title, and became extinct upon the holder's demise. John VI held the imperial title for a few months only, from the ratification of the Treaty in November 1825 until his death in March 1826. During those months, however, as John's imperial title was purely honorific while his son, Pedro I, remained the sole monarch of the Brazilian Empire.\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{Main|British Emperor}}\nIn the late 3rd century, by the end of the epoch of the ''barracks emperors'' in Rome, there were two [[List of Roman Emperors#Britannic Empire 286 to 297|Britannic Emperors]], reigning for about a decade. After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the Imperator [[Cunedda]] forged the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in northern Wales, but all his successors were titled kings and princes.\n\n====England====\nThere was no consistent title for the king of England before 1066, and monarchs chose to style themselves as they pleased. Imperial titles were used inconsistently, beginning with [[Athelstan]] in 930 and ended with the [[Norman conquest of England]]. [[Empress Matilda]] (1102\u20131167) is the only English monarch commonly referred to as \"emperor\" or \"empress\", but she acquired her title through her marriage to [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nDuring the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] declared that 'this realm of England is an Empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the [[imperial Crown]] of the same'. This was in the context of the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and the [[English Reformation]], to emphasize that England had never accepted the quasi-imperial claims of the papacy.  Hence England and, by extension its modern successor state, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], is according to English law an Empire ruled by a King endowed with the imperial dignity. However, this has not led to the creation of the ''title'' of Emperor in England, nor in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], nor in the United Kingdom.\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[File:George V of the united Kingdom.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V]], [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], [[Emperor of India]].]]\nIn 1801, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] rejected the title of Emperor when offered. The only period when British monarchs held the title of ''Emperor'' in a dynastic succession started when the title [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]] was created for [[Queen Victoria]]. The government led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], conferred the additional title upon her by an Act of Parliament, reputedly to assuage the monarch's irritation at being, as a mere Queen, notionally inferior to her own daughter ([[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], who was the wife of the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|reigning German Emperor]]); the Indian Imperial designation was also formally justified as the expression of Britain succeeding the former [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] as [[suzerain]] over hundreds of [[princely state]]s. The [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided for the abolition of the use of the title \"[[Emperor of India]]\" by the [[British monarch]], but this was not executed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] until a [[royal proclamation]] on 22 June 1948. Despite this, George VI continued as king of India until 1950 and as king of Pakistan until his death in 1952. \n\nThe last Empress of India was George VI's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].\n\n===German Empire===\n{{Main|German Empire}}\n[[File:Kohner - Kaiser Wilhelm II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]] and the [[King of Prussia]].]]\nUnder the guise of idealism giving way to realism, German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] prime minister [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s authoritarian ''[[Realpolitik]]''. Bismarck wanted to unify the rival German states to achieve his aim of a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to convince German people to do this: the [[Second war of Schleswig]] against Denmark in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] against the [[Second French Empire]] in 1870\u201371. During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] in 1871, the [[North German Confederation]], supported by its allies from [[southern Germany]], formed the [[German Empire]] with the proclamation of the Prussian king [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the [[Palace of Versailles]], to the humiliation of the French, who ceased to resist only days later.\n\nAfter his death he was succeeded by his son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] who was only emperor for 99 days. In the same year his son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] became the third emperor within a year. He was the last German emperor. After the empire's defeat in World War I the empire, called in German ''Reich'', had a president as head of state instead of an emperor. The use of the word ''Reich'' was abandoned after the Second World War.\n\n===Russia===\n[[File:Profile portrait of Catherine II by Fedor Rokotov (1763, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]]]]\nIn 1472, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia Palaiologina]], married [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], grand prince of Moscow, who began championing the idea of Russia being the successor to the Byzantine Empire. This idea was represented more emphatically in the composition the monk Filofej addressed to their son [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]]. After ending Muscovy's dependence on its [[Mongol]] overlords in 1480, Ivan III began the usage of the titles [[Tsar]] and Autocrat (''samoderzhets''). His insistence on recognition as such by the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since 1489 resulted in the granting of this recognition in 1514 by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to Vasili III. His son [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] emphatically crowned himself [[Tsar of Russia]] on 16 January 1547. The word \"Tsar\" derives from Latin Caesar, but this title was used in Russia as equivalent to \"King\"; the error occurred when medieval Russian clerics referred to the biblical Jewish kings with the same title that was used to designate Roman and Byzantine rulers \u2014 \"Caesar\".\n\nOn 31 October 1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. The title used was Latin \"''Imperator''\", which is a westernizing form equivalent to the traditional Slavic title \"''Tsar''\". He based his claim partially upon a letter discovered in 1717 written in 1514 from Maximilian I to Vasili III, in which the Holy Roman Emperor used the term in referring to Vasili.\n\nA formal address to the ruling Russian monarch adopted thereafter was 'Your Imperial Majesty'. The crown prince was addressed as 'Your Imperial Highness'.\n\nThe title has not been used in Russia since the abdication of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917.\n\n[[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] produced four reigning Empresses, all in the eighteenth century.\n\n===Serbia===\n{{main|Emperor of Serbia}}\nIn 1345, the Serbian King [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an]] proclaimed himself Emperor ([[Tsar]]) and was crowned as such at [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] 1346 by the newly created [[Serbian Patriarch]], and by the Patriarch of Bulgaria and the autocephalous Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by Bulgaria and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read \"Emperor of Serbs and Greeks\" (''\u0446\u0430\u0440 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u043a\u0430'' in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an and his son Stefan Uro\u0161 V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of Du\u0161an, [[Simeon Uro\u0161]], and then his son [[Jovan Uro\u0161]], claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in [[Thessaly]]. The \"Greek\" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.\n\n==Emperors in the Americas==\n\n===Pre-Columbian traditions===\nThe Aztec and Inca traditions are unrelated to one another. Both were conquered under the reign of King [[Charles I of Spain]] who was simultaneously emperor-elect of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the fall of the Aztecs and fully emperor during the fall of the Incas. Incidentally by being king of Spain, he was also Roman (Byzantine) emperor in pretence through [[Andreas Palaiologos]]. The translations of their titles were provided by the Spanish.\n\n====Aztec Empire====\nThe only [[pre-Columbian]] North American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the [[Aztec Empire]] (1375\u20131521). It was an [[elected monarchy]] chosen by the elite. Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] slew Emperor [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] and installed puppet rulers who became vassals for Spain.\n\n====Inca Empire====\nThe only pre-Columbian South American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Sapa Inca]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] (1438\u20131533). Spanish conquistador [[Francisco Pizarro]], conquered the Inca for Spain, killed Emperor [[Atahualpa]], and installed puppets as well. Atahualpa may actually be considered a usurper as he had achieved power by [[Inca Civil War|killing his half-brother]] and he did not perform the required coronation with the imperial crown ''[[mascaipacha]]'' by the ''Huillaq Uma'' (high priest).\n\n===Post-Columbian Americas===\n\n====Brazil====\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D. Pedro II na abertura da Assembl\u00e9ia Geral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]] in [[regalia]] at the opening of the General Assembly (oil painting by [[Pedro Am\u00e9rico]]).]]\nWhen [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] ordered the invasion of Portugal in 1807 because it refused to join the [[Continental System]], the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]] moved their capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to avoid the fate of the [[Spanish Bourbons]] (Napoleon I arrested them and made his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] king). When the French general [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] arrived in [[Lisbon]], the Portuguese fleet had already left with all the local elite.\n\nIn 1808, under a British naval escort, the fleet arrived in Brazil. Later, in 1815, the Portuguese Prince Regent (since 1816 [[John VI of Portugal|King Jo\u00e3o VI]]) proclaimed the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'', as a union of three kingdoms, lifting Brazil from its colonial status.\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon I and the [[liberal Wars|Liberal revolution]] in Portugal, the Portuguese royal family returned to Europe (1821). Prince Pedro of Braganza (King Jo\u00e3o's older son) stayed in South America acting as regent of the local kingdom, but, two years later in 1822, he proclaimed himself [[Peter I of Brazil|Pedro I]], first [[Emperor of Brazil]]. He did, however, recognize his father, Jo\u00e3o VI, as ''Titular Emperor of Brazil'' \u2014a purely honorific title\u2014until Jo\u00e3o VI's death in 1826.\n\nThe empire came to an end in 1889, with the overthrow of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] (Pedro I's son and successor), when the Brazilian republic was proclaimed.\n\n====Haiti====\n[[Haiti]] was declared an empire by its ruler, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who made himself Jacques I, on 20 May 1805. He was assassinated the next year. Haiti again became an empire from 1849 to 1859 under [[Faustin Soulouque]].\n\n====Mexico====\n[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]\n\nIn Mexico, the [[First Mexican Empire]] was the first of two empires created. After the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|declaration of independence]] on September 15, 1821, it was the intention of the Mexican parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the [[King]] of Spain, [[Fernando VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], would also be [[Emperor of Mexico]], but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to accede to the Mexican throne.\n\nFerdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. By request of Parliament, the president of the regency [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on 12 July 1822 as [[Agust\u00edn I]]. Agust\u00edn de Iturbide was the general who helped secure Mexican independence from Spanish rule, but was overthrown by the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].\n\nIn 1863, the invading French, under [[Napoleon III]] (see above), in alliance with Mexican conservatives and [[Mexican nobility|nobility]], helped create the [[Second Mexican Empire]], and invited Archduke Maximilian, of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], younger brother of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef I]], to become emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I of Mexico]]. The childless Maximilian and his consort [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium]], adopted Agust\u00edn's grandsons Agustin and Salvador as his heirs to bolster his claim to the throne of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota made [[Chapultepec Castle]] their home, which has been the only palace in North America to house sovereigns. After the withdrawal of French protection in 1867, Maximilian was captured and executed by the liberal forces of [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]].\n\nThis empire led to French influence in the Mexican culture and also [[French Mexican|immigration from France]], Belgium, and Switzerland to Mexico.\n\n==Persia (Iran)==\n{{further|Shah|King of Kings}}\n\nIn [[Iran|Persia]], from the time of [[Darius the Great]], Persian rulers used the title \"[[King of Kings]]\" (''[[Shah]]anshah'' in Persian) since they had dominion over peoples from the borders of India to the borders of Greece and Egypt. [[Alexander]] probably crowned himself ''shahanshah'' after conquering Persia{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, bringing the phrase ''basileus ton basileon'' to Greek. It is also known that [[Tigranes the Great]], king of Armenia, was named as the king of kings when he made his empire after defeating the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. Georgian title \"mephet'mephe\" has the same meaning.\n\nThe last ''shahanshah'' ([[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]) was ousted in 1979 following the [[Iranian Revolution]]. ''Shahanshah'' is usually translated as ''king of kings'' or simply ''king'' for ancient rulers of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]], and [[Sassanid]] dynasties, and often shortened to ''shah'' for rulers since the [[Safavid]] dynasty in the 16th century.  Iranian rulers were typically regarded in the West as emperors.\n\n==Indian subcontinent==\n{{main|Chakravartin}}\nThe Sanskrit word for emperor is ''[[Samr\u0101j]]'' or ''Chakravartin''. This word has been used as an epithet of various Vedic deities, like Varuna, and has been attested in the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], possibly the oldest compiled book among the Indo-Europeans. ''Chakravarti'' refers to the king of kings. A ''Chakravarti'' is not only a sovereign ruler but also has feudatories.\n\nTypically, in the later Vedic age, a Hindu high king (''[[Maharaja|Maharajah]]'') was only called ''Samr\u0101\u1e6d'' after performing the Vedic ''[[Rajasuya]]'' sacrifice, enabling him by religious tradition to claim superiority over the other kings and princes. Another word for emperor is ''s\u0101rvabhaum\u0101''. The title of ''Samr\u0101\u1e6d'' has been used by many rulers of the Indian subcontinent as claimed by the Hindu mythologies. In proper history, most historians call [[Chandragupta Maurya]] the first ''samr\u0101\u1e6d'' (emperor) of the Indian subcontinent, because of the huge empire he ruled. The most famous emperor was his grandson [[Ashoka the Great]]. Other dynasties that are considered imperial by historians are the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]], [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], [[Kakatiya Empire|Kakatiya]], [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]] and the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]].\n\n[[Rudhramadevi]] (1259\u20131289) was one of the most prominent rulers of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] Plateau, being one of the few ruling queens (empress) in Indian history.\n\nAfter India was invaded by the Mongol Khans and Turkic Muslims, the rulers of their major states on the subcontinent were titled ''Sult\u0101n'', In this manner, the only empress-regnant ever to have actually sat on the throne of Delhi was [[Razia Sultana|Razia Sultan]].  The [[Mughal Emperor]]s were the only Indian rulers for whom the term was consistently used by Western contemporaries. For the period from 1877 to 1947 when British Emperors ruled [[British India]] as the pearl in the crown of the British Empire, see above.\n\n==Africa==\n\n===Ethiopia===\n{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}\n{{Main|Emperor of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] from 1930 to 1974.]]\nFrom 1270 the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] used the title {{transl|am|N\u0259gus\u00e4 N\u00e4g\u00e4st}}, literally \"King of Kings\". The use of the ''king of kings'' style began a millennium earlier in this region, however, with the title being used by the Kings of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]], beginning with [[Sembrouthes]] in the 3rd century.\n\nAnother title used by this dynasty was {{transl|am|Itegue Zetopia}}. {{transl|am|Itegue}} translates as Empress, and was used by the only reigning Empress, [[Zauditu of Ethiopia|Zauditu]], along with the official title {{transl|am|Negiste Negest}} (\"Queen of Kings\").\n\nIn 1936, the Italian king [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] claimed the title of [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] after Ethiopia was occupied by Italy during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. After the defeat of the Italians by the British and the Ethiopians in 1941, [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] was restored to the throne but Victor Emmanuel did not relinquish his claim to the title until 1943.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vadala|first=Alexander Attilio|date=2011-01-01|title=Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156913311x590664|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=636\u2013653|doi=10.1163/156913311X590664|issn=1569-1330}}</ref>\n\n===Central African Empire===\n{{Main|Emperor of Central Africa}}\nIn 1976, President [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]], proclaimed the country to be an autocratic [[Central African Empire]], and made himself Emperor as Bokassa I.

The claims of other East Asian monarchies to the title may have been accepted for diplomatic purposes, but it was not necessarily used in more general contexts.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Emperor of China}}\n[[File:QinshihuangBW.jpg|thumb|upright|Qin Shi Huang]]\n\nThe [[East Asian]] tradition is different from the Roman tradition, having arisen separately. What links them together is the use of the Chinese logographs \u7687 (''hu\u00e1ng'') and \u5e1d (''d\u00ec'') which together or individually are imperial. Because of the cultural influence of China, China's neighbors adopted these titles or had their native titles conform in ''[[hanzi]]''. Anyone who spoke to the emperor was to address himself as b\u00ecxi\u00e0 (\u965b\u4e0b, lit. the \"Bottom of the Steps\"), corresponding to \"[[Imperial Majesty (style)|Imperial Majesty]]\"; sh\u00e8ngsh\u00e0ng (\u8056\u4e0a, lit. Holy Highness); or w\u00e0nsu\u00ec (\u842c\u6b72, lit. \"You, of Ten Thousand Years\").\n\nIn 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], who was [[Chinese sovereign|king]] of [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] at the time, proclaimed himself ''[[Shi Huangdi]]'' (\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d), which translates as \"first emperor\". ''Huangdi'' is composed of ''huang'' (\"august one\", \u7687) and ''di'' (\"sage-king\", \u5e1d), and referred to legendary/mythological [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|sage-emperors]] living several millennia earlier, of which three were ''huang'' and five were ''di''. Thus Zheng became [[Qin Shi Huang]], abolishing the system where the ''huang''/''di'' titles were reserved to dead and/or mythological rulers. Since then, the title \"king\" became a lower ranked title, and later divided into two grades. Although not as popular, the title \u738b ''wang'' (king or prince) was still used by many monarchs and dynasties in China up to the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] in the 19th century. \u738b is pronounced ''v\u01b0\u01a1ng'' in Vietnamese, ''\u014d'' in Japanese, and ''wang'' in Korean.\n\nThe imperial title continued in China until the [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown in 1912. The title was briefly revived from 12 December 1915 to 22 March 1916 by President [[Yuan Shikai]] and again in early July 1917 when General [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] attempted to restore last Qing emperor [[Puyi]] to the throne. Puyi retained the title and attributes of a foreign emperor, as a personal status, until 1924. After the Japanese occupied [[Manchuria]] in 1931, they proclaimed it to be the Empire of [[Manchukuo]], and Puyi became emperor of Manchukuo. This empire ceased to exist when it was occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn general, an emperor would have one empress (''Huanghou'', \u7687\u540e) at one time, although posthumous entitlement to empress for a [[concubines|concubine]] was not uncommon. The earliest known usage of ''huanghou'' was in the [[Han Dynasty]]. The emperor would generally select the empress from his [[concubine]]s. In subsequent dynasties, when the distinction between wife and concubine became more accentuated, the [[crown prince]] would have chosen an empress-designate before his reign. [[Early Imperial China|Imperial China]] produced only one reigning empress, [[Wu Zetian]], and she used the same Chinese title as an emperor (''Huangdi'', \u7687\u5e1d). Wu Zetian then reigned for about 15 years (690\u2013705 AD).\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Emperor of Japan}}\n[[File:Emperor Showa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Hirohito]] (\u88d5\u4ec1), or the [[Sh\u014dwa Emperor]] (\u662d\u548c\u5929\u7687), the last Japanese Emperor having ruled with prerogative powers, combined with assumption of divinity (photographed 1926).]]\n{{cleanup|section|reason=The second paragraph contains many grammar mistakes.|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe earliest Emperor recorded in [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] is [[Emperor Jimmu]], who is said to be a descendant of [[Amaterasu]]'s grandson Ninigi who descended from Heaven ([[Tenson k\u014drin]]). If one believes what is written in [[Nihon Shoki]], the Emperors have an unbroken direct male lineage that goes back more than 2,600 years.\n\nIn ancient Japan, the earliest titles for the sovereign were either \u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b (''yamato \u014dkimi'', Grand King of Yamato), \u502d\u738b/\u502d\u56fd\u738b (''wa\u014d''/''wakoku\u014d'', King of Wa, used externally), or \u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b (''amenoshita shiroshimesu \u014dkimi'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally). As early as the 7th century the word \u5929\u7687 (which can be read either as ''sumera no mikoto'', divine order, or as ''tenn\u014d'', Heavenly Emperor, the latter being derived from a Tang Chinese term referring to the Pole star around which all other stars revolve) began to be used. The earliest use of this term is found on a wooden slat, or ''[[mokkan]]'', unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998. The slat dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. The reading 'Tenn\u014d' has become the standard title for the Japanese sovereign up to the present age. The term \u5e1d (''mikado'', Emperor) is also found in literary sources.\n\nJapanese monarchs were given their official title by the Chinese emperor. The new Japanese monarch after coming into power would send a representative to China and receive the anointment. They would receive their official title on several golden plates of several meters tall. Since the Japanese monarchs changed their title to \u5929\u7687 (Heavenly Emperor) in 607, the Chinese emperor refused to anoint the Japanese king, thus, ending relations with Japan for the next few hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/15/national/history/once-upon-a-time-china-anointed-a-king-of-japan/#.U2exSPldVRY|title=Once upon a time, China anointed a 'King of Japan' - The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times}}</ref> Although the Japanese emperors used Chinese imperial titles,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, rarely was the Chinese-style \"[[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]]\" used. In the Japanese language, the word ''tenn\u014d'' is restricted to Japan's own monarch; ''k\u014dtei'' (\u7687\u5e1d) is used for foreign emperors. Historically, [[Daij\u014d-tenn\u014d|retired emperors]] often kept power over a child-emperor as de facto regent. For a long time, a ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' (formally the imperial generalissimo, but made hereditary) or an [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|imperial regent]] wielded actual political power. In fact, through much of Japanese history, the emperor has been little more than a figurehead.\n\nAfter World War II, all claims of divinity were dropped (see [[Ningen-sengen]]). The Diet acquired all prerogative powers of the Crown, reverting the latter to a ceremonial role.<ref>Although the [[Emperor of Japan]] is classified as constitutional monarch among political scientists, the current constitution of Japan defines him only as 'a symbol of the nation' and no subsequent legislation states his status as the ([[head of state]]) or equates the Crown synonymously with any government establishment.</ref> By the end of the 20th century, Japan was the only country with an emperor on the throne.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Japan's succession law prohibits a female from ascending the throne. With the birth of a daughter as the first child of the current [[crown prince]], [[Crown Prince Naruhito|Naruhito]], Japan [[Crown Prince Naruhito#Marriage and Family|considered abandoning that rule]]. However, shortly after the announcement that [[Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|third child]], the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]] was suspended by [[Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]]. On 3 January 2007, after the birth of her son, [[Prince Hisahito]], Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal.<ref>https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070103/ap_on_re_as/japan_imperial_succession</ref><!-- Keep this section updated in line with the page for Emperor of Japan -->\n\nCurrently, many{{who|date=November 2016}} believe the new prince of Japan will ascend the throne, as the law defines. Historically, Japan has had eight reigning empresses who used the genderless title ''Tenn\u014d'', rather than the female consort title ''k\u014dg\u014d'' (\u7687\u540e) or ''ch\u016bg\u016b'' (\u4e2d\u5bae). There is ongoing discussion of the [[Japanese Imperial succession controversy]].\n<!--\nEmperor's highest wife is called Kogo, and the female emperor is not called Kogo but Tenno as her male counterparts. The female emperor should be called (\u5929\u7687 Ten-no) but Empress is usual in Western parlances. However, how should female emperor's husband be called? It has not been provided in Japan yet, because no female emperor was married when reigning: only single women (widows, unmarrieds) have been female emperors in history, or a wife or widow of an emperor or Crown Prince was made female Tenno (i. e., she was already Kogo or something like it).\n-->\nAlthough current Japanese law prohibits female succession, all Japanese emperors claim to trace their lineage to ''[[Amaterasu]]'', the Sun Goddess of the [[Shinto|Shint\u014d]] [[religion]]. <!-- Shinto religion does not recognize a \"supreme\" kami, rather, kami and humans alike are viewed equally.--> Thus, the Emperor is thought to be the highest authority of the Shinto religion, and one of his duties is to perform Shinto rituals for the people of Japan.\n\n===Korea===\n[[File:Gojong of the Korean Empire 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Gojong]] of the [[Korean Empire]]]]\n\nThe rulers of [[Goguryeo]] (37 BC-668 AD) used the title of ''[[Taewang]]'' ([[Hangul]]: \ud0dc\uc655, [[Hanja]]: \u592a\u738b), literally translated as the ''Greatest of the Kings''. Also some [[Silla]] (57 BC-935 AD) rulers including [[Beopheung of Silla|Beopheung]] and [[Jinheung of Silla|Jinheung]] used this title for their declaration of independence from the influence of [[Goguryeo]].\n\nThe rulers of [[Balhae]] (698\u2013926) internally called themselves ''Seongwang'' ([[Hangul]]: \uc131\uc655, [[Hanja]]: \u8056\u738b).<ref>[[s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377219|New Book of Tang vol.209]]</ref> In the 10th century, [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]] took the title of emperor himself as a means of enhancing the prestige of the monarchy, and it was first used in Korea. Many Goryeo sovereign alternately used both supreme king and emperor. After the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongolian invasions]] (1231\u20131258), however, Korea relinquished the imperial title.\n\nThe rulers of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392\u20131897) still used the term \"King of the Joseon\" ([[Hangul]]: \uc870\uc120\uad6d\uc655, [[Hanja]]: \u671d\u9bae\u570b\u738b). In the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u2013'95, Japan defeated the [[Qing Dynasty]] China, and the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded in which Japan had China recognize the independence and autonomy of Korea. However, [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] used term of \"His Majesty the Great Monarch\" ([[Hangul]]: \ub300\uad70\uc8fc\ud3d0\ud558, [[Hanja]]: \u5927\u541b\u4e3b\u965b\u4e0b), not an official imperial title.\n\nIn 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]] (1897\u20131910), and became emperor of Korea. [[Emperor Gojong]] declared the new [[Korean era name|era name]] \"Gwangmu\" ([[Hangul]]: \uad11\ubb34, [[Hanja]]: \u5149\u6b66, Warrior of light). The Korean Empire maintained their state until 1910 \u2014 though it was an Empire by name, it was in fact in the process of being absorbed by Japan.\n\n===Mongolia===\nPre-Mongol Kingdoms such as the Xiongnu used the title \"[[Chanyu|Chanu]]\" meaning \"Ruler of all\" in old Mongolian. However it was not until the Chanu name was dropped and instead replaced by \"Khan\" that the rulers of Mongolia claimed the divine right as the ruler of all under the blue sky, this rule was closely tied with the ancient religious beliefs of the people of Mongolia ([[Tengrism]]). The title [[Khagan]] ([[Khan (title)|khan]] of khans or grand khan) was held by [[Genghis Khan]], founder of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1206. After 1271, the emperors of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] also took the Chinese title ''huangdi'', or [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. Only the Khagans from Genghis Khan to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 are normally referred to as Emperors in English.\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i au pouvoir.jpg|thumb|upright|[[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], the last Emperor of Vietnam]]\nNg\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n, the first ruler of [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] as an independent state, used the title ''V\u01b0\u01a1ng'' (\u738b, ''King''). However, after the death of Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n, the country immersed in a civil war known as [[12 Warlords Rebellion|Chaos of the 12 Lords]] that lasted for over 20 years. In the end, [[\u0110inh B\u1ed9 L\u0129nh]] unified the country after defeating all the warlords and became the first ruler of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to use the title ''Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u1ebf'' (\u7687\u5e1d, ''Emperor'') in 968. Succeeding rulers in Vietnam then continued to use this Emperor title until 1806 when this title was stopped being used for a century.\n\n\u0110inh B\u1ed9 L\u0129nh wasn't the first to claim the title of ''\u0110\u1ebf'' (\u5e1d, ''Emperor''). Before him, [[L\u00fd B\u00ed]] and [[Mai Th\u00fac Loan]] also claimed this title. However, their rules were very short lived.\n\nThe Vietnamese emperors also gave this title to their ancestors who were lords or influence figures in the previous dynasty like the Chinese emperors. This practice is one of many indications of the idea \"Vietnam's equality with China\" which remained intact up to the twentieth century.<ref>{{citation|author=Tuyet Nhung Tran, Anthony J. S. Reid|title=Vi\u1ec7t Nam Borderless Histories|year=2006|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-299-21770-9|ref=harv|page=67}}</ref>\n\nIn 1802 the newly established Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty requested canonization from Chinese [[Jiaqing Emperor]] and received the title ''Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u01a1ng'' (\u570b\u738b, ''King of a State)'' and the name of the country as ''An Nam'' (\u5b89\u5357) instead ''\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t'' (\u5927\u8d8a). To avoid unnecessary armed conflicts, the Vietnamese rulers accepted this in diplomatic relation and use the title Emperor only domestically. However, Vietnamese rulers never accepted the vassalage relationship with China and always refused to come to Chinese courts to pay homage to Chinese rulers (a sign of vassalage acceptance). China waged a number of wars against Vietnam throughout history, and after each failure, settled for the tributary relationship. The Yuan dynasty under [[Kublai Khan]] waged three wars against Vietnam to force it into a vassalage relationship but after successive failures, [[Kublai Khan]]'s successor, [[Tem\u00fcr Khan]], finally settled for a tributary relationship with Vietnam. Vietnam sent tributary missions to China once in three years (with some periods of disruptions) until the 19th century, [[Sino-French War]] France replaced China in control of northern Vietnam.\n\nThe emperors of the last dynasty of Vietnam continued to hold this title until the French conquered Vietnam. The emperor, however, was then a puppet figure only and could easily be disposed of by the French for more pro-France figure. Japan took Vietnam from France and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied Vietnam was declared an [[Empire of Vietnam|empire]] by the Japanese in March 1945. The line of emperors came to an end with [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], who was deposed after the war, although he later served as head of state of [[South Vietnam]] from 1949-55.\n\n==Oceania==\nThe lone holders of the imperial title in [[Oceania]] were the heads of the semi-mythical [[Tu\u02bbi Tonga Empire]].\n\n==Fictional uses==\nThere have been many fictional emperors in movies and books.

Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical.\n\n=== Legal egalitarianism ===\n{{details|equality before the law}}\nOne argument is that [[liberalism]] provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights.<ref>Rosales, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda. \"Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy.\" 20th World Contress on Philosophy: Political Philosophy.

The 1789 [[Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind.\n\nThe [[Declaration of Independence of the United States]] is an example of an assertion of equality of men, the wording of \"men\" and \"man\" is a reference to both men and women i.e. \"mankind\" [[all men are created equal]]\". [[John Locke]] is sometimes considered the founder of this form.\n\nMany state constitutions in the United States also use \"rights of man\" language rather than \"rights of person\" since the noun \"man\" has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women.{{citation needed|reason= sources needed both for the \"always\" bit and that it is the reason state constutions chose to say man rather than persons|date=June 2018}}\n\nIt is generally accepted by egalitarians that feminism falls under egalitarianism and that some feminists identify themselves as egalitarian which under the correct definition of the word is equality for both men and women.\n\n=== Social egalitarianism ===\nAt a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[social anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[left-libertarianism]], and [[progressivism]], some of which propound [[economic egalitarianism]]. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among [[intellectualism|intellectuals]] and in the general populations of many countries. However, whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question. Anti-egalitarianism<ref>Sidanius, Jim, et al. \"Social dominance orientation, anti\u2010egalitarianism and the political psychology of gender: an extension and cross\u2010cultural replication.\" European Journal of Social Psychology 30.1 (2000): 41-67.</ref> or [[elitism]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://englishthesaurus.net/antonym/egalitarian/ |title=Antonyms for egalitarian |last= |first= |date= |website=English Thesaurus |publisher= |access-date=28 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref> is opposition to egalitarianism.\n\n{{anchor|Finance|Financial|Economics|Economic egalitarianism}}\n\n==== Economic ====\nAn early example of equality of outcome economic egalitarianism is [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a scholar of the Chinese philosophy of [[agriculturalism]], who supported the [[price fixing|fixing of prices]] and in which all similar goods and services, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price.<ref name=\"dw\">{{cite book|last=Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011|page=38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref>\n\nIn [[socialism]], [[social ownership]] of [[means of production]] is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership, the [[surplus product]] generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners, thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another. Although the economist [[Karl Marx]] is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian, Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether. However, Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific [[economic system]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/#KarMarEquRig|title=Egalitarianism|author=|date=16 August 2002|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe American economist [[John Roemer]] has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism. Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of [[distributive justice]], shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice. Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice, the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be [[To each according to his contribution|proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production]] is inadequate. Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized.<ref name=\"Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions, 2008\">''Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions'', by Roemer, John. 2008.

(1997 [1824]) Moral inquiries on the situation of man and of brutes, London: Open Gate.</ref> have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well. Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that \"Egalitarianism implies rejecting [[speciesism]], and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals\" and that we should aid [[wild animal suffering|animals suffering in nature]].<ref name=\"Horta2014\">Horta, Oscar (2014) \"Egalitarianism and Animals,\" Between the Species: Vol. 19: Iss. 1, Article 5.\nAvailable at: http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/bts/vol19/iss1/5</ref> Furthermore, Horta argues that \"because [nonhuman animals] are worse off in comparison to humans, egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests of nonhuman animals.\"<ref name=\"Horta2014\" />\n\n=== Religious and spiritual egalitarianism ===\n==== Sikhism ====\nThe [[Sikhism|Sikh]] faith was founded upon egalitarian principles, reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race, but also between the genders. This equality led to denunciation of [[Sati (practice)|sati]], the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the [[Pyre|funeral pyres]] of deceased husband, but which actually occurred due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation over becoming the bounty of war for the Central Asians that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God. Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism, many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism, with greater rigidity than the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] archetype from which the practice was inherited.<ref name=\"Darshan, S. T 2013\">Darshan, S. T. \"7 Sikhism and development: a perfect match?.\" Handbook of Research on Development and Religion (2013): 97.</ref>  Despite the rhetoric of equality, scholars have \"found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh's of low castes\".<ref name=\"Darshan, S. T 2013\"/> Furthermore, despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism, denouncing sexism, female infanticide, dowry, sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolation\u2014the reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent, like [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]].<ref>Singh, I. J. \"What sikhism says about gender and sex.\" International Sikh Conferences. 2004.</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\n{{Main|Christian egalitarianism|Christian communism|Christian universalism}}\nThe [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarian]] view holds that the [[Bible]] teaches the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic mixes, all economic classes and all age groups, but within the teachings and example of [[Jesus Christ]], [[God in Christianity|God]] and the overarching principles of scripture.<ref>Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}</ref>\n\nWithin the wide range of [[Christianity]] there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups, some of which are [[Complementarianism|complementarians]]. There are many{{who|date=June 2018}} that say that the Bible encourages equality and also encourages law and order and social structure (for example, parents having authority over their children and husbands authority over their wives). These ideas are considered by some{{who|date=June 2018}} to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism.\n\n==== Judaism ====\n[[Judaism]] is a [[Universalism|universalist]] religion due to the belief that one God created the entire universe. A further distinction has to be made however. Judaism teaches that [[Jews]] (defined as either the biological descendants of [[Jacob]] \"Israel\", the son of Isaac and grandson of [[Abraham]] or someone who converted) have a specific covenant with [[God in Judaism|God]] as a [[chosen people]] ([[Deutoronomy]] 7:6 \"chosen as God's [[Jews as the chosen people|treasured people]]\") to serve as an example of [[Divine light|God's light]] to the rest of the world. The oral Torah and [[Rabbinic literature]] codified in the [[Talmud]] makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the [[gentile]]s (literally, \"the nations\"). However, Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. In this aspect, Judaism is universalist in its divine message, but not in its religious obligations. In [[Reform Judaism|reform]] and [[conservative Judaism]], egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations. [[Synagogue]]s that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating (i.e. no [[mechitza]]) and allow women to lead [[Jewish prayer|services]] with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the [[Torah]].\n\n==== Islam ====\nThe [[Islam]]ic stance on equality stresses that all humans are equal in the eyes of God, regardless of gender, class and race. The [[Quran]] states: \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted\".  There exists no 'equality' in this verse.  \"The most noble ...\" In deed, inherent in the choice of words is the foundation of all hatred and discrimination.<ref>The Quran 49:13 \u2013 English translation by Saheeh International</ref> Louise Marlow's ''Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought'' compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4311272?uid=3739560&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21104297963707 |title=Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought by Louise Marlow |last1=Poonawala |first1=Ismail K. |date=Summer 1999 |website=www.jstor.org |publisher=Iranian Studies Vol. 32, No. 3 (Summer, 1999), pp. 405\u2013407|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern egalitarianism theory ===\nModern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically, politically and socially. Modern egalitarianism theory (or&nbsp; \"new egalitarianism\") outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost, then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other. In essence, the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talents\u2014these differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.millenium.itesm.mx/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&sid=f2c02b96-fed4-4085-a57d-9fef664ae057%40sessionmgr101|title=Egalitarianism:Fair and Equal?

The fabric of an \"egalitarianist society\" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit [[peer pressure]] rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, [[Individualism|individualist]], [[fatalist]] or [[Autonomism|autonomist]], will be inherently unstable: the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles.<ref name=\"Thompson 1990\"/> Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group: autonomists or individualists.\n\n[[Alexander Berkman]] suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity [...] Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact [...] Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality [...] Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse\".<ref>Alexander Berkman ''What is Anarchism?'' pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n=== Marxism ===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] believed that a revolution would bring about a [[Socialism|socialist]] society which would then eventually give way to a [[Communism|communist]] stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\".\n\nHowever, [[Marxism]] rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of \"equality\"), but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires\u2014thus Marx's notion of [[communist society]] is radically individualistic.<ref name=\"Karl Marx on Equality\">''Karl Marx on Equality'', by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: \"Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes&nbsp;... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed.\"</ref>\n\nMarx was a proponent of two principles, the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society: \"[[To each according to his contribution]]\" and \"[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]<nowiki/>\". Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.<ref name=\"Rejecting Egalitarianism, 1987\">''Rejecting Egalitarianism'', by Nielsen, Kai. 1987.

The judge may consider the witness's specialized (scientific, technical or other) opinion about [[evidence]] or about [[fact]]s before the court within the expert's area of expertise, referred to as an \"expert opinion\".<ref name=\"FRE702\" /> Expert witnesses may also deliver \"expert evidence\" within the area of their expertise.<ref>''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', articles \"Evidence\", \"Expert\", \"Witness\"</ref> Their testimony may be rebutted by testimony from other experts or by other evidence or facts.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known use of an expert witness in English law came in 1782, when a court that was hearing [[litigation]] relating to the silting-up of [[Wells-next-the-Sea|Wells]] harbour in [[Norfolk]] accepted evidence from a leading [[civil engineer]], [[John Smeaton]]. This decision by the court to accept Smeaton's evidence is widely cited as the root of modern rules on expert evidence. <!-- Citation - Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America by Tal Golan, Harvard University Press 2004 --> However, it was still such an unusual feature in court that in 1957 in the [[Old Bailey]], [[Lord Justice]] [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] could describe the case of suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] thus: \"It is a most curious situation, perhaps unique in these courts, that the act of murder has to be proved by expert evidence.\"<ref>Cullen, Pamela V., \"A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams\", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904027-19-9}}</ref>\n\n==Role of expert witnesses==\nTypically, [[expert]]s are relied on for opinions on severity of [[injury]], degree of [[sanity]], cause of failure in a machine or other device, [[Wrongful dismissal in the United Kingdom|loss of earnings and associated benefits]], care costs, and the like. In an [[intellectual property]] case an expert may be shown two music scores, book texts, or circuit boards and asked to ascertain their degree of similarity. In the majority of cases, the expert's personal relation to the defendant is considered and irrelevant.\n\nThe [[tribunal]] itself, or the [[judge]], can in some systems call upon experts to technically evaluate a certain [[fact]] or [[Philosophy of action|action]], in order to provide the court with a complete knowledge on the fact/action it is judging. The expertise has the legal value of an acquisition of data. The results of these experts are then compared to those by the experts of the parties.\n\nThe expert has a great responsibility, and especially in [[penal law|penal trials]], and [[perjury]] by an expert is a severely punished [[crime]] in most countries. The use of expert witnesses is sometimes criticized in the [[United States]] because in [[civil law (common law)|civil trials]], they are often used by both sides to advocate differing positions, and it is left up to a [[jury]] to decide which expert witness to believe. Although experts are legally prohibited from expressing their opinion of submitted evidence until after they are hired, sometimes a party can surmise beforehand, because of reputation or prior cases, that the testimony will be favorable regardless of any basis in the submitted data; such experts are commonly disparaged as \"hired guns.\"<ref>Snow, J.N., & Weed, R. (1997). Mental health forensic issues in Georgia: The role of the expert witness.  Georgia Journal of Professional Counselors, 53-65.</ref><ref>Snow, J.N. & Weed, R. (1996). Forensic issues in mental health: The role of the expert witness.  Journal of Legal Nurse Consulting, 7(4), 2-13.</ref>\n\n===Duties of experts===\nIn high stakes cases multiple experts, in multiple topics, are often retained by each party. Although it is still relatively rare, the court itself may also retain its own independent expert. In all cases, fees paid to an expert may not be contingent on the outcome of the case.\n\nExpert evidence is often the most important component of many civil and criminal cases today. [[Fingerprint]] examination, [[blood analysis]], [[DNA fingerprinting]], and [[forensic firearm examination]] are common kinds of expert evidence heard in serious criminal cases. In civil cases, the work of [[accident analysis]], [[Forensic engineering#Forensic engineering|forensic engineers]], and [[Forensic accounting|forensic accountants]] is usually important, the latter  to assess [[damages]] and [[Costs (law)|costs]] in long and complex cases. [[Intellectual property]] and [[medical negligence]] cases are typical examples.\n\nElectronic evidence has also entered the courtroom as critical forensic evidence.  Audio and video evidence must be authenticated by both parties in any litigation by a forensic expert who is also an expert witness who assists the court in understanding details about that electronic evidence.\n\n[[Voice-mail]] recordings and closed-circuit television systems produce electronic evidence often used in litigation, more so today than in the past.  Video recordings of bank robberies and audio recordings of life threats are presented in court rooms by electronic expert witnesses.\n\n====England and Wales====\nIn [[England and Wales]], under the [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]] (CPR), an expert witness is required to be independent and address his or her [[expert report]] to the court. A witness may be jointly instructed by both sides if the parties agree to this, especially in cases where the liability is relatively small.\n\nUnder the CPR, expert witnesses may be instructed to produce a joint statement detailing points of agreement and disagreement to assist the court or tribunal. The meeting is held quite independently of instructing lawyers, and often assists in resolution of a case, especially if the experts review and modify their opinions. When this happens, substantial trial costs can be saved when the parties to a dispute agree to a settlement. In most systems, the [[trial (law)|trial]] (or the procedure) can be suspended in order to allow the experts to study the case and produce their results. More frequently, meetings of experts occur before trial. Experts charge a professional fee which is paid by the party commissioning the report (both parties for joint instructions) although the report is addressed to the court. The fee must not be contingent on the outcome of the case. Expert witnesses may be [[subpoenaed]] (issued with a witness summons), although this is normally a formality to avoid court date clashes.\n\n====Scotland====\nIn [[Scots Law]], ''[[Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh]]'' (1953)  provides authority that where a witness has particular knowledge or skills in an area being examined by the court, and has been called to court in order to elaborate on that area for the benefit of the court, that witness may give evidence of his/her opinion on that area.<ref>Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh 1953 SC 34</ref>\n\n== Types of expert witness==\n\n===Testifying experts===\nIf the witness needs to testify in court, the privilege is no longer protected. The expert witness's identity and nearly all documents used to prepare the testimony will become discoverable. Usually an experienced lawyer will advise the expert not to take notes on documents because all of the notes will be available to the other party.\n\nAn expert testifying in a United States federal court must satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. Evid. 702.<ref name=\"FRE702\">[http://www.federalevidence.com/rules-of-evidence#Rule702 Federal Rules of Evidence - 2011 | Federal Evidence Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Generally, under Rule 702, an expert is a person with \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\" who can \"assist the trier of fact,\" which is typically a jury. A witness who is being offered as an expert must first establish his or her competency in the relevant field through an examination of his or her credentials. The opposing attorney is permitted to conduct a [[voir dire]] of the witness in order to challenge that witness\u2019 qualifications. If qualified by the court, then the expert may testify \"in the form of an opinion or otherwise\" so long as:  \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\"\n\nAlthough experts can testify in any case in which their expertise is relevant, criminal cases are more likely to use [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] or [[forensic psychology|forensic psychologists]], whereas civil cases, such as personal injury, may use [[Forensic engineering#Forensic engineering|forensic engineers]], [[Accountant#Forensic accounting|forensic accountants]], [[employment consultant]]s or [[health care|care]] experts. Senior [[physician]]s &ndash; UK, Ireland, and Commonwealth [[consultant (medicine)|consultant]]s, U.S. [[attending physician]]s &ndash; are frequently used in both the civil and criminal courts.\n\nThe [[Federal Court of Australia]] has issued guidelines for experts appearing in Australian courts.<ref>[http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/how/prac_direction.html Guidelines for Expert Witnesses in Proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia], Practice Direction, (Federal Court of Australia, 2007)</ref> This covers the format of the expert's written testimony as well as their behaviour in court. Similar procedures apply in non-court forums, such as the Australian [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]].<ref>[http://www.tomw.net.au/technology/it/expert_witness/ The accidental expert witness], Tom Worthington, Information Age (IDG, 2005)</ref>\n\n==== Educating witness ====\nThe educating witness teaches the fact-finder (jury or, in a bench trial, judge) about the underlying scientific theory and instrument implementing theory. This witness is an expert witness, called to elicit opinions that a theory is valid and the instruments involved are reliable. The witness must be qualified as an expert witness, which may require academic qualifications or specific training.\n\n==== Reporting witness ====\nCalled after teaching witness leaves stand. Usually the laboratory technician who personally conducted the test. Witness will describe both the test and the results. When describing test, will venture opinions that proper test procedures were used and that equipment was in good working order.<ref name=\"EvidenceNineties\">{{cite book |last1=Carlson |first1=Ronald L. |last2=Imwinkelried |first2=Edward J. |last3=Kionka |first3=Edward J. |date=1991 |title=Evidence in the nineties: cases, materials, and problems for an age of science and statutes |pages= |location= |publisher=Michie Co |isbn=978-0-87473-740-0 |edition= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuFFAQAAIAAJ&q=laboratory+technician+reporting+witness+equipment&dq=laboratory+technician+reporting+witness+equipment}}</ref>\n\n===Non-testifying experts===\nIn the U.S., a party may hire experts to help them evaluate a given case. For example, a car maker may hire an experienced mechanic to decide if its cars were built to specification. This kind of expert opinion will be protected from [[discovery (law)|discovery]] by the opposing party. In other words, if the expert finds evidence against their client, the opposite party will not automatically gain access to it. This privilege is similar to the [[work-product doctrine]] (not to be confused with [[attorney\u2013client privilege]]).\n\nThe non-testifying expert can be present at the trial or hearing to aid the attorney in asking questions of other expert witnesses.  Unlike a testifying expert, a non-testifying expert can be easily withdrawn from a case.  It is also possible to change a non-testifying expert to a testifying expert before the expert disclosure date.<ref name=\"Eri\">{{cite web|last=Eri J.D.|first=Christopher|title=What are the differences between an expert witness and a consultant non testifying expert|url=http://www.forensisgroup.com/resources-for-attorneys/what-are-the-differences-between-an-expert-witness-and-a-consultant-non-testifying-expert/|work=Forensis Group|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\nIn the [[United States]], under the Federal Rule of Evidence 702 (FRE), an expert witness must be qualified on the topic of testimony. In determining the qualifications of the expert, the FRE requires the expert have had specialized education, training, or practical experience in the subject matter relating to the case.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rule 702. Testimony by Expert Witnesses|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702|website=Cornell Law School|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>  The expert's testimony must be based on facts in evidence, and should offer opinion about the [[Causation (law)|causation]] or [[correlation]] to the evidence in drawing a conclusion.\n\nExperts in the U.S. typically are paid on an hourly basis for their services in investigating the facts, preparing a report, and if necessary, [[testimony|testifying]] during pre-trial discovery, or at trial. Hourly fees range from approximately $200 to $750 or more per hour, varying primarily by the expert's field of expertise, and the individual expert's qualifications and reputation. In several fields, such as [[handwriting analysis]], where the expert compares signatures to determine the likelihood of a forgery, and medical case reviews by a physician or nurse, in which the expert goes over hospital and medical records to assess the possibility of malpractice, experts often initially charge a [[flat fee|flat fixed fee]] for their initial report. As with the hourly fees discussed previously, the amount of that flat fee varies considerably based on the reviewing expert's field, experience and reputation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matson|first1=Jack V.|title=Effective Expert Witnessing, Fifth Edition: Practices for the 21st Century|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1466578645|pages=107\u2013110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HethGUSuHcC|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n  \nThe expert's professional fee, plus his or her related expenses, is generally paid by the party retaining the expert. In some circumstance the party who prevails in the litigation may be entitled to recover the amounts paid to its expert from the losing party.\n\n===Scientific evidence===\n\nIn [[law]], '''scientific evidence''' is evidence derived from [[Science|scientific]] knowledge or techniques.  Most [[Forensics|forensic evidence]], including [[DNA profiling|genetic evidence]], is scientific evidence.\n\n==== ''Frye'' test ====\nThe ''Frye'' test, coming from the case ''[[Frye v. United States]]'' (1923), said that admissible scientific evidence must be a result of a theory that had \"general acceptance\" in the scientific community. This test results in uniform decisions regarding admissibility. In particular, the judges in ''Frye'' ruled that:\n\n:''Just  when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.''<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Frye v. United States |vol=293 |reporter=F. |opinion=1013 |pinpoint= |court=D.C. Cir. |date=1923 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/publications/evidenceiii/cases/frye.htm |accessdate=2017-01-02 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThis test has been criticized as misunderstanding the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] and being based on the assumption that a jury is unable to evaluate scientific testimony. The goals of the test were to avoid evidence from overly questionable or controversial scientific theories to be used; it was used to exclude [[lie-detector]] results employed by the defense in the original case.\n\n==== ''Daubert'' test ====\nThe [[Daubert test|''Daubert'' test]] arose out of the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''.<ref>{{ussc|name=Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals|link=|volume=509|page=579|pin=|year=1993}}.</ref> It requires four things to be shown:\n# That the theory is testable (has it been tested?)\n# That the theory has been [[peer review]]ed, (Peer reviewing usually reduces the chances of [[Scholarly peer review#Failures|error]] in the theory)\n# The reliability and error rate (100% reliability and zero error are not required, but the rates should be considered by the trial judge)\n# The extent of general acceptance by the scientific community\n\nThe [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] use the Daubert Test.

[[AP2 adaptors]] are multisubunit complexes that perform this function at the plasma membrane. The best-understood receptors that are found concentrated in coated vesicles of mammalian cells are the [[LDL receptor]] (which removes [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] from circulating blood), the transferrin receptor (which brings ferric ions bound by [[transferrin]] into the cell) and certain hormone receptors (such as that for [[Epidermal growth factor|EGF]]).\n\nAt any one moment, about 25% of the plasma membrane of a fibroblast is made up of coated pits. As a coated pit has a life of about a minute before it buds into the cell, a fibroblast takes up its surface by this route about once every 16 minutes. Coated vesicles formed from the plasma membrane have a diameter of about 36&nbsp;nm and a lifetime measured in a few seconds. Once the coat has been shed, the remaining vesicle fuses with [[endosomes]] and proceeds down the endocytic pathway.

Abbott's liberal inclinations in theology were prominent both in his educational views and in his books. His ''[[Shakespearian Grammar]]'' (1870) is a permanent contribution to English [[philology]]. In 1885, he published a life of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]. His theological writings include three anonymously published religious romances - ''[[Philochristus]]'' (1878), where he tried to raise interest in [[Gospel]]s reading, ''[[Onesimus (book)|Onesimus]]'' (1882), and ''[[Silanus the Christian]]'' (1908).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nMore weighty contributions are the anonymous theological discussion ''[[s:The Kernel and the Husk|The Kernel and the Husk]]'' (1886), ''Philomythus'' (1891), his book ''The Anglican Career of [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]]'' (1892), and his article \"The Gospels\" in the ninth edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', embodying a critical view which caused considerable stir in the English theological world. He also wrote ''St Thomas of Canterbury, his Death and Miracles'' (1898), ''Johannine Vocabulary'' (1905), ''Johannine Grammar'' (1906).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAbbott also wrote educational text books, one being \"Via Latina: First Latin Book\" which was published in 1898 and distributed around the world within the education system.\n\n== ''Flatland'' ==\n[[File:Houghton EC85 Ab264 884f - Flatland, title.jpg|thumb|''Flatland'' title page, 1884]]\n{{main article|Flatland}}\nAbbott's best-known work is his 1884 novella ''Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions'' which describes a two-dimensional world and explores the nature of dimensions.

As a child she and her brother George studied singing, [[piano]], [[guitar]] and [[violin]] with their father.\n\nThe family moved to [[Peoria, Illinois]] in 1854 but Professor Abbott was unable to find a sufficient number of music students to make ends meet and the family suffered from financial problems.<ref name=century/>  To help out, she and George began performing professionally when Emma was nine years old. She made her debut as a guitar player and singer in [[Peoria, Illinois]] in 1859, with George on the violin, and was teaching guitar by age thirteen.<ref>[http://www.picturehistory.com/product/id/23027 Profile], picturehistory.com; accessed October 5, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:EmmaAbbott.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Emma Abbott]]\nIn 1866 she joined an itinerant concert troup and toured the country.  While performing on the road she met and was befriended by [[Clara Louise Kellogg]]. Upon hearing Abbott in a concert in Toledo, Kellogg made it a point to meet her and encourage her to pursue an opera career and gave her a letter of introduction.<ref name=\"century\">Willard and Livermore, Eds.

This was followed by further studies with [[Mathilde Marchesi]], [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Wartel]] and [[Enrico Delle Sedie]] in [[Paris]]. She appeared in several productions in Paris, earning rave reviews for her fine [[soprano]] voice. She was awarded a contract with the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]] in [[London]] and made her d\u00e9but at [[Covent Garden]] as Marie in ''[[La fille du r\u00e9giment|La Fille du r\u00e9giment]]'' in 1876. However, her contract was cancelled shortly thereafter when she refused to sing Violetta from [[Verdi]]'s ''[[La Traviata]]'' on moral grounds.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Willard|editor1-first=Frances Elizabeth|editor2-last=Rice|editor2-first=Mary Ashton|title=A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-seventy biographical sketches of Leading American Women of all walks of life|year=1893|page=3|quote=While in Paris, she suffered an illness that threatened the destruction of her voice.

In 1878 she and her husband Eugene Wetherell, organized an opera company known by her name (the Abbott English Opera Company), which toured extensively throughout the United States. It was the first opera company formed by a woman in the United States. Her husband ran the business end of the company and she managed the artistic side, often starring in the productions.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe company garnered a reputation among the public for quality productions and was quite successful. Among the notable roles that Abbott sang with the company are Juliette in [[Gounod]]'s ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', Virginia in ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', Josephine in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', the title role in [[Flotow]]'s ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]'', Amina in [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[La Sonnambula]]'', and Violetta in ''[[La Traviata]]'', a role to which she apparently no longer objected,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> however, instead of singing ''Addio del passato'', she made Violetta expire with ''[[Nearer, my God, to Thee]]''.<ref>''The Musical Times'', May 1891, p. 274.</ref>\n\n\nThroughout her career, she retained artistic control over her troupe, which sometimes numbered 60. Although the company's repertoire included works from the French, Italian and English operatic literatures, they always performed in English. Many of the works were abridged and interpolated songs were commonplace. For this reason the company and Abbott were not popular with many music critics who were unhappy with the changes to the standard repertoire. However, the company was incredibly popular with the public and was consistently financially successful. Abbott herself became known among Americans as 'the people's prima donna'.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Death===\nAbbott continued performing up until her sudden death from [[pneumonia]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in 1891, aged 40.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&lpg=PA1&dq=emma%20abbott&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q=emma%20abbott&f=false|title=Notable American Women, 1607\u20131950: A Biographical Dictionary|last=James|first=Edward T.|last2=James|first2=Janet Wilson|last3=Boyer|first3=Paul S.|last4=|first4=|date=1971-01-01|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674627345|location=|pages=2|language=en|quote=|via=Google Books}}</ref>  She is buried at [[Oak Grove Cemetery (Gloucester, Massachusetts)|Oak Grove Cemetery]] in Gloucester, Massachusetts along with her husband.<ref>{{cite web|title=Take a walking tour of Oak Grove Cemetery|url=http://gloucester.wickedlocal.com/article/20151209/NEWS/151206415|website=Wicked Loca1 Gloucester|accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{GroveOnline|title=Emma Abbott|author=Hitchcock, H.

His mother was Princess Inoe, a daughter of [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]]; but instead of Osabe, it was Kanmu who was later named to succeed their father. After Inoe and Prince Osabe were confined and then died in 775, Osabe's sister \u2013 Kanmu's half-sister [[Princess Sakahito]] \u2013 became Kanmu's wife. Later, when he ascended to the throne in 781, Kanmu appointed his young brother, [[Prince Sawara]], whose mother was Takano no Niigasa, as crown prince. Hikami no Kawatsugu, a son of [[Emperor Tenmu]]'s grandson Prince Shioyaki and Sh\u014dmu's daughter Fuwa, attempted to carry out a coup d'\u00e9tat in 782, but it failed and Kawatsugu and his mother were sent into exile. In 785 Sawara was expelled and died in exile.\n\nKanmu had 16 empresses and consorts, and 32 imperial sons and daughters.<ref name=\"brown277\"/> Among them, three sons would eventually ascend to the imperial throne: [[Emperor Heizei]], [[Emperor Saga]] and [[Emperor Junna]]. Some of his descendants (known as the ''Kanmu Taira'' or ''Kanmu Heishi'') took the [[Taira clan|Taira]] hereditary clan title, and in later generations became prominent warriors. Examples include [[Taira no Masakado]], [[Taira no Kiyomori]], and (with a further surname expansion) the [[H\u014dj\u014d clan]]. The ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poet [[Ariwara no Narihira]] was one of his grandsons.\n\nKanmu is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates {{Nihongo3|Kashiwabara Imperial Mausoleum|\u67cf\u539f\u9675|Kashiwabara no Misasagi}}, in [[Fushimi-ku, Kyoto]], as the location of Kanmu's [[mausoleum]].<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>\n\n===Events of Kanmu's life===\nKanmu was an active emperor who attempted to consolidate government hierarchies and functions.

In 784 Kanmu shifted his capital from [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] to [[Nagaoka-ky\u014d]] in a move that was said to be designed to edge the powerful Nara Buddhist establishments out of state politics\u2014while the capital moved, the major Buddhist temples, and their officials, stayed put. Indeed, there was a steady stream of edicts issued from 771 right through the period of K\u016bkai's studies which, for instance, sought to limit the number of Buddhist priests, and the building of temples. However the move was to prove disastrous and was followed by a series of natural disasters including the flooding of half the city. In 785 the principal architect of the new capital, and royal favourite, [[Fujiwara no Tanetsugu]], was assassinated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nMeanwhile, Kanmu's armies were pushing back the boundaries of his empire. This led to an uprising, and in 789 a substantial defeat for Kanmu's troops. Also in 789 there was a severe drought and famine\u2014the streets of the capital were clogged with the sick, and people avoiding being [[Conscription|draft]]ed into the military, or into forced labour. Many disguised themselves as Buddhist priests for the same reason. Then in 794 Kanmu suddenly shifted the capital again, this time to Heian-ky\u014d, which is modern day [[Kyoto]]. The new capital was started early the previous year, but the change was abrupt and led to even more confusion amongst the populace.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nPolitically Kanmu shored up his rule by changing the syllabus of the university. [[Confucius|Confucian]] ideology still provided the ''raison d'\u00eatre'' for the Imperial government. In 784 Kanmu authorised the teaching of a new course based on the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' based on two newly imported commentaries: ''Kung-yang'' and ''Ku-liang''. These commentaries used political rhetoric to promote a state in which the Emperor, as \"Son of Heaven,\" should extend his sphere of influence to barbarous lands, thereby gladdening the people. In 798 the two commentaries became required reading at the government university.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nKanmu also sponsored the travels of the monks [[Saich\u014d]] and [[K\u016bkai]] to [[China]], from where they returned to found the Japanese branches of, respectively, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Kugy\u014d==\n{{Nihongo|''[[Kugy\u014d]]''|\u516c\u537f}} is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras.<ref>[http://www.furugosho.com/moyenage/empereur-g2.htm \u2013 ''kugy\u014d'' of Kammu-tenn\u014d]</ref>\n\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.

Sometimes called '''The Virgin Queen''', '''Gloriana''' or '''Good Queen Bess''', Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the [[House of Tudor]].\n\nElizabeth was the daughter of [[Henry VIII]] and [[Anne Boleyn]], his second wife, who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth's birth. Anne's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her half-brother, [[Edward VI]], ruled until his death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to [[Lady Jane Grey]] and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, Elizabeth and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in spite of [[Third Succession Act|statute law to the contrary]].  Edward's will was set aside and Mary became queen, deposing Lady Jane Grey. During Mary's reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\n\nIn 1558 upon Mary's death, Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel.<ref>\"I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.\" Elizabeth's first speech as queen, [[Hatfield House]], 20 November 1558. Loades, 35.</ref> She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]]. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the [[Supreme Governor]]. This [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] was to evolve into the [[Church of England]]. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; she never did, despite numerous courtships. She was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, [[James VI of Scotland]]. She had earlier been responsible for the imprisonment and execution of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been.<ref name=\"starkey5\">Starkey ''Elizabeth: Woman'', 5.</ref> One of her mottoes was \"''video et taceo''\" (\"I see but say nothing\").<ref>Neale, 386.</ref> In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope [[Regnans in Excelsis|declared her illegitimate]] in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war with Spain]].  England's defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history.\n\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her [[virginity]]. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. Elizabeth's reign became known as the [[Elizabethan era]]. The period is famous for the flourishing of [[English Renaissance theatre|English drama]], led by playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]], and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as [[Francis Drake]]. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler,<ref>Somerset, 729.</ref> who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.<ref name=starkey5/>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.png|thumb|left|Elizabeth's parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.

Jane was proclaimed queen by the Privy Council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days.

Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], the son of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] and an active Catholic.<ref>Loades, 27.</ref> Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.\n\nIn January and February 1554, [[Wyatt's rebellion]] broke out; it was soon suppressed.<ref>Neale, 45.</ref> Elizabeth was brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].

Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir [[Henry Bedingfeld|Henry Bedingfield]].

She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.<ref name=collinson>Patrick Collinson, \"Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603)\" in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2008) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8636, accessed 23 Aug 2011]</ref>\n\nIn terms of public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with religious matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.\n\nElizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical [[Puritan]]s though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms.<ref>{{cite book|title=This Sceptred Isle 1547\u20131660|chapter=Disc 1|isbn=978-0-563-55769-2|last1=Lee|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Lee (historian)|origyear=1995|year=1998|title-link=This Sceptred Isle}}</ref> As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the [[Edward VI of England#Reformation|Protestant settlement of Edward VI]], with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.<ref>Loades, 46.</ref>\n\nThe [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the [[House of Lords]], particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the [[Archbishopric of Canterbury]].<ref>\"It was fortunate that ten out of twenty-six bishoprics were vacant, for of late there had been a high rate of mortality among the episcopate, and a fever had conveniently carried off Mary's Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Reginald Pole]], less than twenty-four hours after her own death\".

Black, 10.</ref> This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] rather than the more contentious title of [[Supreme Head]], which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. The new [[Act of Supremacy 1559|Act of Supremacy]] became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the [[heresy]] laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 [[Book of Common Prayer]] compulsory, though the penalties for [[recusancy]], or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.<ref>Somerset, 101\u2013103.</ref>\n\n== Marriage question ==\n\nFrom the start of Elizabeth's reign, it was expected that she would marry and the question arose to whom.

Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships.<ref>Loades, 38.</ref><ref>Haigh, 19.</ref> She considered several suitors until she was about fifty.

In April she [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] the Parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in 1566. Having promised to marry previously, she told an unruly House:\n<blockquote>I will never break the word of a prince spoken in public place, for my honour's sake.

The marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in February 1567 by conspirators almost certainly led by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. Elizabeth confronted Mary about the marriage, writing to her:\n\n<blockquote>How could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.<ref>Letter to Mary, Queen of Scots, 23 June 1567.\" Quoted by Loades, 69\u201370.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese events led rapidly to Mary's defeat and imprisonment in [[Loch Leven Castle]]. The Scottish lords forced her to [[abdicate]] in favour of her son [[James VI]], who had been born in June 1566. James was taken to [[Stirling Castle]] to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from [[Loch Leven (Kinross)|Loch Leven]] in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe.

Elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. Her strategy, to support the Dutch on the surface with an English army, while beginning secret peace talks with Spain within days of Leicester's arrival in Holland,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 43</ref> had necessarily to be at odds with Leicester's, who wanted and was expected by the Dutch to fight an active campaign.

It was her first venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563. Henry's succession was strongly contested by the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports. The subsequent English campaigns in France, however, were disorganised and ineffective.<ref name=\"haigh142\">Haigh, 142.</ref> [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Willoughby]], largely ignoring Elizabeth's orders, roamed northern France to little effect, with an army of 4,000 men. He withdrew in disarray in December 1589, having lost half his troops. In 1591, the campaign of [[John Norreys]], who led 3,000 men to [[Brittany]], was even more of a disaster. As for all such expeditions, Elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders. Norreys left for London to plead in person for more support. In his absence, a Catholic League army almost destroyed the remains of his army at Craon, north-west France, in May 1591. In July, Elizabeth sent out another force under [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], to help Henry IV in besieging [[Rouen]]. The result was just as dismal. Essex accomplished nothing and returned home in January 1592. Henry abandoned the siege in April.<ref>Haigh, 143.</ref> As usual, Elizabeth lacked control over her commanders once they were abroad. \"Where he is, or what he doth, or what he is to do,\" she wrote of Essex, \"we are ignorant\".<ref>Haigh, 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n===Ireland===\n{{main|Tudor conquest of Ireland}}\n[[File:England Queen Elizabeth I sixpence 1593.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Silver [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]], struck 1593, identifying Elizabeth as \"[[by the Grace of God]] Queen of England, [[English claim to the French throne|France]], and Ireland\"]]\nAlthough Ireland was one of her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous,<ref>One observer wrote that [[Ulster]], for example, was \"as unknown to the English here as the most inland part of Virginia\".

During a revolt in [[Munster]] led by [[Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond]], in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish people starved to death. The poet and colonist [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote that the victims \"were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same\".<ref>Somerset, 668.</ref> Elizabeth advised her commanders that the Irish, \"that rude and barbarous nation\", be well treated; but she showed no remorse when force and bloodshed were deemed necessary.<ref>Somerset, 668\u2013669.</ref>\n\nBetween 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth faced her most severe test in Ireland during the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]], a revolt that took place at the height of hostilities with [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Spain]], who backed the rebel leader, [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone]].<ref>Loades, 98.</ref> In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent [[Essex in Ireland|Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], to put the revolt down. To her frustration,<ref>In a letter of 19 July 1599 to Essex, Elizabeth wrote: \"For what can be more true (if things be rightly examined) than that your two month's journey has brought in never a capital rebel against whom it had been worthy to have adventured one thousand men\".

He was replaced by [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy|Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy]], who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death.<ref>Loades, 98\u201399.</ref> Soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between England and Spain.\n\n===Russia===\nElizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the [[Tsardom of Russia]] originally established by her half-brother. She often wrote to [[Ivan the Terrible]] on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance. The Tsar even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised.\nUpon Ivan's death, he was succeeded by his simple-minded son [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor]]. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in maintaining exclusive trading rights with England. Feodor declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador Sir [[Jerome Bowes]], whose pomposity had been tolerated by Ivan. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent [[Boris Godunov]] that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor with two of his many titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by Feodor's father, but was turned down.<ref>''Russia and Britain'' by Crankshaw, Edward, published by Collins, ''The Nations and Britain'' series</ref>\n\n===Muslim states===\n[[File:MoorishAmbassador to Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|upright|Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud was the Moorish ambassador to Elizabeth in 1600.]]\nTrade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the [[Barbary states]] during the rule of Elizabeth.<ref name=\"vaughan\">{{cite book| author = Virginia Mason Vaughan| title = Performing Blackness on English Stages, 1500\u20131800| url = https://books.google.com/?id=19_SIlq3ZvsC&pg=PA57| year = 2005| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-84584-7| page = 57 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Allardyce Nicoll| title = Shakespeare Survey With Index 1\u201310| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OeakAOji13EC&pg=PA90| year = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-52347-9| page = 90 }}</ref> England established a trading relationship with [[Morocco]] in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a [[Pope|Papal]] ban.<ref>{{cite book| author = Emily Carroll Bartels| title = Speaking of the Moor |page=24| url = https://books.google.com/?id=S6Z9J0OJmmQC&pg=PA24| year = 2008| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| isbn = 978-0-8122-4076-4 }}</ref> In 1600, [[Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud]], the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler [[Ahmad al-Mansur|Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur]], visited England as an ambassador to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,<ref name=\"vaughan\"/><ref>[[University of Birmingham]] Collections [http://mimsy.bham.ac.uk/detail.php?t=objects&type=related&kv=101212 Mimsy.bham.ac.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228082016/http://mimsy.bham.ac.uk/detail.php?t=objects&type=related&kv=101212 |date=28 February 2009 }}</ref> to negotiate an [[Anglo-Moroccan alliance]] against Spain.<ref name=\"tate.org.uk\">[[Tate Gallery]] exhibition \"East-West: Objects between cultures\", [http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/east-west-objects-between-cultures/east-west-room-1 Tate.org.uk]</ref><ref name=\"vaughan\"/> Elizabeth \"agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish\".<ref name=\"Kupperman39\">Kupperman, 39</ref> Discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.<ref>Nicoll, p.96</ref>\n\nDiplomatic relations were also established with the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the chartering of the [[Levant Company]] and the dispatch of the first English ambassador to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], [[William Harborne]], in 1578.<ref name=Kupperman39/> For the first time, a Treaty of Commerce was signed in 1580.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&pg=PA353 |title=The Encyclopedia of world history by Peter N.

A new generation was in power. With the exception of Lord Burghley, the most important politicians had died around 1590: the Earl of Leicester in 1588; Sir Francis Walsingham in 1590; and Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] in 1591.<ref>Collinson, 89</ref> Factional strife in the government, which had not existed in a noteworthy form before the 1590s,<ref>Doran ''Monarchy'', 216</ref> now became its hallmark.<ref>Hammer, 1\u20132</ref> A&nbsp;bitter rivalry arose between the Earl of Essex and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], son of Lord Burghley and their respective adherents, and the struggle for the most powerful positions in the state marred politics.<ref>Hammer, 1, 9</ref> The queen's personal authority was lessening,<ref>Hammer, 9\u201310</ref> as is shown in the 1594 affair of Dr. Lopez, her trusted physician. When he was wrongly accused by the Earl of Essex of treason out of personal pique, she could not prevent his execution, although she had been angry about his arrest and seems not to have believed in his guilt.<ref>Lacey, 117\u2013120</ref>\n\nDuring the last years of her reign, Elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a cost-free system of patronage, rather than asking Parliament for more subsidies in a time of war.<ref>A Patent of Monopoly gave the holder control over an aspect of trade or manufacture. See Neale, 382.</ref> The practice soon led to [[price fixing|price-fixing]], the enrichment of courtiers at the public's expense, and widespread resentment.<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 208.</ref> This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601.<ref>Black, 192\u2013194.</ref> In her famous \"[[Golden Speech]]\" of 30 November 1601 at [[Whitehall Palace]] to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:<ref>Neale, 383\u2013384.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess.

During this period and into the [[Jacobean era]] that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks.<ref>Black, 239\u2013245.</ref> The notion of a great [[Elizabethan era]] depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.<ref>Haigh, 176.</ref>\n\nAs Elizabeth aged her image gradually changed. She was portrayed as [[Belphoebe]] or [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], and after the Armada, as [[Gloriana]], the eternally youthful [[Faerie Queene]] of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s poem. Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic [[iconography|icons]] that made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been scarred by [[smallpox]] in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics.<ref name=\"loades92\">Loades, 92.</ref> Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss to such an extent that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/11353064/The-Tudors-had-bad-teeth-What-rot.html \"The Tudors had bad teeth?

In the words of the chronicler [[John Stow]]:\n<blockquote>Westminster was surcharged with multitudes of all sorts of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came out to see the [[obsequy]], and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.<ref>Weir, ''Elizabeth'', 486.</ref></blockquote>\n\nElizabeth was interred in Westminster Abbey, in a tomb shared with her half-sister, Mary I.

James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court.<ref>Strong, 164.</ref> The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties,<ref>Haigh, 170.</ref> was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. [[Godfrey Goodman]], Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: \"When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive. Then was her memory much magnified.\"<ref>Weir, 488.</ref> Elizabeth's reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.<ref>Dobson and Watson, 257.</ref>\n\nThe picture of Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers of the early 17th century has proved lasting and influential.<ref>Haigh, 175, 182.</ref> Her memory was also revived during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion.<ref>Dobson and Watson, 258.</ref> In the [[Victorian era]], the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day,<ref name=Ld/><ref>The age of Elizabeth was redrawn as one of [[chivalry]], epitomised by courtly encounters between the queen and sea-dog \"heroes\" such as Drake and Raleigh. Some Victorian narratives, such as Raleigh laying his cloak before the queen or presenting her with a potato, remain part of the myth. Dobson and Watson, 258.</ref> and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat.<ref>Haigh, 175.</ref><ref>In his preface to the 1952 reprint of ''Queen Elizabeth I'', J.&nbsp;E. Neale observed: \"The book was written before such words as \"ideological\", \"fifth column\", and \"cold war\" became current; and it is perhaps as well that they are not there. But the ideas are present, as is the idea of romantic leadership of a nation in peril, because they were present in Elizabethan times\".</ref> Historians of that period, such as [[J. E. Neale]] (1934) and [[A. L. Rowse]] (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress.<ref>Haigh, 182.</ref> Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.<ref>Kenyon, 207</ref>\n\nRecent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of Elizabeth.<ref>Haigh, 183.</ref> Her reign is famous for the defeat of the Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on C\u00e1diz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea.<ref name=haigh142/> In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record.<ref>Black, 408\u2013409.</ref> Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.<ref>Haigh, 142\u2013147, 174\u2013177.</ref>\n\nElizabeth established an English church that helped shape a national identity and remains in place today.<ref>Loades, 46\u201350.</ref><ref>Weir, ''Elizabeth'', 487.</ref><ref>Hogge, 9\u201310.</ref> Those who praised her later as a Protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all practices of Catholic origin from the Church of England.<ref>The new state religion was condemned at the time in such terms as \"a cloaked papistry, or mingle mangle\". Somerset, 102.</ref> Historians note that in her day, strict Protestants regarded the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Acts of Settlement and Uniformity of 1559]] as a compromise.<ref>Haigh, 45\u201346, 177.</ref><ref>Black, 14\u201315.</ref> In fact, Elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as [[Francis Bacon]] put it, to \"make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts\".<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 50.</ref><ref>Haigh, 42.</ref>\n\nThough Elizabeth followed a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England's status abroad. \"She is only a woman, only mistress of half an island,\" marvelled [[Pope Sixtus V]], \"and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by [[Holy Roman Empire|the Empire]], by all\".<ref name=\"somerset1\">Somerset, 727.</ref> Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as [[Christendom]] fragmented.<ref name=somerset726/><ref>Hogge, 9''n''.</ref><ref>Loades, 1.</ref> Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent.<ref>As Elizabeth's [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], Sir [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]], put it on her behalf to parliament in 1559, the queen \"is not, nor ever meaneth to be, so wedded to her own will and fantasy that for the satisfaction thereof she will do anything&nbsp;... to bring any bondage or servitude to her people, or give any just occasion to them of any inward grudge whereby any tumults or stirs might arise as hath done of late days\".

Amaterasu had a son called [[Ame no Oshihomimi no Mikoto]] and through him a grandson named [[Ninigi-no-Mikoto]]. She sent her grandson to the Japanese islands where he eventually married [[Konohanasakuya-hime|Konohana-Sakuya-hime]].

They eventually married and had four sons. The last of these, Kamu-yamato Iware-biko no mikoto, became Emperor Jimmu.<ref>Nussbaum, \"''Chijin-godai''\" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC| p. 111|page=111}}.</ref>\n\n===Migration===\n[[File:Emperor Jimmu.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a bearded Jimmu with his emblematic long bow and an accompanying [[Three-legged_crow#Japan|three-legged crow]]. This 19th century artwork is by [[Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]].]]\nAccording to the chronicles ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', Jimmu's brothers were born in [[Takachiho, Miyazaki|Takachiho]], the southern part of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] in modern-day [[Miyazaki Prefecture]]. They moved eastward to find a location more appropriate for administering the entire country. Jimmu's older brother, Itsuse no Mikoto, originally led the migration, and led the clan eastward through the [[Seto Inland Sea]] with the assistance of local chieftain ''Sao Netsuhiko''. As they reached Naniwa (modern day [[\u014csaka]]), they encountered another local chieftain, ''Nagasunehiko'' (\"the long-legged man\"), and Itsuse was killed in the ensuing battle. Jimmu realized that they had been defeated because they battled eastward against the sun, so he decided to land on the east side of [[Kii Peninsula]] and to battle westward. They reached [[Kumano Region|Kumano]], and, with the guidance of a [[three-legged crow]], ''Yatagarasu'' (\"eight-span crow\"), they moved to [[Yamato Province|Yamato]]. There, they once again battled Nagasunehiko and were victorious.\n\nIn Yamato, ''[[Nigihayahi|Nigihayahi no Mikoto]]'', who also claim descent from the Takamagahara gods, was protected by Nagasunehiko. However, when Nigihayahi met Jimmu, he accepted Jimmu's legitimacy. At this point, Jimmu is said to have ascended to the throne of Japan. Upon scaling a Nara mountain to survey the Seto Inland Sea he now controlled, Jimmu remarked that it was shaped like the \"heart\" rings made by mating [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], archaically ''akitsu'' \u79cb\u6d25.<ref>[https://www.kusuyama.jp/culture/tombo-dragonfly/]</ref> A mosquito then tried to steal Jimmu's royal blood but since Jimmu was a god incarnate emperor, ''akitsumikami'' \u73fe\u5fa1\u795e, a dragonfly killed the mosquito. Japan thus received its [[Names of Japan|classical name]] the Dragonfly Islands, ''akitsushima'' \u79cb\u6d25\u5cf6.\n\nAccording to the ''Kojiki'', Jimmu died when he was 126 years old. This emperor's [[posthumous name]] literally means \"divine might\" or \"god-warrior\". It is undisputed that this identification is Chinese in form and Buddhist in implication, which suggests that the name must have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Jimmu. It is generally thought that Jimmu's name and character evolved into their present shape just before<ref>Kennedy, Malcolm D. A History of Japan. London.

He was elected as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] for [[New Jersey]] following the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was appointed by President [[George Washington]] as Director of the [[United States Mint]], serving from 1795 until 1805.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n[[File:1811, Sharples, James, Elias Boudinot IV.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Sharples]], ''Elias Boudinot IV'', [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nElias Boudinot was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on May 2, 1740. His father, Elias Boudinot III, was a merchant and silversmith; he was a neighbor and friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. His mother, Mary Catherine Williams, was born in the [[British West Indies]]; her father was from [[Wales]]. Elias' paternal grandfather, Elie (sometimes called Elias) Boudinot, was the son of Jean Boudinot and Marie Suire of Marans, Aunis, [[France]]. They were a [[Huguenot]] (French Protestant) family who fled to New York about 1687 to avoid the religious persecutions of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].\n\nMary Catherine Williams and Elias Boudinot Sr. were married on August 8, 1729. Over the next twenty years, they had nine children. The first, John, was born in the British West Indies-Antigua. Of the others, only the younger Elias and his siblings [[Annis Boudinot Stockton|Annis]], Mary, and Elisha reached adulthood. Annis became one of the first published women poets in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and her work appeared in leading newspapers and magazines. Elisha Boudinot became Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of New Jersey]].\n\nAfter studying and being tutored at home, Elias Boudinot went to [[Princeton, New Jersey]] to read the law as a legal apprentice to [[Richard Stockton (1730-1781)|Richard Stockton]]. An attorney, he had married Elias' older sister [[Annis Boudinot Stockton|Annis Boudinot]]. Richard Stockton was later a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1760, Boudinot was admitted to the bar, and began his practice in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. He owned land adjacent to the road from Elizabethtown to [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey]].\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Mrs Elias Boudinot, attributed to Matthew Pratt (1734-1805).jpg|thumb|Hannah Stockton Boudinot (1736\u20131808), by Matthew Pratt]]\nAfter getting established, on April 21, 1762, Boudinot married Hannah Stockton (1736\u20131808), Richard's younger sister. They had two children, Maria Boudinot, who died at age two, and Susan Vergereau Boudinot.\n\nSusan married [[William Bradford (Attorney General)|William Bradford]], who became [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania|Chief Justice of Pennsylvania]] and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] under [[George Washington]]. After her husband's death in 1795, Susan Boudinot Bradford returned to her parents' home to live. The young widow edited her father's papers. Now held by [[Princeton University]], these provide significant insight into the events of the Revolutionary era.\n\nIn 1805, Elias, Hannah and Susan moved to a new home in [[Burlington, New Jersey]]. Hannah died a few years after their move, and Elias lived there for the remainder of his years.\n\n==Later career==\nIn his later years, Boudinot invested and speculated in land. He owned large tracts in [[Ohio]] including most of [[Green Township, Hamilton County, Ohio|Green Township]] in what is now the western suburbs of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], where there is a street bearing his surname. At his death, he willed {{convert|13,000|acre|km2}} to the city of Philadelphia for parks and city needs. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's Church, Burlington, New Jersey.<ref>{{FAG|12858}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nBoudinot became a prominent lawyer and his practice prospered. As the revolution drew near, he aligned with the [[Radical Whigs|Whigs]], and was elected to the New Jersey provincial assembly in 1775. In the early stages of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], he was active in promoting enlistment; several times he loaned money to field commanders to purchase supplies. Boudinot helped support the activities of rebel spies. After the British occupation of New York City, spies were sent to [[Staten Island]] and [[Long Island, New York]] to observe and report on movements of specific British garrisons and regiments.\n\nOn May 5, 1777, General [[George Washington]] asked Boudinot to be appointed as commissary general for prisoners. Congress through the board of war concurred. Boudinot was commissioned as a colonel in the [[Continental Army]] for this work. He served until July 1778, when competing responsibilities forced him to resign. The commissary managed enemy prisoners, and also was responsible for supplying [[American Revolution prisoners of war|American prisoners]] who were held by the British.\n\nIn November 1777, the New Jersey legislature named Boudinot as one of their delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. His duties as Commissary prevented his attendance, so in May 1778 he resigned. By early July he had been replaced and attended his first meeting of the Congress on July 7, 1778. As a delegate, he still continued his concerns for the welfare of prisoners of war. His first term ended that year.\n\nIn 1781, Boudinot returned to the Congress, for a term lasting through 1783. In November 1782, he was elected as [[President of the Continental Congress]] for a one-year term. The President of Congress was a mostly ceremonial position with no real authority, but the office did require him to handle a good deal of correspondence and sign official documents.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Calvin C. |last1=Jillson |first2=Rick K. |last2=Wilson |title=Congressional Dynamics: Structure, Coordination, and Choice in the First American Congress, 1774\u20131789 |location=Stanford |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1994 |pages=76\u201380 |isbn=0-8047-2293-5 }}</ref> On April 15, 1783 he signed the Preliminary Articles of Peace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/paris.html|title=Treaty of Paris: Primary Documents of American History (Virtual Programs & Services, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref> When the United States (US) government was formed in 1789, Boudinot was elected from New Jersey to the US [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. He was elected to the second and third congresses as well, where he generally supported the administration. He refused to join the expansion of affiliated groups that formed formal political parties.\n\nIn 1794, he declined to serve another term, and left Congress in early 1795. In October 1795, President [[George Washington]] appointed him as Director of the [[United States Mint]], a position he held through succeeding administrations until he retired in 1805.\n\n==Later public service==\nIn addition to serving in political office, Elias supported many civic, religious, and educational causes during his life. Boudinot served as one of the trustees of the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University]]) for nearly half a century, from 1772 until 1821. When the Continental Congress was forced to leave Philadelphia in 1783 while he was  president, he moved the meetings to [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], where they met in the College's [[Nassau Hall]].\n\nOn September 24, 1789, the House of Representatives voted to recommend the First Amendment of the newly drafted Constitution to the states for ratification. The next day, Congressman  Boudinot proposed that the House and Senate jointly request of President Washington to proclaim a day of thanksgiving for \"the many signal favors of Almighty God.\" Boudinot said that he\n<blockquote>could not think of letting the session pass over without offering an opportunity to all the citizens of the United States of joining, with one voice, in returning to Almighty God their sincere thanks for the many blessings he had poured down upon them.<ref>''The Annals of the Congress, The Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States, Compiled From Authentic Materials,'' compiled by Joseph Gales, Senior (Washington, DC: Gales and Seaton, 1834), 1:949\u2013950</ref></blockquote>\n\nBoudinot was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb|title=MemberListB|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nA devout [[Presbyterian]], Boudinot supported missions and missionary work.  He wrote ''The Age of Revelation'' in response to Thomas Paine's ''The Age of Reason.'' He was one of the founders of the [[American Bible Society]], and after 1816 served as its President.\n\nHe argued for the rights of black and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] citizens, and sponsored students to the Board School for Indians in [[Connecticut]]. One of these, a young Cherokee named ''Gallegina Uwatie'', also known as ''Buck Watie'', stayed with him in Burlington on his way to the school. The two so impressed each other that ''Gallegina'' asked for and was given permission to adopt the statesman's name. Later known as  [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], he was an editor of the ''Cherokee Phoenix'', the nation's first newspaper, which was published in Cherokee and English.\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n* [[Princeton University]] Library holds the Boudinot-Stockton papers, as well as many family possessions and portraits.\n* Elias Boudinot Elementary School in [[Burlington, New Jersey]] is named after him, as are the following:\n* Boudinot Street in Philadelphia, located between C and D Streets.\n* Boudinot Avenue in Western Hills, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] home of the original [[LaRosa's]] pizzeria.\n* Boudinot Place in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]\n* Boudinot Street in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].\n* Boudinot Lane in [[Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey|Franklin Township, New Jersey]]\n* Boudinot-Southard-Ross Farmstead in [[Bernards Township, Somerset County, New Jersey]]\n\n==Quotes==\n{{Copy to Wikiquote|section=yes}}\n* \"Be religiously careful in our choice of all public officers...and judge of the tree by its fruits.\"\n* \"Good government generally begins in the family, and if the moral character of a people once degenerate, their political character must soon follow.\"\n\n==Archival collections==\nThe [[Presbyterian Historical Society]] in [[Philadelphia]] has a [http://www.history.pcusa.org/collections/findingaids/fa.cfm?record_id=256 collection of incoming correspondence and several legal agreements pertaining to land ownership] related to Boudinot from 1777\u20131821 in its holdings. The correspondence dating from 1777\u20131778 almost exclusively deals with the trading and releasing of prisoners.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{EB1911 poster|Boudinot, Elias}}\n* {{Cite book |first=J.

This frequency range is divided into separate bands, and the [[electromagnetic wave]]s within each frequency band are called by different names; beginning at the low frequency (long wavelength) end of the spectrum these are: [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[terahertz waves]], [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s at the high-frequency (short wavelength) end.  The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications.  The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the [[universe]] itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the [[Planck length]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Basic Electronics Engineering |author1=Bakshi, U.

Exposure to these rays can be a health hazard, causing [[radiation sickness]], [[DNA damage]] and [[cancer]].  Radiation of visible light wavelengths and lower are called ''nonionizing radiation'' as they cannot cause these effects.\n\nIn most of the frequency bands above, a technique called [[spectroscopy]] can be used to physically separate waves of different frequencies, producing a [[spectrum]] showing the constituent frequencies.

[\u2026] He found that the temperatures of the colors increased from the violet to the red part of the spectrum. [\u2026] Herschel decided to measure the temperature just ''beyond'' the red of the spectrum in a region where no sunlight was visible. To his surprise, he found that this region had the highest temperature of all.}}</ref>  He was studying the temperature of different colors by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism. He noticed that the highest temperature was beyond red. He theorized that this temperature change was due to \"calorific rays\" that were a type of light ray that could not be seen.\n\nThe next year, [[Johann Ritter]], working at the other end of the spectrum, noticed what he called \"chemical rays\" (invisible light rays that induced certain chemical reactions). These behaved similarly to visible violet light rays, but were beyond them in the spectrum.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Michael W.|title=Johann Wilhelm Ritter (1776\u20131810)|url=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/ritter.html|publisher=The Florida State University|accessdate=5 March 2013|quote=Ritter [\u2026] hypothesized that there must also be invisible radiation beyond the violet end of the spectrum and commenced experiments to confirm his speculation. He began working with silver chloride, a substance decomposed by light, measuring the speed at which different colors of light broke it down. [\u2026] Ritter [\u2026] demonstrated that the fastest rate of decomposition occurred with radiation that could not be seen, but that existed in a region beyond the violet. Ritter initially referred to the new type of radiation as chemical rays, but the title of ultraviolet radiation eventually became the preferred term.}}</ref>  They were later renamed [[ultraviolet]] radiation.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation was first linked to electromagnetism in 1845, when [[Michael Faraday]] noticed that the polarization of light traveling through a transparent material responded to a [[magnetic field]] (see [[Faraday effect]]). During the 1860s [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] developed four partial differential [[Maxwell's equations|equations]] for the [[electromagnetic field]]. Two of these equations predicted the possibility and behavior of waves in the field. Analyzing the speed of these theoretical waves, Maxwell realized that they must travel at a speed that was about the known [[speed of light]]. This startling coincidence in value led Maxwell to make the inference that light itself is a type of electromagnetic wave.\n\n[[Maxwell's equations]] predicted an infinite number of frequencies of [[electromagnetic waves]], all traveling at the speed of light. This was the first indication of the existence of the entire electromagnetic [[spectrum]].\n\nMaxwell's predicted waves included waves at very low frequencies compared to infrared, which in theory might be created by oscillating charges in an ordinary electrical circuit of a certain type. Attempting to prove Maxwell's equations and detect such low frequency electromagnetic radiation, in 1886 the physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] built an apparatus to generate and detect what are now called [[radio wave]]s. Hertz found the waves and was able to infer (by measuring their wavelength and multiplying it by their frequency) that they traveled at the speed of light. Hertz also demonstrated that the new radiation could be both reflected and refracted by various dielectric media, in the same manner as light. For example, Hertz was able to focus the waves using a lens made of tree [[pitch (resin)|resin]]. In a later experiment, Hertz similarly produced and measured the properties of [[microwave]]s. These new types of waves paved the way for inventions such as the [[wireless telegraph]] and the [[radio]].\n\nIn 1895 [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]] noticed a new type of radiation emitted during an experiment with an evacuated tube subjected to a high voltage. He called these radiations [[x-ray]]s and found that they were able to travel through parts of the human body but were reflected or stopped by denser matter such as bones. Before long, many uses were found for them in the [[Radiography|field of medicine]].\n\nThe last portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was filled in with the discovery of [[gamma ray]]s. In 1900 [[Paul Villard]] was studying the radioactive emissions of [[radium]] when he identified a new type of radiation that he first thought consisted of particles similar to known alpha and beta particles, but with the power of being far more penetrating than either. However, in 1910, British physicist [[William Henry Bragg]] demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914, [[Ernest Rutherford]] (who had named them gamma rays in 1903 when he realized that they were fundamentally different from charged alpha and beta particles) and [[Edward Andrade]] measured their wavelengths, and found that gamma rays were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies.\n\n==Range==\nElectromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties: the [[frequency]] ''f'', [[wavelength]] [[lambda|\u03bb]], or [[photon]] [[energy]] ''E''. Frequencies observed in astronomy range from {{val|2.4|e=23|u=Hz}} (1 [[GeV]] gamma rays) down to the local [[plasma frequency]] of the ionized interstellar medium (~1&nbsp;kHz). Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency,<ref name=\"em-spectrum\"/> so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of [[atom]]s, whereas wavelengths on the opposite end of the spectrum can be as long as the [[universe]]. [[Photon energy]] is directly proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma ray photons have the highest energy (around a billion [[electron volt]]s), while radio wave photons have very low energy (around a [[femto]]electronvolt). These relations are illustrated by the following equations:\n:<math>f = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}, \\quad\\text{or}\\quad f = \\frac{E}{h}, \\quad\\text{or}\\quad E=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda},</math>\nwhere:\n*''c'' = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum\n*''h'' = {{val|6.62606896|(33)|e=-34|u=J\u00b7s}} = {{val|4.13566733|(10)|e=-15|u=eV\u00b7s}} is [[Planck's constant]].<ref name=\"CODATA\">{{CODATA2006|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?h}}</ref>\n\nWhenever electromagnetic waves exist in a [[Transmission medium|medium]] with [[matter]], their wavelength is decreased. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, no matter what medium they are traveling through, are usually quoted in terms of the ''vacuum wavelength'', although this is not always explicitly stated.\n\nGenerally, electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]], [[microwave]], [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] (or sub-millimeter) radiation, [[infrared]], the [[visible region]] that is perceived as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s. The behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength. When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior also depends on the amount of energy per [[quantum]] (photon) it carries.\n\n[[Spectroscopy]] can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible range of 400&nbsp;nm to 700&nbsp;nm. A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2&nbsp;nm to 2500&nbsp;nm.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=November 2015}} Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. Spectroscopes are widely used in [[astrophysics]].

For example, SLF radio waves at 60&nbsp;Hz may be received and studied by astronomers, or may be ducted along wires as electric power, although the latter is, in the strict sense, not electromagnetic radiation at all (see [[near and far field]]).\n\nNote that there are no precisely defined boundaries between the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum; rather they fade into each other like the bands in a rainbow (which is the sub-spectrum of visible light). Radiation of each frequency and wavelength (or in each band) has a mix of properties of the two regions of the spectrum that bound it. For example, red light resembles infrared radiation in that it can excite and add energy to some [[chemical bond]]s and indeed must do so to power the chemical mechanisms responsible for [[photosynthesis]] and the working of the [[visual system]].\n\nThe distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is partly based on sources: the photons generated from [[nuclear decay]] or other nuclear and subnuclear/particle process, are always termed gamma rays, whereas X-rays are generated by [[electron]]ic transitions involving highly energetic inner atomic electrons.<ref>{{cite book\n |author1=Feynman, Richard |author2=Leighton, Robert |author3=Sands, Matthew |title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol.1\n |publisher = Addison-Wesley\n |year = 1963\n |location = USA\n |pages = 2\u20135\n |isbn = 978-0-201-02116-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |author1=L'Annunziata, Michael  |author2=Baradei, Mohammad \n |title = Handbook of Radioactivity Analysis\n |publisher = Academic Press\n |year = 2003\n |page = 58\n |url = https://books.google.com/?id=b519e10OPT0C&pg=PA58&dq=gamma+x-ray\n |isbn = 978-0-12-436603-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |author1=Grupen, Claus |author2=Cowan, G. |author3=Eidelman, S.

By analogy to electronic transitions, [[muonic atom]] transitions are also said to produce X-rays, even though their energy may exceed {{convert|6|MeV}},<ref>[http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-0335.pdf Corrections to muonic X-rays and a possible proton halo] slac-pub-0335 (1967)</ref> whereas there are many (77 known to be less than {{convert|10|keV|abbr=on}}) low-energy nuclear transitions (e.g., the {{convert|7.6|eV|abbr=on}} nuclear transition of [[thorium]]-229), and, despite being one million-fold less energetic than some muonic X-rays, the emitted photons are still called gamma rays due to their nuclear origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ems3.html#c5 |title=Gamma-Rays |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>\n\nThe convention that EM radiation that is known to come from the nucleus, is always called \"gamma ray\" radiation is the only convention that is universally respected, however. Many astronomical [[gamma ray]] sources (such as [[gamma ray burst]]s) are known to be too energetic (in both intensity and wavelength) to be of nuclear origin. Quite often, in high energy physics and in medical radiotherapy, very high energy EMR (in the >10 MeV region)\u2014which is of higher energy than any nuclear gamma ray\u2014is not called X-ray or gamma-ray, but instead by the generic term of \"high energy photons.\"\n\nThe region of the spectrum where a particular observed electromagnetic radiation falls, is [[Frame of reference|reference frame]]-dependent (due to the [[Doppler shift]] for light), so EM radiation that one observer would say is in one region of the spectrum could appear to an observer moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light with respect to the first to be in another part of the spectrum. For example, consider the [[cosmic microwave background]]. It was produced, when matter and radiation decoupled, by the de-excitation of hydrogen atoms to the ground state. These photons were from [[Lyman series]] transitions, putting them in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Now this radiation has undergone enough cosmological [[red shift]] to put it into the microwave region of the spectrum for observers moving slowly (compared to the speed of light) with respect to the cosmos.\n\n===Rationale for names===\nElectromagnetic radiation interacts with matter in different ways across the spectrum. These types of interaction are so different that historically different names have been applied to different parts of the spectrum, as though these were different types of radiation. Thus, although these \"different kinds\" of electromagnetic radiation form a quantitatively continuous spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths, the spectrum remains divided for practical reasons related to these qualitative interaction differences.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:70%; font-size:95%;\n|+Electromagnetic radiation interaction with matter\n|-\n!

In artificial generation of radio waves, an electronic device called a [[transmitter]] generates an [[alternating current|AC]] [[electric current]] which is applied to an antenna.  The oscillating electrons in the antenna generate oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s that radiate away from the antenna as radio waves.  In reception of radio waves, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of a radio wave couple to the electrons in an antenna, pushing them back and forth, creating oscillating currents which are applied to a [[radio receiver]].  Earth's atmosphere is mainly transparent to radio waves, except for layers of charged particles in the [[ionosphere]] which can reflect certain frequencies.\n\nRadio waves are extremely widely used to transmit information across distances in [[radio communication]] systems such as [[radio broadcasting]], [[television]], [[two way radio]]s,  [[mobile phone]]s, [[communication satellite]]s, and [[wireless networking]].  In a radio communication system, a radio frequency current is [[modulation|modulated]] with an information-bearing [[signal]] in a transmitter by varying either the amplitude, frequency or phase, and applied to an antenna.  The radio waves carry the information across space to a receiver, where they are received by an antenna and the information extracted by [[demodulation]] in the receiver.     Radio waves are also used for navigation in systems like [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and [[navigational beacon]]s, and locating distant objects in [[radiolocation]] and [[radar]].  They are also used for [[remote control]], and for industrial heating.\n\nThe use of the [[radio spectrum]] is strictly regulated by governments, coordinated by a body called the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) which [[frequency allocation|allocates frequencies]] to different users for different uses.\n\n===Microwaves===\n{{Main article|Microwaves}}\n[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|right|350px|Plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.]]\n\n[[Microwave]]s are radio waves of short [[wavelength]], from about 10 centimeters to one millimeter, in the [[super-high frequency|SHF]] and [[extremely high frequency|EHF]] frequency bands.   Microwave energy is produced with [[klystron]] and [[magnetron]] tubes, and with [[Solid-state electronics|solid state]] devices such as [[Gunn diode|Gunn]] and [[IMPATT diode]]s.  Although they are emitted and absorbed by short antennas, they are also absorbed by [[polar molecule]]s, coupling to vibrational and rotational modes, resulting in bulk heating.  Unlike higher frequency waves such as [[infrared]] and [[light]] which are absorbed mainly at surfaces, microwaves can penetrate into materials and deposit their energy below the surface.   This effect is used to heat food in [[microwave oven]]s, and for industrial heating and medical [[diathermy]].    Microwaves are the main wavelengths used in [[radar]], and are used for [[satellite communication]], and [[wireless networking]] technologies such as [[Wifi]], although this is at intensity levels unable to cause thermal heating. The copper cables ([[transmission line]]s) which are used to carry lower frequency radio waves to antennas have excessive power losses at microwave frequencies, and metal pipes called [[waveguide]]s are used to carry them.  Although at the low end of the band the atmosphere is mainly transparent, at the upper end of the band absorption of microwaves by atmospheric gasses limits practical propagation distances to a few kilometers.\n\n===Terahertz radiation===\n{{Main article|Terahertz radiation}}\n\nTerahertz radiation is a region of the spectrum between far infrared and microwaves. Until recently, the range was rarely studied and few sources existed for microwave energy at the high end of the band (sub-millimeter waves or so-called [[terahertz radiation|terahertz waves]]), but applications such as imaging and communications are now appearing. Scientists are also looking to apply terahertz technology in the armed forces, where high-frequency waves might be directed at enemy troops to incapacitate their electronic equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Advanced weapon systems using lethal Short-pulse terahertz radiation from high-intensity-laser-produced plasmas |date=March 6, 2005 |url=http://www.indiadaily.com/editorial/1803.asp |work=India Daily |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106223741/http://indiadaily.com/editorial/1803.asp |archivedate=6 January 2010 }}</ref>  Terahertz radiation is strongly absorbed by atmospheric gases, making this frequency range useless for long distance communication.\n\n===Infrared radiation===\n{{Main article|Infrared radiation}}\nThe [[infrared]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from roughly 300&nbsp;GHz to 400 THz (1&nbsp;mm - 750&nbsp;nm). It can be divided into three parts:<ref name=\"em-spectrum\"/>\n*'''Far-infrared''', from 300&nbsp;GHz to 30 THz (1&nbsp;mm \u2013 10 \u03bcm). The lower part of this range may also be called microwaves or terahertz waves. This radiation is typically absorbed by so-called rotational modes in gas-phase molecules, by molecular motions in liquids, and by [[phonons]] in solids. The water in Earth's atmosphere absorbs so strongly in this range that it renders the atmosphere in effect opaque. However, there are certain wavelength ranges (\"windows\") within the opaque range that allow partial transmission, and can be used for astronomy. The wavelength range from approximately 200 \u03bcm up to a few mm is often referred to as [[Submillimetre astronomy|\"sub-millimeter\" in astronomy]], reserving far infrared for wavelengths below 200 \u03bcm.\n*'''Mid-infrared''', from 30 to 120 THz (10\u20132.5 \u03bcm). Hot objects ([[black-body]] radiators) can radiate strongly in this range, and human skin at normal body temperature radiates strongly at the lower end of this region. This radiation is absorbed by molecular vibrations, where the different atoms in a molecule vibrate around their equilibrium positions. This range is sometimes called the ''fingerprint region'', since the mid-infrared absorption spectrum of a compound is very specific for that compound.\n*'''Near-infrared''', from 120 to 400 THz (2,500\u2013750&nbsp;nm). Physical processes that are relevant for this range are similar to those for visible light. The highest frequencies in this region can be detected directly by some types of photographic film, and by many types of solid state [[image sensor]]s for [[infrared photography]] and videography.\n\n===Visible radiation (light)===\n{{Main article|Visible spectrum}}\nAbove infrared in frequency comes [[visible light]]. The [[Sun]] emits its peak power in the visible region, although integrating the entire emission power spectrum through all wavelengths shows that the Sun emits slightly more infrared than visible light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance:  Air Mass 1.5|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> By definition, visible light is the part of the EM spectrum the [[luminosity function|human eye]] is the most sensitive to. Visible light (and near-infrared light) is typically absorbed and emitted by electrons in molecules and atoms that move from one energy level to another. This action allows the chemical mechanisms that underlie human vision and plant photosynthesis. The light that excites the human [[visual system]] is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. A [[rainbow]] shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if it could be seen) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow with [[ultraviolet]] appearing just beyond the violet end.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation with a [[wavelength]] between 380 [[nanometre|nm]] and 760&nbsp;nm (400\u2013790 terahertz) is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially near infrared (longer than 760&nbsp;nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 380&nbsp;nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when the visibility to humans is not relevant. White light is a combination of lights of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Passing white light through a prism splits it up into the several colors of light observed in the visible spectrum between 400&nbsp;nm and 780&nbsp;nm.\n\nIf radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes the eyes, this results in [[visual perception]] of the scene. The brain's visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this insufficiently-understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses. Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. [[Optical fiber]] transmits light that, although not necessarily in the visible part of the spectrum (it is usually infrared), can carry information. The modulation is similar to that used with radio waves.\n\n===Ultraviolet radiation===\n{{Main article|Ultraviolet}}\n[[File:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|right|thumb|The amount of penetration of UV relative to altitude in Earth's [[ozone layer|ozone]]]]\nNext in frequency comes [[ultraviolet]] (UV). The wavelength of UV rays is shorter than the violet end of the [[visible spectrum]] but longer than the X-ray.\n\nUV is the longest wavelength radiation whose photons are energetic enough to [[ionization|ionize]] atoms, separating [[electron]]s from them, and thus causing [[chemical reaction]]s.  Short wavelength UV and the shorter wavelength radiation above it (X-rays and gamma rays) are called ''[[ionizing radiation]]'', and exposure to them can damage living tissue, making them a health hazard.  UV can also cause many substances to glow with visible light; this is called ''[[fluorescence]]''.\n\nAt the middle range of UV, UV rays cannot ionize but can break chemical bonds, making molecules unusually reactive. [[Sunburn]], for example, is caused by the disruptive effects of middle range UV radiation on [[Human skin|skin]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], which is the main cause of [[skin cancer]]. UV rays in the middle range can irreparably damage the complex [[DNA]] molecules in the cells producing [[thymine dimers]] making it a very potent [[mutagen]].\n\nThe Sun emits significant UV radiation (about 10% of its total power), including extremely short wavelength UV that could potentially destroy most life on land (ocean water would provide some protection for life there). However, most of the Sun's damaging UV wavelengths are absorbed by the atmosphere before they reach the surface. The higher energy (shortest wavelength) ranges of UV (called \"vacuum UV\") are absorbed by nitrogen and, at longer wavelengths, by simple diatomic [[oxygen]] in the air. Most of the UV in the mid-range of energy is blocked by the ozone layer, which absorbs strongly in the important 200\u2013315&nbsp;nm range, the lower energy part of which is too long for ordinary [[dioxygen]] in air to absorb. This leaves less than 3% of sunlight at sea level in UV, with all of this remainder at the lower energies. The remainder is UV-A, along with some UV-B. The very lowest energy range of UV between 315&nbsp;nm and visible light (called UV-A) is not blocked well by the atmosphere, but does not cause sunburn and does less biological damage. However, it is not harmless and does create oxygen radicals, mutations and skin damage. See [[ultraviolet]] for more information.\n\n===X-rays===\n{{Main article|X-rays}}\nAfter UV come [[X-ray]]s, which, like the upper ranges of UV are also ionizing. However, due to their higher energies, X-rays can also interact with matter by means of the [[Compton scattering|Compton effect]]. Hard X-rays have shorter wavelengths than soft X-rays and as they can pass through many substances with little absorption, they can be used to 'see through' objects with 'thicknesses' less than that equivalent to a few meters of water. One notable use is diagnostic X-ray imaging in medicine (a process known as [[radiography]]). X-rays are useful as probes in high-energy physics. In astronomy, the accretion disks around [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s emit X-rays, enabling studies of these phenomena. X-rays are also emitted by the [[corona]]s of stars and are strongly emitted by some types of [[nebulae]]. However, [[X-ray telescope]]s must be placed outside the Earth's atmosphere to see astronomical X-rays, since the great depth of the [[atmosphere of Earth]] is opaque to X-rays (with areal density of 1000 grams per cm<sup>2</sup>), equivalent to 10 meters thickness of water.<ref>Koontz, Steve (26 June 2012) [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120012405.pdf Designing Spacecraft and Mission Operations Plans to Meet Flight Crew Radiation Dose]. NASA/MIT Workshop. See pages I-7 (atmosphere) and I-23 (for water).</ref> This is an amount sufficient to block almost all astronomical X-rays (and also astronomical gamma rays\u2014see below).\n\n===Gamma rays===\n{{Main article|Gamma rays}}\nAfter hard X-rays come [[gamma rays]], which were discovered by [[Paul Ulrich Villard]] in 1900. These are the most energetic [[photons]], having no defined lower limit to their wavelength. In [[astronomy]] they are valuable for studying high-energy objects or regions, however as with X-rays this can only be done with telescopes outside the Earth's atmosphere. Gamma rays are used experimentally by physicists for their penetrating ability and are produced by a number of  [[radioisotopes]]. They are used for [[irradiation]] of foods and seeds for sterilization, and in medicine they are occasionally used in [[Radiation oncology|radiation cancer therapy]].<ref>[http://www.revisionworld.com/gcse-revision/physics/waves/uses-electromagnetic-waves Uses of Electromagnetic Waves | gcse-revision, physics, waves, uses-electromagnetic-waves | Revision World<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> More commonly, gamma rays are used for diagnostic imaging in [[nuclear medicine]], an example being [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]]. The wavelength of gamma rays can be measured with high accuracy through the effects of [[Compton scattering]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar |Electromagnetism |Electronics |Telecommunication}}\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bandplan]]\n*[[Cosmic ray]]\n*[[Digital dividend after digital television transition]]\n*[[Electroencephalography]]\n*[[Infrared window]]\n*[[Ionizing radiation]]\n*[[List of international common standards]]\n*[[Optical window]]\n*[[Ozone layer]]\n*[[Radiant energy]]\n*[[Radiation]]\n*[[Radio window]]\n*[[Spectroscopy]]\n*[[V band]]\n*[[W band]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n*[http://www.unwantedemissions.com/ UnwantedEmissions.com] (U.S. radio spectrum allocations resource)\n*[http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/radcomm/frequency_planning/spectrum_plan/arsp-wc.pdf Australian Radiofrequency Spectrum Allocations Chart] (from Australian Communications and Media Authority)\n*[http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/spectallocation-08.pdf/$FILE/spectallocation-08.pdf Canadian Table of Frequency Allocations] (from [[Industry Canada]])\n*[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/allochrt.html U.S. Frequency Allocation Chart] \u2014 Covering the range 3&nbsp;kHz to 300&nbsp;GHz (from [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]])\n*[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/ra/topics/spectrum-strat/future/strat02/strategy02app_b.pdf UK frequency allocation table] (from [[Ofcom]], which inherited the [[Radiocommunications Agency]]'s duties, pdf format)\n*[http://attic.e-motiv.net/em-spectrum Flash EM Spectrum Presentation / Tool] \u2013 Very complete and customizable.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090104154951/http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/optics/rendering.html#CIEdiag/ How to render the color spectrum / Code] \u2013 Only approximately right.\n*[http://unihedron.com/projects/spectrum/downloads/spectrum_20090210.pdf Poster \"Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum\"] (992 kB)\n*[http://prezi.com/3qp57ddr0fmw/electromagnetic-spectrum/ Electromagnetic Spectrum presentation]\n*[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo46210 Electromagnetic Spectrum Strategy:  A Call to Action] [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]\n\n{{Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n{{Color topics}}\n\n[[Category:Electromagnetic spectrum| ]]\n[[Category:Waves]]", "sha1": "94jmedvpy47zp3u8qsw0tw5imw5j9y8"}}, {"title": "Expert system", "ns": "0", "id": "10136", "revision": {"id": "866031506", "parentid": "859502214", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T20:38:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bernd.Brincken", "id": "10975165"}, "comment": "/* History */ 1965 & ref", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Symbolics3640 Modified.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|A [[Symbolics]] Lisp Machine: an early platform for expert systems.]]\n\nIn [[artificial intelligence]], an '''expert system''' is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.<ref name=\"Jackson1998\">{{Citation |title= Introduction To Expert Systems |year= 1998 |publisher= Addison Wesley |edition= 3 |last= Jackson |first= Peter |isbn= 978-0-201-87686-4 |page= 2}}</ref>\nExpert systems are designed to solve complex problems by [[automated reasoning|reasoning]] through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as [[Rule-based system|if\u2013then rules]] rather than through conventional [[Procedural programming|procedural code]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=conventional+programming&i=40325,00.asp |title=Conventional programming |publisher=Pcmag.com |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref> The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s.<ref name=\"durkinhistory\">{{cite book |first= Cornelius T. |last= Leondes |title= Expert systems: the technology of knowledge management and decision making for the 21st century |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-12-443880-4 |pages= 1\u201322}}</ref> Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) software.<ref name=\"Simon & Schuster\">{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|date=1995|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-13-103805-2|pages=22\u201323|url=http://stpk.cs.rtu.lv/sites/all/files/stpk/materiali/MI/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf|access-date=14 June 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227\u2013331}}{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=327\u2013335, 434\u2013435}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=145\u201362, 197\u2212203}}\n\nAn expert system is divided into two subsystems: the [[inference engine]] and the [[knowledge base]]. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.<ref>[http://www.hrmars.com/admin/pics/261.pdf Nwigbo Stella and Agbo Okechuku Chuks], School of Science Education, Expert system: a catalyst in educational development in Nigeria: \"''Knowledge-based systems collect the small fragments of human know-how into a knowledge-base which is used to reason through a problem, using the knowledge that is appropriated''\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nExpert systems were introduced around 1965<ref>[http://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/bio3/AI/TIMELINE/timeline.html kenyon.edu: AI Timeline], retrieved October 27, 2018</ref> by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by [[Edward Feigenbaum]], who is sometimes termed the \"father of expert systems\"; other key early contributors were Bruce Buchanan and Randall Davis. The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex, such as diagnosing infectious diseases ([[Mycin]]) and identifying unknown organic molecules ([[Dendral]]).

While in the US the focus tended to be on rule-based systems, first on systems hard coded on top of [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as [[IntelliCorp (software)|Intellicorp]], in France research focused more on systems developed in [[Prolog]]. The advantage of expert system shells was that they were somewhat easier for nonprogrammers to use.  The advantage of Prolog environments was that they weren't focused only on ''if-then'' rules; Prolog environments provided a much fuller realization of a complete [[First Order Logic]] environment.<ref>George F. Luger and William A. Stubblefield, Benjamin/Cummings Publishers, Rule Based Expert System Shell: example of code using the Prolog rule based expert system shell</ref><ref>[http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/engdep1/download/prolog/htm_docs/prolog.htm A.

Universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the [[Fortune 500]] companies applied the technology in daily business activities.<ref name=durkinhistory/><ref>Durkin, J. Expert Systems: Catalog of Applications. Intelligent Computer Systems, Inc., Akron, OH, 1993.</ref> Interest was international with the [[Fifth generation computer|Fifth Generation Computer Systems project]] in Japan and increased research funding in Europe.\n\nIn 1981, the first [[IBM PC]], with the [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] operating system, was introduced. The imbalance between the high affordability of the relatively powerful chips in the PC, compared to the much more expensive cost of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time, created a new type of architecture for corporate computing, termed the [[client-server model]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Orfali|first=Robert|title=The Essential Client/Server Survival Guide|year=1996|publisher=Wiley Computer Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-471-15325-7|pages=1\u201310}}</ref>  Calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe using a PC. This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications. As a result, client server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market. Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world, requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop. They were a natural fit for new PC-based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts. Until then, the main development environment for expert systems had been high end [[Lisp machine]]s from [[Xerox]], [[Symbolics]], and [[Texas Instruments]]. With the rise of the PC and client server computing, vendors such as Intellicorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC based tools. Also, new vendors, often financed by [[venture capital]] (such as Aion Corporation, [[Neuron Data]], Exsys, and many others<ref>{{cite book|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|title=Smart or Lucky: How Technology Leaders Turn Chance into Success|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Son|isbn=1118033787|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KrTQzQHl7AC&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=expert+systems+failed+to+live+up+to+hype#v=onepage&q=expert%20systems%20failed%20to%20live%20up%20to%20hype&f=false|access-date=29 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=Dunn |date=September 30, 1985 |title=Expandable Expertise for Everyday Users |page=30 |journal=InfoWorld |volume=7 |issue=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iS8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30 |access-date=2011-03-13}}</ref>), started appearing regularly.\n\nThe first expert system to be used in a design capacity for a large-scale product was the SID (Synthesis of Integral Design) software program, developed in 1982. Written in [[LISP]], SID generated 93% of the [[VAX 9000]] CPU logic gates.<ref name=\"SIDDTJ\">Carl S. Gibson, et al, VAX 9000 SERIES, Digital Technical Journal of Digital Equipment Corporation, Volume 2, Number 4, Fall 1990, pp118-129.</ref> Input to the software was a set of rules created by several expert logic designers. SID expanded the rules and generated software [[logic synthesis]] routines many times the size of the rules themselves. Surprisingly, the combination of these rules resulted in an overall design that exceeded the capabilities of the experts themselves, and in many cases out-performed the human counterparts.  While some rules contradicted others, top-level control parameters for speed and area provided the tie-breaker. The program was highly controversial, but used nevertheless due to project budget constraints. It was terminated by logic designers after the VAX 9000 project completion.\n\nIn the 1990s and beyond, the term ''expert system'' and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon. There are two interpretations of this. One is that \"expert systems failed\": the IT world moved on because expert systems didn't deliver on their over hyped promise.<ref>[http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0501.htm#w AI Expert Newsletter: W is for Winter]</ref><ref>[http://ejlt.org//article/view/14/1 Leith P., \"The rise and fall of the legal expert system\", in European Journal of Law and Technology, Vol 1, Issue 1, 2010]</ref> The other is the mirror opposite, that expert systems were simply victims of their success: as IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines, such tools migrated from being standalone tools for developing special purpose ''expert'' systems, to being one of many standard tools.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haskin|first=David|title=Years After Hype, 'Expert Systems' Paying Off For Some|journal=Datamation|date=January 16, 2003|url=http://www.datamation.com/netsys/article.php/1570851/Years-After-Hype-Expert-Systems-Paying-Off-For-Some.htm|access-date=29 November 2013}}</ref>  Many of the leading major business application suite vendors (such as [[SAP (software)|SAP]], [[Siebel Systems|Siebel]], and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) integrated expert system abilities into their suite of products as a way of specifying business logic \u2013 rule engines are no longer simply for defining the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex, volatile, and critical business logic; they often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments.<ref>{{cite web|last=SAP News Desk|title=SAP News Desk IntelliCorp Announces Participation in SAP EcoHub|url=http://laszlo.sys-con.com/node/946452|work=laszlo.sys-con.com |publisher=LaszloTrack|access-date=29 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Pegasystems|title=Smart BPM Requires Smart Business Rules|url=http://www.pega.com/business-rules |work=pega.com|access-date=29 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |last=Zhao |first=Kai |first2=Shi |last2=Ying |first3=Linlin |last3=Zhang |first4=Luokai |last4=Hu |title=Achieving business process and business rules integration using SPL |book-title=Future Information Technology and Management Engineering (FITME) |date=9\u201310 Oct 2010 |volume=2 |pages=329\u2013332 |location=Changzhou, China |publisher=IEEE |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656297&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5656297 |doi=10.1109/fitme.2010.5656297 |isbn=978-1-4244-9087-5}}</ref>\n\n== Software architecture ==\nAn expert system is an example of a [[knowledge-based system]]. Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture. A knowledge-based system is essentially composed of two sub-systems: the [[knowledge base]] and the [[inference engine]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Reid |title=Knowledge-Based Systems Concepts, Techniques, Examples |url=http://www.reidgsmith.com/Knowledge-Based_Systems_-_Concepts_Techniques_Examples_08-May-1985.pdf |website=Reid G. Smith |access-date=9 November 2013|date=May 8, 1985}}</ref>\n\nThe knowledge base represents facts about the world. In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral, these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables. In later expert systems developed with commercial shells, the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object-oriented programming. The world was represented as classes, subclasses, and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances. The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects.\n\nThe inference engine is an [[automated reasoning system]] that evaluates the current state of the knowledge-base, applies relevant rules, and then asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base. The inference engine may also include abilities for explanation, so that it can explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted in the assertion.<ref name=\"Hayes-Roth 1983\">{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}</ref>\n\nThere are mainly two modes for an inference engine: [[forward chaining]] and [[backward chaining]]. The different approaches are dictated by whether the inference engine is being driven by the antecedent (left hand side) or the consequent (right hand side) of the rule. In forward chaining an antecedent fires and asserts the consequent. For example, consider the following rule:\n\n<math>R1: \\mathit{Man}(x) => \\mathit{Mortal}(x)</math>\n\nA simple example of forward chaining would be to assert Man(Socrates) to the system and then trigger the inference engine. It would match R1 and assert Mortal(Socrates) into the knowledge base.\n\nBackward chaining is a bit less straight forward. In backward chaining the system looks at possible conclusions and works backward to see if they might be true. So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true. One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface. This could be especially powerful with backward chaining. If the system needs to know a particular fact but doesn't, then it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known. So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.\n\nThe use of rules to explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities. In the simple example above if the system had used R1 to assert that Socrates was Mortal and a user wished to understand why Socrates was mortal they could query the system and the system would look back at the rules which fired to cause the assertion and present those rules to the user as an explanation. In English if the user asked \"Why is Socrates Mortal?\" the system would reply \"Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man\".  A significant area for research was the generation of explanations from the knowledge base in natural English rather than simply by showing the more formal but less intuitive rules.<ref>[http://www.ccis2k.org/iajit/PDF/vol.4,no.1/9-Nabil.pdf Nabil Arman], Polytechnic University of Palestine, January 2007, Fault Detection in Dynamic Rule Bases Using Spanning Trees and Disjoin Sets: \"\"</ref>\n\nAs expert systems evolved, many new techniques were incorporated into various types of inference engines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8 |issue= 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}</ref> Some of the most important of these were:\n\n* Truth maintenance. These systems record the dependencies in a knowledge-base so that when facts are altered, dependent knowledge can be altered accordingly. For example, if the system learns that Socrates is no longer known to be a man it will revoke the assertion that Socrates is mortal.\n* Hypothetical reasoning. In this, the knowledge base can be divided up into many possible views, a.k.a. worlds. This allows the inference engine to explore multiple possibilities in parallel. For example, the system may want to explore the consequences of both assertions, what will be true if Socrates is a Man and what will be true if he is not?\n* Fuzzy logic. One of the first extensions of simply using rules to represent knowledge was also to associate a probability with each rule. So, not to assert that Socrates is mortal, but to assert Socrates ''may'' be mortal with some probability value. Simple probabilities were extended in some systems with sophisticated mechanisms for uncertain reasoning and combination of probabilities.\n* Ontology classification. With the addition of object classes to the knowledge base, a new type of reasoning was possible. Along with reasoning simply about object values, the system could also reason about object structures. In this simple example, Man can represent an object class and R1 can be redefined as a rule that defines the class of all men.  These types of special purpose inference engines are termed [[Deductive classifier|classifiers]]. Although they were not highly used in expert systems, classifiers are very powerful for unstructured volatile domains, and are a key technology for the Internet and the emerging [[Semantic Web]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87683&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|access-date=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41\u201346}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34\u201343|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Advantages  ==\nThe goal of knowledge-based systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|page=6|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}</ref>  In a traditional computer program the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist. With an expert system the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood, reviewed, and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts. The benefits of this explicit knowledge representation were rapid development and ease of maintenance.\n\nEase of maintenance is the most obvious benefit. This was achieved in two ways. First, by removing the need to write conventional code, many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems.  Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine. This also was a reason for the second benefit: [[rapid prototyping]]. With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.\n\nA claim for expert system shells that was often made was that they removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves. In reality, this was seldom if ever true. While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code, they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language. Also, as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world, issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical. Inevitably demands to integrate with, and take advantage of, large legacy databases and systems arose. To accomplish this, integration required the same skills as any other type of system.<ref name=\"Wong 1995 141\u2013152\">{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Bo K.|first2=John A.|last3=Monaco|title=Expert system applications in business: a review and analysis of the literature|journal=Information and Management|date=September 1995|volume=29|issue=3|pages=141\u2013152|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218565&CFID=383824649&CFTOKEN=44575196|access-date=29 November 2013|doi=10.1016/0378-7206(95)00023-p|last2=Monaco}}</ref>\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nThe most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the [[knowledge acquisition]] problem. Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult, but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization. As a result of this problem, a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition, to help automate the process of designing, debugging, and maintaining rules defined by experts. However, when looking at the life-cycle of expert systems in actual use, other problems \u2013 essentially the same problems as those of any other large system \u2013 seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition: integration, access to large databases, and performance.<ref>{{citation\n |last= Kendal |first= S.L. |last2= Creen |first2= M.\n |title= An introduction to knowledge engineering |year= 2007 |publisher= Springer\n |location= London |isbn= 978-1-84628-475-5 |oclc= 70987401}}</ref><ref name=\"Feigenbaum1983\">{{citation\n |last= Feigenbaum |first= Edward A. |last2= McCorduck |first2= Pamela |authorlink= Edward Feigenbaum |authorlink2= Pamela McCorduck\n |title= The fifth generation |edition= 1st |year= 1983 |publisher= [[Addison-Wesley]]\n |location= Reading, MA |isbn= 978-0-201-11519-2 |oclc= 9324691}}</ref>\n\nPerformance could be especially problematic because early expert systems were built using tools (such as earlier Lisp versions) that interpreted code expressions without first compiling them. This provided a powerful development environment, but with the drawback that it was virtually impossible to match the efficiency of the fastest compiled languages (such as [[C (programming language)|C]]). System and database integration were difficult for early expert systems because the tools were mostly in languages and platforms that were neither familiar to nor welcome in most corporate IT environments \u2013 programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog, and hardware platforms such as [[Lisp machine]]s and personal computers. As a result, much effort in the later stages of expert system tool development was focused on integrating with legacy environments such as [[COBOL]] and large database systems, and on porting to more standard platforms. These issues were resolved mainly by the client-server paradigm shift, as PCs were gradually accepted in the IT environment as a legitimate platform for serious business system development and as affordable [[minicomputer]] servers provided the processing power needed for AI applications.<ref name=\"Wong 1995 141\u2013152\"/>\n\n== Applications ==\nHayes-Roth divides expert systems applications into 10 categories illustrated in the following table. The example applications were not in the original Hayes-Roth table, and some of them arose well afterward. Any application that is not footnoted is described in the Hayes-Roth book.<ref name=\"Hayes-Roth 1983\"/> Also, while these categories provide an intuitive framework to describe the space of expert systems applications, they are not rigid categories, and in some cases an application may show traits of more than one category.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

His mother, the [[Catherine Willoughby|Duchess of Suffolk]], wrote to Lord Burghley that \"my wise son has gone very far with my Lady Mary Vere, I fear too far to turn\". Both the Duchess and her husband [[Richard Bertie (courtier)|Richard Bertie]] first opposed the marriage, and the Queen initially withheld her consent.

De&nbsp;Vere was sympathetic to the proposed marriage; Leicester and his nephew Philip Sidney were adamantly opposed to it. This antagonism may have triggered the famous quarrel between de&nbsp;Vere and Sidney on the tennis court at Whitehall. It is not entirely clear who was playing on the court when the fight erupted; what is undisputed is that de&nbsp;Vere called Sidney a 'puppy', while Sidney responded that \"all the world knows puppies are gotten by dogs, and children by men\". The French ambassadors, whose private galleries overlooked the tennis court, were witness to the display. Whether it was Sidney who next challenged de&nbsp;Vere to a duel or the other way around, de&nbsp;Vere did not take it further, and the Queen personally took Sidney to task for not recognizing the difference between his status and de&nbsp;Vere's.

[[Virgil]], probably working from an [[Alexandria]]n source, recognized three: [[Alecto]] or Alekto (\"endless\"), [[Megaera]] (\"jealous rage\"), and [[Tisiphone]] or Tilphousia (\"vengeful destruction\"), all of whom appear in the ''[[Aeneid]]''. [[Dante Alighieri]] followed Virgil in depicting the same three-character [[triptych]] of Erinyes; in Canto IX of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' they confront the poets at the gates of the city of [[Dis (Divine Comedy)|Dis]]. Whilst the Erinyes were usually described as three maiden goddesses, the Erinys Telphousia was usually a by-name for the wrathful goddess [[Demeter]], who was worshipped under the title of Erinys in the Arkadian town of Thelpousa.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''Erinyes'' is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''orinein'', \"to raise, stir, excite\", and the noun \u1f14\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 ''[[Eris (mythology)|eris]]'', \"strife\" have been suggested; Beekes, pp.&nbsp;458&ndash;459, has proposed a [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Greek origin]]. The word ''Erinys'' in the [[grammatical number|singular]] and as a [[theonym]] is first attested in [[Mycenaean Greek]], written in [[Linear B]], in the following forms: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc01\ud800\udc2a\ud800\udc1d}}, ''e-ri-nu'', and  {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc01\ud800\udc2a\ud800\udc1d\ud800\udc38}}, ''e-ri-nu-we''.

Their task is to hear complaints brought by mortals against the insolence of the young to the aged, of children to parents, of [[Xenia (Greek)|hosts to guests]], and of householders or city councils to suppliants\u2014and to punish such crimes by hounding culprits relentlessly. The Erinyes are [[crone]]s and, depending upon authors, described as having snakes for hair, dog's heads, coal black bodies, bat's wings, and blood-shot eyes. In their hands they carry brass-studded scourges, and their victims die in torment.<ref name=Graves122>Graves, pp. 122&ndash;123.</ref>\n\n==Three sisters==\nAccording to legend, the three classic Furies sprang forth from the spilled blood of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] when he was castrated by his son [[Cronus]].  The sisters are:\n* [[Alecto]] \u2013 Punisher of moral crimes (anger, etc.)\n* [[Megaera]] \u2013 Punisher of infidelity, oath breakers, and theft\n* [[Tisiphone]] \u2013 Punisher of murderers\n\n==Cult==\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] describe a sanctuary in Athens dedicated to the Erinyes under the name Semnai: \n:\"Hard by [the Areopagos the murder court of Athens] is a sanctuary of the goddesses which the Athenians call the August, but Hesiod in the Theogony calls them Erinyes (Furies). It was Aeschylus who first represented them with snakes in their hair. But on the images neither of these nor of any of the under-world deities is there anything terrible.

The Erinyes are featured prominently in the myth of [[Orestes]], which recurs frequently throughout many works of [[ancient Greek literature]]. \n \n===Aeschylus===\nFeatured in ancient Greek literature, from poems to plays, the Erinyes form the Chorus and play a major role in the conclusion of [[Aeschylus]]'s dramatic trilogy the ''[[Oresteia]]''. In the first play, ''[[Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', King [[Agamemnon]] returns home from the [[Trojan War]], where he is slain by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], who wants vengeance for her daughter [[Iphigenia]], who was sacrificed by Agamemnon in order to obtain favorable winds to sail to Troy. In the second play, ''[[Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'', their son [[Orestes]] has reached manhood and has been commanded by [[Apollo]]'s oracle to avenge his father's murder at his mother\u2019s hand. Returning home and revealing himself to his sister [[Electra]], Orestes pretends to be a messenger bringing the news of his own death to Clytemnestra. He then slays his mother and her lover [[Aegisthus]]. Although Orestes\u2019 actions were what Apollo had commanded him to do, Orestes has still committed matricide, a grave sacrilege.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Trousdell|first1=Richard|title=Tragedy and Transformation: The Oresteia of Aeschylus|journal=Jung Journal|volume=2|issue=3|pages=5\u201338|jstor=10.1525/jung.2008.2.3.5|doi=10.1525/jung.2008.2.3.5|year=2008}}</ref> Because of this, he is pursued and tormented by the terrible Erinyes, who demand yet further blood vengeance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Henrichs|first1=Albert|title=Anonymity and Polarity: Unknown Gods and Nameless Altars at the Areopagos|journal=Illinois Classical Studies|volume=19|pages=27\u201358|jstor=23065418|year=1994}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Deux furies.png|thumb|left|upright|Two Furies, from a nineteenth-century book reproducing an image from an ancient vase.]]\n\nIn ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]'', Orestes is told by Apollo at [[Delphi]] that he should go to [[Athens]] to seek the aid of the goddess [[Athena]]. In Athens, Athena arranges for Orestes to be tried by a jury of Athenian citizens, with her presiding. The Erinyes appear as Orestes' accusers, while Apollo speaks in his defense. The trial becomes a debate about the necessity of blood vengeance, the honor that is due to a mother compared to that due to a father, and the respect that must be paid to ancient deities such as the Erinyes compared to the newer generation of Apollo and Athena. The jury vote is evenly split. Athena participates in the vote and chooses for acquittal. Athena declares Orestes acquitted because of the rules she established for the trial.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hester|first1=D.

Athena, however, offers the ancient goddesses a new role, as protectors of justice, rather than vengeance, and of the city. She persuades them to break the cycle of blood for blood (except in the case of war, which is fought for glory, not vengeance). While promising that the goddesses will receive due honor from the Athenians and Athena, she also reminds them that she possesses the key to the storehouse where [[Zeus]] keeps the thunderbolts that defeated the other older deities. This mixture of bribes and veiled threats satisfies the Erinyes, who are then led by Athena in a procession to their new abode. In the play, the \"Furies\" are thereafter addressed as \"Semnai\" (Venerable Ones), as they will now be honored by the citizens of Athens and ensure the city's prosperity.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite journal|last1=Mace|first1=Sarah|title=Why the Oresteia's Sleeping Dead Won't Lie, Part II: \"Choephoroi\" and \"Eumenides\"|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=100|issue=1|pages=39\u201360|jstor=4133005|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n===Euripides===\nIn [[Euripides]]' ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' the Erinyes are for the first time \"equated\" with the '''Eumenides'''<ref>Gantz, p. 832.</ref> (\u0395\u1f50\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, pl. of \u0395\u1f50\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03c2; literally \"the gracious ones\", but also translated as \"Kindly Ones\").<ref>''Suid''. s.v. \u1f0c\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b4' \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac</ref> This is because it was considered unwise to mention them by name (for fear of attracting their attention), the ironic name is similar to how [[Hades]], god of the dead is styled Pluton, or Pluto, \"the Rich One\".<ref name=Graves122 /> Using [[euphemisms]] for the names of deities serves many religious purposes.\n\n===Sophocles===\nIn [[Sophocles]]'s play, ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', it is significant that he comes to his final resting place in the grove dedicated to the Erinyes. It shows that he has paid his penance for his blood crime, as well as come to integrate the balancing powers to his early over-reliance upon Apollo, the god of the individual, the sun, and reason. He is asked to make an offering to the Erinyes and complies, having made his peace.{{Original research inline|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Modern references and literature==\n[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Remorse of Orestes (1862).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''The Remorse of [[Orestes]]'', where he is surrounded by the Erinyes, by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1862]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Erinyes persist as a theme that appears in modern literature as well as the subject of scholarly pursuits of mythology and ancient Greek culture. The Orestes theme becomes an important subject to scholars such as [[James George Frazer]] and [[Robert Graves]]. In ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', Graves translates and interprets the legends and myth fragments about Clytemnestra, Agamemnon, and Orestes, as suggesting a ritual killing of a ''\"king\"'' (Agamemnon) in very early religious ceremonies that were suppressed when [[patriarchy]] replaced the matriarchies of very ancient Greece. Graves asserts that the [[sacrilege]] for which the Erinyes pursued Orestes was the killing of his mother, who represented [[matriarchy]]. He explains that worship of [[Athena]] was retained as a cult because it was too strong to be suppressed, but she was ''recast'' as a child of Zeus in new myths, even given the previously incomprehensible role of justifying what would have been a horrific crime against the old religious customs. Graves, and many other mythographers, were influenced by ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' of Frazer, and since it was published many myths have been reinterpreted to reveal clues to ancient religious practices that were kept as secret rituals. They are mentioned in the poem \"To Brooklyn Bridge\" by [[Hart Crane]]. The Eumenides are also featured in [[T. S.

It was created on 4 January 1916 for [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|John Hamilton-Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen]].\n\n==Family history==\n\n===Baronetcy of Haddo===\nThe Gordon family descends from [[Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, of Haddo|John Gordon]], who fought as a Royalist against the [[Covenanter]]s in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1642 he was created a baronet, of [[Haddo House|Haddo]] in the County of Aberdeen, in the [[Baronetage of Nova Scotia]]. In 1644 he was found guilty of treason and beheaded, with the baronetcy forfeited. The title was restored after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] for his son John, the second Baronet.\n\n===Earldom of Aberdeen===\nThe second Baronet died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He was a noted advocate and served as [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] and as [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]]. On 30 November 1682 he was raised to the [[Peerage of Scotland]] as '''Lord Haddo, Methlick, Tarves and Kellie''', '''Viscount of Formartine''' and '''Earl of Aberdeen'''.{{sfn|Cokayne|1910|p=14}} He was succeeded by his only surviving son, the second Earl.

On 1 June 1814 he was created '''Viscount Gordon''', of [[Aberdeen]] in the [[County of Aberdeen]], in the Peerage of the United Kingdom,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=16909 |date=18 June 1814 |page=1255}}</ref> which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Aberdeen married firstly Lady Catherine Elizabeth (1784\u20131812), daughter of [[John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn]], and assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Hamilton in 1818.{{sfn|Cokayne|1910|p=16}} When he died the titles passed to his eldest son from his second marriage to Harriet Douglas, the fifth Earl. He sat as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire]]. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, was a sailor and adventurer.

His eldest son, [[Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (1859-1939)|Sir Alexander Hamilton-Gordon]] was also a general in the Army. Reverend the Hon. Douglas Hamilton-Gordon (1824\u20131901), third son of the second marriage of the fourth Earl, was Chaplain-in-Ordinary to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and Canon of [[Diocese of Salisbury|Salisbury]]. The Hon. [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Hamilton-Gordon]], fourth son of the second marriage of the fourth Earl, was a Liberal politician and was created [[Baron Stanmore]] in 1893 (see this title for more information on him and this branch of the family). [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair]], daughter of [[Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth]], and wife of the first Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, was an author, philanthropist and an advocate of woman's interests.\n\nThe family seat is [[Haddo House]], [[Aberdeenshire]]. The title Earl of Haddo is the [[courtesy title]] for the Marquess's eldest son and heir, the eldest son of whom uses the [[courtesy title]] Viscount of Formartine. The Marquesses of Aberdeen and Temair are related to the [[Marquess of Huntly|Marquesses of Huntly]]. Sir John Gordon (d. c. 1395) of Strathbogie, ancestor of Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, was the brother of Elizabeth Gordon. She married Sir Alexander Seton (d. 1438) and was the mother of [[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly]] (ancestor of the Marquesses of Huntly).\n\n==Gordon baronets, of Haddo (1642)==\n[[File:Plaque commemorating Lady Aberdeen (Ottawa, Ontario).jpg|right|thumb|230px|Memorial in [[Ottawa]] to [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Ishbel, Marchioness of Aberdeen]], wife of the first Marquess, who was [[Governor-General of Canada]] from 1893 to 1898.]]\n*[[Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, of Haddo|Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet]] (1610\u20131644)\n*[[Sir John Gordon, 2nd Baronet, of Haddo|Sir John Gordon, 2nd Baronet]] (c. 1632\u20131665)\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Earl of Aberdeen|Sir George Gordon, 3rd Baronet]] (1637\u20131720) (created '''Viscount of Formartine''' and '''Earl of Aberdeen''' in 1682)\n\n==Earls of Aberdeen (1682)==\n* [[George Gordon, 1st Earl of Aberdeen]], '''1st Viscount of Formartine''' (1637\u20131720)\n**George Gordon, Lord Haddo (1674-d. between 1694-1708)\n* [[William Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aberdeen]], '''2nd Viscount of Formartine''' (1679\u20131745)\n* [[George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen]], '''3rd Viscount of Formartine''' (1722\u20131801)\n**[[George Gordon, Lord Haddo]] (1764\u20131791)\n* [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen]], '''4th Viscount of Formartine''', '''1st Viscount Gordon''' (1784\u20131860) (Created '''Viscount Gordon''' in 1814)\n* [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|George John James Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen]], '''5th Viscount of Formartine''', '''2nd Viscount Gordon''' (1816\u20131864)\n* [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 6th Earl of Aberdeen]], '''6th Viscount of Formartine''', '''3rd Viscount Gordon''' (1841\u20131870)\n* [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|John Campbell Hamilton-Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen]], '''7th Viscount of Formartine''', '''4th Viscount Gordon''' (1847\u20131934) (created '''Earl of Haddo''' and '''Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair''' in 1916)\n\n==Marquesses of Aberdeen and Temair (1916)==\n* [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|John Campbell Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]], '''7th Earl of Aberdeen''', '''1st Earl of Haddo''', '''7th Viscount of Formartine''', '''4th Viscount Gordon''' (1847\u20131934)\n* [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]], '''8th Earl of Aberdeen''', '''2nd Earl of Haddo''', '''8th Viscount of Formartine''', '''5th Viscount Gordon''' (1879\u20131965)\n* [[Dudley Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Dudley Gladstone Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]], '''9th Earl of Aberdeen''', '''3rd Earl of Haddo''', '''9th Viscount of Formartine''', '''6th Viscount Gordon''' (1883\u20131972)\n* [[David Gordon, 4th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|David George Ian Alexander Gordon, 4th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]], '''10th Earl of Aberdeen''', '''4th Earl of Haddo''', '''10th Viscount of Formartine''', '''7th Viscount Gordon''' (1908\u20131974)\n* [[Archibald Gordon, 5th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Archibald Victor Dudley Gordon, 5th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]], '''11th Earl of Aberdeen''', '''5th Earl of Haddo''', '''11th Viscount of Formartine''', '''8th Viscount Gordon'''  (1913\u20131984)\n* [[Alastair Gordon, 6th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Alastair Ninian John Gordon, 6th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]], '''12th Earl of Aberdeen''', '''6th Earl of Haddo''', '''12th Viscount of Formartine''', '''9th Viscount Gordon''' (1920\u20132002)\n* [[Alexander Gordon, 7th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Alexander George Gordon, 7th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]], '''13th Earl of Aberdeen''', '''7th Earl of Haddo''', '''13th Viscount of Formartine''', '''10th Viscount Gordon''' (b. 1955)\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] is the present holder's son George Ian Alastair Gordon, Earl of Haddo (b. 1983).<br> \nThe heir apparent's heir apparent is his son Ivo Alexander Ninian Gordon, Viscount Formartine (b. 18 July 2012).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Baron Stanmore]]\n*[[Duff-Gordon baronets]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | last=Cokayne | first=George E. | authorlink=George Cokayne |editor-last=Gibbs |editor-first=Vicary |editor-link=Vicary Gibbs (St Albans MP) | title=The complete peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, extant, extinct, or dormant | volume=I, Ab-Adam to Basing | publisher=St. Catherine Press | location=London | year=1910 |pages=14\u201318 | url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015066332571 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Cokayne | first=George E. | authorlink=George Cokayne |editor1-last=Doubleday |editor1-first=H.

It belongs to the group of [[swing dance]]s. It is danced under fast [[swing music]], including [[rock and roll]] and [[boogie-woogie]].\n\nYerrington and Outland equated East Coast Swing to the New Yorker in 1961. Originally known as \"Eastern Swing\" by [[Arthur Murray]] Studios, the name East Coast Swing became more common between 1975 and 1980.<ref>Dance Terminology Notebook. Skippy Blair. 1994. Altera. page 27. {{ISBN|0-932980-11-2}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe dance was created by dance studios including the [[Arthur Murray]] dance studios in the 1940s, based on the [[Lindy Hop]]. Lindy Hop was felt by dance studios to be both too difficult and too unstructured to teach to beginning dancers, but there was market demand for training in Swing Dance. The dance studios had initially dismissed Lindy Hop in particular as a fad.<ref name=\"caknsw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/swing.htm|title=Swing History origins of Swing Dance|year=1996|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref> East Coast Swing can be referred to by many different names in different regions of the United States and the World. It has alternatively been called Eastern Swing, [[Jitterbug]], American Swing, East Coast Lindy, Lindy (not to be confused with [[Lindy Hop]]), and Triple Swing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithacaswingdance.com/f_ecs.html|title=East Coast Swing History|year=n.d.|accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> Other variants of East Coast Swing that use altered footwork forms are known as [[Single Swing]] or \"Single-step Swing\" (where the triple step is replaced by a single step forming a slow, slow, quick, quick rhythm common to [[Foxtrot]]), and Double Swing (using a tap-step footwork pattern).\n\nEast Coast Swing is a Rhythm Dance that has both 6 and 8 beat patterns.<ref>Dance Terminology Notebook 1995. Skippy Blair. 1995 p 27</ref>\nThe name ''East Coast Swing'' was coined initially to distinguish the dance from the street form and the new variant used in the competitive ballroom arena (as well as separating the dance from [[West Coast Swing]], which was developed in [[California]]). While based on [[Lindy Hop]], it does have clear distinctions. East Coast Swing is a standardized form of dance developed first for instructional purposes in the Arthur Murray studios, and then later codified to allow for a medium of comparison for competitive ballroom dancers. It can be said that there is no right or wrong way to dance it; however, certain styles of the dance are considered correct \"form\" within the technical elements documented and governed by the National Dance Council of America. The N.D.C.A. oversees all the standards of American Style Ballroom and Latin dances. Lindy Hop was never standardized and later became the inspiration for several other dance forms such as: (European) [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|Boogie Woogie]], [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], East Coast Swing, [[West Coast Swing]] and [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock and Roll]].\n\nIn practice on the social dance floor, the six count steps of the East Coast Swing are often mixed with the eight count steps of [[Lindy Hop]], [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]], and less frequently, [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]].\n\n==Basic technique==\n'''Single-step Swing'''\n\nEast Coast Swing has a 6 count basic step.  This is in contrast to the meter of most swing music, which has a 4 count basic rhythm.  In practice, however, the 6-count moves of the east coast swing are often combined with 8-count moves from the [[Lindy hop]], [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]], and [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]].\n\nDepending on the region and instructor, the [[Basic (dance move)|basic step]] of single-step East Coast Swing is either \"[[rock step]], [[Dance move|step]], step\" or \"step, step, rock step\". In both cases, the rock step always starts on the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]].\n\nFor \"rock step, step, step\" the beats, or counts, are the following:\n\nSteps for the \"lead\" (traditionally, the man's part)\n{|\n| Rock || Beat 1 - STEP back with your LEFT foot\n|-\n| Step || Beat 2 - STEP forward with your RIGHT foot (to where you first started)\n|-\n|      || \n|-\n| Step || Beat 3 - STEP to the left with your LEFT foot\n|-\n|      || Beat 4 - Begin to shift your weight back to your right foot\n|-\n| Step || Beat 5 - STEP to the right with your RIGHT foot\n|-\n|      || Beat 6 - Begin to shift your weight to the left and back\n|}\nSteps for the \"follow\" (traditionally, the woman's part which mirrors the lead's part)\n{|\n| Rock || Beat 1 - STEP back with your RIGHT foot\n|-\n| Step || Beat 2 - STEP forward with your LEFT foot (to where you first started)\n|-\n|      || \n|-\n| Step || Beat 3 - STEP to the right with your RIGHT foot\n|-\n|      || Beat 4 - Begin to shift your weight back to your left foot\n|-\n| Step || Beat 5 - STEP to the left with your LEFT foot\n|-\n|      || Beat 6 - Begin to shift your weight to the right and back\n|}\nFor \"step, step, rock step,\" the rock step occurs on beats 5 and 6, but the overall progression remains the same.\n\nThe normal steps can be substituted with a [[triple step]] or double step \"step-tap\"  or \"kick-step\" instead of a single step. This is commonly used during songs when a slower tempo makes the single step difficult (an example progression would be \"rock step, triple step, triple step\").\n\n==Timing==\n\nBecause East Coast uses a six step pattern with music employing 4 beats per measure, three measures of music are required to complete two sets of steps, as shown in the following table.\n\n{|\n|-\n| Music beats (in fours):||'''1'''||&nbsp;||2||&nbsp;||3||&nbsp;||4||&nbsp;||'''1'''||&nbsp;||2||&nbsp;||3||&nbsp;||4||&nbsp;||'''1'''||&nbsp;||2||&nbsp;||3||&nbsp;||4\n|-\n| Music beat incremental:||1||&nbsp;||2||&nbsp;||3||&nbsp;||4||&nbsp;||5||&nbsp;||6||&nbsp;||7||&nbsp;||8||&nbsp;||9||&nbsp;||10||&nbsp;||11||&nbsp;||12\n|-\n| East Coast Triple Step Timing:  (1 and 2, 3 and 4, rock step)||R||||S||&nbsp;||3||a||4||&nbsp;||5||&nbsp;a||6||&nbsp;||'''R'''||||S||&nbsp;||3||a||4||&nbsp;||5||a||6\n|-\n| East Coast Single Step:  (1 2 rock step)||R||&nbsp;||&nbsp;S||&nbsp;||3||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||5||&nbsp;||||&nbsp;||R||&nbsp;||&nbsp;S||&nbsp;||3||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||5||&nbsp;||\n|}\nThe rock step starts on 1, 2 the first triple step starts 3a4 and the second on 5a6.\n\nIn single time style (used with faster music) the triple steps are replaced by single steps, so two beats of music are used for each single step while each step in the rock (R) step (S) is still completed in one beat, finishing the cycle in six musical beats.  Some instructors will teach vocalizing the single time style as\" \"Quick. Quick. Slow. Slow. \"  or \"Back Step. Slow. Slow.\"\n\nThere is the choice to start with triples or with a rock step, however if you check the above chart where a triple step starts on a 1, 2 you can see that the pattern progresses and wraps back around.  The choice of starting with a triple or a rock step does have musical consequences as music has phrasing with hits that often happen on 12, or 24 or 36... This means that dancers who choose to start with a rock step you will probably find themselves on a rock step on every new phrase. Those who start with a triple will start with a triple on each new phrase.  An advantage of starting with the triple step is that dancers can more easily change their foot work right at the start of the musical phrase.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikibooks|Swing Dancing|East Coast Swing}}\n*[[Lindy hop]]\n*[[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]]\n*[[West Coast Swing]]\n*[[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]]\n*[[Jive (dance)|Jive]]\n*[[Hand dancing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Dance}}\n\n[[Category:Swing dances]]\n[[Category:Competitive dance]]\n[[Category:East Coast music|Swing]]", "sha1": "53qi2566235vjyomgyqp7ry2cfjn62f"}}, {"title": "Ernst Kaltenbrunner", "ns": "0", "id": "10148", "revision": {"id": "866725828", "parentid": "866467212", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T04:19:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Spintendo", "id": "3465809"}, "comment": "Fixing style/layout errors [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Fix common mistakes]] were/were", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Kaltenbrunner|people with the surname|Kaltenbrunner (surname)}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name         = Ernst Kaltenbrunner\n| image        = File:Ernst Kaltebrunner in Nurnberg.jpg\n| caption = Kaltenbrunner as a defendant in the [[Nuremberg trials]]\n| imagesize    = 200px\n| smallimage   = \n| order        = [[RSHA|Director of the Reich Main Security Office]]\n| term_start   = 30 January 1943\n| term_end     = 12 May 1945\n| appointed    = [[Adolf Hitler]]\n| predecessor  = [[Reinhard Heydrich]]{{\\}}[[Heinrich Himmler]] (acting)\n| successor    = None\n| order2       = President of the [[Interpol|ICPC]]\n| term_start2  = 30 January 1943\n| term_end2    = 12 May 1945\n| predecessor2 = [[Arthur Nebe]]\n| successor2   = <!--[[Florent Louwage]]--->\n| birth_date   = 4 October 1903\n| birth_place  = [[Ried im Innkreis]], [[Austria-Hungary]] \n| death_date   = 16 October 1946 (aged 43)\n| death_place  = [[Nuremberg]], [[Allied-occupied Germany]] (execution)\n| module      = {{Infobox military person |embed=yes\n| embed_title = [[File:Flag Schutzstaffel.svg|23px]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] paramilitary career\n| rank        = [[SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer|SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer und General der Waffen-SS]]\n| allegiance = {{flag|Nazi Germany}}\n| serviceyears = 1931\u20131945\n}}\n| party        = [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP)\n| profession   = [[Lawyer]]\n| religion     = [[Gottgl\u00e4ubig]]<br><small>prev.

An ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (general) in the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), between January 1943 and May 1945 he held the offices of Chief of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt''; RSHA). He was the highest-ranking member of the SS to face trial at the first [[Nuremberg trials]]. He was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] and [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[hanging]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Ried im Innkreis]], Austria, Kaltenbrunner was the son of a [[lawyer]], and was educated at the Realgymnasium in [[Linz]].  Raised in a nationalist family, Kaltenbrunner was childhood friends with  [[Adolf Eichmann]], the infamous SS officer who played a key role in implementing the Nazis' [[Final Solution]] against Europe's Jews.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=100}} After Gymnasium, Kaltenbrunner went on to obtain his doctorate degree in law at [[Graz University]] in 1926.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=393, 394}} He worked at a law firm in [[Salzburg]] for a year before opening his own law office in Linz.{{sfn|Snyder|1976|p=189}} He had deep scars on his face from [[academic fencing|dueling]] in his student days, although some sources attribute them to an automobile accident.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/NurembergNews10_16_46.html |title=The Nuremberg Trials<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2016-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010312175414/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/NurembergNews10_16_46.html#dueling%20scars |archive-date=2001-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn 14 January 1934, Kaltenbrunner married Elisabeth Eder (b. 1908) who was from Linz and a [[Nazi Party]] member.  They had three children.  In addition to the children from his marriage, Kaltenbrunner had twins, Ursula and Wolfgang, (b. 1945) with his long-time mistress Gisela Gr\u00e4fin von Westarp (n\u00e9e Wolf).  All the children survived the war.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=408, 409}}\n\n==SS career==\nOn 18 October 1930, Kaltenbrunner joined the Nazi Party with NSDAP member number 300,179.{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=393}} In 1931, he was the ''Bezirksredner'' (district speaker) for the Nazi Party in [[Upper Austria|Ober\u00f6sterreich]]. Kaltenbrunner went on to join the [[SS]] on 31 August 1931, his SS number was 13,039.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=393, 394}} He first became a ''Rechtsberater'' (legal consultant) for the party in 1929 and later held this same position for [[Allgemeine-SS Order of Battle|SS Abschnitt VIII]] beginning in 1932.{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=394}} That same year, he began working at his father's law practice and by 1933 was head of the National-Socialist Lawyers' League in Linz.{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=394}}\n\nIn January 1934, Kaltenbrunner was briefly jailed at the Kaisersteinbruch detention camp with other National Socialists for conspiracy by the [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] government.  While there he led a hunger strike which forced the government to release 490 of the party members.  In 1935, he was jailed again on suspicion of [[high treason]]. This charge was dropped, but he was sentenced to six months imprisonment for [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and he lost his license to practice law.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=394, 395}}\n\nFrom mid-1935 Kaltenbrunner was head of the illegal SS Abschnitt VIII in Linz and was considered a leader of the [[Austrian SS]].  To provide [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Heinz Jost]] with new information, Kaltenbrunner repeatedly made trips to [[Bavaria]].  Hiding on a train and on a ship that traveled to [[Passau]], he would return with money and orders for Austrian comrades.{{sfn|Rosmus|2015|p=52}} Kaltenbrunner was arrested again in 1937, by Austrian authorities on charges of being head of the illegal Nazi Party organisation in Ober\u00f6sterreich.

Also in 1938, he was appointed [[High SS and police leader]] (''H\u00f6herer SS- und Polizeif\u00fchrer''; HSSPF) for Donau, which was the primary SS command in Austria (he held that post until 30 January 1943).{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=395}}\n\n==World War II==\nIn June 1940, Kaltenbrunner was appointed Police President of Vienna and held that additional post for a year. In July 1940, he was commissioned as a SS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' in the [[Waffen-SS]] Reserve.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=393, 396}} Throughout the course of his many duties, Kaltenbrunner also developed an impressive intelligence network across Austria moving south eastwards, which eventually brought him to Himmler's attention for the assignment as chief of the [[RSHA]] in January 1943.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=135}} The RSHA was composed of the SiPo (''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]''; the combined forces of the [[Gestapo]] and [[Kriminalpolizei (Nazi Germany)|Kripo]]) along with the SD (''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'', Security Service).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=470, 661}} He replaced Heydrich, who was [[Operation Anthropoid|assassinated]] in June 1942. Kaltenbrunner held this position until the end of the war.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=661}} Hardly anyone knew Kaltenbrunner and upon his appointment, Himmler transferred responsibility for both SS personnel and economics from the RSHA to the [[SS Main Economic and Administrative Office]].{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=553}} Nonetheless, he was promoted to SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] und General der Polizei'' on 21 June 1943. He also replaced Heydrich as President of the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), the organization today known as [[Interpol]].{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=393, 396}}\n\nFear of a collapsing home-front due to the Allied bombing campaigns and that another \"stab-in-the-back\" at home could arise as a result, caused Kaltenbrunner to immediately tighten the Nazi grip within Germany.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=289}} From what historian Anthony Read relates, Kaltenbrunner's appointment as RSHA chief came as a surprise given the other possible candidates like head of the Gestapo, [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]], or even SD foreign intelligence chief, [[Walter Schellenberg]].{{sfn|Read|2005|p=798}} Historian Richard Grunberger also added the name of Dr. [[Wilhelm Stuckart]], the future minister of the German Interior as another potential candidate for head of the RSHA; however, he suggests that Kaltenbrunner was most likely selected since he was a comparative \"newcomer\" who would be more \"pliable\" in Himmler's hands.{{sfn|Grunberger|1993|p=98}}\n\nLike many of the ideological fanatics in the regime, Kaltenbrunner was a committed anti-Semite. According to former SS-''Sturmbannf\u00fchrer'' Hans Georg Mayer, Kaltenbrunner was present at a December 1940 meeting between Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, and Heydrich, where it was decided to gas all Jews incapable of heavy physical work.{{sfn|Breitman|1994|pp=81\u201382}} Under Kaltenbrunner's command, the persecution of Jews picked up pace as \"the process of extermination was to be expedited and the concentration of the Jews in the Reich itself and the occupied countries were to be liquidated as soon as possible.\"{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=406}} Kaltenbrunner stayed constantly informed over the status of concentration camp activities, receiving periodic reports at his office in the RSHA.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=270}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-029, KZ Mauthausen, Himmler, Kaltenbrunner, Ziereis.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Kaltenbrunner with Himmler and Ziereis at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] in April 1941]]\nDuring the summer of 1943, Kaltenbrunner conducted his second inspection of the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]]. While he was there, 15 prisoners were selected to demonstrate for Kaltenbrunner three methods of killing; by gunshot to the neck, hanging and gassing. After the killings were performed, Kaltenbrunner inspected the crematorium and later the quarry.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=396\u2013398}} In October 1943, he told [[Herbert Kappler]], the head of German police and security services in Rome, that the \"eradication of the Jews in Italy\" was of \"special interest\" for \"general security\".{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=398}} Four days later, Kappler's SS and police units began rounding up and deporting Jews by train to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=398}}\n\nIn 1944 when Hitler was in the process of strong-arming Admiral Horthy into submitting Hungary to the Nazis during an arranged meeting in Klessheim Castle in Salzburg, Kaltenbrunner was present for the negotiations and escorted him out once they were over. Accompanying Horthy and Kaltenbrunner on the journey back to Hungary was [[Adolf Eichmann]] who brought with him a special ''Einsatzkommando'' unit to begin the process of \"rounding up and deporting Hungary's 750,000 Jews.\"{{sfn|Read|2005|p=825}}\n\nIt was said that even Himmler feared him, as Kaltenbrunner was an intimidating figure with his {{convert|1.94|m|ftin}} height, facial scars and volatile temper. Kaltenbrunner was also a longtime friend of [[Otto Skorzeny]] and recommended him for many secret missions, allowing Skorzeny to become one of Hitler's favorite agents. Kaltenbrunner was also responsible for heading [[Operation Long Jump]], a plan to assassinate [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] in [[Tehran]]. This mission was thwarted by Soviet intelligence agent [[Gevork Vartanian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armenpress.am/eng/news/674765/Armenian_intelligence_agent_hero_of_the_Soviet_Union_Gevorg_Vardanian_passed_away.html|title=Armenian intelligence agent, hero of the Soviet Union Gevorg Vardanian passed away|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nImmediately in the wake of the [[Operation Valkyrie|20 July Plot]] on Hitler's life in 1944, Kaltenbrunner was summoned to Hitler's wartime headquarters at the ''Wolfsschanze'' ([[Wolf's Lair]]) in [[East Prussia]] to begin the investigation into who was responsible for the assassination attempt.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=833}} Once it was revealed that an attempted military coup against Hitler had been launched, Himmler and Kaltenbrunner had to tread carefully as the military was not under the jurisdiction of the Gestapo or the SD.

He also said Gestapo Chief [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] had illegally affixed his signature to numerous documents in question.{{sfn|Conot|2000|pp=367\u2013368}}\n\nKaltenbrunner argued in his defense that his position as RSHA chief existed only theoretically and said he was only active in matters of espionage and intelligence. He maintained that Himmler, as his superior, was the person actually culpable for the atrocities committed during his tenure as chief of the RSHA. Kaltenbrunner also asserted that he had no knowledge of the [[Final Solution]] before 1943 and went on to claim that he protested against the ill-treatment of the Jews to Himmler and Hitler.{{sfn|Marrus|1997|p=214}} Further denials from Kaltenbrunner included statements that he knew nothing of the [[Commissar Order]] and that he never visited [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen concentration camp]], despite documentation of his visit.{{sfn|Conot|2000|pp=364\u2013365}} At one point, Kaltenbrunner went so far as to avow that ''he'' was responsible for bringing the Final Solution to an end.{{sfn|Conot|2000|p=370}}\n\n{{listen|filename=KaltenbrunnerNuremberg.ogg|title=Excerpt from Ernst Kaltenbrunner's closing statement at the Nuremberg Trials.|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nOn 30 September 1946, the [[International Military Tribunal]] found Kaltenbrunner not guilty of crimes against peace, but guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity (counts three and four).

Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi party]] and assumed dictatorial powers. [[Austrian Civil War|Suppressing the Socialist movement]] in February 1934, he cemented the rule of \"[[austrofascism]]\" through the [[authoritarian]] ''[[May Constitution of 1934|First of May Constitution]]''. Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] agents in 1934.

A few months after her son's birth, Josepha married landowner Leopold Schmutz in [[Kirnberg an der Mank|Kirnberg]], who did not, however, adopt Engelbert as his own child. Dollfuss, who was raised as a devout [[Roman Catholic]], received a scholarship for the [[minor seminary]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna|Archdiocese of Vienna]] in [[Hollabrunn]] in 1904.

Dollfuss' diminutive stature would remain an object of satire all his life; among his nicknames were 'Millimetternich' (blending 'millimeter' and [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]]), and 'Jockey'. \n\nDollfuss was eventually accepted and joined the Tyrolean ''[[Kaisersch\u00fctzen|Landessch\u00fctzen]]'' regiment at [[Brixen]] and by the end of 1914 was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Serving as commander of a machine gun detachment, he was a highly decorated soldier and was briefly taken by the Italian forces as a [[prisoner of war]] in 1918.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} After the war he returned to studies in Vienna, joining a Catholic male student fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]''), became co-founder of the [[German Student Union]] in Austria and acted as a representative at the ''[[Cartellverband]]'' umbrella organization. Together with occasional allies like [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], [[Robert Hohlbaum]] and [[Hermann Neubacher]], he distinguished himself as a [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemite]].{{Citation needed|reason=unproven claim|date=February 2018}}{{disputed|date=February 2018}} From 1919 he worked as secretary of the Austrian Farmers' Association (''Bauernbund'') and was sent to study economics at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. There Engelbert met Alwine Glienke (1897\u20131973), a German woman from a Protestant family, whom he married in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.artikel33.com/wirtschaft/1/wer-war-engelbert-dollfu.php  |title=Wer war Engelbert Dollfu\u00df? |publisher=Artikel33 |language=de |accessdate=2018-03-04}}</ref> The couple had one son and two daughters, with one daughter dying during early childhood.\n\nDollfuss finished his studies and obtained the [[doctor of law]] degree in 1922. He worked as a secretary of the Lower Austrian Chamber of Agriculture and in 1927 became its director. A great admirer of [[Karl Freiherr von Vogelsang]]'s teachings, he became a member of the conservative [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] (CS) and promoted the establishment of [[agricultural cooperative]]s as well as the implementation of social insurance and [[unemployment benefits]] for farm workers against inner party disapproval. At the instigation of his party colleague Chancellor [[Carl Vaugoin]], he was appointed president of the [[Austrian Federal Railways]] in 1930 (Dollfuss would push off Vaugoin to this post three years later).\n\nIn the [[Austrian legislative election, 1930|1930 legislative election]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]] emerged as the strongest party and Vaugoin resigned as chancellor. In March 1931, Dollfuss was named Minister of Agriculture and Forests in the short-lived coalition cabinet of Chancellor [[Otto Ender]]. When Ender resigned a few months later at the height of the ''[[Creditanstalt]]'' affair, he maintained this office under Ender's successor [[Karl Buresch]]. However, the political situation became more and more unstable after a failed ''[[Heimwehr]]'' coup d'\u00e9tat and the [[Nazi Party]] reaching a significant level of votes in several ''[[Landtag]]'' elections. The CS lost its [[Greater German People's Party|Greater German]] allies in parliament and when the Social Democrats requested the dissolution of the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]], the Buresch cabinet resigned on 20 May 1932.\n\n== Chancellor of Austria ==\n\nOn 10 May 1932, Dollfuss, age 39 and with only one year's experience in the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]], was offered the office of [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] by President [[Wilhelm Miklas]], also a member of the Christian-Social Party. Dollfuss refused to reply, instead spending the night in his favourite church praying, returning in the morning for a bath and a spartan meal before replying to the President he would accept the offer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882197-3,00.html | work=Time | title=AUSTRIA: Eve of Renewal | date=September 25, 1933}}</ref> Dollfuss was sworn in on 20 May 1932 as head of a [[coalition government]] between the Christian-Social Party, the [[Landbund]] \u2014 a [[right-wing]] [[agrarianism|agrarian]] party \u2014 and [[Heimwehr|Heimatblock]], the parliamentary wing of the ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a [[paramilitary]] [[ultra-nationalist]] group. The coalition assumed the pressing task of tackling the problems of the [[Great Depression]]. Much of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]'s industry had been situated in the areas that became part of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after [[World War I]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]]. Postwar Austria was therefore economically disadvantaged.\n\nDollfuss' majority in [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Parliament]] was marginal; his government had only a one-vote majority.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u00d6sterreich I (Die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik) |last=Portisch |first=Hugo| author2=Sepp Riff |year=1989 |publisher=Verlag Kremayr und Scheriau |location=Vienna, Austria |isbn=3-218-00485-3 |page=415}}</ref>\n\n== Dollfuss as dictator of Austria ==\n[[File:DollfussEnGinebra1933.jpeg|thumb|Chancellor Dollfuss in [[Geneva]], 1933]]\n{{main|Self-elimination of Parliament}}\nIn March 1933, an argument arose over irregularities in the voting procedure. The Social Democratic president of the [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] (the lower house of parliament) [[Karl Renner]] resigned to be able to cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well to be able to vote. Without a president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable, and advised [[President of Austria|President]] [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. When the National Council wanted to reconvene days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had police bar entrance to parliament, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria. From that point onwards, he governed as dictator by emergency decree with absolute power.\n\nDollfuss was concerned that with [[NSDAP|German National Socialist]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialists]] (DNSAP) could gain a significant minority in future elections (according to fascism scholar [[Stanley G. Payne]], should elections have been held in 1933, the DNSAP could have mustered about 25% of the votes \u2013 contemporary [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] analysts suggest a higher support of 50%, with a 75% approval rate in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region bordering Nazi Germany).<ref>Stanley G.

Dollfuss banned the communists on 26 May 1933 and the DNSAP on 19 June 1933. Under the banner of [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], he later established a one-party dictatorship rule largely modeled after fascism in Italy, banning all other Austrian parties including the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAP\u00d6). Social Democrats however continued to exist as an independent organization, nevertheless, without its paramilitary ''Republikanischer Schutzbund'', which until 31 March 1933<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.doew.braintrust.at/m9sm101.html|title=D\u00f6W - Documentation Center of Austrian Resistance|work=braintrust.at|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref> could have mustered tens of thousands against Dollfuss' government.\n\n=== Austrofascism ===\n\nDollfuss modeled [[Austrofascism]] according to [[Catholic]] [[corporatist]] ideals with [[clericalism|anti-secularist]] tones and in a similar way to Italian [[fascism]], dropping Austrian pretenses of unification with Germany as long as the Nazi Party remained in power. In August 1933, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime issued a guarantee of Austrian independence. Dollfuss also exchanged 'Secret Letters' with Mussolini about ways to guarantee Austrian independence. Mussolini was interested in Austria forming a buffer zone against Nazi Germany. Dollfuss always stressed the similarity of the regimes of Hitler in Germany and [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, and was convinced that Austrofascism and Italian fascism could counter [[totalitarian]] national socialism and communism in Europe.\n\nIn September 1933 Dollfuss merged his Christian Social Party with elements of other nationalist and conservative groups, including the Heimwehr, which encompassed many workers who were unhappy with the radical leadership of the socialist party, to form the ''[[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Vaterl\u00e4ndische Front]]'', though the Heimwehr continued to exist as an independent organization until 1936, when Dollfuss' successor [[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] forcibly merged it into the Front, instead creating the unabidingly loyal ''Frontmiliz'' as paramilitary task force. Dollfuss escaped an assassination attempt in October 1933 by [[Rudolf Dertill]], a 22-year-old who had been ejected from the military for his national socialist views.\n\n=== Austrian civil war ===\n\nIn February 1934 the security forces provoked arrests of Social Democrats and unjustified searches for weapons of the Social Democrats' already outlawed [[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]. After the Dollfuss dictatorship took steps against known Social Democrats, the Social Democrats called for nationwide resistance against the government. [[Austrian Civil War|A civil war]] began, which lasted sixteen days, from 12 until 27 February. Fierce fighting took place primarily in the East of Austria, especially in the streets of some outer [[Vienna]] districts, where large fortress-like [[Gemeindebau|municipal workers' buildings]] were situated, and in the northern, industrial areas of the province of [[Styria]], where Nazi agents{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} had great interest in a bloodbath between security forces and workers' militias. The resistance was suppressed by police and military power. The Social Democrats were outlawed,<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IaaJAAAAMAAJ&q=Sozialdemokratische+Partei+verboten+1934 |title=Protokolle des Ministerrates der Ersten Republik, Volume 8, Part 6 |ISBN=3-7046-0004-0 |page=xvii |year=1985 |language=de |accessdate=2018-03-04}}</ref> and their leaders were imprisoned or fled abroad.\n\n=== New constitution ===\n\nDollfuss staged a parliamentary session with just his party members present in April 1934 to [[May Constitution of 1934|have his new constitution approved]], effectively the second constitution in the world espousing [[corporatist]] ideas after that of the Portuguese ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''.<ref>Stanley G.

The Duce personally gave the announcement to the widow, who was a guest at his villa in [[Riccione]] with children. He also put at the disposal of [[Ernst R\u00fcdiger Starhemberg]], who spent a holiday in [[Venice]], a plane that allowed the prince to rush back to Vienna and to face the assailants with his militia, with the permission of President [[Wilhelm Miklas]].<ref>Richard Lamb, ''Mussolini and the British'', 1997, p. 149</ref>\n\nMussolini also mobilised a part of the Italian army on the Austrian border and threatened Hitler with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria to thwart the putsch. Then he announced to the world: \"The independence of Austria, for which he has fallen, is a principle that has been defended and will be defended by Italy even more strenuously\", and then replaced in the main square of [[Bolzano]] the statue<ref>[[:de:Walther-Denkmal (Bozen)]]</ref> of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], a Germanic troubadour, with that of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], a Roman general who conquered part of Germany. This was the greatest moment of friction between Fascism and National Socialism and Mussolini himself came down several times to reaffirm the differences in the field. The assassination of Dollfuss was accompanied by uprisings in many regions in Austria, resulting in further deaths. In [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], a large contingent of northern German Nazis tried to seize power but were subdued by the Italian units nearby. At first Hitler was jubilant, but the Italian reaction surprised him. Hitler became convinced that he could not face a conflict with the Western European powers, and he officially denied liability, stating his regret for the murder of the Austrian Prime Minister. He replaced the ambassador to Vienna with [[Franz von Papen]] and prevented the conspirators entering Germany, also expelling them from the Austrian Nazi Party. The Nazi assassins in Vienna, after declaring the formation of a new government under Austrian Nazi [[Anton Rintelen]], previously exiled by Dollfuss as Austrian Ambassador to Rome, surrendered after threats from Austrian military of blowing up the Chancellery using [[dynamite]], and were subsequently tried and executed by [[hanging]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747609-3,00.html | work=Time | title=AUSTRIA: Death for Freedom | date=August 6, 1934}}</ref> [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], previously Minister of Education, was appointed new chancellor of Austria after a few days, assuming the office from Dollfuss\u2019 deputy Starhemberg.\n\nOut of a population of 6.5 million, approximately 500,000 Austrians were present at Dollfuss\u2019 burial in [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747609-5,00.html | work=Time | title=Austria: Death for Freedom | date=August 6, 1934}}</ref> He is interred in the [[Hietzing]] cemetery in Vienna<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viennatouristguide.at/Friedhoefe/Hietzing/Ehrengraeber/z_dollfuss.htm |title=Vienna Tourist Guide: Dollfuss Hietzinger Friedhof |publisher=Hedwig Abraham  |accessdate=6 February 2010}} (includes photographs)</ref> beside his wife [[Alwine Dollfuss]] (d. 1973) and two of his children, Hannerl and Eva, all of whom were in Italy as guests of [[Rachele Mussolini]] at the time of his death, an event which saw Mussolini himself shed tears over his slain ally.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882197-4,00.html | work=Time | title=AUSTRIA: Eve of Renewal | date=September 25, 1933}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aspetos.at/de/traueranzeige/rudolf_dollfuss |title=Rudolf Dollfu\u00df - Traueranzeige und Parte  &#8224; 05.11.2011 - ASPETOS |accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== In literature ==\n\nIn [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s 1941 play ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'', Dollfuss is represented by the character \"Dullfeet\".<ref name=\"The New York Times - 9 May 1991- Review/Theater; Brecht's Cauliflower King In Another Resistible Rise\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/theater/review-theater-brecht-s-cauliflower-king-in-another-resistible-rise.html|title=Review/Theater; Brecht's Cauliflower King In Another Resistible Rise|last=[[Mel Gussow]]|date=May 9, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n* ''Das Kammersystem in der Landwirtschaft \u00d6sterreichs''.

His father, Christoph Ludwig Hoffmann (1736\u201397), was a [[barrister]] in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia), as well as a poet and amateur musician who played the [[viola da gamba]]. In 1767 he married his cousin, Lovisa Albertina Doerffer (1748\u201396). Ernst Theodor Wilhelm, born on 24 January 1776, was the youngest of three children, of whom the second died in infancy.\n\nWhen his parents separated in 1778, the father went to Insterburg (now [[Chernyakhovsk]]) with his elder son, Johann Ludwig Hoffmann (1768\u2013after 1822), while Ernst's mother stayed in K\u00f6nigsberg with her relatives: two aunts, Johanna Sophie Doerffer (1745\u20131803) and Charlotte Wilhelmine Doerffer (c. 1754\u201379) and their brother, Otto Wilhelm Doerffer (1741\u20131811), who were all unmarried. This trio raised the youngster.\n\nThe household, dominated by the uncle (whom Ernst nicknamed ''O Weh''\u2014\"Oh dear!\"\u2014in a play on his initials), was [[pietist]]ic and uncongenial. Hoffmann was to regret his estrangement from his father. Nevertheless, he remembered his aunts with great affection, especially the younger, Charlotte, whom he nicknamed ''Tante F\u00fc\u00dfchen'' (\"Aunt Littlefeet\"). Although she died when he was only three years old, he treasured her memory (e.g. see ''Kater Murr'') and embroidered stories about her to such an extent that later biographers sometimes assumed her to be imaginary, until proof of her existence was found after [[World War II]].<ref>Friedrich Schnapp. \"Hoffmanns Verwandte aus der Familie Doerffer in K\u00f6nigsberger Kirchenb\u00fcchern der Jahre 1740\u20131811.\" ''Mitteilungen der E. T. A. Hoffmann-Gesellschaft.'' 23 (1977), 1\u201311.</ref>\n\nBetween 1781 and 1792 he attended the Lutheran school or ''[[Burgschule (K\u00f6nigsberg)|Burgschule]]'', where he made good progress in classics. He was taught drawing by one Saemann, and counterpoint by a Polish organist named Podbileski, who was to be the prototype of Abraham Liscot in ''Kater Murr''. Ernst showed great talent for piano-playing, and busied himself with writing and drawing. The provincial setting was not, however, conducive to technical progress, and despite his many-sided talents he remained rather ignorant of both classical forms and of the new artistic ideas that were developing in Germany. He had, however, read [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Jean Paul]], and wrote part of a novel titled ''Der Geheimnisvolle''.\n\nAround 1787 he became friends with [[Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Younger]] (1775\u20131843), the son of a pastor, and nephew of [[Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder]], the well-known writer friend of [[Immanuel Kant]]. During 1792, both attended some of Kant's lectures at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]]. Their friendship, although often tested by an increasing social difference, was to be lifelong.\n\nIn 1794, Hoffmann became enamored of Dora Hatt, a married woman to whom he had given music lessons. She was ten years older, and gave birth to her sixth child in 1795.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In February 1796, her family protested against his attentions and, with his hesitant consent, asked another of his uncles to arrange employment for him in [[G\u0142og\u00f3w|Glogau (G\u0142og\u00f3w)]], [[Prussian Silesia]].<ref>R\u00fcdiger Safranski.

Metzlersche, Stuttgart, 1988. {{ISBN|3-476-10243-2}}</ref>\n\n===The provinces===\nFrom 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited [[Dresden]], where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]] and [[Raphael]]. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August\u2014Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called ''Die Maske'' and sending a copy to Queen [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Luise of Prussia]]. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named [[August Wilhelm Iffland|Iffland]]. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for [[Pozna\u0144|Posen (Pozna\u0144)]] in [[South Prussia]] in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery.\n\nFrom June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of [[Greater Poland]] and [[Masovia]]. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become \"what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nHis first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on [[Shrove Tuesday]] 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by \"promoting\" Hoffmann to [[P\u0142ock]] in [[New East Prussia]], the former capital of Poland (1079\u20131138), where administrative offices were relocated from [[Toru\u0144|Thorn (Toru\u0144)]]. He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married \"Mischa\" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose [[Polish language|Polish]] surname was Trzci\u0144ska). They moved to P\u0142ock in August 1802.\n\nHoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in [[August von Kotzebue|Kotzebue]]'s periodical, ''Die Freim\u00fcthige'', and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann's was called ''Der Preis'' (\"The Prize\"), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 [[Friedrich d'or|Friedrichs d'or]]. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise.<ref>''Die Freim\u00fcthige,'' 11 February 1804. Volume II, no. 6, pages xxi\u2013xxiv.</ref> This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Cora Hatt in K\u00f6nigsberg.\n\nAt the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at [[Warsaw]]. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Cora Hatt's daughters. He was never to return to K\u00f6nigsberg.\n\n===Warsaw===\nHoffmann assimilated well with Polish society; the years spent in Prussian Poland he recognized as the happiest of his life. In Warsaw he found the same atmosphere he had enjoyed in Berlin, renewing his friendship with [[Zacharias Werner]], and meeting his future biographer, a neighbour and fellow jurist called [[Julius Eduard Hitzig|Julius Eduard Itzig]] (who changed his name to Hitzig after his baptism). Itzig had been a member of the Berlin literary group called the ''Nordstern'', and he gave Hoffmann the works of [[Novalis]], [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Achim von Arnim]], [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert]], [[Carlo Gozzi]] and [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]]. These relatively late introductions marked his work profoundly.\n\nHe moved in the circles of [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso]], [[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9]], [[Rahel Levin]] and [[David Ferdinand Koreff]].\n\nHis fortunate position was not to last: on 28 November 1806, during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s troops captured Warsaw, and the Prussian bureaucrats lost their jobs. They divided the contents of the treasury between them and fled. In January 1807 his wife and two-year-old daughter C\u00e4cilia returned to Posen, while he pondered whether to move to [[Vienna]] or go back to Berlin. A delay of six months was caused by severe illness. Eventually the French authorities demanded that all former officials swear allegiance or leave the country. As they refused to grant him a passport to Vienna, he was forced to return to Berlin.\nHe visited his family in Posen before arriving in Berlin on 18 June 1807, hoping to further his career there as an artist and writer.\n\n===Berlin and Bamberg===\nThe next fifteen months were some of the worst in Hoffmann's life.\nThe city of Berlin was also occupied by Napoleon's troops. Obtaining only meagre allowances, he had frequent recourse to his friends, constantly borrowing money and still going hungry for days at a time; he learned that his daughter had died. Nevertheless, he managed to compose his Six Canticles for ''a cappella'' choir: one of his best compositions, which he would later attribute to Kreisler in ''Lebensansichten des Katers Murr''.\n[[File:E. T. A. Hoffmann - Kapellmeister Kreisler.jpg|thumbnail|Hoffmann's portrait of Kapellmeister Kreisler]]\nOn 1 September 1808 he arrived with his wife in [[Bamberg]], where he began a job as theatre manager. The director, Count Soden, left almost immediately for W\u00fcrzburg, leaving a man named Heinrich Cuno in charge. Hoffmann was unable to improve standards of performance, and his efforts caused intrigues against him which resulted in him losing his job to Cuno. He began work as music critic for the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'', a newspaper in [[Leipzig]], and his articles on [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] were especially well received, and highly regarded by the composer himself. It was in its pages that the \"[[Kapellmeister]] [[Johannes Kreisler]]\" character made his first appearance.\n\nHoffmann's breakthrough came in 1809, with the publication of ''Ritter Gluck'', a story about a man who meets, or believes he has met, the composer [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] (1714\u201387) more than twenty years after the latter's death. The theme alludes to the work of [[Jean Paul]], who invented the term [[Doppelg\u00e4nger]] the previous decade, and continued to exact a powerful influence over Hoffmann, becoming one of his earliest admirers. With this publication, Hoffmann began to use the pseudonym E. T. A. Hoffmann, telling people that the \"A\" stood for ''Amadeus'', in homage to the composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756\u201391). However, he continued to use Wilhelm in official documents throughout his life, and the initials E. T. W. also appear on his gravestone.\n\nThe next year, he was employed at the Bamberg Theatre as stagehand, decorator, and playwright, while also giving private music lessons.\nHe became so enamored of a young singing student, Julia Marc, that his feelings were obvious whenever they were together, and Julia's mother quickly found her a more suitable match. When Joseph Seconda offered Hoffmann a position as musical director for his opera company (then performing in Dresden), he accepted, leaving on 21 April 1813.\n\n===Dresden and Leipzig===\nPrussia had declared war against France on 16 March during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], and their journey was fraught with difficulties. They arrived on the 25th, only to find that Seconda was in Leipzig; on the 26th, they sent a letter pleading for temporary funds. That same day Hoffmann was surprised to meet Hippel, whom he had not seen for nine years.\n\nThe situation deteriorated, and in early May Hoffmann tried in vain to find transport to Leipzig. On 8 May, the bridges were destroyed, and his family were marooned in the city. During the day, Hoffmann would roam, watching the fighting with curiosity. Finally, on 20 May, they left for Leipzig, only to be involved in an accident which killed one of the passengers in their coach and injured his wife.\n\nThey arrived on 23 May, and Hoffmann started work with Seconda's orchestra, which he found to be of the best quality. On 4 June an armistice began, which allowed the company to return to Dresden. But on 22 August, after the end of the armistice, the family was forced to relocate from their pleasant house in the suburbs into the town, and during the next few days the [[Battle of Dresden]] raged. The city was bombarded; many people were killed by bombs directly in front of him. After the main battle was over, he visited the gory battlefield. His account can be found in ''Vision auf dem Schlachtfeld bei Dresden''. After a long period of continued disturbance, the town surrendered on 11 November, and on 9 December the company travelled to Leipzig.\n\nOn 25 February Hoffmann quarrelled with Seconda, and the next day he was given notice of twelve weeks. When asked to accompany them on their journey to Dresden in April, he refused, and they left without him. But during July his friend Hippel visited, and soon he found himself being guided back into his old career as a jurist.\n\n===Berlin===\n[[File:Grave of ETA Hoffmann.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of E. T. A. Hoffmann. Translated, the inscription reads: E. T. W. Hoffmann, born on 24 January 1776, in K\u00f6nigsberg, died on 25 June 1822, in Berlin, Councillor of the Court of Justice, excellent in his office, as a poet, as a musician, as a painter, dedicated by his friends.]]\nAt the end of September 1814, in the wake of Napoleon's defeat, Hoffmann returned to Berlin and succeeded in regaining a job at the ''Kammergericht'', the chamber court. His opera ''[[Undine (Hoffmann)|Undine]]'' was performed by the Berlin Theatre. Its successful run came to an end only after a fire on the night of the 25th performance. Magazines clamoured for his contributions, and after a while his standards started to decline. Nevertheless, many masterpieces date from this time.\n\nDuring the period from 1819 Hoffmann was involved with legal disputes, while fighting ill health. Alcohol abuse and syphilis eventually caused weakening of his limbs during 1821, and paralysis from the beginning of 1822. His last works were dictated to his wife or to a secretary.\n\n[[Klemens von Metternich|Prince Metternich]]'s anti-liberal programs began to put Hoffmann in situations that tested his conscience. Thousands of people were accused of treason for having certain political opinions,\nand university professors were monitored during their lectures.\n\nKing [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] appointed an Immediate Commission for the investigation of political dissidence; when he found its observance of the rule of law too frustrating, he established a Ministerial Commission to interfere with its processes. The latter was greatly influenced by Commissioner Kamptz. During the trial of [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn|\"Turnvater\" Jahn]], the founder of the gymnastics association movement, Hoffmann found himself annoying Kamptz, and became a political target. When Hoffmann caricatured Kamptz in a story (''Meister Floh''), Kamptz began legal proceedings. These ended when Hoffmann's illness was found to be life-threatening. The King asked for a reprimand only, but no action was ever taken. Eventually ''Meister Floh'' was published with the offending passages removed.\n\nHoffmann died of syphilis in Berlin on 25 June 1822 at the age of 46. His grave is preserved in the Protestant ''Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde'' (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of [[Jerusalem Church (Berlin)|Jerusalem Church]] and [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|New Church]]) in [[Kreuzberg|Berlin-Kreuzberg]], south of [[Hallesches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hallesches Tor]] at the underground station Mehringdamm.\n\n==Works==\n{{Mainlist|E.

Hoffmann's story ''[[Mademoiselle de Scuderi|Das Fr\u00e4ulein von Scuderi]]'' is sometimes cited as the first [[detective story]] and a direct influence on Poe's \"[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]\".<ref>''[[The Seven Basic Plots]]'', Christopher Booker, Continuum, 2004, page 507</ref>\n\nThe twentieth-century Russian literary theorist [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] characterised Hoffmann's works as [[Menippea]], essentially satirical and self-parodying in form, thus including him in a tradition that includes [[Cervantes]], [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]].\n\n[[Robert Schumann]]'s piano suite [[Kreisleriana]] (1838) has its title from one of Hoffmann's books (and according to [[Charles Rosen]]'s ''The Romantic Generation'', is possibly also inspired by \"The Life and Opinions of Tomcat Murr\", in which Kreisler appears). [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s masterwork, the opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann|Les contes d'Hoffmann]]'' (\"The Tales of Hoffmann\", 1881), is based on the stories, principally ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (\"The Sandman\", 1816), ''[[Rat Krespel]]'' (\"Councillor Krespel\", 1818), and ''Das verlorene Spiegelbild'' (\"The Lost Reflection\") from ''[[Die Abenteuer der Silvester-Nacht]]'' (\"The Adventures of New Year's Eve\", 1814). ''[[Klein Zaches genannt Zinnober]]'' (\"Little Zaches called Cinnabar\", 1819) inspired an aria, also the operetta (\"Le Roi Carotte\" , 1872). [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' (1892) is based on \"Nutcracker and Mouse King\", and the ballet ''[[Copp\u00e9lia]]'', with music by [[Leo Delibes|Delibes]], is based on two eerie Hoffmann stories.\n\nHoffmann also influenced 19th-century musical opinion directly through his music criticism. His reviews of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67]] (1808) and other important works set new literary standards for writing about music, and encouraged later writers to consider music as \"the most Romantic of all the arts.\"<ref>See also [[Fausto Cercignani]], ''E.

Hoffmann - Hoffmann k\u00e4mpft gegen die B\u00fcrokratie 1821.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Hoffmann's drawing of himself, riding on Tomcat Murr and fighting \"Prussian bureaucracy\"]]\n\nHoffmann strove for artistic polymathy. He created far more in his works than mere political commentary achieved through satire. His masterpiece novel ''[[Lebensansichten des Katers Murr]]'' (\"The Life and Opinions of Tomcat Murr\", 1819\u20131821) deals with such issues as the aesthetic status of true artistry and the modes of self-transcendence that accompany any genuine endeavour to create. Hoffmann's portrayal of the character Kreisler (a genius musician) is wittily counterpointed with the character of the tomcat Murr \u2013 a virtuoso illustration of artistic pretentiousness that many of Hoffmann's contemporaries found offensive and subversive of Romantic ideals.\n\nHoffmann's literature indicates the failings of many so-called artists to differentiate between the superficial and the authentic aspects of such Romantic ideals.

To allow him to accept that post, he was given a temporary [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] from his religious vows on the grounds of poor health and love of Humanistic studies, though he remained a priest. [[Pope Leo X]] later made the dispensation permanent, a considerable privilege at the time.\n\n==Education and scholarship==\n[[File:Rotterdam standbeeld Erasmus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of Erasmus in Rotterdam. It was created by [[Hendrick de Keyser]] in 1622, replacing a stone statue of 1557.]]\n\nIn 1495, with Bishop Henry's consent and a stipend, Erasmus went on to study at the [[University of Paris]], in the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu]], a centre of reforming zeal, under the direction of the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Jan Standonck]], of whose rigors he complained. The University was then the chief seat of [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] learning, but already coming under the influence of [[Renaissance]] humanism. For instance, Erasmus became an intimate friend of an Italian humanist [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], poet and \"professor of humanity\" in Paris.\n\nThe chief centres of Erasmus's activity were [[Paris]], [[Leuven]] (in the [[Duchy of Brabant]], now in [[Belgium]]), [[England]], and Basel; yet he never belonged firmly in any one of these places. In 1499 he was invited back to England by [[William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy]], who offered to accompany him on his trip back to England. Erasmus was \"ever susceptible to the charms of attractive, well-connected, and rich young men\".<ref>Thomas Penn, ''The Winter King'', Penguin, 2013</ref> His time in England was fruitful in the making of lifelong friendships with the leaders of English thought in the days of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: [[John Colet]], [[Thomas More]], [[John Fisher]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[William Grocyn]].  At the [[University of Cambridge]], he was the [[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]] and had the option of spending the rest of his life as an English [[professor]]. He stayed at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] from 1510 to 1515.<ref>{{acad|id=ERSS465D|name=Erasmus, Desiderius}}</ref> His rooms were in the \"I\" staircase of Old Court, and he famously hated English ale and English weather.\n\nErasmus suffered from poor health and complained that Queens' could not supply him with enough decent wine (wine was the Renaissance medicine for gallstones, from which Erasmus suffered). Until the early 20th-century, Queens' College used to have a corkscrew that was purported to be \"Erasmus' corkscrew\" which was a third of a metre long, though today the college still has what it calls \"Erasmus' chair\".<ref>John Twigg, A History of Queens' College, Cambridge 1448\u20131986 (Woodbridge, Suff.: Boydell Press, 1987).</ref> Today Queens' College has an Erasmus Building and an Erasmus Room. His legacy is marked for someone who complained bitterly about the lack of comforts and luxuries to which he was accustomed. As Queens' was an unusually humanist-leaning institution in the 16th century, [[Queens' College Old Library]] still houses many first editions of Erasmus' publications, many of which were acquired during that period by bequest or purchase, including Erasmus' New Testament translation which is signed by friend and Polish religious reformer [[Jan Laski]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Library Collections|website=Queens' College Cambridge.

Erasmus was particularly impressed by the Bible teaching of [[John Colet]] who pursued a style more akin to the [[church fathers]] than the [[Scholastics]]. This prompted him, upon his return from England, to master the Greek language, which would enable him to study theology on a more profound level and to prepare a new edition of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate|Bible translation]]. On one occasion he wrote to Colet: <blockquote>\n\"I cannot tell you, dear Colet, how I hurry on, with all sails set, to holy literature. How I dislike everything that keeps me back, or retards me\".<ref name = \"cmsmlw\"/>\n</blockquote>Despite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in learning Greek by an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, continuously begging his friends to send him books and money for teachers in his letters.<ref>Huizinga, Dutch edition, pp. 52\u201353.</ref> Discovery in 1506 of [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s ''New Testament Notes'' encouraged Erasmus to continue the study of the New Testament.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Anderson\n | first=Marvin\n | title=Erasmus the Exegete\n | journal=Concordia Theeological Monthly\n | volume=40\n | issue=11\n | year=1969\n | pages=722\u201346\n}}\n</ref>\n\nErasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit his freedom of intellect and literary expression. Throughout his life, he was offered positions of honor and profit in academia but declined them all, preferring the uncertain but sufficient rewards of independent literary activity. From 1506 to 1509, he was in Italy: in 1506 he graduated as [[Doctor of Divinity]] at the [[Turin]] [[University of Turin|University]], and he spent part of the time as a proofreader at the publishing house of [[Aldine Press|Aldus Manutius]] in [[Venice]]. According to his letters, he was associated with the Venetian natural philosopher, [[Giulio Camillo]],<ref>''Opus Epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterdami'', Ed. H.M.Allen, (Oxford University Press, 1937), Ep. 3032: 219\u201322; 2682: 8\u201313.</ref> but, apart from this, he had a less active association with Italian scholars than might have been expected.\n\nHis residence at Leuven, where he lectured at the [[Old University of Leuven|University]], exposed Erasmus to much criticism from those ascetics, academics and clerics hostile to the principles of literary and religious reform and the loose norms of the Renaissance adherents to which he was devoting his life. In 1517, he supported the foundation at the University, by his friend [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]], of the Collegium Trilingue for the study of [[Hebrew]], Latin, and Greek\u2014after the model of the College of the Three Languages at the [[Complutense University of Madrid#Early history|University of Alcal\u00e1]]. However, feeling that the lack of sympathy which prevailed at Leuven at that time was actually a form of mental persecution, he sought refuge in Basel, where under the shelter of Swiss hospitality he could express himself freely. Admirers from all quarters of Europe visited him there and he was surrounded by devoted friends, notably developing a lasting association with the great publisher [[Froben|Johann Froben]].\n\nOnly when he had mastered Latin did he begin to express himself on major contemporary themes in [[literature]] and [[religion]]. He felt called upon to use his learning in a purification of the doctrine by returning to the historic documents and original languages of sacred Scripture. He tried to free the methods of scholarship from the rigidity and formalism of medieval traditions, but he was not satisfied with this. His revolt against certain forms of [[Christian monasticism]] and scholasticism was not based on doubts about the truth of doctrine, nor from hostility to the organization of the Church itself, nor from rejection of [[celibacy]] or monastical lifestyles. He saw himself as a preacher of righteousness by an appeal to reason, applied frankly and without fear of the [[magisterium]]. He always intended to remain faithful to Catholic doctrine, and therefore was convinced he could criticize frankly virtually everyone and everything. Aloof from entangling obligations, Erasmus was the centre of the literary movement of his time, corresponding with more than five hundred men in the worlds of politics and of thought.\n\n==Spanish Polyglot Bible and Erasmus's Greek New Testament==\n===The First Translation===\nIn 1502, Spain, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros had put together a team of Spanish translators to create a [[Complutensian Polyglot|Compilation of a Bible in four languages]], Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin. Translators for Greek were commissioned from Greece itself and worked closely with prestigious Latinists and thalamic scholars.\n[[Cardinal Cisneros]]'s team completed and printed the full new testament, including the Greek translation, in 1514. To do so they developed specific types to print Greek. \nCisneros informed Erasmus of the works going on in Spain and may have sent a printed version of the New Testament to him. However, the Spanish team wanted the entire Bible to be released as one single work and withdrew from publication.\n\nThe information and the delay allowed Erasmus to request a \"Publication Privilege\" of four years for the Greek New Testament to ensure that his work would be published first. He obtained it in 1516 from both [[Pope Leo X]], to whom he'd dedicate his work, and [[Emperor Maximilian I]]. Erasmus's ' Greek New Testament to be published first, in 1516, forcing the Spanish team of Cisneros to wait until 1520 to publish their [[Complutensian Polyglot]].<ref>Mendoza, J.

The Spanish copy was approved for publication by the Pope in 1520, however, it wasn't released until 1522 due to the team's insistence on reviewing and editing. Only fifteen errors have been found in the entire six volumes and four languages of Cisneros's bible. A ridiculously low number for the time. The fear of them publishing though affected Erasmus's work, rushing him to printing and caused him to forego editing. The result was a large number of translation mistakes, transcription errors and typos that required further editions to be printed. (see \"publication\").<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"Epistle 694\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Volume 5'', 167. The Latin is ''pr\u0153cipitatum fuit verius quam editum''.</ref>\n\n===The Translation of Erasmus===\nErasmus had been working for years on two projects: a collation of Greek texts and a fresh Latin New Testament. In 1512, he began his work on this Latin New Testament. He collected all the Vulgate manuscripts he could find to create a [[critical edition]]. Then he polished the language. He declared, \"It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin.\"<ref>\"Epistle 695\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Vol. 5: Letters 594 to 841, 1517\u20131518'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 172.</ref> In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text:\n:\"My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome\u2019s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god. I have already almost finished emending him by collating a large number of ancient manuscripts, and this I am doing at enormous personal expense.\"<ref>\"Epistle 273\" in Collected ''Works of Erasmus Vol. 2: Letters 142 to 297, 1501\u20131514'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated Wallace K. Ferguson; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 253.</ref>\n\nWhile his intentions for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, it is less clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended to produce a critical Greek text or that he wanted to beat the Complutensian Polyglot into print, there is no evidence to support this. He wrote, \"There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me.\"<ref>\"Epistle 305\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus. Vol. 3: Letters 298 to 445, 1514\u20131516'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 32.</ref>\nHe further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work:\n:\"But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that often through the translator\u2019s clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep.\"<ref>\"Epistle 337\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus'' Vol. 3, 134.</ref>\nSo he included the Greek text to permit qualified readers to verify the quality of his Latin version. But by first calling the final product ''Novum Instrumentum omne'' (\"All of the New Teaching\") and later ''Novum Testamentum omne'' (\"All of the New Testament\") he also indicated clearly that he considered a text in which the Greek and the Latin versions were consistently comparable to be the essential core of the church's New Testament tradition.\n\n===Contribution===\nIn a way it is legitimate to say that Erasmus \"synchronized\" or \"unified\" the Greek and the Latin traditions of the New Testament by producing an updated version of either simultaneously. Both being part of canonical tradition, he clearly found it necessary to ensure that both were actually presenting the same content. In modern terminology, he made the two traditions \"compatible\". This is clearly evidenced by the fact that his Greek text is not just the basis for his Latin translation, but also the other way round: there are numerous instances where he edits the Greek text to reflect his Latin version. For instance, since the last six verses of ''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]'' were missing from his Greek manuscript, Erasmus translated the Vulgate's text back into Greek. Erasmus also translated the Latin text into Greek wherever he found that the Greek text and the accompanying commentaries were mixed up, or where he simply preferred the Vulgate\u2019s reading to the Greek text.<ref>E.g. at Acts 9:6.

After comparing what writings he could find, Erasmus wrote corrections between the lines of the manuscripts he was using (among which was [[Minuscule 2]]) and sent them as proofs to Froben.<ref name=\"SH\">[http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&bookID=encyc02&page=106&view= \"History of the Printed Text\"], in: ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. II: Basilica \u2013 Chambers'', p. 106 ff.</ref> His hurried effort was published by his friend [[Johann Froben]] of Basel in 1516 and thence became the first published Greek New Testament, the ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]], diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum''. Erasmus used several Greek manuscript sources because he did not have access to a single complete manuscript. Most of the manuscripts were, however, late Greek manuscripts of the Byzantine textual family and Erasmus used the oldest manuscript the least because \"he was afraid of its supposedly erratic text.\"<ref>Bruce Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 102.</ref> He also ignored much older and better manuscripts that were at his disposal.<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) ''Tyndale's Testament'', Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn the second (1519) edition, the more familiar term ''Testamentum'' was used instead of ''Instrumentum''. This edition was used by [[Martin Luther]] in his [[Luther Bible|German translation of the Bible]], written for people who could not understand Latin. Together, the first and second editions sold 3,300 copies. By comparison, only 600 copies of the Complutensian Polyglot were ever printed. The first and second edition texts did not include the passage (1 John 5:7\u20138) that has become known as the [[Comma Johanneum]]. Erasmus had been unable to find those verses in any Greek manuscript, but one was supplied to him during production of the third edition. That manuscript is now thought to be a 1520 creation from the [[Latin Vulgate]], which likely got the verses from a fifth-century marginal gloss in a Latin copy of I John. The Roman Catholic Church decreed that the ''Comma Johanneum'' was open to dispute (2 June 1927), and it is rarely included in modern scholarly translations.\n\nThe third edition of 1522 was probably used by [[Tyndale]] for the first English New Testament (Worms, 1526) and was the basis for the 1550 Robert Stephanus edition used by the translators of the [[Geneva Bible]] and [[King James Version]] of the English Bible. Erasmus published a fourth edition in 1527 containing parallel columns of Greek, Latin Vulgate and Erasmus's Latin texts. In this edition Erasmus also supplied the Greek text of the last six verses of [[Revelation]] (which he had translated from Latin back into Greek in his first edition) from [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Ximenez]]'s ''[[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Biblia Complutensis]]''. In 1535 Erasmus published the fifth (and final) edition which dropped the Latin Vulgate column but was otherwise similar to the fourth edition. Later versions of the Greek New Testament by others, but based on Erasmus's Greek New Testament, became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]''.\n\nErasmus dedicated his work to [[Pope Leo X]] as a patron of learning and regarded this work as his chief service to the cause of Christianity. Immediately afterward, he began the publication of his ''[[Paraphrases of Erasmus|Paraphrases of the New Testament]]'', a popular presentation of the contents of the several books. These, like all of his writings, were published in Latin but were quickly translated into other languages, with his encouragement.\n\nErasmus, in his capacity as humanist editor, advised major printers such as Aldus Manutis on which manuscripts to publish. <ref>Murray, Stuart. 2009. The library: an illustrated history. Chicago, ALA Editions</ref>\n\n==Beginnings of Protestantism==\n\n===Attempts at impartiality in dispute===\n[[Protestant Reformation|Martin Luther's movement]] began in the year following the publication of the New Testament and tested Erasmus' character. The issues between growing religious movements, which would later become known as [[Protestantism]], and the [[Catholic Church]] had become so clear that few could escape the summons to join the debate. Erasmus, at the height of his literary fame, was inevitably called upon to take sides, but partisanship was foreign to his nature and his habits. In all his criticism of clerical follies and abuses, he had always protested that he was not attacking the Church itself or its doctrines, and had no enmity toward churchmen. The world had laughed at his [[satire]], but few had interfered with his activities. He believed that his work so far had commended itself to the best minds and also to the dominant powers in the religious world.\n\nErasmus did not build a large body of supporters with his letters. He chose to write in Greek and Latin, the languages of scholars. His critiques reached an elite but small audience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Peter G.|title=European History in Perspective: The Long European Reformation|year=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-333-64451-5|page=70}}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement with Luther===\n\"Free will does not exist\", according to Luther in his letter ''[[w:On the Bondage of the Will|De Servo Arbitrio]]'' to Erasmus translated into German by [[Justus Jonas]] (1526) in that sin makes human beings completely incapable of bringing themselves to God. Noting Luther's criticism of the Catholic Church, Erasmus described him as \"a mighty trumpet of gospel truth\" while agreeing, \"It is clear that many of the reforms for which Luther calls are urgently needed.\u201d<ref name=\"Galli, Mark 2000, p. 344\">Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. 131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference, 2000, p. 344.</ref> He had great respect for Luther, and Luther spoke with admiration of Erasmus's superior learning. Luther hoped for his cooperation in a work which seemed only the natural outcome of his own. In their early correspondence, Luther expressed boundless admiration for all Erasmus had done in the cause of a sound and reasonable Christianity and urged him to join the Lutheran party. Erasmus declined to commit himself, arguing that to do so would endanger his position as a leader in the movement for pure scholarship which he regarded as his purpose in life. Only as an independent scholar could he hope to influence the reform of religion. When Erasmus hesitated to support him, the straightforward Luther became angered that Erasmus was avoiding the responsibility due either to [[cowardice]] or a lack of purpose. However, any hesitancy on the part of Erasmus stemmed, not from lack of courage or conviction, but rather from a concern over the mounting disorder and violence of the reform movement. To [[Philip Melanchthon]] in 1524 he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I know nothing of your church; at the very least it contains people who will, I fear, overturn the whole system and drive the princes into using force to restrain good men and bad alike. The gospel, the word of God, faith, Christ, and Holy Spirit \u2013 these words are always on their lips; look at their lives and they speak quite another language.<ref>{{cite book| chapter=Letter of September 6, 1524| title= Collected Works of Erasmus| year= 1992 | publisher=University of Toronto Press| volume=10| isbn= 0-8020-5976-7 |page= 380 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=bYVEgXbiunkC&pg=PA380&dq=%22gospel,+the+word+of+God,+faith,+Christ,+and+Holy+Spirit%22#v=onepage&q=%22gospel%2C%20the%20word%20of%20God%2C%20faith%2C%20Christ%2C%20and%20Holy%20Spirit%22&f=false}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAgain, in 1529, he writes \u201cAn epistle against those who falsely boast they are Evangelicals\u201d<ref>Epistola contra quosdam qui se falso iactant evangelicos.</ref> to Vulturius Neocomus ([[w:Gerard Geldenhouwer|Gerardus Geldenhouwer]]). Here Erasmus complains of the doctrines and morals of the Reformers:\n\n<blockquote>You declaim bitterly against the luxury of priests, the ambition of bishops, the tyranny of the Roman Pontiff, and the babbling of the sophists; against our prayers, fasts, and Masses; and you are not content to retrench the abuses that may be in these things, but must needs abolish them entirely...<br>Look around on this \u2018Evangelical\u2019 generation,<ref>\"Circumspice populum istum Euangelicum\u2026\" Latin text in Erasmus, ''Opera Omnia'', (1706), vol. 10, 1578BC.

In book I of his ''Hyperaspistes'' he puts the matter bluntly to Luther:\n<blockquote>We are dealing with this: Would a stable mind depart from the opinion handed down by so many men famous for holiness and miracles, depart from the decisions of the Church, and commit our souls to the faith of someone like you who has sprung up just now with a few followers, although the leading men of your flock do not agree either with you or among themselves \u2013 indeed though you do not even agree with yourself, since in this same ''Assertion''<ref>A reference to Luther's ''Assertio omnium articulorum per bullam Leonis X. novissimam damnatorum'' (Assertion of all the Articles condemned by the Bull of Leo X, 1520), [[Weimar edition of Martin Luther's works|WA]] VII.</ref> you say one thing in the beginning and something else later on, recanting what you said before.<ref>''Collected Works of Erasmus, Controversies: De Libero Arbitrio / Hyperaspistes I'', Peter Macardle, Clarence H.

I doubt that either side in the dispute can be suppressed without grave loss.\"<ref name=\"Galli, Mark 2000, p. 344\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn his [[catechism]] (entitled ''Explanation of the [[Apostles' Creed]]'') (1533), Erasmus took a stand against Luther's teaching by asserting the unwritten [[Sacred Tradition]] as just as valid a source of revelation as the [[Bible]], by enumerating the [[Deuterocanonical books]] in the [[Biblical canon|canon of the Bible]] and by acknowledging seven [[sacraments]].<ref>''Opera omnia Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami'', vol.

Erasmus, they said, had laid the egg, and Luther had hatched it. Erasmus wittily dismissed the charge, claiming that Luther had hatched a different bird entirely.\".<ref>[http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/reynoldserasmusresponsibleluther.pdf ''Concordia Theological Journal''] Was Erasmus Responsible for Luther?

One of the topics he dealt with was free will, a crucial question. In his ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio]]'' (1524), he lampoons the Lutheran view on free will. He lays down both sides of the argument impartially. The \"Diatribe\" did not encourage any definite action; this was its merit to the Erasmians and its fault in the eyes of the Lutherans. In response, Luther wrote his ''De servo arbitrio'' ([[On the Bondage of the Will]]) (1525), which attacks the \"Diatribe\" and Erasmus himself, going so far as to claim that Erasmus was not a Christian. Erasmus responded with a lengthy, two-part ''Hyperaspistes'' (1526\u201327). In this controversy Erasmus lets it be seen that he would like to claim more for free will than St. Paul and St. Augustine seem to allow according to Luther's interpretation.<ref>Britannica Online Encyclopedia, Desiderius Erasmus ''Dutch humanist and scholar'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/191015/Desiderius-Erasmus/59231/The-Protestant-challenge#ref=ref24610The Protestant challenge]</ref> For Erasmus the essential point is that humans have the freedom of choice.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Watson\n | first=Philip\n | title=Erasmus, Luther and Aquinas\n | journal=Concordia Theological Monthly\n | volume=40\n | issue=11\n | year=1969\n | pages=747\u201358\n }}work\n</ref> The conclusions Erasmus reached drew upon a large array of notable authorities, including, from the Patristic period, Origen, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine, in addition to many leading Scholastic authors, such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus.

If these were the outcomes of reform, he was thankful that he had kept out of it. Yet he was ever more bitterly accused of having started the whole \"tragedy\" (as the Catholics dubbed Protestantism).\n\nWhen the city of Basel definitely adopted the Reformation in 1529, Erasmus gave up his residence there and settled in the imperial town of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]].\n\n[[File:Hans Holbein d.

For example, in ''De libero arbitrio'', opposing certain views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, \"because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived.\" Gary Remer writes, \"Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors.\"<ref>Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996), p. 95 {{ISBN|0-271-02811-4}}</ref> Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, \"It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him.\"<ref>Froude, James Anthony\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=ussXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA359&dq=erasmus+heretics+kill&hl=en&ei=V31mTcm-F8K_tgeRtaXmAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Life and letters of Erasmus: lectures delivered at Oxford 1893\u20134''] (London: Longmans, Green & Co. 1894), p. 359</ref>\n\n===Sacraments===\n[[File:4146 Print 13077kopie.jpg|thumb|230x230px|Erasmus by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter I Brueghel]], [[The Phoebus Foundation]] ]]\nA test of the Reformation was the doctrine of the [[sacrament]]s, and the crux of this question was the observance of the [[Eucharist]]. In 1530, Erasmus published a new edition of the orthodox treatise of [[Algerus]] against the heretic [[Berengar of Tours]] in the eleventh century. He added a dedication, affirming his belief in the reality of the Body of Christ after consecration in the Eucharist, commonly referred to as [[transubstantiation]]. The [[sacramentarian]]s, headed by [[Johannes Oecolampadius|\u0152colampadius]] of Basel, were, as Erasmus says, quoting him as holding views similar to their own in order to try to claim him for their schismatic and \"erroneous\" movement.\n\n==Death==\nWhen his strength began to fail, he decided to accept an invitation by [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Queen Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands]], to move from Freiburg to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. However, during preparations for the move in 1536, he suddenly died from an attack of [[dysentery]] during a visit to [[Basel]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Desiderius Erasmus}}</ref> He had remained loyal to the papal authorities in Rome, but he did not have the opportunity to receive the [[last rites]] of the Catholic Church; and whether he asked for a priest or not is nowhere mentioned in the reports of his death. According to Jan van Herwaarden, this is consistent with his view that outward signs were not important; what mattered is the believer's direct relationship with God, which he noted \"as the [Catholic] church believes\". However, Herwaarden observes that \"he did not dismiss the rites and sacraments out of hand but asserted a dying person could achieve a state of salvation without the priestly rites, provided their faith and spirit were attuned to God.\"<ref>{{citation |author=Jan Van Herwaarden |title=Between Saint James and Erasmus: Studies in Late Medieval Religious Life |location=Leiden |publisher=BRILL |year=2003 |pages=529\u2013530 |isbn=9789004129849}}</ref> He was buried with great ceremony in [[Basel Minster]] (the former [[cathedral]]) there.<ref name=\"Church 1924\"/>\n\nHis last words, as recorded by his friend [[Beatus Rhenanus]], were apparently \"''Dear God''\" ({{lang-nl|Lieve God}}).<ref>Huizinga, Dutch edition, p. 202.</ref> A bronze statue of him was erected in the city of his birth in 1622, replacing an earlier work in stone.\n\n==Writings==\nErasmus wrote both on [[ecclesiastic]] subjects and those of general human interest. By the 1530s, the writings of Erasmus accounted for 10 to 20 percent of all book sales in Europe.<ref>Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. ''131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference,'' 2000, 343.</ref>  He is credited with coining the adage, \"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.\"  With the collaboration of [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], he formed a [[Paremiography]] (collection) of Latin [[proverb]]s and adages, commonly titled ''[[Adagia]]''.  Erasmus is also generally credited with originating the phrase \"[[Pandora's box]]\", arising through an error in his translation of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Pandora]]'' in which he confused ''pithos'' (storage jar) with ''pyxis'' (box).\n\nHis more serious writings begin early with the ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]],'' the \"Handbook of the Christian Soldier\" (1503) (translated into English a few years later by the young [[William Tyndale]]).  (A more literal translation of ''enchiridion'' - 'dagger' - has been likened to \"the spiritual equivalent of the modern [[Swiss Army knife]].\")<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid.  Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years. New York: Viking, 2010, 599.</ref> In this short work, Erasmus outlines the views of the normal Christian life, which he was to spend the rest of his days elaborating.  The chief evil of the day, he says, is formalism - going through the motions of tradition without understanding their basis in the teachings of Christ.  Forms can teach the soul how to worship God, or they may hide or quench the spirit.  In his examination of the dangers of formalism, Erasmus discusses monasticism, saint worship, war, the spirit of class and the foibles of \"society.\"\n\nThe ''Enchiridion'' is more like a sermon than a satire.  With it Erasmus challenged common assumptions, painting the clergy as educators who should share the treasury of their knowledge with the laity.  He emphasized personal spiritual disciplines, and called for a reformation which he characterized as a collective return to the Fathers and Scripture.  Most importantly, he extolled the reading of scripture as vital because of its power to transform and motivate toward love.  Much like the Brethren of the Common Life, he wrote that the New Testament is the law of Christ people are called to obey and that Christ is the example they are called to imitate.\n\nAccording to [[Ernest Barker]], \"Besides his work on the New Testament, Erasmus laboured also, and even more arduously, on the [[Church Fathers|early Fathers]]. [\u2026] Among the Latin Fathers he edited the works of [[St Jerome]], [[Hilary of Poitiers|St Hilary]], and [[St Augustine]]; among the Greeks he worked on [[Irenaeus]], [[Origen]] and [[Chrysostom]].\"<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1948) ''Traditions of Civility'', chapter 4: The Connection between the Renaissance and the Reformation, pp. 93\u201394, [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref>\n\nErasmus also wrote of the legendary [[Frisians|Frisian]] freedom fighter and rebel [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] (Greate Pier), though more often in criticism than in praise of his exploits.  Erasmus saw him as a dim, brutal man who preferred physical strength to wisdom.<ref name=\"erasmus\">The Age of Erasmus, Lectures Delivered in the Universities of Oxford and London, by P. S. Allen, Clarendon Press 1914</ref>\n\n[[File:HolbeinErasmusFollymarginalia.jpg|upright|thumb|Marginal drawing of Folly by Hans Holbein in the first edition of Erasmus's ''Praise of Folly'', 1515]]\n\nOne of Erasmus's best-known works, inspired by ''De triumpho stultitiae'' (written by Italian humanist [[Faustino Perisauli]]), is ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'', published under the double title ''Moriae encomium'' (Greek, Latinised) and ''Laus stultitiae'' (Latin).<ref>[http://www.ub.unibas.ch/kadmos/gg/picpage/gg0015_009_tit.htm Early title page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112141116/http://www.ub.unibas.ch/kadmos/gg/picpage/gg0015_009_tit.htm |date=12 November 2007 }}</ref>  A satirical attack on superstitions and other traditions of European society in general and the western Church in particular, it was written in 1509, published in 1511, and dedicated to Sir Thomas More, whose name the title puns.\n\nThe ''[[Education of a Christian Prince|Institutio principis Christiani]]'' (''Education of a Christian Prince'') (Basel, 1516) was written as advice to the young king Charles of Spain (later [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]).  Erasmus applies the general principles of honor and sincerity to the special functions of the Prince, whom he represents throughout as the servant of the people.  ''Education'' was published in 1516, three years after<ref>{{cite book|last=Spielvogel|first=Jackson J.|title=Western Civilization, Eighth Edition, Volume B: 1300\u20131815|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-1-111-34215-9|page=353}}</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]\u2019s ''[[The Prince]]''; a comparison between the two is worth noting.  Machiavelli stated that, to maintain control by political force, it is safer for a prince to be feared than loved.  Erasmus preferred for the prince to be loved, and strongly suggested a well-rounded education in order to govern justly and benevolently and avoid becoming a source of oppression.\n\nAs a result of his reformatory activities, Erasmus found himself at odds with both the great parties.  His last years were embittered by controversies with men toward whom he was sympathetic.  Notable among these was [[Ulrich von Hutten]], a brilliant but erratic genius, who had thrown himself into the Lutheran cause and declared that Erasmus, if he had a spark of honesty, would do the same.  In his reply in 1523, ''Spongia adversus aspergines Hutteni'', Erasmus displays his skill in [[semantics]].  He accuses Hutten of having misinterpreted his utterances about reform and reiterates his determination never to break with the Church.\n\nThe ''[[Ciceronianus]]'' came out in 1528, attacking the style of Latin that was based exclusively and fanatically on Cicero's writings.  Etienne Dolet wrote a riposte titled ''Erasmianus'' in 1535.\n\nErasmus's last major work, published the year of his death, is the ''[[Ecclesiastes of Erasmus|Ecclesiastes]]'' or \"Gospel Preacher\" (Basel, 1536), a massive manual for preachers of around a thousand pages. Though somewhat unwieldy because Erasmus was unable to edit it properly in his old age, it is in some ways the culmination of all of Erasmus' literary and theological learning, offering prospective preachers advice on nearly every conceivable aspect of their vocation with extraordinarily abundant reference to classical and biblical sources.\n\n===''Sileni Alcibiadis'' (1515)===\nErasmus\u2019s ''Sileni Alcibiadis'' is one of his most direct assessments of the need for Church reform.  Johann Froben published it first within a revised edition of the ''Adagia'' in 1515, then as a stand-alone work in 1517.  This essay has been likened to John Colet\u2019s ''Convocation Sermon'', though the styles differ.\n\n''Sileni'' is the plural (Latin) form of ''Silenus'', a creature often related to the Roman wine god [[Bacchus]] and represented in pictorial art as inebriated, merry revellers, variously mounted on donkeys, singing, dancing, playing flutes etc. [[Alcibiades]] was a Greek politician in the 5th century BCE and a general in the [[Peloponnesian War]]; he figures here more as a character written into some of Plato's dialogues\u2014a young, debauched playboy whom Socrates tries to convince to seek truth instead of pleasure, wisdom instead of pomp and splendor.\n\nThe term ''Sileni''\u2014especially when juxtaposed with the character of Alcibiades\u2014can therefore be understood as an evocation of the notion that something on the inside is more expressive of a person's character than what one sees on the outside.  For instance, something or someone ugly on the outside can be beautiful on the inside, which is one of the main points of Plato's dialogues featuring ''Alcibiades'' and the ''Symposion'', in which Alcibiades also appears.\n\nIn support of this, Erasmus states, \"Anyone who looks closely at the inward nature and essence will find that nobody is further from true wisdom than those people with their grand titles, learned bonnets, splendid sashes and bejeweled rings, who profess to be wisdom\u2019s peak\".  Erasmus lists several Sileni and then questions whether Christ is the most noticeable Silenus of them all.  The [[Apostles]] were Sileni since they were ridiculed by others.  He believes that the things which are the least ostentatious can be the most significant, and that the Church constitutes all Christian people \u2014that despite contemporary references to clergy as the whole of the Church, they are merely its servants.  He criticizes those that spend the Church\u2019s riches at the people\u2019s expense.  The true point of the Church is to help people lead Christian lives.  Priests are supposed to be pure, yet when they stray away, no one condemns them.  He criticizes the riches of the popes, believing that it would be better for the Gospel to be most important.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe popularity of his books is reflected in the number of editions and translations that have appeared since the sixteenth century. Ten columns of the catalogue of the British Library are taken up with the enumeration of the works and their subsequent reprints. The greatest names of the classical and patristic world are among those translated, edited, or annotated by Erasmus, including Saint [[Ambrose]], [[Aristotle]], Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], Saint [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], Saint [[John Chrysostom]], [[Cicero]] and Saint Jerome.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn his native Rotterdam, the [[Erasmus Universiteit|University]] and [[Gymnasium Erasmianum]] have been named in his honor. In 2003, a poll showing that most Rotterdammers believed Erasmus to be the designer of the local \"Erasmus Bridge\" instigated the founding of the Erasmus House (Rotterdam),<ref>[http://www.erasmushuisrotterdam.nl/ Erasmushuis]</ref> and the [[Erasmus House (Jakarta)]]<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2000/03/27/dutch-cultural-center-erasmus-huis-turns-30.html Dutch cultural center Erasmus Huis turns 30 ], the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'', 27 March 2000</ref>  dedicated to celebrating Erasmus's legacy. Three moments in Erasmus's life are celebrated annually. On 1 April, the city celebrates the publication of his best-known book ''The Praise of Folly''. On 11 July, the ''Night of Erasmus'' celebrates the lasting influence of his work. His birthday is celebrated on 28 October.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nErasmus's reputation and the interpretations of his work have varied over time. Moderate Catholics recognized him as a leading figure in attempts to reform the Church, while Protestants recognized his initial support for Luther's ideas and the groundwork he laid for the future Reformation, especially in biblical scholarship. By the 1560s, however, there was a marked change in reception.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Erasmus censored.png|right|thumb|Erasmus of Rotterdam censored by the Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]\n\nAccording to [[Franz Anton Knittel]], Erasmus in his ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]]'' did not incorporate the ''[[Comma Johanneum|Comma]]'' from the [[Codex Montfortianus]], because of grammar differences, but used [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglotta]]. According to him the ''Comma'' was known to [[Tertullian]].<ref>Knittel, ''Neue Kritiken \u00fcber den ber\u00fchmten Sprych: Drey sind, die da zeugen im Himmel, der Vater, das Wort, und der heilige Geist, und diese drei sind eins'' Braunschweig 1785</ref>\n\nProtestant views of Erasmus fluctuated depending on region and period, with continual support in his native Netherlands and in cities of the Upper Rhine area. However, following his death and in the late sixteenth century, many Reformation supporters saw Erasmus's critiques of Luther and lifelong support for the universal Catholic Church as damning, and second-generation Protestants were less vocal in their debts to the great humanist. Nevertheless, his reception is demonstrable among Swiss Protestants in the sixteenth-century: he had an indelible influence on the biblical commentaries of, for example, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Bullinger, and John Calvin, all of whom used both his annotations on the New Testament and his paraphrases of same in their own New Testament commentaries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Erasmus and Calvin on the Foolishness of God: Reason and Emotion in the Christian Philosophy  |last=Essary |first=Kirk |year=2017 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781487501884}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Erasmus designated his own legacy and his life works were turned over at his death to his friend the Protestant humanist turned remonstrator [[Sebastian Castellio]] for the repair of the breach and divide of Christianity in its Catholic, Anabaptist, and Protestant branches.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sebastian Castellio, 1515-1563; Humanist and Defender of Religious Toleration in a Confessional Age; Translated and Edited by Bruce Gordon  |last=Guggisbert |first=Hans |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Hants England; Burlington, Vermont, USA |isbn=0754630196}}</ref>\n\nBy the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], however, Erasmus increasingly again became a more widely respected cultural symbol and was hailed as an important figure by increasingly broad groups. In a letter to a friend, Erasmus once had written: \"That you are patriotic will be praised by many and easily forgiven by everyone; but in my opinion it is wiser to treat men and things as though we held this world the common fatherland of all.\"<ref>Letter 480, to Bud\u00e9 (ed.

([[Louvre]])]]\n* [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] painted him at least three times, and perhaps as many as seven; some only survive in versions by other artists. His three profile portraits of Erasmus, two (nearly identical) profile portraits and one three-quarters view portrait were all painted in the same year, 1523. Erasmus used the Holbein portraits as gifts for his friends in England, such as [[William Warham]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (as he writes in a letter to Warham regarding the gift portrait, Erasmus quips that \"he might have something of Erasmus should God call him from this place.\") Erasmus spoke favourably of Holbein as an artist and person, but later criticized Holbein whom he had accused of sponging off various patrons to whom Erasmus had recommended, for purposes more of monetary gain than artistic endeavor.\n* [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] also produced portraits of Erasmus, whom he met three times, in the form of an [[engraving]] of 1526 and a preliminary charcoal sketch. Concerning the former Erasmus was unimpressed, declaring it an unfavourable likeness of him. Nevertheless, Erasmus and D\u00fcrer maintained a close friendship, with D\u00fcrer going so far as to solicit Erasmus's support for the Lutheran cause, which Erasmus politely declined. Erasmus wrote a glowing ''[[encomium]]'' about the artist, likening him to famous Greek painter of antiquity [[Apelles]]. Erasmus was deeply affected by his death in 1528.\n* [[Quentin Matsys]] produced the earliest known portraits of Erasmus, including an oil painting in 1517 and a medallion in 1519.\n* In 1622, [[Hendrick de Keyser]] cast a statue of Erasmus in bronze replacing an earlier stone version from 1557.

The series of 29 [[Children's literature|children's novels]] was written (one co-written) by [[Donald J. Sobol]], with the first book published in 1963 and the last novel published posthumously, in 2012.  The Encyclopedia Brown series has spawned a comic strip, a TV series, and compilation books of puzzles and games.\n\n==Style==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2012}}\nEach book in the ''Encyclopedia Brown'' mystery series is self-contained in that the reader is not required to have read earlier books in order to understand the stories. The major characters, settings, etc. are usually introduced (or reintroduced) in each book.\n\nBooks featuring Brown are subdivided into a number\u2014usually ten or more\u2014of (possibly interlinked) short stories, each of which presents a [[Mystery fiction|mystery]]. The mysteries are intended to be solved by the reader, thanks to the placement of a logical or factual inconsistency somewhere within the text. This is very similar to the layout of Donald Sobol's other book series, ''Two-Minute Mysteries''. Brown, his father, or Sally Kimball invariably solves the case by exposing this inconsistency, in the \"Answers\" section in the back of the book.\n\n==Formula==\n\nOften, these books follow a formula wherein the first chapter involves Brown solving a case at the dinner table for his father, the local police chief in the fictional seaside town of Idaville in an unspecified state. When Chief Brown barely tastes his meal, that is a cue he was handed a difficult case. He pulls out his casebook and goes over it with the family. Encyclopedia solves these cases by briefly closing his eyes while he thinks deeply, then asking a single question which directly leads to him finding the solution.\n\nThe second mystery often begins in the Brown garage on Rover Avenue, where Encyclopedia has set up his own detective agency to help neighborhood children solve cases for \"25 cents per day, plus expenses - No case too small.\" This second case usually involves the [[Bullying|town bully]] and [[mischief]] maker Bugs Meany, leader of a gang who call themselves the Tigers, who, after being foiled, will attempt revenge in the third mystery.\n\nIn the third mystery, the plot involves Encyclopedia's partner, close friend, and bodyguard, [[Sally Kimball]], the one person under 14 years of age to physically stand up to Bugs. She is the only reason neither Bugs nor any of his Tigers ever try to physically attack Encyclopedia. Encyclopedia tends to dislike anyone whom Sally has a crush on, possibly indicating that he has a crush on her. Also intelligent, Sally once attempted\u2014in the first book of the series\u2014to prove herself smarter than Encyclopedia by stumping him with a mystery of her own creation. Ironically the contest was held at the Tigers' clubhouse, with Bugs and the others cheering him on. However, she was beaten in the contest (although Encyclopedia admitted that she almost tricked him), after which she became his friend. In subsequent storylines Bugs or his gang usually set up some sort of trap to get Encyclopedia or Sally in trouble. However, as in the previous story, they make a key mistake which Encyclopedia exposes.\n\nLater cases may find Encyclopedia assisting his father at a crime scene (rarely more serious than [[larceny]], and Encyclopedia is always discreet when helping his father) or interacting with people around town, often exposing scams. One such example is a high school dropout and would-be [[con artist]] named Wilford Wiggins who spends time trying to dream up schemes to fleece kids out of their money. Like Bugs, his schemes have an inconsistency which Encyclopedia exposes.\n\nIn some cases it is Sally and not Encyclopedia who figures it out because, as she tells Encyclopedia, \"You are a boy.\" In other words, she notices things that only a girl would find inconsistent. Sally further displays her intelligence in the various mysteries in that she often can deduce who committed the crime, or whether a certain person is lying, but she simply cannot always prove it.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n\n* Chief Brown, Encyclopedia's father and Idaville's Chief of Police\n* Mrs. Brown, Encyclopedia's mother\n* [[Sally Kimball]], Encyclopedia's friend, business partner & bodyguard\n* Encyclopedia's friends:\n** Charlie Stewart, who collects animal teeth\n** Cicero Sturgess, Idaville's leading child actor\n** Benny Breslin, whose loud snoring often proves to be a nuisance on camping trips\n** Pablo Pizarro, Idaville's leading child artist\n** Tyrone Taylor\n** Pinky Plummer\n** Billy and Jody Turner\n** Herb Stein\n** Mort \"Fangs\" Liveright, who can open a bottle of root beer with his teeth\n* Main antagonists:\n** The Tigers: neighborhood bullies whose clubhouse is an unused toolshed behind Mr. Sweeney's Auto Body Shop. The author frequently introduces them by suggesting a different name as an insult, e.g. \"They called themselves the Tigers. They should have called themselves the Mountaineers. They were never on the level.\"\n*** Bugs Meany (the leader)\n*** Duke Kelly\n*** Rocky Graham\n*** Spike Larsen\n*** Ike Cassidy\n*** Dutch Kuller\n*** Rowdy Quilp\n*** Carl Higgensbottom\n*** Rusty Malone\n*** Monk Walsh\n*** Mugsy Moonsooner\n*** Jimbo Dawson\n*** Roscoe Tenn\n*** Jess Rae\n** Wilford Wiggins, a high school dropout who always tries to get kids to invest in assorted \"get rich quick\" schemes, but is inevitably thwarted by Encyclopedia\n\n==Comic strip==\n[[File:Encyclopedia Brown strip.png|alt=]]\n\nFrom December 3, 1978, to September 20, 1980, Encyclopedia Brown was a daily and Sunday comic strip syndicated by [[Universal Press Syndicate]].  The artwork was done by [[Frank Bolle]], and Donald J. Sobol was credited as the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2010/02/obscurity-of-day-encyclopedia-brown.html |title=Stripper's Guide: Obscurity of the Day: Encyclopedia Brown |publisher=Strippersguide.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe ''Encyclopedia Brown'' books experienced some enduring popularity.\n\nIn 1976, the [[Mystery Writers of America]] honored Sobol and his Encyclopedia Brown series with a special [[Edgar Award]].<ref>{{cite web|website=The Edgars|url=http://www.theedgars.com/edgarsDB/index.php |title=The Edgar Awards}}</ref>\n\nEducators have used Encyclopedia Brown in classrooms to instruct students in skills such as writing reports. In 1986, the Society for Visual Education, Inc. published a filmstrip series, produced and written by Lynne V. Gibbs, with accompanying audio cassette tapes and workbooks for elementary and middle schools' use. The following four Encyclopedia Brown stories were utilized: ''The Case of the Missing Statue, The Case of the Happy Nephew, The Case of the Kidnapped Pigs'', and ''The Case of the Marble Shooter''. According to [[WorldCat]]'s library catalog listing, \"As super-sleuth Encyclopedia Brown solves four mysteries, he shows students how he fills out his reports, including selecting a topic, gathering information, taking notes, making an outline, and revising and editing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/encyclopedia-brown-introduces-report-writing-skills/oclc/16980494|title=Encyclopedia Brown Introduces Report Writing Skills|website=Worldcat}}</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n===TV series on HBO===\nA  [[live action]] television series adaptation, also called ''Encyclopedia Brown'' ran on [[HBO]] starting in 1989.

The territory and population of an empire is commonly of greater extent than the one of a kingdom.<ref>''Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language'', Portland House, New York, 1989, p. 468.</ref>\n\nAn empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] or the [[Russian Empire]], or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a [[colonial empire]]. Aside from the more formal usage, the word ''empire'' can also refer [[colloquialism|colloquially]] to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a [[transnational corporation]]), a political organisation controlled by a single individual (a [[political boss]]), or a group (political bosses).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/61337|title=Empire |work=Oxford Dictionary Online|subscription=yes|access-date=21 October 2014}}</ref> The word ''empire'' is associated with such other words as ''[[imperialism]]'', ''[[colonialism]]'', and ''[[globalization]]''. Empire is often used to describe a displeasure to overpowering situations.{{sfn|Howe|2002}}\n\nAn imperial [[political structure]] can be established and maintained in two ways: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion.<ref>Ross Hassig, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest'' (1994), pp. 23\u201324, {{ISBN|0-582-06829-0}} (pbk)</ref> Territorial empires (e.g. the [[Mongol Empire]] and [[Median Empire]]) tend to be [[Connected space|contiguous]] areas. The term, on occasion, has been applied to [[shipping|maritime]] empires or [[thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] (e.g. the [[Delian League|Athenian]] and [[British Empire|British empires]]) with looser structures and more scattered territories.\n\nThis aspiration to universality resulted in conquest by converting 'outsiders' or 'inferiors' into the colonialized religion. This association of nationality and race became complex and has had a more intense drive for expansion.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=10-15}}\n\n==Definition==\nAn empire is a multi-ethnic or multinational state with political and/or military dominion of populations who are culturally and ethnically distinct from the imperial (ruling) ethnic group and its culture.<ref>''The Oxford English Reference Dictionary'', Second Edition (2001), p. 461, {{ISBN|0-19-860046-1}}</ref> This is in contrast to a [[federation]], which is an extensive state voluntarily composed of autonomous states and peoples. An empire is a large polity which rules over territories outside of its original borders.\n\nDefinitions of what physically and politically constitute an empire vary. It might be a state affecting [[imperialism|imperial policies]] or a particular [[Structuralism|political structure]]. Empires are typically formed from diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious components.<ref>{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Stephen|title=Empire|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-280223-1|page=15}}</ref> 'Empire' and 'colonialism' are used to refer to relationships between powerful state or society versus a less powerful one.\n\n[[Tom Nairn]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] define empires as polities that \"extend relations of power across territorial spaces over which they have no prior or given legal sovereignty, and where, in one or more of the domains of economics, politics, and culture, they gain some measure of extensive hegemony over those spaces for the purpose of extracting or accruing value\".<ref>{{Cite book | year= 2006 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Nairn | first2= Tom | title= Globalization and Violence, Vol. 1: Globalizing Empires, Old and New | url= https://www.academia.edu/3587722/Globalization_and_Violence_Vol._1_Globalizing_Empires_editor_with_Tom_Nairn_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page= xxiii}}</ref> [[Rein Taagepera]] has defined an empire as \"any relatively large sovereign political entity whose components are not sovereign\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taagepera|first1=Rein|date=1979|title=Size and Duration of Empires: Growth-Decline Curves, 600 B.C. to 600 A.D.|journal=Social Science History|volume=3|issue=3/4|page=117|doi=10.2307/1170959|jstor=1170959}}</ref>\n\nSometimes, an empire is a semantic construction, such as when a ruler assumes the title of \"emperor\".<ref>{{Cite web|access-date=26 October 2018|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/empire|quote=any monarchy that for reasons of history, prestige, etc, has an emperor rather than a king as head of state|title=empire|work=The Free Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|access-date=26 October 2018|publisher=LoveToKnow, Corp.|date=2018|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/empire|quote=government by an emperor or empress|title=empire|work=Your Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|access-date=26 October 2018|url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/empire|quote=a monarchy with an emperor as head of state|title=empire|work=Vocabulary.com Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|access-date=26 October 2018|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/empire|quote=government by an emperor or empress|title=empire|work=Collins English Dictionary|date=2018}}</ref> That ruler's nation logically becomes an \"empire\", despite having no additional territory or hegemony. Examples of this form of empire are the [[Central African Empire]], or the [[Korean Empire]] proclaimed in 1897 when Korea, far from gaining new territory, was on the verge of being annexed by the [[Empire of Japan]], the last to use the name officially. Among the last of the empires in the 20th century were the [[Central African Empire]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Manchukuo]], the [[German Empire]], and [[Korea]].\n\nThe terrestrial empire's maritime analogue is the [[thalassocracy]], an empire composed of islands and coasts which are accessible to its terrestrial homeland, such as the Athenian-dominated [[Delian League]].\n\nFurthermore, empires can expand by both land and sea. Stephen Howe notes that empires by land can be characterized by expansion over terrain, \"extending directly outwards from the original frontier\"{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=35}} while an empire by sea can be characterized by colonial expansion and empire building \"by an increasingly powerful navy\".{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=66}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nEmpires originated as different types of states, although they commonly began as powerful monarchies. Ideas about empires have changed over time, ranging from public approval to universal distaste. Empires are built out of separate units with some kind of diversity \u2013 ethnic, national, cultural, religious \u2013 and imply at least some inequality between the rulers and the ruled. Without this inequality, the system would be seen as a [[commonwealth]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThroughout history, the major powers of the world constantly seek to conquer other parts of the world. Most of the powers were centralized in Europe, for example the [[Roman Empire]]. During the [[Age of Discovery]], the idea of taking over other nations was brought back in a more modernized way. [[Imperialism]] is the idea of a major power controlling another nation or land with the intentions to use the native people and resources to help the mother country in any way possible.\n\nMany empires were the result of military conquest, incorporating the vanquished states into a political union, but imperial hegemony can be established in other ways. The [[Delian League|Athenian Empire]], the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[British Empire]] developed at least in part under [[Election|elective]] auspices. The [[Empire of Brazil]] declared itself an empire after separating from the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1822. France has twice transitioned from being called the [[republic|French Republic]] to being called the French Empire while it retained an overseas empire.\n\nWeaker states may seek annexation into the empire. An example is the bequest of [[Pergamon]] to the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Attalus III]]. The [[Unification of Germany]] as the empire accreted to the [[Prussia]]n [[metropole]] was less a military conquest of the German states than their political divorce from the [[Austrian Empire]], which formerly ruled loosely over the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Having convinced the other states of its military prowess, and having excluded the [[Austrians]], Prussia dictated the terms of imperial membership.\n\n[[File:Modern Empires.svg|thumb|Diachronic map of the main empires of the modern era (1492\u20131945).]]\n\nPolitically, it was typical for either a monarchy or an [[oligarchy]], rooted in the original core territory of the empire, to continue to dominate. If governmental authority was maintained by controlling water supplies, vital to colonial subjects, such r\u00e9gimes were called [[hydraulic empire]]s.\n\nEuropeans began applying the designation of \"empire\" to non-European [[Monarchy|monarchies]], such as the [[Qing Empire]] and the [[Mughal Empire]], as well as the [[Maratha Empire]], eventually leading to the looser denotations applicable to any political structure meeting the criteria of \"imperium\".\n\nSome monarchies styled themselves as having greater size, scope, and power than the territorial, politico-military, and economic facts support. As a consequence, some monarchs assumed the title of \"emperor\" (or its corresponding translation, ''[[tsar]]'', ''empereur'', ''[[kaiser]]'', ''[[shah]]''  etc.) and renamed their states as \"The Empire of ...\".\n\nEmpires were seen as an expanding power, administration, ideas and beliefs followed by cultural habits from place to place. Empires tend to impose their culture on the subject states to strengthen the imperial structure.  This can have notable effects that outlast the empire itself, both positive and negative.\n\n==History of imperialism==\n===Bronze and Iron Age empires===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Early empires\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Map achaemenid empire en.png|[[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Persia]] at its zenith\nFile:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|[[Maurya Empire]] of [[India]] at its greatest extent under [[Ashoka the Great]]\n</gallery>\n|}\nThe earliest known empire appeared in Egypt when King [[Narmer]] of the Upper Valley conquered the Lower Valley circa 3000 BC and laid the foundations for the [[Old Kingdom]]. The [[Akkadian Empire]], established by [[Sargon of Akkad]] (24th century BC), was an early all-Mesopotamian empire. This imperial achievement was repeated by [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]] in the 17th century BC. In the 15th century BC, the [[New Kingdom]] of [[Ancient Egypt]], ruled by [[Thutmose III]], was [[North Africa during Antiquity|ancient Africa]]'s major force upon incorporating [[Nubia]] and the [[City-state#Ancient city-states|ancient city-states]] of the [[Levant]].\n\nCirca 1500 BC in China rose the [[Shang Empire]] which was succeeded by the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] Empire circa 1100 BC. Both surpassed in territory their contemporary Near Eastern empires. The Zhou Empire dissolved in 770 BC into feudal multi-state system which lasted for five and a half centuries until the universal conquest of [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] in 221 BC.\n\nThe first empire comparable to Rome in organization was the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (916\u2013612 BC). The [[Median Empire]] was the first empire within the territory of [[Persia]]. By the 6th century BC, after having allied with the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonians]] to defeat the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], the Medes were able to establish their own empire, which was the largest of its day and lasted for about sixty years.\n\n===Classical period===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Classical period\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Roman Empire-117AD.png|The [[Roman Empire]] under [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117).

His Empire was succeeded by three Empires ruled by the [[Diadochi]]\u2014the [[Seleucid]], [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]], and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]], which, despite being independent, are called the \"[[Hellenistic]] Empire\" by virtue of their similarities in culture and administration.\n\nMeanwhile, in the western Mediterranean the Empires of [[Carthage]] and [[Rome]] began their rise. Having decisively defeated Carthage in 202 BC, Rome defeated Macedonia in 200 BC and the Seleucids in 190/189 BC to establish all-Mediterranean Empire. The Seleucid Empire broke apart and its former eastern part was absorbed by the [[Parthian Empire]]. In 30 BC Rome annexed the Ptolemaic Egypt.\n\nIn India during the [[Axial Age]] appeared the [[Maurya Empire]]\u2014a geographically extensive and powerful empire, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321\u2013185 BC. The empire was founded in 322 BC by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], who rapidly expanded his power westward across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers following the withdrawal by Alexander the Great. By 320 BC, the Maurya Empire had fully occupied [[northwestern India]] as well as defeating and conquering the [[satrap]]s left by Alexander. Under Emperor [[Asoka the Great]], the Maurya Empire became the first Indian empire to conquer the whole Indian Peninsula \u2014 an achievement repeated only twice, by the [[Gupta]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires. In the reign of Asoka [[Buddhism]] spread to become the dominant religion in ancient India. It has been estimated that the Maurya dynasty controlled an unprecedented one-third of the world's entire economy, was home to one-third of the world's population at the time (an estimated 50 million out of 150 million humans), contained the world's largest city of the time ([[Pataliputra]], estimated to be larger than Rome under [[Emperor Trajan]]) and according to [[Megasthenes]], the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, and 9,000 war elephants.{{clear}}\n\nIn [[China]] of the [[Axial Age]], the era of the [[Warring States]] ended in 221 BC with the universal conquest of [[Qin dynasty|Qin]]. The King of Qin, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], became China's [[First Emperor]] and began the pattern of successive dynasties. Ying Zheng connected all the existing defense walls of northern China into what is known today [[Great Wall]] of China which marked the northern frontier of China. The Qin Dynasty was short lived and in 207 BC was overthrown by the [[Han Dynasty]] (207 BC - AD 220) which became one of East Asia's most long-lived dynasties. In the second century AD the Han Empire expanded into Central Asia. By this time only four Empires stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic\u2014[[Han Dynasty|Han]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]].\n[[File:Eurasia in 2nd Century.png|thumb|300px|Map showing the four empires of Eurasia in the 2nd century AD]]\n\nThe Romans were the first nation to invent and embody the concept of empire in their two mandates: to wage war and to make and execute laws.{{sfn|Howe|2002}} They were the most extensive Western empire until the [[early modern period]], and left a lasting impact on Western Europe. Many languages, cultural values, religious institutions, political divisions, urban centers, and legal systems can trace their origins to the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire governed and rested on exploitative actions. They took slaves and money from the peripheries to support the imperial center.{{sfn|Howe|2002}} However, the absolute reliance on conquered peoples to carry out the empire's fortune, sustain wealth, and fight wars would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Howe|2002}} The Romans were strong believers in what they called their \"civilizing mission\". This term was legitimized and justified by writers like Cicero who wrote that only under Roman rule could the world flourish and prosper.{{sfn|Howe|2002}} This ideology, that was envisioned to bring a new world order, was eventually spread across the Mediterranean world and beyond. People started to build houses like Romans, eat the same food, wear the same clothes and engage in the same cruel games.{{sfn|Howe|2002}} Even rights of citizenship and authority to rule were granted to people not of Roman or Italian birth.{{sfn|Howe|2002}}\n\nThe Latin word ''[[imperium]]'', referring to a magistrate's power to command, gradually assumed the meaning \"The territory in which a magistrate can effectively enforce his commands\", while the term \"''imperator''\" was originally an honorific meaning \"commander\". The title was given to generals who were victorious in battle. Thus, an \"empire\" may include regions that are not legally within the territory of a state, but are under either direct or indirect control of that state, such as a [[colony]], [[client state]], or [[protectorate]]. Although historians use the terms \"Republican Period\" and \"Imperial Period\" to identify the periods of Roman history before and after absolute power was assumed by [[Augustus]], the Romans themselves continued to refer to their government as a republic, and during the Republican Period, the territories controlled by the republic were referred to as \"''Imperium Romanum''\". The emperor's actual legal power derived from holding the office of \"consul\", but he was traditionally honored with the titles of ''imperator'' (commander) and ''princeps'' (first man or, chief). Later, these terms came to have legal significance in their own right; an army calling their general \"''imperator''\" was a direct challenge to the authority of the current emperor.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|author=Michael Burger|page=115|year=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQUs2QnC2F4C&lpg=PA115&ots=RNij6LEiWy&dq=imperator%20princeps%20%22commander%20in%20chief%22&pg=PA115#v=onepage&q=imperator%20princeps%20%22commander%20in%20chief%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe legal systems of [[France]] and its former colonies are strongly influenced by Roman law.<ref>{{cite web|title=France \u2013 Legal History |url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/FranceLegalHistory.htm |author=Ken Pennington |publisher=Columbus School of Law and School of Canon Law, The Catholic University of America |accessdate=September 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929015635/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/FranceLegalHistory.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Similarly, the [[United States]] was founded on a model inspired by the [[Roman Republic]], with upper and lower legislative assemblies, and executive power vested in a single individual, the president.

The [[Bulgarian Empire]] remained a major power in the Balkans until its fall in the late 14th century.\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Post-classical period\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Rashidun654wVassal.png|The expansion of the [[Rashidun Empire]].\nFile:Mongols-map.png|[[Mongol Empire]] in the 13th century.\nFile:Ajuuraan2.png|[[Ajuran Sultanate]] in the 15th century\nFile:Almohad dynasty 1147 - 1269 (AD).PNG|[[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad Empire]]\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n|}At the time, in the [[Medieval period|Medieval West]], the title \"empire\" had a specific technical meaning that was exclusively applied to states that considered themselves the heirs and successors of the Roman Empire. Among these were the \"Byzantine Empire\", which was the actual continuation of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern portion of the Roman Empire]], the [[Carolingian Empire]], the largely Germanic [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. Yet, these states did not always fit the geographic, political, or military profiles of empires in the modern sense of the word. To legitimise their ''imperium'', these states directly claimed the title of ''Empire'' from Rome. The ''sacrum Romanum imperium'' (Holy Roman Empire), which lasted from 800 to 1806, claimed to have exclusively comprehended Christian principalities, and was only nominally a discrete imperial state. The Holy Roman Empire was not always centrally-governed, as it had neither core nor peripheral territories, and was not governed by a central, politico-military elite. Hence, [[Voltaire]]'s remark that the Holy Roman Empire \"was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire\" is accurate to the degree that it ignores<ref>{{Citation|url=http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire|title=Voltaire|publisher=[[Wikiquote]], citing Essai sur l'histoire generale et sur les moeurs et l'espirit des nations, Chapter 70 (1756)|accessdate=2008-01-06}}</ref> German rule over Italian, French, Proven\u00e7al, Polish, Flemish, Dutch, and Bohemian populations, and the efforts of the ninth-century [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (i.e., the [[Ottonians]]) to establish central control.

Constantinople was retaken in 1261 by the Byzantine successor state centered in [[Nicaea]], re-establishing the [[Byzantine Empire]] until 1453, by which time the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]]-[[Muslim]] [[Ottoman Empire]] (ca. 1300\u20131918), had conquered most of the region. The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire and it was the most powerful empire to succeed the Abbasi empires at the time, as well as one of the most powerful empires in the world.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=46}} The Ottoman Empire centered on modern day Turkey, dominated the eastern Mediterranean, overthrew the Byzantine Empire to claim Constantinople and it would start battering at Austria and Malta, which were countries that were key to central and to south-west Europe respectively &mdash; mainly for their geographical location.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=46}} The reason these occurrences of batterings were so important was because the Ottomans were Muslim, and the rest of Europe was Christian, so there was a sense of religious fighting going on.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=46}} This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=46}} Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries, and they had problems in them as well.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=46}} The flows of trade and of cultural influences across the supposed great divide never ceased, so the countries never stopped bartering with each other.{{sfn|Howe|2002}} These epochal clashes between civilizations profoundly shaped many people's thinking back then, and continues to do so in the present day.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=30}} Modern hatred against Muslim communities in South-Eastern Europe, mainly in Bosnia and Kosovo, has often been articulated in terms of seeing them as unwelcome residues of this imperialism: in short, as Turks.{{sfn|Howe|2002|p=47}} Moreover, Eastern Orthodox imperialism was not re-established until the coronation of [[Peter the Great]] as [[Tsar|Emperor of Russia]] in 1721. Likewise, with the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815), the [[Austrian Empire]] (1804\u20131867) emerged reconstituted as the Empire of [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] (1867\u20131918), having \"inherited\" the imperium of Central and Western Europe from the losers of said wars.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, [[Genghis Khan]] expanded the [[Mongol Empire]] to be the largest contiguous empire in the world. However, within two generations, the empire was separated into four discrete khanates under Genghis Khan's grandsons. One of them, [[Kublai Khan]], conquered China and established the [[Yuan Dynasty]] with the imperial capital at [[Beijing]]. One family ruled the whole Eurasian land mass from the Pacific to the Adriatic and Baltic Seas. The emergence of the [[Pax Mongolica]] had significantly eased [[trade]] and [[commerce]] across Asia.<ref>Gregory G.

Both existed for several generations before the arrival of the Europeans. Inca had gradually conquered the whole of the settled Andean world as far south as today Santiago in Chile.\n\nIn [[Oceania]], the [[Tu'i Tonga Empire|Tonga Empire]] was a lonely empire that existed from the Medieval to the Modern period.\n\n===Colonial empires===\n[[File:Portugal Imp\u00e9rio total.png|thumb|right|200x|All areas of the world that were once part of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

In the Old World, colonial [[imperialism]] was attempted and established on the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Ireland]]. These conquered lands and people became ''[[de jure]]'' subordinates of the empire, rather than ''[[de facto]]'' imperial territories and subjects. Such subjugation often elicited \"client-state\" resentment that the empire unwisely ignored, leading to the collapse of the European colonial imperial system in the late 19th century and the early and mid-20th century. Portuguese discovery of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in the New World gave way to many expeditions led by [[Kingdom of England|England]] (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]), [[Spain]], [[France]], and the [[Dutch Republic]]. In the 18th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] was at its height because of the great mass of goods taken from conquered territory in the Americas (nowadays [[Mexico]], parts of the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]], most of Central America, and South America) and the [[Philippines]].\n\n===Modern period===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Modern period\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Map of territorial growth 1775.svg|Red shows self-governing North American British colonies and pink shows claimed and largely indirectly controlled territories in 1775.\nFile:India in 1700 Joppen.jpg|In the year 1690, the [[realm]]s of the [[Mughal Empire]] spanned from [[Kabul]] to [[Cape Comorin]].<ref name=\"WilburCompany\">{{cite book|last1=Wilbur|first1=Marguerite Eyer|last2=Company|first2=The East India|title=The East India Company: And the British Empire in the Far East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTCsAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA175|accessdate=16 February 2014|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804728645|pages=175\u2013178}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Ottoman empire.svg|The [[Ottoman Empire]] at its greatest extent.\nFile:Spanish Empire Anachronous en.svg|The [[Spanish empire|Spanish]]\u2013[[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] Empire of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580\u20131640) was the first global imperial entity.

The [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918), another \"heir to the Holy Roman Empire\", arose in 1871.\n\nThe [[Ashanti Empire]] (or Confederacy), also Asanteman (1701\u20131896), was a [[West African]] state of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], the [[Akan people]] of the [[Ashanti Region]], Akanland in modern-day Ghana. The Ashanti (or Asante) were a powerful, militaristic and highly disciplined people in West Africa. Their military power, which came from effective strategy and an early adoption of European [[firearm]]s, created an empire that stretched from central Akanland (in modern-day Ghana) to present day [[Benin]] and [[Ivory Coast]], bordered by the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] kingdom to the north and [[Dahomey]] to the east. Due to the empire's military prowess, sophisticated hierarchy, social stratification and culture, the Ashanti empire had one of the largest [[historiographies]] of any indigenous [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n political entity.\n\nThe [[Sikh Empire]] (1799\u20131846) was established in the Punjab region of India. The empire collapsed when its founder, Ranjit Singh, died and its army fell to the British. During the same period, the [[Maratha Empire]] (also known as the Maratha Confederacy) was a Hindu state located in present-day India. It existed from 1674 to 1818, and at its peak, the empire's territories covered much of Southern Asia. The empire was founded and consolidated by Shivaji. After the death of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor Aurangzeb, it expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat, which halted the expansion of the empire. Later, the empire was divided into a confederacy of states which, in 1818, were lost to the British during the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UVFuAAAAMAAJ|title=Shivaji|first=Setumadhavarao R.|last=Pagadi|publisher=National Book Trust, India|year=1983|isbn=81-237-0647-2|page=21}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Empire of Brazil]] (1822-1889) was the only South American modern monarchy, established by the heir of the [[Portuguese Empire]] as an independent nation eventually became an emerging international power. The new country was huge but sparsely populated and ethnically diverse. In 1889 the monarchy was overthrown in a sudden [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic.\n\nThe British established their [[First British Empire|first empire]] (1583\u20131783) in North America by colonising lands that made up [[British America]], including parts of [[History of Canada#Canada under British rule (1763\u20131867)|Canada]], the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. In 1776, the [[Continental Congress]] of the Thirteen Colonies declared itself independent from the British Empire, thus beginning the [[American Revolution]]. Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific, and later Africa, with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the [[Second British Empire]] (1783\u20131815), which was followed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[Britain's Imperial Century]] (1815\u20131914).

Regardless of the supposed motivation for this constant expansion, all of these land acquisitions were carried out by [[American imperialism|imperialistic means]]. This was done by financial means in some cases, and by military force in others. Most notably, the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Texas Annexation (1845), and the Mexican Cession (1848) highlight the imperialistic goals of the United States during this \u201cmodern period\u201d of imperialism. The U.S. government has stopped pursuing additional territories since the mid 20th century.

For example, the Holy Roman Empire, a German re-constitution of the [[Roman Empire]], metamorphosed into various political structures (i.e., federalism), and eventually, under [[Habsburg]] rule, re-constituted itself in 1804 as the [[Austrian Empire]], an empire of much different politics and scope, which in turn became the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in 1867. The Roman Empire, perennially reborn, also lived on as the [[Byzantine Empire]] (Eastern Roman Empire) - temporarily splitting into the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] before its remaining territory and centre became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A similarly persistent concept of empire saw the [[Mongol Empire]] become the Khanate of the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[Empire of China]], and the [[Ilkhanate]] before resurrection as the [[Timurid Empire]] and as the [[Mughal Empire]]. After 1945 the [[Empire of Japan]] retained its Emperor but lost its colonial possessions and became the [[State of Japan]].\n\nAn autocratic empire can become a [[republic]] (e.g., the Central African Empire in 1979;), or it can become a republic with its imperial dominions reduced to a core territory (e.g., [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] shorn of the German colonial empire (1918\u20131919), or the Ottoman Empire (1918\u20131923)). The dissolution of the [[Austro\u2013Hungarian Empire]] after 1918 provides an example of a multi-ethnic [[superstate]] broken into constituent nation-oriented states: the republics, kingdoms, and provinces of [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Transylvania]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Ruthenia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], ''et al''. In the aftermath of [[World War I]] the [[Russian Empire]] also broke up and became reduced to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) before re-forming as the USSR (1922-1991) - sometimes seen as the core of a [[Soviet Empire]].\n\nAfter the [[Second World War ]](1939\u20131945), the deconstruction of colonial empires quickened and became commonly known as [[decolonisation]]. The British Empire evolved into a loose, multinational [[Commonwealth of Nations]], while the [[French colonial empire]] metamorphosed to a [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophone commonwealth]]. The same process happened to the [[Portuguese Empire]], which evolved into a [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|Lusophone commowealth]], and to the former territories of the extinct [[Spanish Empire]], which alongside the Lusophone countries of [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], created a [[Organization of Ibero-American States|Ibero-American commowealth]]. France returned the French territory of [[Kwang-Chou-Wan]] to China in 1946. The British gave [[Hong Kong]] back to China in 1997 after 150 years of rule. The Portuguese territory of [[Macau]] reverted to China in 1999. Macau and Hong Kong did not become part of the provincial structure of China; they have autonomous systems of government as [[Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nFrance still governs colonies ([[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[R\u00e9union]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|St Martin]], [[Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands|TAAF]], [[Wallis and Futuna]], [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], and [[Mayotte]]), and exerts [[hegemony]] in [[Francophone Africa]] (29 francophone countries such as [[Chad]], [[Rwanda]], ''et cetera''). Fourteen [[British Overseas Territories]] remain under British sovereignty. Sixteen countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] share their head of state, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], as [[Commonwealth realms]].\n\nIn 2004 [[Eliot A. Cohen]] summarized the contemporary transition from empire:  \"The Age of Empire may indeed have ended, but then an age of American hegemony has begun, regardless of what one calls it.\"{{sfn|Cohen|2004|p=56}}\n\n== Fall of empires ==\n\n=== Roman Empire ===\nThe fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in the West is seen as one of the most pivotal points in all of human history. This event traditionally marks the transition from classical civilization to the birth of Europe. The Roman Empire started to decline at the end of the reign of the last of the [[Five Good Emperors]], Marcus Aurelius in 161-180 A.D. There is still a debate over the cause of the fall of one of the largest empires in the history. Piganiol argues that the Roman Empire under its authority can be described as \"a period of terror\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piganiol|first=Andr\u00e9|date=|title=THE CAUSES OF THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE|url=|journal=The Journal of General Education|volume=Vol. 1, No. 1 - Vol. 65, No. 3-4|pages=62-69|via=JSTOR}}</ref> holding its imperial system accountable for its failure.

There was also the looming presence of the Persians which, at any time, took a large percentage of the fighting force\u2019s attention. At the same time the Huns, a nomadic warrior people from the steppes of Asia, are also putting extreme pressure on the German tribes outside of the Roman frontier. The German tribes really had no other choice, geographically, but to move into Roman territory. At this point, without increased funding, the Roman army could no longer effectively defend its borders against major waves of Germanic tribes. This inability is illustrated by the crushing defeat at Adrianople in 378 C.E. and, later, the [[Battle of the Frigidus|Battle of Frigidus]].\n\n==Contemporary usage==\n{{Main|Imperialism}}\nContemporaneously, the concept of ''empire'' is politically valid, yet is not always used in the traditional sense. For example, Japan is considered the world's sole remaining empire because of the continued presence of the Japanese Emperor in national politics. Despite the semantic reference to imperial power, Japan is a ''[[de jure]]'' [[constitutional monarchy]], with a homogeneous population of 127 million people that is 98.5 percent ethnic Japanese, making it one of the largest nation-states.<ref>George Hicks, ''Japan's hidden apartheid: the Korean Minority and the Japanese'', (Aldershot, England; Brookfield, VT: Ashgate, 1998), 3.</ref>\n\nCharacterizing some aspects of American foreign policy and international behavior as \"[[American imperialism|American Empire]]\" is controversial but not uncommon. This characterization is controversial because of the strong tendency in American society to reject claims of American imperialism. The initial motivations for the inception of the United States eventually led to the development of this tendency, which has been perpetuated by the country-wide obsession with this national narrative. The United States was formed because colonists did not like being under control of the British Empire. Essentially, the United States was formed in an attempt to reject imperialism. This makes it very hard for people to acknowledge America\u2019s status as an empire. This active rejection of imperialist status is not limited to high-ranking government officials, as it has been ingrained in American society throughout its entire history. As David Ludden explains, \u201cjournalists, scholars, teachers, students, analysts, and politicians prefer to depict the U.S. as a nation pursuing its own interests and ideals.\u201d<ref name=Ludden2004>{{cite journal|title=America's Invisible Empire|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=30 October 2004|volume=39|issue=44|url=http://www.epw.in/journal/2004/44/commentary/americas-invisible-empire.html}} Text available [http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18738.htm here], author link [http://history.fas.nyu.edu/object/davidludden here].</ref> This often results in imperialist endeavors being presented as measures taken to enhance national security.

These alterations include the intellectual (political science) trends that perceive the contemporary world's order via the re-territorrialisation of ''political space'', the re-emergence of ''classical imperialist practices'' (the \"inside\" vs. \"outside\" duality, cf. the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]), the deliberate weakening of international organisations, the restructured international economy, economic nationalism, the expanded arming of most countries, the proliferation of nuclear weapon capabilities and the [[politics of identity]] emphasizing a state's ''subjective'' perception of its place in the world, as a nation and as a civilisation. These changes constitute the \"Age of Nation Empires\"; as imperial usage, ''nation-empire'' denotes the return of geopolitical power from ''global'' power blocs to ''regional'' power blocs (i.e., centred upon a \"regional power\" state [China, Russia, U.S., ''et al''.]) and regional multi-state power alliances (i.e., Europe, Latin America, South East Asia). Nation-empire regionalism claims sovereignty over their respective (regional) political (social, economic, ideologic), cultural, and military spheres.<ref>For the Okur's thesis about \"nation empires\", look at the article: Mehmet Akif Okur, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090225004118/http://www.sam.gov.tr/perceptions/volume12/winter/winter-004-PERCEPTION%28mehmetakifokur%29%5B4%5D.pdf Rethinking Empire After 9/11: Towards A New Ontological Image of World Order] Perceptions, Journal of International Affairs, Volume XII, Winter 2007, pp. 61\u201393</ref>\n\n==Timeline of empires==\nThe chart below shows a timeline of polities that have been called empires.

Being global, the system can neither expand nor be subject to external intrusion as the European states system had been for centuries:\n{{quote|\nIn all previous struggles for supremacy, attempts to unite the European peninsula in a single state have been condemned to failure primarily through the intrusion of new forces from outside the old Occident. The Occident was an open area. But the globe was not, and, for that very reason, ultimately destined to be unified\u2026 And this very process [of unification] was clearly reflected in both World Wars.<ref>Ludwig Dehio, The Precarious Balance: Four Centuries of the European Power Struggle, 1945, (tr. Fullman, Charles, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962), p 234.</ref>}}\nFifteen years later, Dehio confirmed his hypothesis: The European system owed its durability to its overseas outlet. \u201cBut how can a multiple grouping of world states conceivably be supported from outside in the framework of a finite globe?\u201d<ref>Ludwig Dehio, \u201cEpilogue,\u201d The Precarious Balance: Four Centuries of the European Power Struggle, 1960, (tr. Fullman, Charles, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962), p 279.</ref>\n\nDuring the same time, [[Quincy Wright]] developed a similar concept. Balance-of-power politics has aimed less at preserving peace than at preserving the independence of states and preventing the development of world empire. In the course of history, the balance of power repeatedly reemerged, but on ever-wider scale. Eventually, the scale became global. Unless we proceed to \u201cinterplanetary wars,\u201d this pattern can no longer continue. In spite of significant reversals, the \u201ctrend towards world unity\u201d can \u201cscarcely be denied.\u201d World unity appears to be \u201cthe limit toward which the process of world history seems to tend.\u201d<ref>Quincy Wright, ''A Study of War'', (Chicago & London: The University of Chicago Press, 1964), p 92-93, 228, 234.</ref>\n\nFive scholars\u2014[[Hornell Hart]],<ref>\"The Logistic Growth of Political Areas,\" ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): p 396-408.</ref> [[Raoul Naroll]],<ref>\"Imperial Cycles and World Order,\" ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): p 83-101.</ref> Louis Morano,<ref>\"A Macrohistoric Trend towards World Government\", ''Behavior Science Notes'', 8, (1973): p 35-40.</ref> [[Rein Taagepera]]<ref>\u201cExpansion and Contraction Patterns of Large Polities: Context for Russia.\u201d ''International Studies Quarterly'', 41/3, (1997): 475-504.</ref> and the author of the circumscription theory [[Robert Carneiro]]<ref>\"Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion\", ''Studying War: Anthropological Perspective'', (eds.

Naroll and Carneiro found that this time is close at hand: around the year 2200 and 2300 respectively.\n\nThe founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], writing yet in 1943, drew a more specific and immediate future imperial project: After the War America is bound \u201cto take over the command of the skies.\u201d The danger of \u201cthe utter annihilation of all enemy towns and lands\u201d can \u201conly be prevented by the air superiority of a single power \u2026 America\u2019s air role is the only alternative to intercontinental wars.\u201d Despite his outstanding anti-imperialism, Coudenhove-Kalergi detailed: \n{{quote|\nNo imperialism, but technical and strategic problems of security urge America to rule the skies of the globe, just as Britain during the last century ruled the seas of the world\u2026 Pacifists and anti-imperialists will be shocked by this logic. They will try to find an escape. But they will try in vain\u2026 At the end of the war the crushing superiority of American plane production will be an established fact\u2026 The solution of the problem \u2026 is by no means ideal, nor even satisfactory. But it is the minor evil\u2026<ref>''Crusade for Pan-Europe'', (New York: G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 1943), p 297-298.</ref>}}\nCoudenhove-Kalergi envisaged a kind of [[Pax Americana]] modeled on \u201cPax Romana\u201d:\n{{quote|\nDuring the third century BC the Mediterranean world was divided on five great powers\u2014Roma and Carthage, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt. The balance of power led to a series of wars until Rome emerged the queen of the Mediterranean and established an incomparable era of two centuries of peace and progress, the \u2018Pax Romana\u2019\u2026 It may be that America\u2019s air power could again assure our world, now much smaller than the Mediterranean at that period, two hundred years of peace\u2026<ref>''Crusade for Pan-Europe'', p 299.</ref>}} \nThis period would be necessary transitory stage before [[World State]] is eventually established, though he did not specify how the last transformation is expected to occur. Coudenhove-Kalergi's follower in the teleological theory of World State, Toynbee, supposed the traditional way of universal conquest and emphasized that the world is ripe for conquest: \"\u2026Hitler's eventual failure to impose peace on the world by the force of arms was due, not to any flaw in his thesis that the world was ripe for conquest, but to an accidental combination of incidental errors in his measures\u2026\" But \"in falling by so narrow a margin to win the prize of world-dominion for himself, Hitler had left the prize dangling within the reach of any successor capable of pursuing the same aims of world-conquest with a little more patience, prudence, and tact.\" With his \"revolution of destruction,\" Hitler has performed the \"yeoman service\" for \"some future architect of a ''Pax Ecumenica''...

In 1951, before he became President, he had written on West Europe: \u201cWe cannot be a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers with our legions if for no other reason than that these are not, politically, our frontiers. What we must do is to assist these [West European] peoples.\u201d Two years later, he wrote: When it was decided to deploy US divisions to Europe, no one had \u201cfor an instant\u201d thought that they would remain there for \u201cseveral decades\u201d\u2014that the United States could \u201cbuild a sort of Roman Wall with its own troops and so protect the world.\u201d<ref>Cited in ''Constructed Peace'', p 147-148.</ref>\n\nEisenhower assured Soviet Chairman [[Nikita Khrushchev]] on Berlin in 1959: \u201cClearly we did not contemplate 50 years in occupation there.\u201d It lasted, remarks [[Marc Trachtenberg]], from July 1945 to September 1994, 10 months short of 50 years.<ref>''A Constructed Peace'', p 401.</ref> Notably, when the US troops eventually left, they left eastward.

The ultimate form of empire was described by Michael Doyle in his ''Empires''. It is empire in which its two main components\u2014the ruling core and the ruled periphery\u2014merged to form one integrated whole. At this stage the ''empire'' as defined ceases to exist and becomes ''world state''. Doyle examplifies the transformation on the case of the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]] whose legislation in AD 212 extended the Roman citizenship to all inhabitants of the Mediterranean world.<ref>''Empires'', (London: Cornell University Press, 1986, p 12).</ref>\n\nInternational Relations scholar [[Alexander Wendt]] in his 2003 article \u201cWhy the World State is Inevitable\u2026\u201d supposed the pathway of universal conquest and subsequent consolidation provided the conquering power recognizes all conquered members.<ref>\"Why the World State is Inevitable: Teleology and the Logic of Anarchy,\" ''European Journal of International Relations'', 9/4, (2003), http://www.comw.org/qdr/fulltext/03wendt.pdf, p 54-56.</ref> Replying on criticism, Wendt invoked the example of the Roman Empire: A \"world empire would be an unstable equilibrium, still subject to the struggle for recognition.\" However, conquest can \"produce a proper \u2018state\u2019 if, as a result of internal reform, the world empire eventually recognizes all of its members (like the Roman Empire did, for example).\u201d<ref>Alexander Wendt, \"Agency, Teleology and the World State: A Reply to Shannon,\" ''European Journal of International Relations'', 11/4, (2005):  p 595, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274287534_Agency_Teleology_and_the_World_State_A_Reply_to_Shannon.</ref>\n\nDoyle's case of the Roman Empire had also been evoked by [[Susan Strange]] in her 1988 article, \"The Future of the American Empire.\" Strange emphasized that the most persistent empires were those which best managed to integrate the ruling core and the peripheral allies. The article is partly a reply on the  published a year earlier bestseller [[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]] which predicted imminent US \"imperial overstretch.\" Strange found this outcome unlikely, stressing the fact that the peripheral allies have been successfully recruited into the American Empire.<ref>Susan Strange, \"The Future of the American Empire,\" ''Journal of International Affairs'', 42/1,(1988): p 9, 11.</ref>\n\nEnvisaging a world empire of either the United States or the Soviet Union (whoever is victorious in World War III), [[Bertrand Russell]] projected the Roman scenario too: \"Like the Romans, they will, in the course of time, extend citizenship to the vanquished. There will then be a true world state, and it will be possible to forget that it will have owed its origin to conquest.\"<ref>Bertrand Russell, \"The Future of Man,\" ''Atlantic Monthly'', (April (1951), electronic source, no pagination, https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1951/03/the-future-of-man/305193/</ref>\n\nTo the case of Caracalla, Toynbee added the [[Abbasid Revolution|Abbasid cosmopolitan reformation]] of 750 AD. Both \"were good auguries for the prospect that, in a post-Modern chapter of Western history, a supranational commonwealth originally based on the hegemony of a paramount power over its satellites might eventually be put on the sounder basis of a constitutional partnership in which all the people of all the partner states would have their fare share in the conduct of common affairs.\u201d<ref>[[A Study of History]], (London: Oxford University Press, 1954), vol IX, p 554-555.</ref>\n\nHistorian Maks Ostrovski finds above mentioned cosmopolitan reformations to be the characteristic fate of persistent empires. When such a reformation occurs in our world, he writes, the [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] would be abolished since all earth inhabitants would have it by birth. This cosmopolitan World State, as the records of earlier circumscribed civilizations suggest, will last millennia.<ref>''The Hyperbole of the World Order'', (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2007), p 350, 367.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Colonialism]]\n* [[Comparative studies of the Roman and Han empires]]\n* [[Democratic empire]]\n* [[Empire-building]]\n* [[Hegemony]]\n* [[Historical powers]]\n* [[Imperialism]]\n* [[Linguistic imperialism]]\n* [[Military globalization]]\n* [[Soviet Empire]]\n* [[World state]]\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n\n'''Lists:'''\n* [[List of empires]]\n* [[List of largest empires]]\n* [[List of extinct countries, empires, etc.]]\n* [[List of countries spanning more than one continent]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Abernethy, David.

If a bureaucracy is motivated \"to inflict maximum damage upon a group of people\", it is \"inevitable that a bureaucracy\u2014no matter how decentralized its apparatus or how unplanned its activities\u2014should push its victims through these stages\", culminating in their annihilation.{{sfnp|Hilberg|1985|pp= 998\u20139}}\n\nIn his monograph, ''The Origins Of The Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939&nbsp;\u2013 March 1942'', [[Christopher Browning]] argues that Nazi policy toward the Jews was radicalized twice: in September 1939, when the [[History of Poland (1939\u201345)|invasion of Poland]] implied policies of mass expulsion and massive loss of Jewish lives; and in spring 1941, when preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]] involved the planning of mass execution, mass expulsion, and starvation \u2013 to dwarf what had happened in Jewish Poland.{{sfnp|Browning|2004|loc=(2007 ed.: p.

During this time: the sites of the first extermination camps were selected, different methods of killing were tested, Jewish emigration from the Third Reich was forbidden, and 11 transports departed for [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] as a temporary holding station. During this period, Browning writes, \"The vision of the Final Solution had crystallised in the minds of the Nazi leadership, and was being turned into reality.\"{{r|Browning424}} This period was the peak of Nazi victories against the Soviet Army on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and, according to Browning, the stunning series of German victories led to both an expectation that the war would soon be won, and the planning of the final destruction of the \"[[Jewish Bolshevik#Nazi Germany|Jewish-Bolshevik]] enemy\".{{sfnp|Browning|2004|pp= 426\u2013427}}\n\nBrowning describes the creation of the extermination camps, which were responsible for the largest number of deaths in the Final Solution, as bringing together three separate developments within the [[Third Reich]]: the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] which had been established in Germany since 1933; an expansion of the gassing technology of the [[Action T4|Nazi euthanasia programme]] to provide killing mechanism of greater efficiency and psychological detachment; and the creation of \"factories of death\" to be fed endless streams of victims by mass uprooting and deportation that utilized the experience and personnel from earlier population resettlement programmes\u2014especially the [[SS and Police Leader|HSSPF]] and [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s [[RSHA]] for \"Jewish affairs and evacuations\".{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p= 354}}\n\n[[Peter Longerich]] argues that the search for a finite date on which the Nazis embarked upon the extermination of the Jews is futile, in his book ''Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews'' (2011). Longerich writes: \"We should abandon the notion that it is historically meaningful to try to filter the wealth of available historical material and pick out a single decision\" that led to the Holocaust.{{sfnp|Longerich|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxYqYIn73SgC&lpg=PA6&vq=abandon%2Bnotion&pg=PA6#v=snippet&q=abandon+notion&f=false 6]}}<ref name=NYRB>{{cite web |author-link=Timothy Snyder |last=Snyder |first=Timothy |title=A New Approach to the Holocaust |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/new-approach-holocaust/ |accessdate=30 March 2015 |work=The New York Review of Books |date=23 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Timothy Snyder]] writes that Longerich \"grants the significance of [[Arthur Greiser|Greiser's]] murder of Jews by gas at [[Che\u0142mno]] in December 1941\", but also detects a significant moment of escalation in spring 1942, which includes \"the construction of the large death factory at [[Treblinka]] for the destruction of the Warsaw Jews, and the addition of a gas chamber to the concentration camp at [[Auschwitz]] for the murder of the Jews of Silesia\".{{r|NYRB}} Longerich suggests that it \"was only in the summer of 1942, that mass killing was finally understood as the realization of the Final Solution, rather than as an extensively violent preliminary to some later program of slave labor and deportation to the lands of a conquered USSR\". For Longerich, to see mass killing as the Final Solution was an acknowledgement by the Nazi leadership that there would not be a German military victory over the USSR in the near future.<ref name=NYRB/>\n\n[[David Cesarani]] emphasises the improvised, haphazard nature of Nazi policies in response to changing war time conditions in his overview, ''Final Solution: The Fate Of The European Jews 1933-49'' (2016). \"Cesarani provides telling examples\", wrote [[Mark Roseman]], \"of a lack of coherence and planning for the future in Jewish policy, even when we would most expect it. The classic instance is the invasion of Poland in 1939, when not even the most elementary consideration had been given to what should happen to Poland's Jews either in the shorter or longer term.

In March, Goebbels confided to his diary: \"On the Jewish question especially, we are in it so deeply that there is no getting out any longer. And that is a good thing.

He was married to [[Antimache]],<ref>Antimache (\u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7), \"strife of opposites\" does not feature further in Greek myth, aside from a list of names of her sons and a genealogy for her, given in Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.5.9, 2.8.1, 3.9.2.</ref> daughter of [[Amphidamas]].\n\n==Mythology==\n\n=== Labors of Heracles ===\n{{main|Labours of Hercules}}In the contest of wills between [[Hera]] and [[Zeus]] over whose candidate would be [[Greek hero|hero]], fated to defeat the remaining creatures representing an old order and bring about the reign of the [[Twelve Olympians]], Eurystheus was Hera's candidate and Heracles \u2013 though his name implies that at one archaic stage of myth-making he had carried \"Hera's fame\" \u2013 was the candidate of Zeus.<ref>See Carl A.P. Ruck and Danny Staples, ''The World of Classical Myth'' (1994) VII. \"Herakles: Making the New Olympia\", pp.163-202.</ref> The arena for the actions that would bring about this deep change are the [[Twelve Labors]] imposed on Heracles by Eurystheus. The immediate necessity for the Labours of Heracles is as penance for Heracles' murder of his own family, in a fit of madness, which had been sent by Hera; however, further human rather than mythic motivation is supplied by mythographers who note that their respective families had been rivals for the throne of [[Mycenae]]. Details of the individual episodes may be found in the article on the [[Labours of Heracles]], but Hera was connected with all of the opponents Heracles had to overcome.<ref>[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' (1985) p. 210: \"Heracles seems to carry Hera's name in his own, as if Hera were his fame (''kleos''), yet all we ever hear is that from beginning to end,this jealous wife of Zeus persecutes her step-son with unrelenting hatred.\" For Hera's connection with each of Heracles' opponents, see under the individual Labours.</ref>\n\nHeracles' human stepfather [[Amphitryon]] was also a grandson of Perseus, and since Amphitryon's father ([[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]) was older than Eurystheus' father ([[Sthenelus]]), he might have received the kingdom, but Sthenelus had banished Amphitryon for accidentally killing (a familiar [[mytheme]]) the eldest son in the family ([[Electryon]]). When, shortly before his son Heracles was born, Zeus proclaimed the next-born descendant of Perseus should get the kingdom, Hera thwarted his ambitions by delaying [[Alcmene]]'s labour and having her candidate Eurystheus born prematurely.[[Image:Erymanthian Boar Louvre G17.jpg|thumb|350px|Eurystheus hiding in a [[Pithos|storage jar]] as [[Heracles]] brings him the [[Erymanthian boar]]. Side A from a [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by [[Oltos]], ca. 510 BC, ([[Louvre]])|left]]Heracles' first task was to slay the [[Nemean Lion]] and bring back its skin, which Heracles decided to wear. Eurystheus was so scared by Heracles' fearsome guise that he hid in a subterranean bronze [[Pithos|winejar]], and from that moment forth all labors were communicated to Heracles through a [[herald]], [[Copreus]].\n\nFor his second labour, to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], Heracles took with him his nephew, [[Iolaus]], as a charioteer. When Eurystheus found out that Heracles' nephew had helped him he declared that the labour had not been completed alone and as a result did not count towards the ten labours set for him.\n\nEurystheus' third task did not involve killing a beast, but capturing one alive - the [[Cerynian Hind]], a golden-horned stag sacred to [[Artemis]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind, as he had promised, to Artemis, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. Eurystheus did come out, but the moment Heracles let the hind go, she sprinted back to her mistress, and Heracles departed, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.\n\nWhen Heracles returned with the [[Erymanthian Boar]], Eurystheus was again frightened and hid in his jar, begging Heracles to get rid of the beast; Heracles obliged.\n\nThe fifth labour proposed by Eurystheus was to clear out the numerous [[Augean Stables|stables of Augeias]]. Striking a deal with Augeias, Heracles proposed a payment of a tenth of Augeias' cattle if the labour was completed successfully. Not believing the task feasible, Augeias agreed, asking his son Phyleus to witness.\nHeracles rerouted two nearby rivers ([[Alfeios River|Alpheis]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneios]]) through the stable, clearing out the dung rapidly. When Augeias learned of Heracles' bargain for the task, he refused payment. Heracles brought the case to court, and Phyleus testified against his father. Enraged, Augeias banished both Phyleus and Heracles from the land before the court had cast their vote. However, Eurystheus refused to credit the labour to Heracles, as he had performed it for payment. So Heracles went and drove Augeias out of the kingdom and installed Phyleus as king. Heracles then took his tenth of the cattle and left them to graze in a field by his home.\n\nFor his sixth labour, Heracles had to drive the [[Stymphalian Birds]] off the marshes they plagued. He did so, shooting down several birds with his Hydra-poisoned arrows and bringing them back to Eurystheus as proof.\n\nFor his seventh labour, Heracles captured the [[Cretan Bull]]. He used a [[lasso]] and rode it back to his cousin. Eurystheus offered to sacrifice the bull to Hera his patron, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the [[Marathonian Bull]].\n\nWhen Heracles brought back the man-eating [[Mares of Diomedes]] successfully, Eurystheus dedicated the horses to Hera and allowed them to roam freely in the Argolid. [[Bucephalus]], [[Alexander the Great]]'s horse, was said to be descended from these mares.\n\nTo acquire the belt of [[Hippolyte]], queen of the [[Amazons]] was Heracles ninth task. This task was at the request of Eurystheus' daughter, [[Admete]]. For the tenth labour, he stole the cattle of the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giant]] [[Geryon]], which Eurystheus then had sacrificed to Hera.\n\nTo extend what may have once been ten Labours to the canonical dozen, it was said that Eurystheus didn't count the Hydra, as he was assisted, nor the Augean stables, as Heracles received payment for his work. For the eleventh labour Heracles had to obtain the Apples of the [[Hesperides]]; he convinced their father, the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], to help him, but did his share of work by temporarily holding up the sky in the Titan's stead. For his final labour, he was to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed hound that guarded the entrance to [[Greek underworld|Hades]]. When he managed to bring the struggling animal back, the terrified Eurystheus hid in his jar one more time, begging Heracles to leave for good and take the dog with him.\n\n===Death===\nAfter Heracles died, Eurystheus remained bitter over the indignity the hero had caused him. He attempted to destroy Heracles' many children (the [[Heracleidae]], led by [[Hyllus]]), who fled to [[Athens]]. He attacked the city but was soundly defeated, and Eurystheus and his sons were killed. Though it is widely told that Hyllus killed Eurystheus. The stories about the killer of Eurystheus and the fate of his corpse vary,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.8.1 and [[Diodorus Siculus]] 4.57 give [[Hyllus]] as the slayer, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.44.10 and [[Strabo]] 7.6.19 give [[Iolaus]].</ref> but the Athenians believed the burial site of Eurystheus remained on their soil and served to protect the country against the descendants of Heracles, who traditionally included the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Argos|Argives]].\n\nAfter Eurystheus' death, the brothers [[Atreus]] and [[Thyestes]], whom he had left in charge during his absence, took over the city, the former exiling the latter and assuming the kingship, while [[Tiryns]] returned to the overlordship of [[Argos]]. It is also widely believed that after his death, Eurystheus's head shrivelled to resemble that of a duckling.\n\n==Eurystheus in Euripides==\nEurystheus was a character in ''[[Heracleidae (play)|Heracleidae]]'', a play by [[Euripides]]. [[Macaria]], one of the daughters of [[Heracles]], and her brothers and sisters hid from Eurystheus in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], ruled by King [[Demophon of Athens|Demophon]]. As Eurystheus prepared to attack, an [[oracle]] told Demophon that he would win if and only if a [[nobility|noble woman]] was sacrificed to [[Persephone]]. Macaria volunteered for the sacrifice and a spring was named the [[Macarian spring]] in her honor.  Eurystheus speaks prophetically of his burial within Attica, claiming that he will be an anti-hero of sorts, though one who will eventually protect the Athenians.<ref>Heracleidae vv. 1026-1044.</ref>\n\n==Popular Culture==\n* Eurystheus appears in ''[[Hercules (2014 film)|Hercules]]'' portrayed by [[Joseph Fiennes]]. Here, Eurytheus is responsible for the death of Hercules\u2019 family rather than Hercules under [[Hera]]\u2019s spell, having drugged Hercules and sent three [[black wolf|black wolves]] to attack him. The wolves killed Hercules\u2019 family, though Hercules killed believed that it was he who killed his own family. Hercules avenges his family by stabbing Eurystheus with his own dagger.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category|Eurystheus}}\n*[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi, Karl]].

Some effects, particularly older ones such as [[Leslie speaker]]s and [[spring reverb]]s, use mechanical components or [[vacuum tube]]s. Effects are often used as [[Effects unit#Stompboxes|stompboxes]], which are typically placed on the floor and controlled with footswitches.

In [[audio engineer]] parlance, a signal without effects is \"dry\" and an effect-processed signal is \"wet\". The abbreviation \"F/X\" or \"FX\" is sometimes used. A pedal-style unit may be called a \"stomp box\", \"stompbox\", \"effects pedal\" or \"pedal\". A musician bringing many pedals to a live show or recording session often mounts the pedals on a [[guitar pedalboard]], to reduce set-up and tear-down time and, for pedalboards with lids, protect the pedals during transportation. When a musician has multiple effects in a [[rack mount]]ed [[road case]], this case may be called an \"effects rack\" or \"rig\". When rackmounted effects are mounted in a roadcase, this also speeds up a musician's set-up and tear-down time, because all of the effects can be connected together inside the rack case and all of the units can be plugged into a powerbar.\n\n==Formats==\nEffects units are available in a variety of formats or form factors. Stompboxes are primarily used units in live performance and (in some cases) studio recordings. Rackmount devices saw a heavy usage during the later 20th century, due to their advanced processing power and desirable tones. However, by the 21st century, with the advant of digital Plug-Ins and more powerful Stompboxes for live usage, the need and practicality of rackmounted effects units went down, and as such, prices of rack effects have diminished due to lower usage.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Clement, V (2007).

Pedals are often rectangle-shaped, but there are a range of other shapes (e.g., the circle-shaped Fuzz Face). Typical simple stompboxes have a single footswitch, one to three [[potentiometers]] (\"pots\" or \"knobs\") for controlling the effect, and a single [[LED]] that indicates if the effect is on. A typical distortion or overdrive pedal's three potentiometers, for example, control the level or intensity of the distortion effect, the tone of the effected signal and the volume (level) of the effected signal. Depending on the type of pedal, the potentiometers may control different parameters of the effect. For a [[chorus effect]], for example, the knobs may control the depth and speed of the effect. Complex stompboxes may have multiple footswitches, many knobs, additional switches or buttons that are operated with the fingers, and an alphanumeric [[LED]] display that indicates the status of the effect with short acronyms (e.g., DIST for \"distortion\").<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref>Mangum, Eric; Stubbs, Dean (2000).

Effect chains are typically created between the guitar and the amp or between the [[preamplifier]] (\"preamp\") and the power amp. When a pedal is off or inactive, the electric [[audio signal]] coming into the pedal diverts onto a ''[[Source direct|bypass]]'', an unaltered \"dry\" signal that continues on to other effects down the chain. In this way, a musician can combine effects within a chain in a variety of ways without having to reconnect boxes during a performance.<ref>Egnater, Bruce [http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/bruce-egnater-effects/December-2009/84 \"Bruce Egnater on Effects Loops\"] ''Guitar Player'', December 2009.</ref> A \"controller\" or \"effects management system\" lets the musician create multiple effect chains, so they can select one or several chains by tapping a single switch.

The protective panels are put back on and latched shut to protect the effects during transportation.]]\n[[Rackmount]]ed effects are typically built in a thin metal chassis with metal \"ears\" designed to be screwed into a [[19-inch rack]] that is standard to the [[telecommunication]], [[computing]] and [[music technology (electronic and digital)|music technology]] industries. Rackmounted effects may be one, two or three rack spaces high. When purchased from the store, rack-mounted equipment is not equipped with the rugged chassis features used on stompboxes and amps that are designed to be transported as standalone units, such as corner protectors. Rackmounted units are typically mounted in a rack, which is housed in a [[road case]], a tough plastic case with removable front and rear covers that can be latched on during transportation to protect the knobs and switches and then removed during performances. A rackmount unit may contain [[electronic circuit]]ry identical to a stompbox's, although its circuits are typically more complex. Unlike stompboxes, rackmounts usually have several different types of effects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ashton|first=Adrian|title=The Bass Handbook|publisher=Hal Leonard|year=2006|pages=91\u201392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I97xJYZC2lIC&pg=PA92&dq=rackmount+ear&hl=en&ei=xXXETePwII-8sQP9o_HrAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CGoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=rack%20mount%20ear&f=false|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eventide H3000 SE Ultra-Harmonizer (left view).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Of all of the formats, rackmount effects from the 2010s typically have the most advanced alphanumeric text display capacities.

Rackmounts are controlled by knobs, switches or buttons on their front panel, and often by a [[MIDI]] digital control interface. During live performances, a musician can operate rackmounted effects using a \"foot controller\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Levitin|first=Dan|title=From Demo Tape to Record Deal: Handy Guide|publisher=Alfred Music|year=1992|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IxeGcwKrJUUC&pg=PA26&dq=rack+foot+controller&hl=en&ei=SHLETfXzCoqesQO9sYnrAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CJQBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&q=rack%20foot%20controller&f=false|isbn=0-88284-494-6}}</ref> By setting up effects in a rack-mounted road case, this speeds up set-up and tear-down, because all of the effects can be connected together with patch cords (which can be left connected permanently) and all of the units can be plugged into a power bar. This means that a musician only needs to plug in the main power bar into [[AC Mains]] power and plug their instrument into the rack, and the last effect unit's output into their [[instrument amplifier]] and/or the [[PA system]].\n\n\"Shock mount\" racks are designed for musicians who frequently move gear between venues. Shock mounts help to protect electronic devices from bumps during transportation. Devices that are less than 19&nbsp;inches wide may use special \"ear\" adapters to mount on a rack.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ashton|first=Adrian|title=The Bass Handbook|publisher=Hal Leonard|year=2006|page=92\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I97xJYZC2lIC&pg=PA92&dq=rackmount+ear&hl=en&ei=xXXETePwII-8sQP9o_HrAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CGoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=rack%20mount%20ear&f=false|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-effects and tabletop units===\n[[File:Boss ME 50 Multi Effects Pedal.jpg|thumb|left|Multi-effects like this [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] ME-50 include many effects in one pedal.]]\nA multi-effects device (also called a \"multi-FX\" device) is a single electronics effects pedal or rackmount device that contains many different electronic effects. Multi-FX devices allow users to \"preset\" combinations of different effects, allowing musicians quick on-stage access to different effects combinations.<ref>Hunter, Dave (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7DjYrk7Vap4C ''Guitar Effects Pedals: The Practical Handbook'']. Hal Leonard. p. 125.</ref> Multi-effects units typically have a range of distortion, chorus, flanger, phaser and reverb effects. The most expensive multi-effects units may also have looper functions. Pedal-style multieffects range from fairly inexpensive stompboxes that contain two pedals and a few knobs to control the effects to large, expensive floor units with many pedals and knobs. Rackmounted multieffects units are typically mounted in a rack. Guitarists and bassists may mount their rackmounted multieffects unit in the same rack with their preamplifier and power amplifier.\n\nA tabletop unit is a type of multi-effects device that sits on a desk and is controlled manually. One such example is the [[Pod (amp modeler)|Pod]] guitar amplifier modeler. Digital effects designed for [[DJ]]s are often sold in tabletop models, so that the units can be placed alongside a [[DJ mixer]], turntables and [[scratching|CD scratching]] gear.<ref>Bartlett, Bruce; Bartlett, Jenny (2008).

Note the four inputs, two for regular sound and two which are run through the onboard [[tremolo]] effect unit.]]\nEffects are often incorporated into [[amplifier]]s and even some types of instruments. Electric [[guitar amplifier]]s typically have built-in [[reverb]] and [[distortion]], while acoustic guitar and [[keyboard amplifier]]s tend to only have built-in reverb. Some acoustic instrument amplifiers have reverb, chorus, compression and equalization (bass and treble) effects. Vintage guitar amps (and their 2010-era reissued models) typically have [[tremolo]] and [[vibrato]] effects, and sometimes reverb. The Fender Bandmaster Reverb amp, for example, had built-in reverb and vibrato. Built-in effects may offer the user less control than standalone pedals or rackmounted units. For example, on some lower- to mid-priced [[bass amplifier]]s, the only control on the [[dynamic range compression|audio compression]] effect is a button or switch to turn it on or off, or a single knob. In contrast, a pedal or rackmounted unit would typically provide ratio, threshold and attack knobs and sometimes \"soft knee\" or other options to allow the user to control the compression.\n\nSince the 2000s, guitar amplifiers began having built-in multi-effects units or digital modeling effects. Bass amplifiers are less likely to have built-in effects, although some may have a [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]]/[[limiter]] or [[fuzz bass]] effect.<ref>Eiche.

This is done by creating a large number of echoes that gradually fade away in volume or \"decay\". One early technique for creating a reverb effect was to send an amplified signal of the music via a speaker to another room with reflective surfaces, such as a tile bathroom, and then record the natural reverberations that were produced. A plate reverb system uses an electromechanical [[transducer]] to create vibrations in a plate of [[metal]]. [[Spring reverb]] systems, which are often used in guitar amplifiers, use a transducer to create vibrations in a spring. Digital reverb effects use various [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] [[algorithm]]s to create the reverb effect, often by using multiple feedback [[Delay (audio effect)|delay circuits]]. [[Rockabilly]] and [[Surf music|surf guitar]] are two genres that make heavy use of reverb.<ref>Hubner, D; Runstein, R (2009).

Feedback that occurs from a vocal mic into a [[PA system]] is almost always avoided. However, in some styles of [[rock music]], [[electric guitar]] players intentionally create feedback by playing their instrument directly in front of a heavily amplified, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[guitar amplifier]]'s [[speaker enclosure]]. The creative use of feedback effects was pioneered by guitarists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] in the 1960s. This technique creates sustained, high-pitched [[overtone]]s and unusual sounds not possible through regular playing techniques. Guitar feedback effects can be difficult to perform, because it is difficult to determine the sound volume and guitar position relative to a guitar amp's loudspeaker necessary for achieving the desired feedback sound.<ref>Wright, Ed (2007).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=KsV_l0FeKlwC ''The Guitar F/X Cookbook''], Hal Leonard. p. 41.</ref> Guitar feedback effects are used in a number of [[rock music|rock]] genres, including [[psychedelic rock]], [[heavy metal music]] and [[punk rock]].\n[[File:EBow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[EBow]] guitar string resonator.]]\n\n[[EBow]] is a [[brand name]] of Heet Sound Products, of Los Angeles, California, for a small, handheld, battery-powered resonator. The Ebow was invented by Greg Heet, as a way to make a note on an electric guitar string resonate continuously, creating an effect that sounds similar to a bowed violin note or a sustained [[pipe organ]] note. The resonator uses a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] - inductive string driver - feedback circuit, including a sensor coil, driver coil, and amplifier, to induce forced string resonance. The Ebow brand resonator is monophonic, and drives only one string at a time.\n\nOther handheld guitar and bass resonators on the market, manufactured under the tradename SRG, produced by Aescher Europa, in Germany, are available in both monophonic (one note at a time) and polyphonic (multiple notes at once) models, which include multiple onboard trigger switch effects, such as HPF (high pass filter) for enhancing harmonics and producing feedback effects, and LPF (low pass filter), producing a bass boost with a cello sound on heavy gauge strings. Later EBow models, such as the plus Ebow, contain a mode slide switch on the back, which allows the player to either produce just sustain or [[overtone]] feedback in addition to sustain.<ref name=\"The Contemporary Guitar\"/>\n\nPedals such as the Boss DF-2 and FB-2 use an internally generated signal matched to the pitch of the guitar that can be sustained indefinitely by depressing the pedal.\n\nMany [[effects unit#Dynamics|compressor pedals]] are often also marketed as \"sustainer pedals\". As a note is sustained, it loses energy and volume due to diminishing vibration in the string. The compressor pedal boosts its electrical signal to the specified [[dynamic range]], slightly prolonging the duration of the note.<ref>Hunter, Dave (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7DjYrk7Vap4C ''Guitar Effects Pedals: The Practical Handbook'']. Hal Leonard. p. 25.</ref> This, combined with heavy distortion and the close proximity of the guitar and the speaker cabinet, can lead to infinite sustain at higher volumes.\n\n===Other effects===\n'''Envelope follower:''' An envelope follower activates an effect once a designated volume is reached. One effect that uses an envelope follower is the ''[[auto-wah]]'', which produces a \"wah\" effect depending on how loud or soft the notes are being played.<ref>{{Cite book|last=White, G|first=Louie, G|title=The Audio Dictionary Instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DulVm8t88QkC&dq=flanger+jet+plane&source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|page=138}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hopper|first=J|title=The Girl's Guide to Rocking Out|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwzQe_h-OjQC|year=2009|publisher=Workman Publishing|page=33}}</ref>\n[[File:Line 6 Flextone III Plus control panel.jpg|thumb|right|A Line 6 modeling amplifier shown from above.

One of the best known examples of this is [[Autotune]], a software program and effect unit which can be used to both correct pitch (it moves a pitch to the nearest semitone), and add vocal effects. Some stompbox-style vocal pedals contain multiple effects, such as reverb and pitch correction.\n\n'''Simulators:''' Simulators enable electric guitars to mimic the sound of other instruments such as [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[electric bass]] and [[sitar]].

The Hammond/Leslie combination has become an element in many genres of music. The Leslie Speaker and the Hammond Organ [[brand]]s are currently owned by [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation]]. The stompbox that simulates this effect is the [[Uni-Vibe]] pedal.\n\nThe '''[[Korg Kaoss Pad]]''' is a small [[touchpad]] [[MIDI]] controller, [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], and effects processor for audio and musical instruments, made by [[Korg]]. The Kaoss Pad's touchpad can be used to control its internal effects engine, which can be applied to a line-in signal or to samples recorded from the line-in. Effects types include pitch shifting, [[distortion]], filtering, [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]], [[tremolo]], [[flanging]], [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverberation]], auto-panning, gating, [[phaser (effect)|phasing]], and [[ring modulation]].\nThe Kaoss Pad can also be used as a [[MIDI controller]].\n\n==Bass effects==\n[[File:Bass effects - EH, fulltone, MXR, Demeter, AMT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A selection of bass effect pedals at a music store.]]\n{{Main|Bass effects}}\n[[Bass effects]] are electronic effects units that are designed for use with the low pitches created by an [[electric bass]] or for an [[upright bass]] used with a bass amp or [[PA system]]. Two examples of bass effects are [[fuzz bass]] and [[bass chorus]].  Some [[bass amplifier]]s have built-in effects, such as [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] or [[chorus effect|chorus]]. [[Upright bass]]ists in jazz, folk, blues and similar genres may use a bass [[preamplifier]], a small electronic device that matches the impedance between the  [[piezoelectric pickup]] and the amp or PA system. Bass preamps also allow for the gain of the signal to be boosted or cut. Some models also offer equalization controls, a compressor, and a [[DI box]] connection.\n\n==Boutique pedals==\n[[File:T-Rex Mudhoney-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[T-Rex Engineering|T-Rex]] brand \"Mudhoney\" overdrive pedal.]]\nBoutique pedals are designed by smaller, independent companies and are typically produced in limited quantities.

The low cost of natural gas and cheap labor supply during the Great Depression helped to fuel the company's early beginnings. The company doubled in size by 1932 and was able to bring the first natural gas to [[Minnesota]]. Over the next 50 years, Northern expanded even more as it acquired many energy companies and created new divisions within. It was reorganized in 1979 as the main subsidiary of a [[holding company]], [[InterNorth]], which was a diversified energy and energy-related products company. Although most of the acquisitions conducted were successful, some ended poorly. InterNorth competed with [[Cooper Industries]] over a hostile takeover of [[Crouse-Hinds Company]], an electrical products manufacturer. InterNorth was ultimately unsuccessful as Cooper bought out Crouse-Hinds. Cooper and InterNorth feuded over numerous suits during the course of the takeover that were eventually settled after the transaction was completed. The subsidiary Northern Natural Gas operated the largest natural gas pipeline company in North America. By the 1980s, InterNorth became a major force for natural gas production, transmission, and marketing as well as for natural gas liquids, and was an innovator in the [[plastics industry]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web| url= http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/57/Enron-Corporation.html|title=Enron Corporation - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Enron Corporation| website= referenceforbusiness.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref> In 1983, InterNorth merged with the Belco Petroleum Company, a [[Fortune 500]] oil exploration and development company founded by [[Arthur Belfer]].<ref name=Funding>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/belco-oil-gas-corp-history/ Funding Universe: \"History of Belco Oil & Gas Corp.\"] retrieved September 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==== Houston Natural Gas ====\nThe [[Houston Natural Gas]] (HNG) corporation was initially formed from the Houston Oil Co. in 1925 to provide gas to customers in the Houston market through the building of [[Pipeline transport|gas pipelines]]. Under the leadership of CEO Robert Herring from 1967 to 1981, the company became a large dominant force in the energy industry with a large pipeline network as a result from a prosperous period of growth in the early to mid-1970s. This growth was largely a result of the exploitation of the unregulated Texas natural gas market and the commodity surge in the early 1970s. Toward the end of the 1970s, HNG's luck began to run out with rising gas prices forcing clients to switch to oil. In addition, with the passing of the [[Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978]], the Texas market was more difficult to profit from and as a result, HNG's profits fell. After Herring's death in 1981, [[M.D. Matthews]] briefly took over as CEO in a 3-year stint with initial success, but ultimately, a big dip in earnings led to his exit. In 1984, [[Kenneth Lay]] succeeded Matthews and inherited the troubled, but large diversified energy conglomerate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edison to Enron: Energy Markets and Political Strategies|last=Bradley|first=Robert L.|publisher=Scrivener|year=2011|isbn=978-0470917367|location=|pages=371\u2013372, 464\u2013467|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== Merger ====\nInterNorth, in its conservative success became a target of corporate takeovers, the most prominent being corporate raider [[Irwin L.

The company had to pay Jacobs, who was still a threat, over $350 million and reorganize the company.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lay sold off any parts of the company that he believed didn't belong in the long-term future of Enron. Lay consolidated all the gas pipeline efforts under the Enron Gas Pipeline Operating Company. In addition, the company began to ramp up its electric power and natural gas efforts. In 1988 and 1989, the company began adding power plants and [[cogeneration]] units to its portfolio. In 1989, [[Jeffrey Skilling]], then a consultant at [[McKinsey & ...Company|McKinsey & Co.]], came up with the idea to link natural gas to consumers in more ways, effectively turning natural gas into a commodity. Enron adopted the idea and called it the \"Gas Bank.\" The division's success prompted Skilling to join Enron as the head of the Gas Bank in 1991.<ref name=\":2\" /> Another major development inside Enron was the beginning of the company's pivot to overseas that was expanded upon in the 1990s. Starting in 1989, the company received a $56 million loan from the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] (OPIC) for a power plant in Argentina.[[File:Enron Complex.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[1400 Smith Street|Enron Complex]] in [[Downtown Houston]].]]\n\n=== 1991\u20132000 ===\nOver the course of the 1990s, Enron made a few changes to its business plan that greatly improved the perceived profitability of the company. First, Enron invested heavily in overseas assets, specifically energy. Another major shift was the gradual transition of focus from a producer of energy to a company that acted more like an investment firm and sometimes a [[hedge fund]], making profits off the margins of the products it traded. These products were traded through the Gas Bank concept, now called the Enron Finance Corp. headed by Skilling.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Operations as a trading firm ====\nWith the success of the Gas Bank trading natural gas, Skilling looked to expand the horizons of his division, Enron Capital & Trade. Skilling hired [[Andrew Fastow]] in 1990 to help with this.\n\n==== Entrance into the retail energy market ====\nStarting in 1994 under the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]], Congress allowed states to deregulate their electricity utilities, allowing them to be opened for competition. California was one such state to do so. Enron, seeing an opportunity with rising prices, was eager to jump into the market. In 1997, Enron acquired [[Portland General Electric]] (PGE). Although an Oregon utility, it had potential to begin serving the massive California market since PGE was a regulated utility. The new Enron division, Enron Energy, ramped up its efforts by offering discounts to potential customers in California for switching their electric supplier to Enron from their previous supplier, starting in 1998. Enron Energy also began to sell natural gas to customers in Ohio and wind power in Iowa. However, in 1999, the company ended its retail endeavor, only offering wholesale energy as it was revealed it was spending upwards of $100 million a year.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Data management====\nAs fiber optic technology progressed in the 1990s, multiple companies, including Enron, attempted to make money by \"keeping the continuing network costs low\", which was done by owning their own network.<ref name=\"NYT1999\">{{cite news|last1=Schiesel|first1=Seth|title=Jumping Off the Bandwidth Wagon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/business/jumping-off-the-bandwidth-wagon.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 July 1999}}</ref> In 1997, FTV Communications LLC, a [[limited liability company]] formed by Enron subsidiary FirstPoint Communications, Inc., [[Williams Companies|Williams Communications Group, Inc.]] and [[Montana Power Company|Touch America]].<ref name=PRNEWS>{{cite news|title=Montana Power, Williams Communications, Enron Units Announce Fiber Providers for Portland-to-Los Angeles Network|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montana-power-williams-communications-enron-units-announce-fiber-providers-for-portland-to-los-angeles-network-77921802.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=[[PRNewswire]]|date=17 December 1997|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217071349/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montana-power-williams-communications-enron-units-announce-fiber-providers-for-portland-to-los-angeles-network-77921802.html|archive-date=February 17, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> FTV constructed a 1,380 mile fiber optic network between Portland and Las Vegas.<ref name=PRNEWS/> In 1998, Enron constructed a building in a rundown area of Las Vegas near E Sahara, building right over the \"backbone\" of fiber optic cables providing service to technology companies nationwide.<ref name=\"NPR04\">{{cite news|title=Profiting from Enron Bankruptcy|url=https://knpr.org/knpr/2004-11/profiting-enron-bankruptcy|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=[[Nevada Public Radio]]|date=29 November 2004|language=en}}</ref> The location had the ability to send \"the entire Library of Congress anywhere in the world within minutes\" and could stream \"video to the whole state of California\".<ref name=\"NPR04\"/> The location was also more protected from natural disasters than areas such as Los Angeles or the East Coast.<ref name=\"NPR04\"/> According to ''Wall Street Daily'', \"Enron had a secret,\" it \"wanted to trade bandwidth like it traded oil, gas, electricity, etc. It launched a secret plan to build an enormous amount of fiber optic transmission capacity in Las Vegas ...  it was all part of Enron\u2019s plan to essentially own the internet\",<ref name=\"WSdaily\">{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|title=SUPERNAP: The World\u2019s Most Advanced Data Center|url=https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2015/09/11/supernap-data-center/|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Wall Street Daily|date=11 September 2015}}</ref> essentially, Enron sought to have all US internet service providers rely on their Nevada facility to supply bandwidth, which Enron would sell in a fashion similar to other commodities.<ref name=\"REG2008\">{{cite news|last1=Vance|first1=Ashlee|title=Welcome to Las Vegas - Home of the technology superpower you've never heard of|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/24/switch_switchnap_rob_roy/?page=3|accessdate=19 February 2017|work=[[The Register]]|date=24 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2000, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling announced to analysts that they were going to open trading for their own \"high-speed fiber-optic networks that form the backbone for Internet traffic\". Investors quickly bought Enron stock following the announcement \"[[Dot-com bubble|as they did with most things Internet-related at the time]]\", with stock prices rising from $40 per share in January 2000 to $70 per share in March, peaking at $90 in the summer of 2000. Enron executives obtained [[windfall gain]]s from the rising stock prices, with a total of $924 million of stocks sold by high-level Enron employees between 2000 and 2001. Head of Enron Broadband Services, Kenneth Rice, sold 1 million shares himself, earning about $70 million in returns. As prices of existing fiber optic cables plummeted due to the vast oversupply of the system, with only 5% of the 40 million miles being active wires, Enron purchased the inactive \"dark fibers\", expecting to buy them at low cost and then make a profit as the need for more usage by internet providers increased, with Enron expecting to lease its acquired dark fibers in 20 year contracts to providers. However, Enron's accounting would use estimates to determine how much their dark fiber would be worth when \"lit\" and apply those estimates to their current income, adding exaggerated revenue to their accounts since transactions were not yet made and it was not known if the cables would ever be active. Enron's trading with other energy companies within the broadband market was its attempt to lure large telecommunications companies, such as [[Verizon Communications]], into its broadband scheme to create its own new market.<ref name=\"WPjan01\">{{cite news|last1=Behr|first1=Peter|title=Broadband Strategy Got Enron in Trouble; Bid to Create Market for Fiber-Optic Space Included Aggressive Accounting|work=[[The Washington Post]]|issue=E01|date=1 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nBy the second quarter of 2001, Enron Broadband Services was reporting losses. On March 12, 2001, a proposed 20-year deal between Enron and [[Blockbuster Inc.]] to stream [[Video on demand|movies on demand]] over Enron's connections was cancelled, with Enron shares dropping from $80 per share in mid-February 2001 to below $60 the week after the deal was killed. The branch of the company that Jeffrey Skilling \"said would eventually add $40 billion to Enron's stock value\" added only about $408 million in revenue for Enron in 2001, with the company's broadband arm closed shortly after its meager second-quarter earnings report in July 2001.<ref name=\"WPjan01\"/>\n\nFollowing the bankruptcy of Enron, telecommunications holdings were sold for \"pennies on the dollar\".<ref name=\"NPR04\"/> In 2002, Rob Roy of [[Switch (company)|Switch Communications]] purchased Enron's Nevada facility in an auction attended only by Roy. Enron's \"fiber plans were so secretive that few people even knew about the auction.\" The facility was sold for only $930,000.<ref name=\"NPR04\"/><ref name=\"WSdaily\"/> Following the sale, Switch  expanded to control \"the biggest data center in the world\".<ref name=\"WSdaily\"/>\n\n==== Overseas expansion ====\nEnron, seeing stability after the merger, began to look overseas for new possible energy opportunities in 1991.

The division was becoming a large share of earnings for Enron, contributing 25% of earnings in 1996. Mark and EI believed the water industry was the next market to be deregulated by authorities and seeing the potential, searched for ways to enter the market, similar to PGE.\n\nIn 1998, Enron International acquired [[Wessex Water]] for $2.88 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/nov/05/corporatefraud.enron|title=How Enron's great water adventure ended in tears|date=2002-11-05|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-27}}</ref> Wessex Water became the core asset of a new company, Azurix, which expanded to other water companies.

The company developed, built, and operated [[power plant]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] while dealing with rules of law and other infrastructures worldwide.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}} Enron owned a large network of natural gas pipelines, which stretched coast to coast and border to border including Northern Natural Gas, [[Florida Gas Transmission]], [[Transwestern Pipeline]] company and a partnership in [[Northern Border Pipeline]] from Canada.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}} The states of California, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island had already passed power deregulation laws by July 1996, the time of Enron's proposal to acquire [[Portland General Electric]] corporation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Loren |title=Enron: the rise and fall |page=113 |publisher=John Wiley & Son |year=1003 |isbn=0-471-47888-1 }}</ref> During 1998, Enron began operations in the [[water sector]], creating the [[Azurix]] Corporation, which it part-floated on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] during June 1999. Azurix failed to become successful in the [[water utility]] market, and one of its major concessions, in [[Buenos Aires]], was a large-scale money-loser.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}} After the relocation to Houston, many analysts{{Who|date=July 2009}} criticized the Enron management as being greatly in debt. Enron management pursued aggressive retribution against its critics, setting the pattern for dealing with accountants, lawyers, and the financial media.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nEnron grew wealthy due largely to marketing, [[promotion (marketing)|promoting]] power, and its high stock price.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Enron was named \"America's Most Innovative Company\" by the magazine ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' for six consecutive years, from 1996 to 2001.<ref>Sharp, p.13.</ref> It was on the ''Fortune''{{'}}s \"100 Best Companies to Work for in America\" list during 2000, and had offices that were stunning in their opulence. Enron was hailed by many, including labor and the workforce, as an overall great company, praised for its large long-term pensions, benefits for its workers and extremely [[Vitality curve|effective management]] until the exposure of its corporate fraud. The first [[Financial analyst|analyst]] to question the company's success story was [[Daniel Scotto]], an energy market expert at [[BNP Paribas]], who issued a note in August 2001 entitled ''Enron: All stressed up and no place to go'', which encouraged investors to sell Enron stocks, although he only changed his recommendation on the stock from \"buy\" to \"neutral\".<ref>{{cite news|last=English|first=Simon|title=Whistle-blower sent off|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nAs was later discovered, many of Enron's recorded assets and profits were inflated or even wholly fraudulent and nonexistent. One example of fraudulent records was during 1999 when Enron promised to repay [[Merrill Lynch & Co.]]'s investment with interest in order to show a profit on its books. Debts and losses were put into entities formed \"offshore\" that were not included in the company's [[financial statement]]s, and other sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between Enron and related companies were used to eliminate unprofitable entities from the company's books.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nThe company's most valuable asset and the largest source of honest income, the 1930s-era Northern Natural Gas company, was eventually purchased by a group of Omaha investors, who relocated its headquarters back to Omaha; it is now a unit of [[Warren Buffett]]'s [[Berkshire Hathaway Energy]]. NNG was established as collateral for a $2.5&nbsp;billion capital infusion by [[Dynegy|Dynegy Corporation]] when Dynegy was planning to buy Enron. When Dynegy examined Enron's financial records carefully, they repudiated the deal and dismissed their CEO, Chuck Watson. The new chairman and CEO, the late Daniel Dienstbier, had been president of NNG and an Enron executive at one time and was forced out of Enron by Ken Lay.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}}  Dienstbier was an acquaintance of Warren Buffett. NNG continues to be profitable now.{{Relevance inline|date=May 2016}}\n\n== 2001 Accounting scandals ==\n{{Main|Enron scandal}}\nDuring 2001, after a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures bordering on fraud perpetrated throughout the 1990s involving Enron and its accounting company [[Arthur Andersen]], Enron suffered the largest [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in history (since surpassed by those of [[Worldcom]] during 2002 and [[Lehman Brothers]] during 2008).\n[[File:EnronStockPriceAugust2000toJanuary2001.svg|thumb|Stock Price of Enron from August 2000 to January 2002]]\nAs the scandal progressed, Enron share prices decreased from US $90.56 during the summer of 2000, to just pennies.<ref>http://www.gilardi.com/pdf/enro13ptable.pdf</ref> Enron had been considered a [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] stock investment, so this was an unprecedented event in the financial world. Enron's demise occurred after the revelation that much of its profits and revenue were the result of deals with [[Special purpose entity|special purpose entities]] ([[limited partnership]]s which it controlled). This meant that many of Enron's debts and the losses that it suffered were not reported in its [[financial statement]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nA rescue attempt by a similar, smaller energy company, [[Dynegy]], failed during late November due to concerns about an unexpected restatement of earnings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. In addition, the scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the \"Big Five\" - the world's foremost accounting firms. The company was found guilty of [[obstruction of justice]] during 2002 for destroying documents related to the Enron audit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Since the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, Andersen was forced to stop auditing public companies. Although the conviction was dismissed during 2005 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the damage to the Andersen name has prevented it from reviving as a viable business even on a limited scale.\n\nEnron also withdrew a naming-rights deal with the [[Houston Astros]] [[Major League Baseball]] club to have its name associated with their new stadium, which was known formerly as Enron Field (now [[Minute Maid Park]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/ballpark/index.jsp|title=Minute Maid Park|website=Houston Astros Official Site|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Accounting practices===\nEnron used a variety of deceptive, bewildering, and fraudulent accounting practices and tactics to cover its fraud in reporting Enron's financial information. Special Purpose Entities were created to mask significant liabilities from Enron's financial statements. These entities made Enron seem more profitable than it actually was, and created a dangerous spiral in which, each quarter, corporate officers would have to perform more and more financial deception to create the illusion of billions of dollars in profit while the company was actually losing money.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/01/15/0115enron.html|title=Dan Ackman, \"Enron the Incredible\"|date=January 15, 2002|publisher=Forbes.com, Jan. 17, 2002}}</ref> This practice increased their stock price to new levels, at which point the executives began to work on [[insider trading|insider information]] and trade millions of dollars' worth of Enron stock. The executives and insiders at Enron knew about the offshore accounts that were hiding losses for the company; the investors, however, did not. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow directed the team which created the off-books companies, and manipulated the deals to provide himself, his family, and his friends with hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed revenue, at the expense of the corporation for which he worked and its stockholders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[File:Arthur Andersen Witnesses.jpg|thumb|Arthur Andersen Witnesses]]\n\nDuring 1999, Enron initiated EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States. Enron president and chief operating officer [[Jeffrey Skilling]] began advocating a novel idea: the company didn't really need any \"assets\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} By promoting the company's aggressive investment strategy, he helped make Enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, trading over $27&nbsp;billion per quarter. The corporation's financial claims, however, had to be accepted at face value. Under Skilling, Enron adopted [[mark to market]] accounting, in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if currently real. Thus, Enron could record gains from what over time might turn out to be losses, as the company's fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price on [[Wall Street]] during the so-called [[Tech boom]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} But when a company's success is measured by undocumented financial statements, actual balance sheets are inconvenient. Indeed, Enron's unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so increase the stock price.

Mark had a major role in the development of the Dabhol project in India, Enron's largest international endeavor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== Projects ====\nEnron International constructed power plants and pipelines across the globe. Some are presently still operating, including the massive Teesside plant in England. Others, like a barge-mounted plant off Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, cost Enron money by lawsuits and investment losses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Puerto Plata was a barge-mounted power plant next to the hotel ''Hotelero del Atlantico''. When the plant was activated, winds blew soot from the plant onto the hotel guests' meals, blackening their food. The winds also blew garbage from nearby slums into the plant's water-intake system. For some time the only solution was to hire men who would row out and push the garbage away with their paddles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through mid-2000 the company collected a paltry $3.5&nbsp;million from a $95&nbsp;million investment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Enron also had other investment projects in Europe, South America, Argentina, [[Brazil]], Bolivia, [[Colombia]], Mexico, [[Jamaica]], Venezuela, and across the [[Caribbean]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== India ====\nAround 1992 [[India]]n experts came to the United States to find energy investors to help with India's energy shortage problems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} During December 1993, Enron finalized a 20-year power-purchase contract with the [[Maharashtra State Electricity Board]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The contract allowed Enron to construct a massive 2,015 megawatt power plant on a remote volcanic bluff {{convert|100|mi|km}} south of Mumbai. Construction would be completed in two phases, and Enron would form the [[Dabhol Power Company]] to help manage the plant. The power project was the first step in a $20&nbsp;billion scheme to help rebuild and stabilize India's power grid. Enron, [[General Electric|GE]] (which was selling turbines to the project), and [[Bechtel]] (which was actually constructing the plant), each contributed 10% [[Equity (finance)|equity]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nDuring 1996, when India's Congress Party was no longer in power, the Indian government assessed the project as being excessively expensive and refused to pay for the plant and stopped construction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the local state-owned utility, was required by contract to continue to pay Enron plant maintenance charges, even if no power was purchased from the plant. The MSEB determined that it could not afford to purchase the power (at Rs. 8 per unit kWh) charged by Enron.

In all events, he was not a [[patriarch of Alexandria]], as is affirmed in an early biography,<ref>''MPG'', lxxxvi. 1, pp.&nbsp;297\u2013310</ref>{{clarify|what is \"MPG\"?|date=February 2013}} written by one Johannes, a notary, and stating that Eusebius was called by Cyril to be his successor in the [[Bishop|episcopate]].\n\nThere has been much dispute regarding the details of his life and the age in which he lived. Galland (Vet. Patr. Biblioth., VIII, 23) says: \"de Eusebio qui vulgo dicitur episcopus Alexandr\u00e6 incerta omnia\" (Concerning Eusebius, commonly called bishop of Alexandria there is nothing sure). His writings have been attributed to Eusebius of Emesa, Eusebius of C\u00e6sarea, and others. According to an old biography said to have been written by his notary, the monk John, and discovered by Cardinal Mai, he lived in the fifth century and led a monastic life near Alexandria. The fame of his virtues attracted the attention of Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria, who visited him with his clergy, and in 444, when dying, had him elected his successor, and consecrated him bishop, though much against his will. Eusebius displayed great zeal in the exercise of his office and did much good by his preaching. Among those he converted was a certain Alexander, a man of senatorial rank. After having ruled his see for seven or, according to another account, for twenty years, he made Alexander his successor and retired to the desert, whence Cyril had summoned him and there died in the odor of sanctity.\n\nWhile Mai seems to have established the existence of a Eusebius of Alexandria who lived in the fifth century, it had been objected than neither the name of Eusebius or his successor Alexander, appears in the list of the occupants of that ancient see. [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Dioscurus]] is mentioned as the immediate successor of Cyril. Nor does the style of the homilies seem on the whole in keeping with the age of Cyril. It may be noted, however, that the biographer of Eusebius expressly states that the Cyril in question is the great opponent of Nestorius. Various solution of the difficulty have been proposed. Thilo<ref>Ueber die Schriften des Eusebius v. Alexandrian U. des Eusebius von Emesa, Halle, 1832</ref> thinks that the authorship of the homilies is to be assigned either to a certain monk \u2013 one of four brothers 3 of the fifth century, or to a [[presbyter]] and court chaplain of [[Justinian I]], who took an active part in the theological strifes of the sixth century. Mai suggests that after the death of Cyril, there were two bishops at Alexandria, Dioscurus, the [[Monophysite]] leader, and Eusebius, the head of the Catholic party. The homilies cover a variety of subjects, and the author is one of the earliest patristic witnesses to the doctrine regarding the descent of Christ into Hell. A list of homilies with the complete text is given by Mai.<ref>Spicilegium Romanum IX</ref> They may also be found in Migne,<ref>P.G., LXXXVI. The \"Sermo de Confusione Diaboli\"</ref> which was published with an introduction by Rand in \"Modern Philology\", II, 261.\n\n==Works==\nThese homilies enjoyed some renown in the [[Eastern Church]] in the sixth and seventh centuries.\n\nThe discourses belong probably to the fifth or sixth century, and possibly originated in [[Alexandria]]. They deal with the life of Jesus of Nazareth and with questions of ecclesiastical life and practise, which they resolve in a monastic-[[ascetic]] way. Their literary character is not quite clear; while most of them are adapted for public delivery, not a few bear the character of ecclesiastical pronouncements.

As such he was regarded by Berengar himself and by his opponents [[Dietwin of Liege]] (Theodwin), [[Durand of Troarne]], and [[Humbert of Mourmoutiers]]. But when he recognized the strength of the opposition, he favored a compromise; at any rate he advised Berengar is 1054 to swear to the formula presented to him.\n\nNevertheless, Berengar considered him his friend many years later and requested him to silence a certain Galfrid Martini or to arrange a disputation. In his reply Eusebius not only regretted the whole controversy, but also stated that he would abide by the words of the Bible, according to which the bread and wine after the consecration become the body and blood of the Lord (see [[transubstantiation]]); if one asks how this can take place, the answer must be that it is not according to the order of nature but in accordance with the divine omnipotence; at any rate one must be careful not to give offense to the plain Christian. The epistle is a downright renunciation of Berengar in case he should still maintain his view.\n\nIn favor of the supposition that Eusebius changed his opinion from deference to the [[List of Counts and Dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou]], the decided opponent of Berengar and his doctrine, it can be adduced that he did not defend Berengar against the hostilities of the court, and that for a long time he sided with this violent prince. It is also possible that the fact impressed itself upon Eusebius that the religious consciousness of the time more and more opposed Berengar. Our knowledge, however, is too fragmentary to pass a very accurate sentence.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Schaff-Herzog}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angers, Eusebius Of}}\n[[Category:1081 deaths]]\n[[Category:11th-century bishops]]\n[[Category:11th-century Roman Catholic bishops]]\n[[Category:Bishops of Angers]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]", "sha1": "2ywv2s8z4hmrfhf3ntqga9bm4nlgx57"}}, {"title": "Eusebius", "ns": "0", "id": "10172", "revision": {"id": "864638837", "parentid": "864123836", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T14:32:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ffranc", "id": "34162051"}, "comment": "removed [[Category:Anti-Gnosticism]]; added [[Category:Christian anti-Gnosticism]] using [[WP:HC|HotCat]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Greek church historian}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Infobox writer\n| name= Eusebius of Caesarea\n| image= Eusebius of Caesarea.jpg\n| caption = Eusebius in a modern imagining\n| birth_name=Eusebius\n| birth_date=260/265\n| birth_place=\n| death_date=339/340 (aged 74\u201379)\n| death_place=\n| occupation=[[Bishop]], [[historian]], [[theologian]]\n| nationality=\n| period=[[Constantinian dynasty]]\n| movement=\n| notableworks= ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', ''On the Life of Pamphilus'', ''Chronicle'', ''On the Martyrs''\n}}\n\n'''Eusebius of Caesarea''' ({{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0|\u02c8|s|i\u02d0|b|i|\u0259|s|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|\u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}, ''Eus\u00e9bios t\u00e9s Kaisare\u00edas''; {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;260/265&nbsp;\u2013 339/340), also known as '''Eusebius Pamphili''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|\u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bc\u03d5\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5)}}, was a [[historian of Christianity]], [[exegete]], and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[polemicist]].

His successor at the [[Episcopal see|See]] of Caesarea, [[Acacius of Caesarea|Acacius]], wrote a ''Life of Eusebius'', a work that has since been lost. Eusebius' own surviving works probably only represent a small portion of his total output.  Beyond notices in his extant writings, the major sources are the 5th-century ecclesiastical historians [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]], [[Sozomen]], and [[Theodoret]], and the 4th-century Christian author [[Jerome]]. There are assorted notices of his activities in the writings of his contemporaries [[Athanasius]], [[Arius]], [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], and [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]]. Eusebius' pupil, [[Eusebius of Emesa]], provides some incidental information.<ref>Wallace-Hadrill, 11.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nIn his ''Ecclesiastical History'', Eusebius writes of [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] as his contemporary. If this is true, Eusebius' birth must have been before Dionysius' death in autumn 264; most modern scholars date the birth to some point in the five years between 260 and 265.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 277; Wallace-Hadrill, 7; Quasten dates his birth to \"about 263\" (3.309).</ref> He was presumably born in the town in which he lived for most of his adult life, [[Caesarea Maritima]].<ref>Louth, \"Birth of church history\", 266; Quasten, 3.309.</ref> He was baptized and instructed in the city,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wallace-Hadrill, 12, citing Socrates, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 1.8; Theodoret, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 1.11.</ref> and lived in Palestine in 296, when [[Diocletian]]'s army passed through the region (in the ''Life of Constantine'', Eusebius recalls seeing [[Constantine I|Constantine]] traveling with the army).<ref>Wallace-Hadrill, 12, citing ''Vita Constantini'' 1.19.</ref> Eusebius was made [[presbyter]] by [[Agapius of Caesarea]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Some, like theologian and ecclesiastical historian [[John Henry Newman]], understand Eusebius' statement that he had heard [[Dorotheus of Tyre]] \"expound the Scriptures wisely in the Church\" to indicate that Eusebius was Dorotheus' pupil while the priest was resident in Antioch; others, like the scholar D. S. Wallace-Hadrill, deem the phrase too ambiguous to support the contention.<ref>Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 7.32.4, qtd. and tr. D. S. Wallace-Hadrill, 12; Wallace-Hadrill cites J. H. Newman, ''The Arians of the Fourth Century'' (1890), 262, in 12 n. 4.</ref>\n\nBy the 3rd century, Caesarea had a population of about 100,000. It had been a pagan city since [[Pompey]] had given control of the city to the [[gentile]]s during his command of the eastern provinces in the 60s BC. The gentiles retained control of the city for the three centuries to follow, despite Jewish petitions for joint governorship. Gentile government was strengthened by the city's refoundation under [[Herod the Great]] (r.&nbsp;37\u20134&nbsp;BC), when it had taken on the name of [[Augustus|Augustus Caesar]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 81\u201382; cf. also A. H. M. Jones, ''The Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1937), 273\u201374.</ref> In addition to the gentile settlers, Caesarea had large Jewish and Samaritan minorities. Eusebius was probably born into the Christian contingent of the city. Caesarea's Christian community presumably had a history reaching back to [[Apostolic Age|apostolic times]],<ref>Acts 8:40, 10:1\u201348; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 82, 327 n. 11.</ref> but it is a common claim that no bishops are attested for the town before about 190,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 82.</ref> even though the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] 7.46 states that [[Zacchaeus]] was the first bishop.\n\nThrough the activities of the theologian [[Origen]] (185/6\u2013254) and the school of his follower [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]] (later 3rd century \u2013 309), Caesarea became a center of Christian learning. Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information, or which churches were using which gospels, regarding the texts which became the [[New Testament]]. The information used to create the late-fourth-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the [[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]] [HE] of Eusebius of Caesarea, wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were accepted by the third-century churches throughout the known world, a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.<ref>C.G. Bateman, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1653073 Origen\u2019s Role in the Formation of the New Testament Canon], 2010.</ref>\n\nOn his deathbed, Origen had made a bequest of his private library to the Christian community in the city.<ref>Quasten, 3.309.</ref> Together with the books of his patron Ambrosius, Origen's library (including the original manuscripts of his works<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.32.3\u20134; Kofsky, 12.</ref>{{refn|Pamphilus might not have obtained all of Origen's writings, however: the library's text of Origen's commentary on Isaiah broke off at 30:6, while the original commentary was said to have taken up thirty volumes.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 333 n. 114, citing Eusebius, ''HE'' 6.32.1; ''In Is''. p. 195.20\u201321 Ziegler.</ref>|group=notes}}) formed the core of the collection that Pamphilus established.<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.32.3\u20134; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 93; idem., \"Eusebius of Caesarea\", 2 col. 2.</ref> Pamphilus also managed a school that was similar to (or perhaps a re-establishment of<ref>Levine, 124\u201325.</ref>) that of Origen.<ref>Kofsky, 12, citing Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 7.32.25. On Origen's school, see: Gregory, ''Oratio Panegyrica''; Kofsky, 12\u201313.</ref> Pamphilus was compared to [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] and [[Peisistratos|Pisistratus]], for he had gathered Bibles \"from all parts of the world\".<ref>Levine, 125.</ref> Like his model Origen, Pamphilus maintained close contact with his students. Eusebius, in his history of the persecutions, alludes to the fact that many of the Caesarean martyrs lived together, presumably under Pamphilus.<ref>Levine, 122.</ref>\n\nSoon after Pamphilus settled in Caesarea (''ca''. 280s), he began teaching Eusebius, who was then somewhere between twenty and twenty-five.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 94.</ref> Because of his close relationship with his schoolmaster, Eusebius was sometimes called ''Eusebius Pamphili'': \"Eusebius, son of Pamphilus\".{{refn|There are three interpretations of this term: (1) that Eusebius was the \"spiritual son\", or favored pupil, of Pamphilus;<ref>Quasten, 3.310.</ref> (2) that Eusebius was literally adopted by Pamphilus;<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and (3) that Eusebius was Pamphilus' biological son. The third explanation is the least popular among scholars. The scholion on the ''Preparation for the Gospels'' 1.3 in the ''Codex Paris''. 451 is usually adduced in support of the thesis. Most reject the scholion as too late or misinformed, but E. H. Gifford, an editor and translator of the ''Preparation'', believes it to have been written by [[Arethas of Caesarea|Arethas]], the tenth-century archbishop of Caesarea, who was in a position to know the truth of the matter.<ref>Wallace-Hadrill, 12 n. 1.</ref>|group=notes}} The name may also indicate that Eusebius was made Pamphilus' heir.<ref>Wallace-Hadrill, 11\u201312.</ref> Pamphilus gave Eusebius a strong admiration for the thought of Origen.<ref>Quasten, 3.309\u201310.</ref> Neither Pamphilus nor Eusebius knew Origen personally;<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 93, 95; Louth, \"Birth of church history\", 266.</ref> Pamphilus probably picked up Origenist ideas during his studies under [[Pierius]] (nicknamed \"Origen Junior\"<ref>Jerome, ''de Viris Illustribus'' 76, qtd. and tr.

The library's biblical and theological contents were more impressive: Origen's [[Hexapla]] and [[Tetrapla]]; a copy of the original Aramaic version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]; and many of Origen's own writings.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Marginal comments in extant manuscripts note that Pamphilus and his friends and pupils, including Eusebius, corrected and revised much of the biblical text in their library.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Their efforts made the hexaplaric Septuagint text increasingly popular in Syria and Palestine.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 95.</ref> Soon after joining Pamphilus' school, Eusebius started helping his master expand the library's collections and broaden access to its resources. At about this time Eusebius compiled a ''Collection of Ancient Martyrdoms'', presumably for use as a general reference tool.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn the 290s, Eusebius began work on his ''magnum opus'', the ''Ecclesiastical History'', a narrative history of the Church and Christian community from the [[Apostolic Age]] to Eusebius' own time. At about the same time, he worked on his ''Chronicle'', a universal calendar of events from the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to, again, Eusebius' own time. He completed the first editions of the ''Ecclesiastical History'' and ''Chronicle'' before 300.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 277; Wallace-Hadrill, 12\u201313.</ref>\n\n==Bishop of Caesarea==\nEusebius succeeded [[Agapius of Caesarea|Agapius]] as Bishop of Caesarea soon after 313  and was called on by [[Arius]] who had been excommunicated by his bishop [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]]. An episcopal council in Caesarea pronounced Arius blameless.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Geza|title=Christian Beginnings from Nazareth to Nicea|accessdate=Feb 4, 2016|date=2012|publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press|page=228}}</ref> Eusebius, a learned man and famous author, enjoyed the favour of the [[Emperor Constantine]].

Shelley, ''Church History in Plain Language,'' (2nd ed. Dallas, Texas: Word Publishing, 1995.), p.102.</ref>\n\nThe theological views of Arius, that taught the subordination of the Son to the Father, continued to be a problem. [[Eustathius of Antioch]] strongly opposed the growing influence of [[Origen|Origen's]] theology as the root of [[Arianism]]. Eusebius, an admirer of Origen, was reproached by Eustathius for deviating from the Nicene faith. Eusebius prevailed and Eustathius was deposed at a [[synod]] in [[Antioch]].\n\nHowever, [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] became a more powerful opponent and in 334, he was summoned before a synod in Caesarea (which he refused to attend). In the following year, he was again summoned before a [[First Synod of Tyre|synod in Tyre]] at which Eusebius of Caesarea presided. Athanasius, foreseeing the result, went to [[Constantinople]] to bring his cause before the Emperor. Constantine called the bishops to his court, among them Eusebius. Athanasius was condemned and exiled at the end of 335. Eusebius remained in the Emperor's favour throughout this time and more than once was exonerated with the explicit approval of the Emperor Constantine. After the Emperor's death (c.337), Eusebius wrote the [[Life of Constantine]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KchhO8KEy3cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Life+of+Constantine%22&lr=&num=100#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Life of Constantine'', Google books]</ref> an important historical work because of eye witness accounts and the use of primary sources. Eusebius died c.339.<ref>Colm Luibheid, ''The Essential Eusebius : The Story of the First Centuries of the Christian Church in the Words of Its Greatest Historian'', Mentor-Omega Press, 1966, p 31.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMuch like his birth, the exact date of Eusebius' death is unknown. However, there is primary text evidence from a council held in Antioch that by the year 341, his successor Acacius had already filled the seat as Bishop. [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]] and Sozomen write about Eusebius' death, and place it just before Constantine's son [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] died, which was in early 340. They also say that it was after the second banishment of Athanasius, which began in mid 339. This means that his death occurred some time between the second half of 339 and early 340.<ref>Schaff, Philip and Rev.

Although posterity suspected him of [[Arianism]], Eusebius had made himself indispensable by his method of authorship; his comprehensive and careful excerpts from original sources saved his successors the painstaking labor of original research. Hence, much has been preserved, quoted by Eusebius, which otherwise would have been lost.\n\nThe literary productions of Eusebius reflect on the whole the course of his life. At first, he occupied himself with works on Biblical criticism under the influence of [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]] and probably of [[Dorotheus of Tyre]] of the [[School of Antioch]]. Afterward, the persecutions under [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]] directed his attention to the martyrs of his own time and the past, and this led him to the history of the whole Church and finally to the history of the world, which, to him, was only a preparation for ecclesiastical history.\n\nThen followed the time of the Arian controversies, and [[dogma]]tic questions came into the foreground. Christianity at last found recognition by the State; and this brought new problems\u2014apologies of a different sort had to be prepared. Lastly, Eusebius wrote eulogies in praise of Constantine. To all this activity must be added numerous writings of a miscellaneous nature, addresses, letters, and the like, and exegetical works that extended over the whole of his life and that include both commentaries and treatises on [[Biblical archaeology]].\n\n===''Onomasticon''===\nEusebius' ''Onomasticon'' (more properly, ''On the Place-Names in the Holy Scripture'', {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc7 \u0398\u03b5\u03af\u1fb3 \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1fc7}}) is a directory of place names, or \"[[gazetteer]]\", a primary source that provides [[Historical geography|historical geographers]] with a contemporary knowledge of fourth-century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]. It sits uneasily between the ancient genres of geography and lexicography, taking elements from both but a member of neither.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 106.</ref> \nEusebius' description of his own method, who wrote: \"I shall collect the entries from the whole of the divinely inspired Scriptures, and I shall set them out grouped by their initial letters so that one may easily perceive what lies scattered throughout the text,\"<ref>''Onomasticon'' p. 2.14ff., qtd. and tr. Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 107.</ref> implies that he had no similar type of book to work from; his work was entirely original, based only on the text of the Bible.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 106\u20137.</ref> Eusebius organizes his entries into separate categories according to their first letters. The entries for [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] under [[Tau]], for example, read as follows:<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 107.</ref> \n<blockquote>Tina (Kinah, 15:22): of the tribe of Judah.<br>\nTelem (15:24): of the tribe of Judah.<br>\nTessam ([Azem] 15:29): of the tribe of Judah.<br>\nTyre ([Zer] 19:35): of the tribe of Naphthali.</blockquote>\n\nUnder each letter, the entries are organized first by the book they are found in, and then by their place in that book. In almost all of the entries in his geographical opus, Eusebius brings down the respective distances in Roman \"[[milestone]]s\" (''semeia'') from major points of reference, such as from [[Jerusalem]], [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Gubrin]] (Eleutheropolis), [[Hebron]], [[Ptolemais Akko|Ptolemais]], [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], etc. In Eusebius' ''Onomasticon'', distances between each \"milestone\" were usually 1,600 meters\u20131,700 meters, although the standard Roman mile was 1,475 meters. Since most villages in the ''Onomasticon'' are far removed from Roman-built roads, scholars have concluded that Eusebius did not glean the geographical information from maps based on a milestone survey, but rather collected the information from some other source.<ref>Benjamin Isaac and Israel Roll, ''Roman Roads in Judaea I \u2013 The Legio-Scythopolis Road'', [[British Archaeological Reports|B.A.R.]] International Series, Oxford 1982, p. 12</ref>\n\nWhere there is a contemporary town at the site or nearby, Eusebius notes it in the corresponding entry. \"[[Pistacia palaestina|Terebinth]]\", for example, describes [[Shechem]] as \"near Neapolis\", modern [[Nablus]], and \"[[Tophet]]\" is located \"in the suburbs of Jerusalem\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n====Date====\nThe ''Onomasticon'' has traditionally been dated before 324, on the basis of its sparse references to Christianity, and complete absence of remarks on Constantine's buildings in the Holy Land. The work also describes traditional religious practices at the oak of [[Mamre]] as though they were still happening, while they are known to have been suppressed soon after 325, when a church was built on the site.<ref>Barnes, \"Onomasticon\", 413.</ref> Eusebius references to the encampment of the [[Legio X Fretensis]] at Aila (in southern Israel, near modern [[Aqaba]] and [[Eilat]]); the X Fretensis was probably transferred from Jerusalem to Aila under Diocletian.<ref>Barnes, \"Onomasticon\", 413 n. 4.</ref>\n\n====Language====\nEusebius compiled his work in [[Greek language|Greek]], although a Latin translation of the Onomasticon was made by [[Jerome]] about a century later.\n\n===Biblical text criticism===\n[[File:Fol. 10v-11r Egmond Gospels.jpg|thumb|Eusebius's [[canon tables]] were often included in Early Medieval [[Gospel book]]s]]\nPamphilus and Eusebius occupied themselves with the [[textual criticism]] of the [[Septuagint]] text of the [[Old Testament]] and especially of the [[New Testament]]. An edition of the Septuagint seems to have been already prepared by [[Origen]], which, according to [[Jerome]], was revised and circulated by Eusebius and Pamphilus. For an easier survey of the material of the four Evangelists, Eusebius divided his edition of the New Testament into paragraphs and provided it with a synoptical table so that it might be easier to find the [[pericope]]s that belong together. These [[canon tables]] or \"Eusebian canons\" remained in use throughout the Middle Ages, and [[illuminated manuscript]] versions are important for the study of early medieval art, as they are the most elaborately decorated pages of many [[Gospel book]]s. Eusebius detailed in ''[[Epistula ad Carpianum]]'' how to use his canons.\n\n===''Chronicle''===\n{{Main|Chronicon (Eusebius)}}\nThe ''Chronicle'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1\u03c0\u1f74 \u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} (''Pantodape historia'')) is divided into two parts. The first part, the ''Chronography'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1}} (''Chronographia'')), gives an epitome of universal history from the sources, arranged according to nations. The second part, the ''Canons'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1f76 \u039a\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2}} (''Chronikoi kanones'')), furnishes a synchronism of the historical material in parallel columns, the equivalent of a parallel timeline.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 112.</ref>\n\nThe work as a whole has been lost in the original Greek, but it may be reconstructed from later chronographists of the Byzantine school who made excerpts from the work, especially [[George Syncellus]]. The tables of the second part have been completely preserved in a Latin translation by Jerome, and both parts are still extant in an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] translation. The loss of the Greek originals has given an Armenian translation a special importance; thus, the first part of Eusebius' ''Chronicle'', of which only a few fragments exist in the Greek, has been preserved entirely in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], though with lacunae.

As the historian [[Socrates Scholasticus]] said, at the opening of his history which was designed as a continuation of Eusebius, \"Also in writing the life of Constantine, this same author has but slightly treated of matters regarding [[Arius]], being more intent on the rhetorical finish of his composition and the praises of the emperor, than on an accurate statement of facts.\" The work was unfinished at Eusebius' death. Some scholars have questioned the Eusebian authorship of this work.\n\n===Minor historical works===\nBefore he compiled his church history, Eusebius edited a collection of martyrdoms of the earlier period and a biography of Pamphilus. The martyrology has not survived as a whole, but it has been preserved almost completely in parts. It contained:\n\n*an epistle of the congregation of [[Smyrna]] concerning the martyrdom of [[Polycarp]];\n*the martyrdom of [[Pionius]];\n*the martyrdoms of [[Carpus and Papylus|Carpus, Papylus]], and [[Carpus and Papylus|Agathonike]];\n*the martyrdoms in the congregations of [[Vienne]] and [[Lyon]];\n*the martyrdom of Apollonius.\n\nOf the life of Pamphilus, only a fragment survives. A work on the [[martyrs of Palestine]] in the time of Diocletian was composed after 311; numerous fragments are scattered in legendaries which have yet to be collected. The life of Constantine was compiled after the death of the emperor and the election of his sons as Augusti (337). It is more a rhetorical eulogy on the emperor than a history but is of great value on account of numerous documents incorporated in it.\n\n===Apologetic and dogmatic works===\nTo the class of [[Apologetics|apologetic]] and dogmatic works belong:\n\n* The ''[[Apology for Origen]]'', the first five books of which, according to the definite statement of Photius, were written by Pamphilus in prison, with the assistance of Eusebius. Eusebius added the sixth book after the death of Pamphilus. We possess only a Latin translation of the first book, made by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]];\n* A treatise against [[Sossianus Hierocles|Hierocles]] (a Roman governor), in which Eusebius combated the former's glorification of [[Apollonius of Tyana]] in a work entitled ''[[A Truth-loving Discourse]]'' (Greek: ''Philalethes logos''); in spite of manuscript attribution to Eusebius, however, it has been argued (by Thomas Hagg<ref>Thomas Hagg, \"Hierocles the Lover of Truth and Eusebius the Sophist,\" SO 67 (1992): 138\u201350</ref> and more recently, Aaron Johnson<ref>Aaron Johnson, \"The Author of the Against Hierocles: A Response to Borz\u00ec and Jones,\" JTS 64 (2013): 574\u2013594)</ref> that this treatise \"[[Against Hierocles]]\" was written by someone other than Eusebius of Caesarea.\n* ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' (''Preparation for the Gospel''), commonly known by its Latin title, which attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over every pagan religion and philosophy. The ''Praeparatio'' consists of fifteen books which have been completely preserved. Eusebius considered it an introduction to Christianity for pagans. But its value for many later readers is more because Eusebius studded this work with so many lively fragments from historians and philosophers which are nowhere else preserved. Here alone is preserved a summary of the writings of the [[Phoenicia]]n priest [[Sanchuniathon]] of which the accuracy has been shown by the mythological accounts found on the [[Ugaritic]] tables, here alone is the account from [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s sixth book of [[Euhemerus]]' wondrous voyage to the island of [[Panchaea]] where [[Euhemerus]] purports to have found his true history of the gods, and here almost alone is preserved writings of the [[neo-Platonist]] philosopher [[Atticus (philosopher)|Atticus]] along with so much else.\n* ''Demonstratio evangelica'' (''[[Proof of the Gospel]]'') is closely connected to the ''Praeparatio'' and comprised originally twenty books of which ten have been completely preserved as well as a fragment of the fifteenth. Here Eusebius treats of the person of Jesus Christ. The work was probably finished before 311;\n* Another work which originated in the time of the persecution, entitled ''[[Prophetic Extracts]]'' (''Eclogae propheticae''). It discusses in four books the [[Messiah|Messianic]] texts of Scripture. The work is merely the surviving portion (books 6\u20139) of the ''General elementary introduction'' to the Christian faith, now lost.  The fragments given as the Commentary on Luke in the PG have been claimed to derive from the missing tenth book of the General Elementary Introduction see D. S. Wallace-Hadrill); however, Aaron Johnson has argued that they cannot be associated with this work.<ref>Aaron Johnson, \"The Tenth Book of Eusebius' General Elementary Introduction: A Critique of the Wallace-Hadrill Thesis,\" Journal of Theological Studies, 62.1 (2011): 144\u2013160</ref>\n{{anchor|On Divine Manifestation|Theophania}}<!--linked-->\n* The treatise ''On Divine Manifestation'' or ''On the Theophania'' (''Peri theophaneias''), of unknown date. It treats of the incarnation of the Divine [[Logos]], and its contents are in many cases identical with the ''Demonstratio evangelica.'' Only fragments are preserved in Greek, but a complete Syriac translation of the ''Theophania'' survives in an early 5th-century manuscript. Samuel Lee, the editor (1842) and translator (1843) of the Syriac ''Theophania'' thought that the work must have been written \"after the general peace restored to the Church by Constantine, and before either the 'Praeparatio,' or the 'Demonstratio Evengelica,' was written . . . it appears probable . . . therefore, that this was one of the first productions of Eusebius, if not the first after the persecutions ceased.\"<ref>Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea ''On the Theophania, or Divine Manifestation of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ'' (Cambridge, 1843), pp. xxi\u2013xxii. Lee's full passage is as follows: \"As to the period at which it was written, I think it must have been, after the general peace restored to the Church by Constantine, and before either the \"Praeparatio\", or the \"Demonstratio Evangelica\", was written. My reason for the first of these suppositions is: Our author speaks repeatedly of the peace restored to the Church; of Churches and Schools restored, or then built for the first time : of the nourishing state of the Church of Caesarea; of the extended, and then successfully extending, state of Christianity : all of which could not have been said during the times of the last, and most severe persecution. My reasons for the second of these suppositions are, the considerations that whatever portions of this Work are found, either in the \"Praeparatio\", |22 the \"Demonstratio Evangelica\", or the \" Oratio de laudibus Constantini\", they there occur in no regular sequence of argument as they do in this Work: especially in the latter, into which they have been carried evidently for the purpose of lengthening out a speech. Besides, many of these places are amplified in these works, particularly in the two former as remarked in my notes; which seems to suggest, that such additions were made either to accommodate these to the new soil, into which they had been so transplanted, or, to supply some new matter, which had suggested itself to our author. And again, as both the \"Praeparatio\" and \"Demonstratio Evangelica\", are works which must have required very considerable time to complete them, and which would even then be unfit for general circulation ; it appears probable to me, that this more popular, and more useful work, was first composed and published, and that the other two,--illustrating as they generally do, some particular points only,--argued in order in our Work,-- were reserved for the reading and occasional writing of our author during a considerable number of years, as well for the satisfaction of his own mind, as for the general reading of the learned. It appears probable to me therefore, that this was one of the first productions of Eusebius, if not the first after the persecutions ceased.\"</ref> Hugo Gressmann, noting in 1904 that the ''Demonstratio'' seems to be mentioned at IV. 37 and V. 1, and that II. 14 seems to mention the extant practice of temple prostitution at Hieropolis in Phoenica, concluded that the ''Theophania'' was probably written shortly after 324. Others have suggested a date as late as 337.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (Harvard, 1981), p. 367, n.176. Note that Lee (p. 285) thinks that the passage in V. 1 refers to an earlier section within the ''Theophania'' itself, rather than to the ''Demonstratio''.</ref>\n* A polemical treatise against [[Marcellus of Ancyra]], the ''Against Marcellus'', dating from about 337;\n* A supplement to the last-named work, also against Marcellus, entitled ''[[Ecclesiastical Theology]]'', in which he defended the Nicene doctrine of the Logos against the party of Athanasius.\n\nA number of writings, belonging in this category, have been entirely lost.\n\n===Exegetical and miscellaneous works===\nAll of the exegetical works of Eusebius have suffered damage in transmission. The majority of them are known to us only from long portions quoted in Byzantine catena-commentaries. However these portions are very extensive. Extant are:\n\n*An enormous Commentary on the [[Psalms]].\n*A commentary on [[Isaiah]], discovered more or less complete in a manuscript in Florence early in the 20th century and published 50 years later.\n*Small fragments of commentaries on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] and [[1 Corinthians]].\n\nEusebius also wrote a work ''Quaestiones ad Stephanum et Marinum'', \"On the Differences of the Gospels\" (including solutions). This was written for the purpose of harmonizing the contradictions in the reports of the different Evangelists. This work was recently (2011) translated into the English language by David J. Miller and Adam C. McCollum (edited by Roger Pearse) and was published under the name \"Eusebius of Caesarea: Gospel Problems and Solutions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eusebius-Caesarea-Problems-Solutions-Translation/dp/0956654010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1334377421&sr=8-1# |title=Eusebius of Caesarea: Gospel Problems and Solutions (Ancient Texts in Translation): Roger Pearse, David J Miller, Adam C McCollum: 9780956654014: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> The original work was also translated into Syriac, and lengthy quotations exist in a ''catena'' in that language, and also in [[coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Arabic]] catenas.<ref>Georg Graf, ''Geschichte der christlichen arabischen Literatur'' vol. 1</ref>\n\nEusebius also wrote treatises on Biblical archaeology:\n\n*A work on the Greek equivalents of Hebrew Gentilic nouns;\n*A description of old Judea with an account of the loss of the ten tribes;\n*A plan of Jerusalem and the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Solomon]].\n\nThese three treatises have been lost.\n\nThe addresses and sermons of Eusebius are mostly lost, but some have been preserved, e.g., a sermon on the consecration of the church in Tyre and an address on the thirtieth anniversary of the reign of Constantine (336).\n\nMost of Eusebius' letters are lost. His letters to Carpianus and Flacillus exist complete. Fragments of a letter to the empress Constantia also exists.\n\n==Doctrine==\nEusebius is fairly unusual in his [[preterist]], or fulfilled eschatological view.  Saying \"The Holy Scriptures foretell that there will be unmistakable signs of the Coming of Christ. Now there were among the Hebrews three outstanding offices of dignity, which made the nation famous, firstly the kingship, secondly that of prophet, and lastly the high priesthood. The prophecies said that the abolition and complete destruction of all these three together would be the sign of the presence of the Christ. And that the proofs that the times had come, would lie in the ceasing of the Mosaic worship, the desolation of Jerusalem and its Temple, and the subjection of the whole Jewish race to its enemies...The holy oracles foretold that all these changes, which had not been made in the days of the prophets of old, would take place at the coming of the Christ, which I will presently shew to have been fulfilled as never before in accordance with the predictions.\" (Demonstratio Evangelica VIII)\n\nFrom a [[dogma]]tic point of view, Eusebius stands entirely upon the shoulders of [[Origen]]. Like Origen, he started from the fundamental thought of the absolute sovereignty (''monarchia'') of God. God is the cause of all beings. But he is not merely a cause; in him everything good is included, from him all life originates, and he is the source of all virtue. God sent Christ into the world that it may partake of the blessings included in the essence of God. Christ is God and is a ray of the eternal light; but the figure of the ray is so limited by Eusebius that he expressly distinguishes the Son as distinct from Father as a ray is also distinct from its source the sun.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nEusebius was intent upon emphasizing the difference of the persons of the Trinity and maintaining the subordination of the Son (Logos, or Word) to God. The Logos, the Son (Jesus) is an hypostasis of God the Father whose generation, for Eusebius, took place before time. The Logos acts as the organ or instrument of God, the creator of life, the principle of every revelation of God, who in his absoluteness and transcendence is enthroned above and isolated from all the world. Eusebius, with most of the Christian tradition, assumed God was immutable. Therefore, to Eusebius's mind, the Logos must possess divinity by participation (and not originally like the Father), so that he can change, unlike God the Father. Thus he assumed a human body without altering the immutable divine Father. Eusebius never calls Jesus ''o the\u00f3s'', but ''the\u00f3s'' because in all contrary attempts he suspected either polytheism (three distinct gods) or [[Sabellianism]] (three modes of one divine person).\n\nLikewise, Eusebius described the relation of the Holy Spirit within the Trinity to that of the Son to the Father. No point of this doctrine is original with Eusebius, all is traceable to his teacher Origen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The lack of originality in his thinking shows itself in the fact that he never presented his thoughts in a system. After nearly being excommunicated due to charges of heresy by Alexander of Alexandria, Eusebius submitted and agreed to the [[Nicene Creed]] at the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nEusebius held that men were sinners by their own free choice and not by the necessity of their natures. Eusebius said, \"The Creator of all things has impressed a natural law upon the soul of every man, as an assistant and ally in his conduct, pointing out to him the right way by this law; but, by the free liberty with which he is endowed, making the choice of what is best worthy of praise and acceptance, because he has acted rightly, not by force, but from his own free-will, when he had it in his power to act otherwise, As, again, making him who chooses what is worst, deserving of blame and punishment, as having by his own motion neglected the natural law, and becoming the origin and fountain of wickedness, and misusing himself, not from any extraneous necessity, but from free will and judgment. The fault is in him who chooses, not in God. For God has not made nature or the substance of the soul bad; for he who is good can make nothing but what is good. Everything is good which is according to nature. Every rational soul has naturally a good free-will, formed for the choice of what is good. But when a man acts wrongly, nature is not to be blamed; for what is wrong, takes place not according to nature, but contrary to nature, it being the work of choice, and not of nature\".<ref>The Christian Examiner, Volume One, published by James Miller, 1824 Edition, p.&nbsp;66</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] several centuries later, Eusebius had unfairly gained the reputation of having been an [[Arian]], and was roundly condemned as such by Patriarch [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople]].  A letter Eusebius is supposed to have written to [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s daughter [[Constantina|Constantia]], refusing to fulfill her request for images of Christ, was quoted in the decrees (now lost) of the Iconoclast [[Council of Hieria]] in 754, and later quoted in part in the rebuttal of the Hieria decrees in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] of 787, now the only source from which some of the text is known.  The authenticity, or authorship of the letter remain uncertain.<ref>David M. Gwynn, \"From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy\" [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225\u2013251], p. 227-245.</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n*[[Edward Gibbon]] openly distrusted the writings of Eusebius concerning the number of martyrs, by noting a passage in the shorter text of the ''Martyrs of Palestine'' attached to the ''Ecclesiastical History'' (Book 8, Chapter 2) in which Eusebius introduces his description of the martyrs of the Great Persecution under Diocletian with: \"''Wherefore we have decided to relate nothing concerning them except the things in which we can vindicate the Divine judgment. [...] We shall introduce into this history in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity.''\"<ref>Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', vol. 1, chapter 16</ref> In the longer text of the same work, chapter 12, Eusebius states: \"''I think it best to pass by all the other events which occurred in the meantime: such as [...] the lust of power on the part of many, the disorderly and unlawful ordinations, and the schisms among the confessors themselves; also the novelties which were zealously devised against the remnants of the Church by the new and factious members, who added innovation after innovation and forced them in unsparingly among the calamities of the persecution, heaping misfortune upon misfortune. I judge it more suitable to shun and avoid the account of these things, as I said at the beginning.''\"\n*When his own honesty was challenged by his contemporaries,<ref>See Gibbon's ''Vindication'' for examples of the accusations that he faced.</ref> Gibbon appealed to a chapter heading in Eusebius' ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Praeparatio evangelica]]'' (Book XII, Chapter 31)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_12_book12.htm|title=Eusebius of Caesarea: Praeparatio Evangelica (translated by E.H.

Lightfoot, Eusebius of Caesarea|publisher=tertullian.org|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> that Eusebius' statements indicate his honesty in stating what he was not going to discuss, and also his limitations as a historian in not including such material. He also discusses the question of accuracy. \"The manner in which Eusebius deals with his very numerous quotations elsewhere, where we can test his honesty, is a sufficient vindication against this unjust charge.\" Lightfoot also notes that Eusebius cannot always be relied on: \"A far more serious drawback to his value as a historian is the loose and uncritical spirit in which he sometimes deals with his materials. This shows itself in diverse ways. He is not always to be trusted in his discrimination of genuine and spurious documents.\"\n*[[Averil Cameron]] (professor at King's College and Oxford) and Stuart Hall (historian and theologian), in their recent translation of the ''Life of Constantine'', point out that writers such as Burckhardt found it necessary to attack Eusebius in order to undermine the ideological legitimacy of the Habsburg empire, which based itself on the idea of Christian empire derived from Constantine, and that the most controversial letter in the ''Life'' has since been found among the papyri of Egypt.<ref>Averil Cameron, Stuart G.

Hollerich (assistant professor at the Jesuit Santa Clara University, California) replies to Burckhardt's criticism of Eusebius, that \"Eusebius has been an inviting target for students of the Constantinian era. At one time or another they have characterized him as a political propagandist, a good courtier, the shrewd and worldly adviser of the Emperor Constantine, the great publicist of the first Christian emperor, the first in a long succession of ecclesiastical politicians, the herald of [[Byzantinism]], a political theologian, a political metaphysician, and a caesaropapist. It is obvious that these are not, in the main, neutral descriptions. Much traditional scholarship, sometimes with barely suppressed disdain, has regarded Eusebius as one who risked his orthodoxy and perhaps his character because of his zeal for the Constantinian establishment.\" Hollerich concludes that \"... the standard assessment has exaggerated the importance of political themes and political motives in Eusebius's life and writings and has failed to do justice to him as a churchman and a scholar\".\n\nWhile many have shared Burckhardt's assessment, particularly with reference to the ''Life of Constantine'', others, while not pretending to extol his merits, have acknowledged the irreplaceable value of his works which may principally reside in the copious quotations that they contain from other sources, often lost.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*Eusebius of Caesarea.\n**''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (''Church History'') first seven books ''ca''. 300, eighth and ninth book ''ca''. 313, tenth book ''ca''. 315, epilogue ''ca''. 325.\n:**Migne, J.P., ed.

It is a fundamental part of the [[scientific method]] that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on ''[[A priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' reasoning, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], or [[revelation]].\n\nEmpiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that \"knowledge is based on experience\" and that \"knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and [[Falsifiability|falsification]]\".<ref>Shelley, M.

The term ''semi-empirical'' is sometimes used to describe theoretical methods that make use of basic [[axiom]]s, established scientific laws, and previous experimental results in order to engage in reasoned model building and theoretical inquiry.\n\nPhilosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.<ref>Markie, P.

For example, [[John Locke]] held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and reasoning alone. Similarly [[Robert Boyle]], a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas.<ref>Loeb, Luis E.

This is enumerated in his work [[Vai\u015be\u1e63ika S\u016btra]].\n\nThe earliest Western proto-empiricists were the [[Empiric school]] of ancient Greek medical practitioners, who rejected the three doctrines of the [[Dogmatic school]], preferring to rely on the observation of ''[[Phenomenalism|\"phenomena\"]]''.<ref name=sini>Sini, Carlo (2004), \"Empirismo\", in Gianni Vattimo et al. (eds.), ''Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia''.</ref>\n\nThe notion of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' (\"clean slate\" or \"blank tablet\") connotes a view of mind as an originally blank or empty recorder (Locke used the words \"white paper\") on which experience leaves marks. This denies that humans have [[innate ideas]]. The image dates back to [[Aristotle]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat the mind (''[[nous]]'') thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet (''grammateion'') which bears no actual writing (''grammenon'');  this is just what happens in the case of the mind.  (Aristotle, ''[[On the Soul]]'', 3.4.430<sup>a</sup>1).</blockquote>\n\nAristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of [[potentiality and actuality]], and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the [[active intellect|active ''nous'']]. These notions contrasted with [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others).  Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than [[Plato]], and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as \"''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''\" (Latin for \"nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses\").\n\nThis idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Jeffrey|title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille|date=June 11, 2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as \"When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon.\"<ref>Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book|last1=Long|first1=A.A.|last2=Sedley|first2=D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge, Ma|pages=238}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) from 1271]]\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] Aristotle's theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed by [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] starting with [[Al Farabi]], developing into an elaborate theory by [[Avicenna]]<ref name=Rizvi/> and demonstrated as a [[thought experiment]] by [[Ibn Tufail]].<ref name=Russell/> For Avicenna ([[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]), for example, the ''tabula rasa'' is a pure potentiality that is actualized through [[education]], and knowledge is attained through \"empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts\" developed through a \"[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]] in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts\". The [[intellect]] itself develops from a [[passive intellect|material intellect]] (''al-'aql al-hayulani''), which is a [[potentiality]] \"that can acquire knowledge to the [[active intellect]] (''al-[['aql]] al-fa'il''), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge\".<ref name=Rizvi>Sajjad H.

The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.<ref name=Russell>G.

In political and historical writing [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] and his friend [[Francesco Guicciardini]] initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the \"effectual truth\" instead. Their contemporary, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519) said, \"If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings.\"<ref>\"Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chineseand Western Medical Illustration\", Camillia Matuk, Journal of Biocommunication, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2006, [http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (c. 1520 \u2013 1591), father of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and the inventor of [[monody]], made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his ''Dialogo della musica antica e moderna'' (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for \"experiment\" was ''esperienza''. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. ''Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei''), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of '[[Pythagorean hammers|Pythagoras' hammers]]' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded \"experience and demonstration\" as the ''sine qua non'' of valid rational enquiry.\n\n===British empiricism===\n'''British empiricism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of [[early modern philosophy]] and [[modern science]]. The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders [[Francis Bacon]], described as [[The Advancement of Learning|empiricist]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], who is described as a rationalist. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], in the next generation, are often also described as an empiricist and a rationalist respectively. [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] were the primary exponents of empiricism in the 18th century [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with Locke being the person who is normally known as the founder of empiricism as such.\n\nIn response to the early-to-mid-17th century \"[[rationalism#Background|continental rationalism]]\" [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) proposed in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) a very influential view wherein the ''only'' knowledge humans can have is ''[[a posteriori]]'', i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', a \"blank tablet\", in Locke's words \"white paper\", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for [[certainty]] of [[Descartes]].\n\n[[File:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bishop George Berkeley]]]]\nA generation later, the Irish [[Anglican]] bishop, [[George Berkeley]] (1685\u20131753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual [[atheism]]. In response to Locke, he put forth in his ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things ''only'' exist either as a ''result'' of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)  In his text ''Alciphron'', Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.<ref>Thornton, Stephen (1987) \"Berkeley's Theory of Reality\" in ''The Journal of the Limerick Philosophical Society'', [http://www.ul.ie/~philos/vol1/berkel.html UL.ie]</ref> Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called [[subjective idealism]].<ref>Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), \"George Berkeley\", vol. 1, p. 297.</ref><ref name=\"MEP2\"/>\n\nThe Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711\u20131776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of [[skepticism]].  Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, \"Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities\u2014by \u2018proofs\u2019 meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition.\"<ref name=\"Hume_human_understanding_chap_prob\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of Probability|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}</ref> And,<ref name=\"Hume_human_understanding_chap_nec\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of the Idea of a Necessary Connexion|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"I believe the most general and most popular explication of this matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, such as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as distinguished from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cause or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained: and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on.\"|Hume Section XIV \"of the idea of necessary connexion in ''A Treatise of Human Nature''}}\n\nHume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: ''relations of ideas'' and ''matters of fact'' (see also [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. \"that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides\") are examples of the first, while propositions involving  some [[contingent]] observation of the world (e.g. \"the sun rises in the East\") are examples of the second. All of people's \"ideas\", in turn, are derived from their \"impressions\". For Hume, an \"impression\" corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an \"idea\". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.<ref name = Hume1/>\n\n[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]'s empiricism led to numerous philosophical schools.]]\nHume maintained that no knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, can be conclusively established by reason.  Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated ''habits'', developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about [[scientific method]]\u2014that of the [[problem of induction]].  Hume argued that it requires [[inductive reasoning]] to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument.<ref name = Hume1/> Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.  Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by [[inductive reasoning]] that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.<ref name=Hume1>Hume, D. \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\", in Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals, 2nd edition, L.A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, UK, 1902 [1748].{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHume concluded that such things as belief in an external world and belief in the existence of the self were not rationally justifiable. According to Hume these beliefs were to be accepted nonetheless because of their profound basis in instinct and custom.  Hume's lasting legacy, however, was the doubt that his skeptical arguments cast on the legitimacy of inductive reasoning, allowing many skeptics who followed to cast similar doubt.\n\n===Phenomenalism===\n{{Main|Phenomenalism}}\nMost of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is ''rationally'' unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit.<ref>Morick, H. (1980), Challenges to Empiricism, Hackett Publishing, Indianapolis, IN.</ref>  According to an extreme empiricist theory known as [[phenomenalism]], anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences.<ref>Marconi, Diego (2004), \"Fenomenismo\"', in [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Gaetano Chiurazzi (eds.), ''L'Enciclopedia Garzanti di Filosofia'', 3rd edition, Garzanti, Milan, Italy.</ref>  Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist\u2014hence the closely related term [[subjective idealism]]. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences.  This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As [[John Stuart Mill]] put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the \"permanent possibility of sensation\".<ref>Mill, J.S., \"An Examination of Sir William Rowan Hamilton's Philosophy\", in A.J. Ayer and Ramond Winch (eds.), British Empirical Philosophers, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, 1968.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\nMill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for ''all'' meaningful knowledge including mathematics.  As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:\n\n{{quote|[Mill] claimed that mathematical truths were merely very highly confirmed generalizations from experience; mathematical inference, generally conceived as deductive [and ''a priori''] in nature, Mill set down as founded on induction.  Thus, in Mill's philosophy there was no real place for knowledge based on relations of ideas.  In his view logical and mathematical necessity is psychological; we are merely unable to conceive any other possibilities than those that logical and mathematical propositions assert. This is perhaps the most extreme version of empiricism known, but it has not found many defenders.<ref name = MEP2/>}}\n\nMill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience.<ref>Wilson, Fred (2005), \"John Stuart Mill\", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref>  The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations.  This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\" might exist in the first place.  Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \"reality\" that goes beyond mere \"possibilities of sensation\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms.<ref name = MEP2/><ref name=MEP6>Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), \"Phenomenalism\", vol. 6, p. 131.</ref> Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\".<ref name=\"MEP6\"/>  Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.  It  fails to fully consider the structure and method of [[mathematical science]], the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of [[inductive reasoning|induction]].<ref name=MEP2>Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), \"Empiricism\", vol. 2, p. 503.</ref><ref name=\"MEP6\"/><ref>Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), \"Axiomatic Method\", vol. 5, pp. 188\u201389, 191ff.</ref>\n\nThe phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.<ref>Bolender, John (1998), \"Factual Phenomenalism: A Supervenience Theory\"', Sorites, no. 9, pp. 16\u201331.</ref>  If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement.  The translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no ''finite'' set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.  But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the [[Third Man Argument|third man]]).<ref>Berlin, Isaiah (2004), The Refutation of Phenomenalism, Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chisholm |first1=Roderick M. |date=September 9, 1948 |title=The Problem of Empiricism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=45 |issue=19 |pages=512\u201317 |jstor=2019108 |doi=10.2307/2019108}}</ref>\n\n===Logical empiricism===\n{{Main|Logical positivism}}\nLogical empiricism (also ''logical positivism'' or ''neopositivism'') was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from [[mathematical logic]] that had been developed by [[Gottlob Frege]]  and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Some of the key figures in this movement were [[Otto Neurath]], [[Moritz Schlick]] and the rest of the [[Vienna Circle]], along with  [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]].\n\nThe neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the  methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848\u20131925) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872\u20131970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all [[logical truth]]s are mere linguistic [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the ''analytic'' (a priori) and the ''synthetic'' (a posteriori).<ref>[[Peter Achinstein|Achinstein, Peter]], and [[Stephen Francis Barker|Barker, Stephen F.]] (1969), The Legacy of Logical Positivism: Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called [[verification principle]]. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.<ref>Barone, Francesco (1986), Il neopositivismo logico, Laterza, Roma Bari.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists\u2014at least before the 1930s\u2014any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of ''phenomenalism'' in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics.  That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called ''protocol sentences'', for example, \"''X'' at location ''Y'' and at time ''T'' observes such and such.\"<ref>[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, Nicholas]] (1985), The Heritage of Logical Positivism, University Press of America, Lanham, MD.</ref>  The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic\u2013synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as [[Nelson Goodman]], [[W.V. Quine]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Richard Rorty]].  By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant  among contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] such as [[Michael Dummett]] and other [[anti-realism|anti-realists]].\n\n===Pragmatism===\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] arose.  The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s.  James popularized the term \"pragmatism\", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of \"pragmaticism\".  Along with its ''[[pragmatic theory of truth]]'', this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and [[rationalism|rational]] (concept-based) thinking.\n\n[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]\nCharles Peirce (1839\u20131914) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today's empirical [[scientific method]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/peirce/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Burch|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}</ref> Although Peirce severely criticized many elements of Descartes' peculiar brand of rationalism, he did not reject rationalism outright.  Indeed, he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation.  In later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism, in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the \"data-driven\" strict-empiricist view.\n\nAmong Peirce's major contributions was to place [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before.  To this, Peirce added the concept of [[abductive reasoning]].  The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today.  Peirce's approach \"presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them.  According to Peirce's doctrine of [[fallibilism]], the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth\".<ref>Ward, Teddy (n.d.), \"Empiricism\", [http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm Eprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714183655/http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm |date=2012-07-14 }}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]]]]\nIn his Harvard \"Lectures on Pragmatism\" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the \"three cotary propositions of pragmatism\" ([[Latin|L:]] ''cos, cotis'' whetstone), saying that they \"put the edge on the [[pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]]\".  First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street.  That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses.  Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of [[abductive reasoning|abductive inference]], its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique\u2014in a word, incorrigible.  This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or \"thisness\"\u2014what the [[Scholastics]] called its ''[[haecceity]]''\u2014that stands beyond control and correction.  Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.  This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]] research, most recently for instance with the work of [[Irvin Rock]] on ''[[indirect perception]]''.<ref>Rock, Irvin (1983), The Logic of Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref><ref>Rock, Irvin, (1997) Indirect Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842\u20131910) coined the term \"[[radical empiricism]]\" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism\u2014though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed \"directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support\",<ref>James, William (1911), The Meaning of Truth.</ref> by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any [[value added]] by seeking [[supernatural]] explanations for [[nature|natural]] [[phenomena]].  James' \"radical empiricism\" is thus ''not'' radical in the context of the term \"empiricism\", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term \"[[empirical]]\". His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.\n\n[[John Dewey]] (1859\u20131952) modified James' pragmatism to form a theory known as [[instrumentalism]].  The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated.  Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that [[reality]] is determined by past experience.  Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience.  The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation,<ref>Dewey, John (1906), Studies in Logical Theory.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> in physical sciences as in ethics.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/jsp.2011.0000 |title=What Experimentalism Means in Ethics |year=2011 |last1=Weber |first1=Eric Thomas |journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume=25 |pages=98}}</ref>  Thus, ideas in Dewey's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known ''a posteriori''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abstract empiricism]]\n* [[Empirical formula]]\n* [[Empirical idealism]]\n* [[Empirical realism]]\n* [[Empirical relationship]]\n* [[Empirical research]]\n* [[Feminist empiricism]]\n* [[Ground truth]]\n* [[History of scientific method]]\n* [[Inquiry]]\n* [[Kantian empiricism]]\n* ''[[Materialism and Empiriocriticism]]''\n* [[Natural philosophy]]\n* [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]]\n* [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]]\n* [[Psychological nativism]]\n* [[Quasi-empirical method]]\n* [[Sensualism]]\n* [[Sextus Empiricus]]\n* [[Transcendental empiricism]]\n* \"[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]\"\n\n==Endnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Achinstein, Peter, and Barker, Stephen F.

The structure can therefore be diagrammed as: \n\n:''a+x, a+y; b+w, b+z; etc.''.\n\nSometimes the same two endings are used for all the ''puncta'', producing the structure \n\n:''a+x, a+y; b+x, b+y, c+x, c+y, etc.''. {{harv|Wolf|1900|loc=98}}<ref>\"Punctus autem est ordinata aggregatio concordantiarum harmoniam facientium\nascendendo et descendendo duas habens partes in principio similes, in fine\ndifferentes, qui clausum et apertum communiter appellantur.\"</ref>\n\nA similar structure was shared with the [[saltarello]], another medieval dance.\n\nThe earliest reported example of this musical form is the song \"Kalenda maya\", written by the [[troubadour]] [[Raimbaut de Vaqueiras]] (1180\u20131207) to the melody of an estampida played by French jongleurs {{harv|McGee|2012}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}}<!--McGee does not claim this is the earliest example--at least, not in the 2018 version of this online source; perhaps the 2012 edition did, but, if so, this needs verification.-->. \"Two poetry treatises describe the ''estampie'' as a poetic and musical form, and a music treatise provides details about it as both a vocal form and an instrumental dance\" {{harv|McGee|2012}}. Fourteenth-century examples include estampies with subtitles such as \"Isabella\" and \"Tre fontane\" {{harv|McGee|2014|loc=8\u201315}}. Non-estampie dances found in Br. Lib. Add 29987 include dance pairs such as \"Lamento di Tristano\" and \"La Manfredina\" (each paired with a following \"rotta\"), and Dan\u00e7a amorosa (paired with a following \"troto\") {{harv|McGee|2014|loc=15}}.\n\nThough the estampie is generally monophonic, there are also two-voice compositions in the form of an estampie, such as the three for keyboard in the [[Robertsbridge Codex|Robertsbridge Fragment]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAccording to Grocheio, the [[Vielle|fiddle]] was the supreme instrument of the period, and the stantipes, together with the [[cantus coronatus]] and ductia, were the principal forms played on fiddles before the wealthy in their celebration {{harv|Page|2001}}.\n\n==Dance==\n{{main|Medieval dance#Estampie}}\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to the ''OED'', the name comes from the Proven\u00e7al ''estampida'', feminine of ''estampit'', the past participle of ''estampir'' \"to resound\" {{harv|Oxford English Dictionary|2005}}.\n\n==Media==\n{{listen|filename=Estampie Retrove Robertsbridge.ogg|title=Estampie \"Retrove\"|description=Anonymous ''estampie'' from the [[Robertsbridge Codex]], performed by Ulrich Metzner|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Willi Apel.

Experimental cancer treatments cannot make medical claims. The term experimental cancer treatment could thus be substituted for \"non FDA approved cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe entries listed below vary between theoretical therapies to unproven controversial therapies. Many of these treatments are alleged to help against only specific forms of cancer. It is not a list of treatments widely available at hospitals.\n\n==Studying treatments for cancer==\n{{See also|Drug discovery}}\nThe twin goals of research are to determine whether the treatment actually works (called [[efficacy]]) and whether it is sufficiently safe. Regulatory processes attempt to balance the potential benefits with the potential harms, so that people given the treatment are more likely to benefit from it than to be harmed by it.\n\nMedical research for cancer begins much like research for any disease. In organized studies of new treatments for cancer, the [[pre-clinical development]] of drugs, devices, and techniques begins in laboratories, either with isolated cells or in small animals, most commonly rats or mice. In other cases, the proposed treatment for cancer is already in use for some other medical condition, in which case more is known about its safety and potential efficacy.\n\n[[Clinical trial]]s are the study of treatments in humans. The first-in-human tests of a potential treatment are called [[Clinical trial#Phase I|Phase I]] studies. Early clinical trials typically enroll a very small number of patients, and the purpose is to identify major safety issues and the ''[[maximum tolerated dose]]'', which is the highest dose that does not produce serious or fatal [[adverse effect]]s. The dose given in these trials may be far too small to produce any useful effect. In most research, these early trials may involve healthy people, but cancer studies normally enroll only people with relatively severe forms of the disease in this stage of testing. On average, 95% of the participants in these early trials receive no benefit, but all are exposed to the risk of adverse effects.<ref>{{cite news | title = When Optimism Is Unrealistic\n| author = Chen, Pauline W.\n| date = 3 March 2011\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/health/views/03chen.html\n| work=The New York Times}}\n</ref>  Most participants show signs of [[optimism bias]] (the irrational belief that they will beat the odds).\n\nLater studies, called [[Clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II]] and [[Clinical trial#Phase III|Phase III]] studies, enroll more people, and the goal is to determine whether the treatment actually works. Phase III studies are frequently [[randomized controlled trial]]s, with the experimental treatment being compared to the current best available treatment rather than to a [[placebo]]. In some cases, the Phase III trial provides the best available treatment to all participants, in addition to some of the patients receiving the experimental treatment.\n\n==Bacterial treatments==\n[[Chemotherapy|Chemotherapeutic]] [[medication|drugs]] have a hard time penetrating tumors to kill them at their core because these cells may lack a good blood supply. Researchers have been using [[anaerobic bacteria]], such as ''[[Clostridium novyi]]'', to consume the interior of oxygen-poor tumours. These should then die when they come in contact with the tumor's oxygenated sides, meaning they would be harmless to the rest of the body. A major problem has been that bacteria do not consume all parts of the malignant tissue. However, combining the therapy with chemotheraputic treatments can help to solve this problem.\n\nAnother strategy is to use anaerobic bacteria that have been transformed with an enzyme that can convert a non-toxic [[prodrug]] into a toxic drug. With the proliferation of the bacteria in the [[necrosis|necrotic]] and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] areas of the tumor, the enzyme is expressed solely in the tumor. Thus, a systemically applied prodrug is metabolised to the toxic drug only in the tumor. This has been demonstrated to be effective with the nonpathogenic anaerobe ''[[Clostridium sporogenes]]''.<ref name=\"Mengesha\">{{cite book |author= Mengesha|year=2009|chapter=Clostridia in Anti-tumor Therapy |title=Clostridia: Molecular Biology in the Post-genomic Era|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn =  978-1-904455-38-7  }}</ref>\n\n==Drug therapies==\n\n===HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells)===\n{{Main|HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells)}}\nHAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is a molecular complex derived from human [[breast milk]] that kills tumor cells by a process resembling programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]).

Currently, [[inositol hexaphosphate]], which is available over-the-counter, is undergoing testing in cancer research due to its telomerase-inhibiting abilities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jagadeesh S, Banerjee PP | title = Inositol hexaphosphate represses telomerase activity and translocates TERT from the nucleus in mouse and human prostate cancer cells via the deactivation of Akt and PKCalpha | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 349 | issue = 4 | pages = 1361\u20137 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 16979586 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.09.002 }}</ref>\n\nA number of research groups have experimented with the use of [[telomerase inhibitor]]s in [[animal model]]s, and as of 2005 and 2006 phase I and II [[Clinical trial|human clinical trials]] are underway. [[Geron Corporation]] is currently conducting two clinical trials involving telomerase inhibitors. One uses a vaccine ([[GRNVAC1]]) and the other uses a lipidated oligonucleotide ([[GRN163L]]).\n\n==Radiation therapies==\n\n===Photodynamic therapy===\n[[Photodynamic therapy]] (PDT) is generally a non-invasive treatment using a combination of light and a photosensitive drug, such as 5-ALA, Foscan, Metvix, Tookad, WST09, WST11, Photofrin, or [[Verteporfin|Visudyne]]. The drug is triggered by light of a specific wavelength.\n\n===Hyperthermia therapy===\n{{Further|Hyperthermia therapy}}\n\nLocalized and whole-body application of heat has been proposed as a technique for the treatment of malignant tumours. Intense heating will cause [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] and coagulation of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] [[protein]]s, rapidly killing cells within a tumour.\n\nMore prolonged moderate heating to temperatures just a few degrees above normal (39.5&nbsp;\u00b0C) can cause more subtle changes. A mild heat treatment combined with other stresses can cause cell death by [[apoptosis]]. There are many biochemical consequences to the [[heat shock protein|heat shock response]] within the cell, including slowed cell division and increased sensitivity to ionizing [[radiation therapy]]. The purpose of overheating the tumor cells is to create a lack of oxygen so that the heated cells become overacidified, which leads to a lack of nutrients in the tumor. This in turn disrupts the metabolism of the cells so that cell death (apoptosis) can set in. In certain cases chemotherapy or radiation that has previously not had any effect can be made effective. Hyperthermia alters the cell walls by means of so-called heat shock proteins. The cancer cells then react very much more effectively to the cytostatics and radiation. If hyperthermia is used conscientiously it has no serious side effects.<ref>Dr med Peter Wolf, 2008, Innovations in biological cancer therapy, a guide for patients and their relatives, p 31-32</ref>\n\nThere are many techniques by which heat may be delivered. Some of the most common involve the use of focused [[ultrasound]] (FUS or [[HIFU]]), [[microwave]] heating, [[induction heating]], [[magnetic hyperthermia]], and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including gold-coated nanoshells and nanorods that exhibit certain degrees of 'tunability' of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an 'optical window' in which biological tissue (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a 'window' exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, get hot and are killed.\n\n[[Magnetic hyperthermia]] makes use of magnetic nanoparticles, which can be injected into tumours and then generate heat when subjected to an alternating magnetic field.<ref>[http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=44 Hyperthermia - Cancer therapy hots up] on physics.org</ref>\n\nOne of the challenges in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient's body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, microwave, and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or [[magnetic resonance imaging]], as well as of developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians also hope to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real time\u2014heat-induced changes in [[biological tissue|tissue]] are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. In [[magnetic hyperthermia]] or magnetic fluid hyperthermia method, it will be easier to control temperature distribution by controlling the velocity of [[ferrofluid]] injection and size of [[magnetic nanoparticles]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Javidi M, Heydari M, Attar MM, Haghpanahi M, Karimi A, Navidbakhsh M, Amanpour S | title = Cylindrical agar gel with fluid flow subjected to an alternating magnetic field during hyperthermia | journal = International Journal of Hyperthermia | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u20139 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25523967 | doi = 10.3109/02656736.2014.988661 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Javidi M, Heydari M, Karimi A, Haghpanahi M, Navidbakhsh M, Razmkon A | title = Evaluation of the effects of injection velocity and different gel concentrations on nanoparticles in hyperthermia therapy | journal = Journal of Biomedical Physics & Engineering | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 151\u201362 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25599061 | pmc = 4289522 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1142/S0219519415500888 | volume=15 | title=MAGNETIC FLUID HYPERTHERMIA IN A CYLINDRICAL GEL CONTAINS WATER FLOW | journal=Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology | pages=1550088}}</ref>\n\n===Non-invasive cancer treatment===\nThis preclinical treatment involves using radio waves to heat up tiny metals that are implanted in cancerous tissue.
