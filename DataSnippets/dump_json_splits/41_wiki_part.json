The more general term [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer [[animation]] ''only'' refers to the moving images. [[Virtual cinematography|Modern computer animation]] usually uses [[3D computer graphics]], although [[2D computer graphics]] are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well.\n\nComputer animation is essentially a digital successor to the [[stop motion]] techniques using 3D models, and [[traditional animation]] techniques using frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. Computer-generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes, constructing [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] for effects shots or hiring [[extra (actor)|extras]] for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology. It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors, expensive set pieces, or [[Theatrical property|props]]. To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the [[computer monitor]] and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it, but advanced slightly in time (usually at a rate of 24, 25 or 30 frames/second). This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].\n\nFor [[3D animation]]s, objects (models) are built on the computer monitor (modeled) and 3D figures are rigged with a [[Skeletal animation|virtual skeleton]]. For 2D figure animations, separate objects (illustrations) and separate transparent layers are used with or without that virtual skeleton. Then the limbs, eyes, mouth, clothes, etc. of the figure are moved by the animator on [[key frame]]s. The differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in a process known as [[Inbetweening|tweening]] or [[morphing]]. Finally, the animation is [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]].{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=232}}\n\nFor 3D animations, all frames must be rendered after the modeling is complete. For 2D vector animations, the [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] process is the key frame illustration process, while tweened frames are rendered as needed. For pre-recorded presentations, the rendered frames are transferred to a different format or medium, like digital video. The frames may also be rendered in real time as they are presented to the end-user audience. Low bandwidth animations transmitted via the internet (e.g. [[Adobe Flash]], [[X3D]]) often use software on the end-users computer to render in real time as an alternative to [[streaming media|streaming]] or pre-loaded high bandwidth animations.\n\n==Explanation==\nTo trick the [[Human eye|eye]] and the [[Human brain|brain]] into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object, the pictures should be drawn at around 12 [[frame rate|frames per second]] or faster.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=148}} (A [[Film frame|frame]] is one complete image.) With rates above 75-120  frames per second, no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due to the way the eye and the brain both process images. At rates below 12 frames per second, most people can detect [[jerkiness]] associated with the drawing of new images that detracts from the illusion of realistic movement.{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=100\u2013101, 255}} Conventional hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15  frames per second in order to save on the number of drawings needed, but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons. To produce more realistic imagery, computer animation demands higher frame rates.\n\nFilms seen in theaters in the United States run at 24 frames per second, which is sufficient to create the illusion of continuous movement. For high resolution, adapters are used.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of computer animation}}\n{{See also|Timeline of computer animation in film and television}}\nEarly digital computer animation was developed at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in the 1960s by Edward E. Zajac, Frank W. Sinden, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=390\u2013394}}  Other digital animation was also practiced at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=69\u201375}}\n\nIn 1967, a computer animation named \"Hummingbird\" was created by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=awvQp1TdBqc]</ref> \n\nIn 1968, a computer animation called \"[[:ru:\u041a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 (\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c)|Kitty]]\" was created with [[BESM]]-4 by Nikolai Konstantinov, depicting a cat moving around.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=so_HQKv-Bmk]</ref> \n\nIn 1971, a computer animation called \"Metadata\" was created, showing various shapes.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vkxrVpzPK4U]</ref> \n\nAn early step in the history of computer animation was the sequel to the 1973 film ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]],'' a science-fiction film about a society in which robots live and work among humans.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=404}} The sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), used the 3D [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame]] imagery, which featured a computer-animated hand and face both created by [[University of Utah]] graduates [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]].{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=282\u2013288}} This imagery originally appeared in their student film ''[[A Computer Animated Hand]]'', which they completed in 1972.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=64}}{{sfn|Means|2011}}\n\nDevelopments in CGI technologies are reported each year at [[SIGGRAPH]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=97\u201398}} an annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques that is attended by thousands of computer professionals each year.{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=95\u201397}} Developers of computer games and 3D video cards strive to achieve the same visual quality on personal computers in real-time as is possible for CGI films and animation. With the rapid advancement of real-time rendering quality, artists began to use [[game engine]]s to render non-interactive movies, which led to the art form [[Machinima]].\n\nThe very first full length computer animated television series was ''[[ReBoot]]'',{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=188}} which debuted in September 1994; the series followed the adventures of characters who lived inside a computer.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=430}} The first feature-length computer animated film was ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), which was made by [[Pixar]].{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=432}}{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=302}}<ref>\"Our Story\", Pixar, 1986-2013. Retrieved on 2013-02-15. {{cite web |url= http://www.pixar.com/about/Our-Story |title= The Pixar Timeline, 1979 to Present. |publisher= Pixar |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905125659/http://www.pixar.com/about/Our-Story |archivedate= 2015-09-05 |df=  }}</ref> It followed an adventure centered around toys and their owners. This groundbreaking film was also the first of many fully computer-animated movies.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=302}}\n\n==Animation methods==\n[[Image:Stickwalkav.gif|thumb|right|In this [[Graphics Interchange Format|.gif]] of a 2D [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation, each 'stick' of the [[stick figure|figure]] is [[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframed]] over time to create motion.]]\nIn most 3D computer animation systems, an animator creates a simplified representation of a character's anatomy, which is analogous to a [[skeleton]] or [[stick figure]].{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=193\u2013196}} The position of each segment of the skeletal model is defined by animation variables, or [[Avar (animation variable)|Avars]] for short. In human and animal characters, many parts of the skeletal model correspond to the actual bones, but [[skeletal animation]] is also used to animate other things, with facial features (though other methods for [[facial animation]] exist).{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=324\u2013326}} The character \"Woody\" in ''[[Toy Story]]'', for example, uses 700 Avars (100 in the face alone). The computer doesn't usually render the skeletal model directly (it is invisible), but it does use the skeletal model to compute the exact position and orientation of that certain character, which is eventually rendered into an image. Thus by changing the values of Avars over time, the animator creates motion by making the character move from frame to frame.\n\nThere are several methods for generating the Avar values to obtain realistic motion. Traditionally, animators manipulate the Avars directly.{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=111\u2013118}} Rather than set Avars for every frame, they usually set Avars at strategic points (frames) in time and let the computer interpolate or [[tweening|tween]] between them in a process called ''[[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframing]]''. Keyframing puts control in the hands of the animator and has roots in hand-drawn [[traditional animation]].{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=132}}\n\nIn contrast, a newer method called ''[[motion capture]]'' makes use of [[live action]] footage.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=118}} When computer animation is driven by motion capture, a real performer acts out the scene as if they were the character to be animated.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=94\u201398}} His/her motion is recorded to a computer using [[video camera]]s and markers and that performance is then applied to the animated character.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=226}}\n\nEach method has its advantages and as of 2007, games and films are using either or both of these methods in productions. Keyframe animation can produce motions that would be difficult or impossible to act out, while motion capture can reproduce the subtleties of a particular actor.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=204}} For example, in the 2006 film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', [[Bill Nighy]] provided the performance for the character [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Even though Nighy doesn't appear in the movie himself, the movie benefited from his performance by recording the nuances of his body language, posture, facial expressions, etc. Thus motion capture is appropriate in situations where believable, realistic behavior and action is required, but the types of characters required exceed what can be done throughout the conventional costuming.\n\n==Modeling==\n3D computer animation combines 3D models of objects and programmed or hand \"keyframed\" movement. These models are constructed out of geometrical vertices, faces, and edges in a 3D coordinate system. Objects are sculpted much like real clay or plaster, working from general forms to specific details with various sculpting tools. Unless a 3D model is intended to be a solid color, it must be painted with \"[[texture mapping|textures]]\" for realism. A bone/joint animation system is set up to deform the CGI model (e.g., to make a humanoid model walk). In a process known as ''rigging'', the virtual marionette is given various controllers and handles for controlling movement.{{sfn|Parent|2012|p=289}} Animation data can be created using [[motion capture]], or [[keyframing]] by a human animator, or a combination of the two.{{sfn|Beane|2012|p=2-15}}\n\n3D models rigged for animation may contain thousands of control points \u2014 for example, \"Woody\" from ''[[Toy Story]]'' uses 700 specialized animation controllers. [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] labored for two years to create [[Aslan]] in the movie ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', which had about 1,851 controllers (742 in the face alone). In the 2004 film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', designers had to design forces of extreme weather with the help of video references and accurate meteorological facts. For the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', actor [[Andy Serkis]] was used to help designers pinpoint the gorilla's prime location in the shots and used his expressions to model \"human\" characteristics onto the creature. Serkis had earlier provided the voice and performance for [[Gollum]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[Image:Jack-in-cube solid model, light background.gif|thumb|A ray-traced 3-D model of a jack inside a cube, and the jack alone below.]]\nComputer animation can be created with a computer and an animation software. Some impressive animation can be achieved even with basic programs; however, the rendering can take a lot of time on an ordinary home computer.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=158}} Professional animators of movies, television and video games could make photorealistic animation with high detail. This level of quality for movie animation would take hundreds of years to create on a home computer. Instead, many powerful [[workstation]] computers are used.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=144}} Graphics workstation computers use two to four processors, and they are a lot more powerful than an actual home computer and are specialized for rendering. A large number of workstations (known as a ''\"[[render farm]]\"'') are networked together to effectively act as a giant computer.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=195}} The result is a computer-animated movie that can be completed in about one to five years (however, this process is not composed solely of rendering). A workstation typically costs $2,000-16,000 with the more expensive stations being able to render much faster due to the more technologically-advanced hardware that they contain. Professionals also use digital [[movie camera]]s, motion/[[performance capture]], [[Chroma key|bluescreens]], [[List of video editing software|film editing software]], props, and other tools used for movie animation.\n\n==Facial animation==\n{{Main article|Computer facial animation}}\nThe realistic modeling of human facial features is both one of the most challenging and sought after elements in computer-generated imagery. [[Computer facial animation]] is a highly complex field where models typically include a very large number of animation variables.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=110\u2013116}} Historically speaking, the first [[SIGGRAPH]] tutorials on ''State of the art in Facial Animation'' in 1989 and 1990 proved to be a turning point in the field by bringing together and consolidating multiple research elements and sparked interest among a number of researchers.{{sfn|Parke|Waters|2008|p=xi}}\n\nThe [[Facial Action Coding System]] (with 46 \"action units\", \"lip bite\" or \"squint\"), which had been developed in 1976, became a popular basis for many systems.{{sfn|Magnenat Thalmann|Thalmann|2004|p=122}} As early as 2001, [[MPEG-4]] included 68 [[Face Animation Parameter]]s (FAPs) for lips, jaws, etc., and the field has made significant progress since then and the use of facial [[microexpression]] has increased.{{sfn|Magnenat Thalmann|Thalmann|2004|p=122}}{{sfn|Pereira|Ebrahimi|2002|p=404}}\n\nIn some cases, an [[Affect measures|affective space]], the [[PAD emotional state model]], can be used to assign specific emotions to the faces of [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]].{{sfn|Pereira|Ebrahimi|2002|pp=60\u201361}} In this approach, the PAD model is used as a high level emotional space and the lower level space is the MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters (FAP). A mid-level Partial Expression Parameters (PEP) space is then used to in a two-level structure \u2013 the PAD-PEP mapping and the PEP-FAP translation model.{{sfn|Paiva|Prada|Picard|2007|pages=24\u201333}}\n\n==Realism==\nRealism in computer animation can mean making each frame look [[photorealism|photorealistic]], in the sense that the scene is rendered to resemble a photograph or make the characters' animation believable and lifelike.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=160\u2013161}} Computer animation can also be realistic with or without the [[photorealistic rendering]].{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=14\u201317}}\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in computer animation has been creating human characters that look and move with the highest degree of realism. Part of the difficulty in making pleasing, realistic human characters is the [[uncanny valley]], the concept where the human audience (up to a point) tends to have an increasingly negative, emotional response as a human replica looks and acts more and more human.

Several [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] animation software applications exist as well. The ease at which these animations can be distributed has attracted professional animation talent also. Companies such as [[PowToon]] and [[GoAnimate]] attempt to bridged the gap by giving amateurs access to professional animations as [[clip art]].\n\nThe oldest (most backward compatible) web-based animations are in the animated [[GIF]] format, which can be uploaded and seen on the web easily.{{sfn|Kuperberg|2002|pp=112\u2013113}} However, the [[raster graphics]] format of GIF animations slows the [[download]] and frame rate, especially with larger screen sizes. The growing demand for higher quality web-based animations was met by a [[vector graphics]] alternative that relied on the use of a [[Browser extension|plugin]].  For decades, [[Flash animation]]s were the most popular format, until the web development community abandoned support for the [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash player]] plugin.  Web browsers on [[mobile device]]s and [[mobile operating system]]s never fully supported the Flash plugin.\n\nBy this time, [[Bandwidth (computing)|internet bandwidth]] and download speeds increased, making raster graphic animations more convenient. Some of the more complex vector graphic animations had a slower frame rate due to complex [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] than some of the raster graphic alternatives. Many of the GIF and Flash animations were already converted to [[digital video]] formats, which were compatible with mobile devices and reduced file sizes via [[video compression]] technology. However, compatibility was still problematic as some of the popular video formats such as Apple's [[QuickTime]] and [[Microsoft Silverlight]] required plugins. [[YouTube]], the most popular video viewing website, was also relying on the Flash plugin to deliver digital video in the [[Flash Video]] format.\n\nThe latest alternatives are [[HTML5]] compatible animations. Technologies such as [[JavaScript]] and  [[CSS animation]]s made sequencing the movement of images in HTML5 web pages more convenient. [[SVG animation]]s offered a vector graphic alternative to the original Flash graphic format, [[SmartSketch]]. YouTube offers an HTML5 alternative for digital video. [[APNG]] (Animated PNG) offered a raster graphic alternative to animated GIF files that enables multi-level transparency not available in GIFs\n\n{{See also|Comparison of HTML5 and Flash}}\n\n==Detailed examples and pseudocode==\nIn 2D computer animation, moving objects are often referred to as \"[[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].\" A sprite is an image that has a location associated with it. The location of the sprite is changed slightly, between each displayed frame, to make the sprite appear to move.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=123}} The following [[pseudocode]] makes a sprite move from left to right:\n\n '''var''' ''int'' x := 0, y := screenHeight / 2;\n '''while''' x < screenWidth\n drawBackground()\n drawSpriteAtXY (x, y) ''// draw on top of the background''\n x := x + 5 ''// move to the right''\n\nComputer animation uses different techniques to produce animations. Most frequently, sophisticated [[mathematics]] is used to manipulate complex three-dimensional [[polygon]]s, apply \"[[Texture mapping|textures]]\", lighting and other effects to the polygons and finally [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] the complete image. A sophisticated [[graphical user interface]] may be used to create the animation and arrange its choreography. Another technique called [[constructive solid geometry]] defines objects by conducting boolean operations on regular shapes, and has the advantage that animations may be accurately produced at any resolution.\n\n== Computer-assisted vs. computer-generated ==\n\n''To animate means, figuratively, to \"give life to\". There are two basic methods that animators commonly use to accomplish this.''\n\nComputer-assisted animation is usually classed as two-dimensional ([[2D computer graphics|2D]]) animation. Drawings are either hand drawn (pencil to paper) or interactively drawn (on the computer) using different assisting appliances and are positioned into specific software packages. Within the [[software]] package, the creator places drawings into different [[key frame]]s which fundamentally create an outline of the most important movements.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=115}} The computer then fills in the \"in-between frames\", a process commonly known as [[Inbetweening|Tweening]].{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=284}} Computer-assisted animation employs new technologies to produce content faster than is possible with [[traditional animation]], while still retaining the stylistic elements of traditionally drawn characters or objects.<ref name=\"Roos\">{{cite web |url= http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/computer-animation.htm |title=How Computer Animation Works |publisher=HowStuffWorks|last=Roos|first=Dave|date=2013|access-date=2013-02-15}}</ref>\n\nExamples of films produced using computer-assisted animation are [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|''The Little Mermaid'']], ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'']], ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'', [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|''Pocahontas'']], [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'']], ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', [[Mulan (1998 film)|''Mulan'']], ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]'' and ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''.\n\nComputer-generated animation is known as three-dimensional ([[3D computer graphics|3D]]) animation. Creators design an object or character with an X, a Y and a Z axis. No pencil-to-paper drawings create the way computer generated animation works. The object or character created will then be taken into a software, key framing and tweening are also carried out in computer generated animation but are also a lot of techniques used that do not relate to [[traditional animation]]. [[Animator]]s can break physical laws by using mathematical [[algorithm]]s to cheat, [[mass]], [[force]] and [[Gravitation|gravity]] rulings. Fundamentally, time scale and quality could be said to be a preferred way to produce animation as they are two major things that are enhanced by using computer generated animation. Another positive aspect of CGA is the fact one can create a flock of creatures to act independently when created as a group. An animal's fur can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] to wave in the wind and lie flat when it rains instead of programming each strand of hair separately.<ref name=\"Roos\" />\n\nA few examples of computer-generated animation movies are ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', and ''[[Shrek]]''. <!-- please don't add any more examples -->\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Animation|Computer graphics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Animation]]\n* [[Animation database]]\n* [[Autodesk]]\n* [[Avar (animation variable)]]\n* [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI)\n* [[New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab]]\n* [[Computer representation of surfaces]]\n* [[Hand-Over]]\n* [[Humanoid animation]]\n* [[List of animation studios]]\n* [[List of computer-animated films]]\n* [[List of computer-animated television series]]\n* [[Medical animation]]\n* [[Morph target animation]]\n* [[Machinima]] (recording video from games and virtual worlds)\n* [[Motion capture]]\n* [[Procedural animation]]\n* [[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]]\n* [[Rich Representation Language]]\n* [[Skeletal animation]]\n* [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television]]\n* [[Virtual artifact]]\n* [[Wire-frame model]]\n* [[12 basic principles of animation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|wikititle=computer animation}}\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Beane\n |first=Andy\n |title=3D Animation Essentials\n |year=2012\n |publisher=John Wiley & Sons\n |location=Indianapolis, Indiana\n |isbn=978-1-118-14748-1\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Kuperberg\n |first=Marcia\n |title=A Guide to Computer Animation: For TV, Games, Multimedia and Web\n |year=2002\n |publisher=Focal Press\n |isbn=0-240-51671-0\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last1=Magnenat Thalmann\n |first1=Nadia\n |authorlink1=Nadia Magnenat Thalmann\n |last2=Thalmann\n |first2=Daniel\n |authorlink2=Daniel Thalmann\n |title=Handbook of Virtual Humans\n |isbn=0-470-02316-3\n |publisher=Wiley Publishing\n |year=2004\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Masson\n |first=Terrence\n |title=CG 101: A Computer Graphics Industry Reference\n |publisher=Digital Fauxtography Inc.\n |isbn=0-7357-0046-X\n |year=1999\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite news\n |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/mobile/53193670-90/film-catmull-computer-animation.html.csp\n |title=Pixar founder\u2019s Utah-made ''Hand'' added to National Film Registry\n |last=Means\n |first=Sean P.\n |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]\n |date=December 28, 2011\n |accessdate=January 8, 2012\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n |last1=Paiva|first1=Ana\n |last2=Prada\n |first2=Rui\n |last3=Picard\n |first3=Rosalind W.\n |year=2007\n |title=Facial Expression Synthesis using PAD Emotional Parameters for a Chinese Expressive Avatar\n |journal= Affective computing and intelligent interaction\n |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media\n |volume=\n |issue=\n |doi=\n |isbn=3-540-74888-1\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Parent\n |first=Rick\n |title=Computer Animation: Algorithms and Techniques\n |year=2012\n |location=Ohio\n |publisher=Elsevier\n |isbn=978-0-12-415842-9\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last1=Pereira\n |first1=Fernando C.

He may have been the son of [[Cynric of Wessex]] and the grandson of [[Cerdic of Wessex]], whom the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' represents as the leader of the first group of [[Saxons]] to come to the land which later became [[Wessex]]. Ceawlin was active during the last years of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] expansion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] by the time of his death.\n\nThe chronology of Ceawlin's life is highly uncertain. The historical accuracy and dating of many of the events in the later ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' have been called into question, and his reign is variously listed as lasting seven, seventeen, or thirty-two years.<ref>Stenton, p. 29, accepts the date given for Ceawlin's accession in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' of 560, but Barbara Yorke in her online DNB article on Ceawlin states that his reign seems to have been deliberately lengthened.</ref> The ''Chronicle'' records several battles of Ceawlin's between the years 556 and 592, including the first record of a battle between different groups of Anglo-Saxons, and indicates that under Ceawlin Wessex acquired significant territory, some of which was later to be lost to other [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].  Ceawlin is also named as one of the eight \"''[[bretwalda]]s''\", a title given in the ''Chronicle'' to eight rulers who had overlordship over southern Britain, although the extent of Ceawlin's control is not known.\n\nCeawlin died in 593, having been deposed the year before, possibly by his successor, [[Ceol of Wessex|Ceol]].  He is recorded in various sources as having two sons, Cutha and [[Cuthwine]], but the genealogies in which this information is found are known to be unreliable.\n\n==Historical context==\nThe history of the [[sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman period in Britain]] is poorly sourced and the subject of a number of important disagreements among historians.  It appears, however, that in the fifth century raids on Britain by continental peoples developed into migrations.  The newcomers included [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], and [[Frisii|Frisians]].  These peoples captured territory in the east and south of England, but at about the end of the fifth century, a British victory at the battle of [[Mons Badonicus]] halted the Anglo-Saxon advance for fifty years.<ref name=Blair_IASE_13>Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 13\u201316.</ref><ref name=Campbell_TAS_23>Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 23.</ref>  Near the year 550, however, the British began to lose ground once more, and within twenty-five years, it appears that control of almost all of southern England was in the hands of the invaders.<ref name=Blair_RBaEE_204>Hunter Blair (''Roman Britain'', p. 204) gives the twenty-five years from 550 to 575 as the dates of the final conquest.</ref>\n\nThe peace following the battle of Mons Badonicus is attested partly by [[Gildas]], a monk, who wrote ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' or ''On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain'' during the middle of the sixth century.  This essay is a polemic against corruption and Gildas provides little in the way of names and dates.  He appears, however, to state that peace had lasted from the year of his birth to the time he was writing.<ref name=Stenton_2>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 2\u20137.</ref>  The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' is the other main source that bears on this period, in particular in an entry for the year 827 that records a list of the kings who bore the title \"''[[bretwalda]]''\", or \"Britain-ruler\".  That list shows a gap in the early sixth century that matches Gildas's version of events.<ref name=Swanton_60>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nCeawlin's reign belongs to the period of Anglo-Saxon expansion at the end of the sixth century.  Though there are many unanswered questions about the chronology and activities of the early West Saxon rulers, it is clear that Ceawlin was one of the key figures in the final Anglo-Saxon conquest of southern Britain.<ref name=Stenton_30>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 30.</ref>\n\n==Early West Saxon sources==\nThe two main written sources for early West Saxon history are the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List.  The ''Chronicle'' is a set of annals which were compiled near the year 890, during the reign of King [[Alfred the Great]] of [[Wessex]].<ref name=KL_41>Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 41.</ref>  They record earlier material for the older entries, which were assembled from earlier annals that no longer survive, as well as, from saga material that might have been transmitted orally.<ref name=Swanton_xix>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. xix</ref><ref name=Yorke_132>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 132.</ref>  The ''Chronicle'' dates the arrival of the future \"West Saxons\" in Britain to 495, when [[Cerdic]] and his son, [[Cynric]], land at ''Cerdices ora'', or Cerdic's shore. Almost twenty annals describing Cerdic's campaigns, and those of his descendants appear interspersed through the next hundred years of entries in the ''Chronicle''.<ref name=Kirby_50>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 50\u201351.</ref><ref name=Swanton_14>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 14\u201321</ref>  Although these annals provide most of what is known about Ceawlin, the historicity of many of the entries is uncertain.<ref name=Kirby_55>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 55</ref>\n\nThe West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List is a list of rulers of Wessex, including the lengths of their reigns.  It survives in several forms, including as a preface to the [B] manuscript of the ''Chronicle''.<ref name=Swanton_xxiii>The Regnal List is now separated from the main body of the ''Chronicle'', and as result the manuscripts are recorded separately in the [[British Library]], as MS [[Cotton Tiberius]] A ii, f. 178 (for the Regnal List), and MS Cotton Tiberius A vi, ff. 1\u201334 (the [B] manuscript of the ''Chronicle'').  See Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. xxii.  See also Lapidge, ''Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 388.</ref>  As with ''Chronicle'', the list was compiled during the reign of Alfred the Great, and both the list and the ''Chronicle'' are influenced by the desire of their writers to use a single line of descent to trace the lineage of the Kings of Wessex through Cerdic to [[Gewis]], the legendary eponymous ancestor of the West Saxons, who is made to descend from [[Woden]].  The result served the political purposes of the scribe, but is riddled with contradictions for historians.<ref name=Kirby_49>D.P. Kirby (''Earliest English Kings'', p. 49) refers to the combination of the Chronicle and the Regnal List as a \"[[political fiction]]\".</ref>\n\nThe contradictions may be seen clearly by calculating dates by different methods from the various sources.  The first event in West Saxon history, the date of which can be regarded as reasonably certain, is the baptism of [[Cynegils]], which occurred in the late 630s, perhaps as late as 640. The ''Chronicle'' dates Cerdic's arrival to 495, but adding up the lengths of the reigns as given in the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, leads to the conclusion that Cerdic's reign might have started in 532, a difference of 37 years.  Neither 495 nor 532 may be treated as reliable, however, the latter date relies on the presumption that the Regnal List is correct in presenting the Kings of Wessex as having succeeded one another, with no omitted kings, no [[Joint monarchs|joint kingship]]s, and that the durations of the reigns are correct as given. None of these presumptions may be made safely.<ref name=Kirby_50 />\n\nThe sources also are inconsistent on the length of Ceawlin's reign.  The ''Chronicle'' gives it as thirty-two years, from 560 to 592, but the Regnal Lists disagree: different versions give it as seven or seventeen years.  A recent detailed study of the Regnal List dates the arrival of the West Saxons in England to 538, and favours seven years as the most likely length of Ceawlin's reign, with dates of 581\u2013588 proposed.<ref name=Kirby_50 /><ref name=Yorke_133>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 133, citing D.N. Dumville, \"The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List and the chronology of Wessex\", 1985.</ref>  The sources do agree that Ceawlin is the son of Cynric and he usually is named as the father of Cuthwine.<ref name=Swanton_GT>See the \"Genealogical Tables\" in the appendices to Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''.</ref>  There is one discrepancy in this case: the entry for 685 in the [A] version of the ''Chronicle'' assigns Ceawlin a son, Cutha, but in the 855 entry in the same manuscript, Cutha is listed as the son of Cuthwine.  Cutha also is named as Ceawlin's brother in the [E] and [F] versions of the ''Chronicle'', in the 571 and 568 entries, respectively.<ref name=Swanton_18>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 18\u201319. For tables showing the variations in the Wessex genealogy, see also figures 3 and 4 in Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 223\u2013224.</ref>\n\nWhether Ceawlin is a descendant of Cerdic is a matter of debate.  Subgroupings of different West Saxon lineages give the impression of separate groups, of which Ceawlin's line is one.  Some of the problems in the Wessex genealogies may have come about because of efforts to integrate Ceawlin's line with the other lineages: it was very important to the West Saxons to be able to trace their ancestors back to Cerdic.<ref name=Yorke_142>Yorke (''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 133) gives this argument in some detail.</ref>  Another reason for doubting the literal nature of these early genealogies is that the etymology of the names of several early members of the dynasty do not appear to be Germanic, as would be expected in the names of leaders of an apparently Anglo-Saxon dynasty.  The name Ceawlin is one of the names that do not have convincing Anglo-Saxon etymologies; it seems more likely to be of native British origin.<ref>\"Records of the West Saxon dynasties survive in versions which have been subject to later manipulation, which may make it all the more significant that some of the founding 'Saxon' fathers have British names: Cerdic, Ceawlin, Cenwalh.\" in: Hills, C., ''Origins of the English,'' Duckworth (2003), p. 105. Also \"The names Cerdic, Ceawlin and Caedwalla, all in the genealogy of the West Saxon kings, are apparently British.\" in: Ward-Perkins, B., ''Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?'' ''The English Historical Review'' 115.462 (June 2000): p513.</ref>\n\nThe earliest sources do not use the term \"West Saxon\". According to [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', the term is interchangeable with the [[Gewisse]]. The term \"West Saxon\" appears only in the late seventh century, after the reign of [[C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex|C\u00e6dwalla]].<ref name=Kirby_48>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 48, 223</ref>\n\n==West Saxon expansion==\n[[Image:Ceawlin map.png|thumb|right|A map of places mentioned by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' in annals relating to Ceawlin; modern versions of the place names are given here, rather than the Anglo-Saxon names used in the chronicle.|alt=A map showing places in central southern England, including Gloucester, Cirencester, Bath, and Aylesbury]]\n\nUltimately, the kingdom of Wessex occupied the southwest of England, but the initial stages in this expansion are not apparent from the sources.<ref name=Kirby_49/>  Cerdic's landing, whenever it is to be dated, seems to have been near the [[Isle of Wight]], and the annals record the conquest of the island in 530.  In 534, according to the ''Chronicle'', Cerdic died and his son Cynric took the throne; the ''Chronicle'' adds that \"they gave the Isle of Wight to their nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar\".<ref>Note that the name \"Wight\" is derived from the Romano-British \"Vectis', not from \"Wihtgar\"; see Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 16.</ref>  These records are in direct conflict with [[Bede]], who states that the Isle of Wight was settled by Jutes, not Saxons; the [[archaeological record]] is somewhat in favour of Bede on this.<ref name=Swanton_14 /><ref name=Stenton_22>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nSubsequent entries in the ''Chronicle'' give details of some of the battles by which the West Saxons won their kingdom.  Ceawlin's campaigns are not given as near the coast.  They range along the [[Thames Valley|Thames valley]] and beyond, as far as [[Surrey]] in the east and the mouth of the [[Severn]] in the west.  Ceawlin clearly is part of the West Saxon expansion, but the military history of the period is difficult to understand.<ref name=Kirby_49 />  In what follows the dates are as given in the ''Chronicle'', although as noted above, these are earlier than now thought accurate.\n\n==556: Beran byrg==\nThe first record of a battle fought by Ceawlin is in 556, when he and his father, Cynric, fought the native Britons at \"Beran byrg\", or Bera's Stronghold.  This now is identified as [[Barbury Castle]], an Iron Age hill fort in Wiltshire, near Swindon.  Cynric would have been king of Wessex at this time.<ref name=Swanton_14/><ref name=Stenton_26>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 26\u201328.</ref>\n\n==568: Wibbandun==\nThe first battle Ceawlin fought as king is dated by the ''Chronicle'' to 568, when he and Cutha fought with [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|\u00c6thelberht]], the king of Kent.  The entry says \"Here Ceawlin and Cutha fought against Aethelberht and drove him into Kent; and they killed two [[Ealdorman|ealdormen]], Oslaf and Cnebba, on Wibbandun.\"  The location of \"Wibbandun\", which can be translated as \"Wibba's Mount\", has not been identified definitely; it was at one time thought to be Wimbledon, but this now is known to be incorrect.<ref name=Plummer_2_16>Plummer, ''Two Saxon Chronicles'', vol. 2 p. 16</ref><ref name=Hodgkins_188>English Place-Name Society (1926), p. xiv, cited in Hodgkins, ''A History'', p. 188 n. 2</ref>  This battle is notable as the first recorded conflict between the invading peoples: previous battles recorded in the ''Chronicle'' are between the Anglo-Saxons and the native Britons.<ref name=Swanton_14 />\n\nThere are multiple examples of joint kingship in Anglo-Saxon history, and this may be another: it is not clear what Cutha's relationship to Ceawlin is, but it certainly is possible he was also a king.  The annal for 577, below, is another possible example.<ref name=Yorke_143_2>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n==571: Bedcanford==\nThe annal for 571 reads: \"Here Cuthwulf fought against the Britons at Bedcanford, and took four settlements: [[Limbury]] and [[Aylesbury]], [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]] and [[Eynsham]]; and in the same year he passed away.\"  Cuthwulf's relationship with Ceawlin is unknown, but the alliteration common to Anglo-Saxon royal families suggests Cuthwulf may be part of the West Saxon royal line.  The location of the battle itself is unidentified.  It has been suggested that it was [[Bedford]], but what is known of the early history of Bedford's names, does not support this.  This battle is of interest because it is surprising that an area so far east should still be in Briton hands this late: there is ample archaeological evidence of early Saxon and Anglian presence in the Midlands, and historians generally have interpreted Gildas's ''De Excidio'' as implying that the Britons had lost control of this area by the mid-sixth century.  One possible explanation is, that this annal records a reconquest of land that was lost to the Britons in the campaigns ending in the battle of Mons Badonicus.<ref name=Stenton_26 />\n\n==577: The lower Severn==\nThe annal for 577 reads \"Here Cuthwine and Ceawlin fought against the Britons, and they killed three kings, Coinmail and Condidan and Farinmail, in the place which is called [[Dyrham]], and took three cities: [[Gloucester]] and [[Cirencester]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].\"<ref name=Swanton_18_2>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 18\u201319</ref>  This entry is all that is known of these Briton kings; their names are in an archaic form that makes it very likely that this annal derives from a much older written source.  The battle itself has long been regarded as a key moment in the Saxon advance, since in reaching the [[Bristol Channel]], the West Saxons divided the Britons west of the Severn from land communication with those in the peninsula to the south of the Channel.<ref name=Stenton_29>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 29.</ref>  Wessex almost certainly lost this territory to [[Penda of Mercia]] in 628, when the ''Chronicle'' records that \"Cynegils and Cwichelm fought against Penda at Cirencester and then came to an agreement.\"<ref name=Stenton_45>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 45.</ref><ref name=Swanton_24>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nIt is possible that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent.  [[Nennius]], a ninth-century historian, mentions a \"Hot Lake\" in the land of the [[Hwicce]], which was along the Severn, and adds \"It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes.  If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot\".

It may be that Ceawlin's overlordship of the southern Britons came to an end with this battle.<ref name=Stenton_30 />\n\n==Bretwaldaship==\n[[Image:Entry_for_827_in_the_Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle,_which_lists_the_eight_bretwaldas.gif|thumb|right|350px|The entry for 827 in the [C] manuscript of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,'' listing the eight ''bretwaldas'', Ceawlin's name can be seen in the fifth line, spelled \"Ceaulin\"|alt=Part of a manuscript page showing eleven lines of lettering in an old style, with a Roman numeral in reddish ink at the start of the first line]]\n\nAbout 731, Bede, a [[Northumbria]]n monk and chronicler, wrote a work called the ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''.  The work was not primarily a secular history, but Bede provides much information about the history of the Anglo-Saxons, including a list early in the history of seven kings who, he said, held \"imperium\" over the other kingdoms south of the [[Humber]].  The usual translation for \"imperium\" is \"overlordship\".   Bede names Ceawlin as the second on the list, although he spells it \"Caelin\", and adds that he was \"known in the speech of his own people as Ceaulin\". Bede also makes it clear that Ceawlin was not a Christian\u2014Bede mentions a later king, \u00c6thelberht of Kent, as \"the first to enter the kingdom of heaven\".<ref name=Bede_111>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', II 5, quoted from Sherley-Price's translation, p. 111</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,'' in an entry for the year 827, repeats Bede's list, adds [[Egbert of Wessex]], and also mentions that they were known as \"bretwalda\", or \"Britain-ruler\".<ref name=Swanton_60 />   A great deal of scholarly attention has been given to the meaning of this word.  It has been described as a term \"of encomiastic poetry\",<ref name=Stenton_34>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 34\u201335.</ref> but there also is evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.<ref name=Kirby_17>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 17.</ref>\n\nBede says that these kings had authority \"south of the [[Humber]]\", but the span of control, at least of the earlier bretwaldas, likely was less than this.<ref name=Campbell_TAS_53>Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp. 53\u201354.</ref>  In Ceawlin's case the range of control is hard to determine accurately, but Bede's inclusion of Ceawlin in the list of kings who held ''imperium'', and the list of battles he is recorded as having won, indicate an energetic and successful leader who, from a base in the upper Thames valley, dominated much of the surrounding area and held overlordship over the southern Britons for some period.<ref name=Kirby_55 />  Despite Ceawlin's military successes, the northern conquests he made could not always be retained: [[Mercia]] took much of the upper Thames valley, and the north-eastern towns won in 571 were among territory subsequently under the control of Kent and Mercia at different times.<ref name=Stenton_29 />\n\nBede's concept of the power of these overlords also must be regarded as the product of his eighth-century viewpoint.  When the ''Ecclesiastical History'' was written, [[\u00c6thelbald of Mercia]] dominated the English south of the Humber, and Bede's view of the earlier kings was doubtless strongly coloured by the state of England at that time.  For the earlier ''bretwaldas'', such as \u00c6lle and Ceawlin, there must be some element of anachronism in Bede's description.<ref name=Kirby_17/>  It also is possible that Bede only meant to refer to power over Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, not the native Britons.<ref name=Campbell_TAS_53/>\n\nCeawlin is the second king in Bede's list.  All the subsequent bretwaldas followed more or less consecutively, but there is a long gap, perhaps fifty years, between [[\u00c6lle of Sussex]], the first bretwalda, and Ceawlin.  The lack of gaps between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been used to make an argument for Ceawlin's dates matching the later entries in the ''Chronicle'' with reasonable accuracy.  According to this analysis, the next bretwalda, [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]], must have been already a dominant king by the time Pope [[Gregory the Great]] wrote to him in 601, since Gregory would have not written to an underking.  Ceawlin defeated \u00c6thelberht in 568 according to the ''Chronicle''.  \u00c6thelberht's dates are a matter of debate, but recent scholarly consensus has his reign starting no earlier than 580.  The 568 date for the battle at Wibbandun is thought to be unlikely because of the assertion in various versions of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin's reign lasted either seven or seventeen years.  If this battle is placed near the year 590, before \u00c6thelberht has established himself as a powerful king, then the subsequent annals relating to Ceawlin's defeat and death may be reasonably close to the correct date.  In any case, the battle with \u00c6thelberht is unlikely to have been more than a few years on either side of 590.<ref name=Kirby_56_2>The argument is made in more detail in Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 56. See also pp. 50\u201351 for a review of the evidence concerning the length of Ceawlin's reign.</ref>  The gap between \u00c6lle and Ceawlin, on the other hand, has been taken as supporting evidence for the story told by Gildas in ''De Excidio'' of a peace lasting a generation or more following a Briton victory at Mons Badonicus.<ref name=Stenton_19>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 19.</ref>\n\n\u00c6thelberht of Kent succeeds Ceawlin on the list of bretwaldas, but the reigns may overlap somewhat: recent evaluations give Ceawlin a likely reign of 581\u2013588, and place \u00c6thelberht's accession near to the year 589, but these analyses are no more than scholarly guesses.<ref name=Yorke_133 /><ref name=Kirby_31>Kirby (''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 31\u201334) provides a very detailed analysis of the chronology of \u00c6thelberht's reign.</ref>  Ceawlin's eclipse in 592, probably by Ceol, may have been the occasion for \u00c6thelberht to rise to prominence; \u00c6thelberht very likely was the dominant Anglo-Saxon king by 597.<ref name=Kirby_56>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 56.</ref>  \u00c6thelberht's rise may have been earlier: the 584 annal, even if it records a victory, is the last victory of Ceawlin's in the ''Chronicle'', and the period after that may have been one of \u00c6thelberht's ascent and Ceawlin's decline.<ref name=Stenton_30 />\n\n==Wessex at Ceawlin's death==\n[[File:England green top.svg|thumb|150px|right|The state of Anglo-Saxon England at Ceawlin's death|alt=A map showing England and Wales, with the locations of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms marked, and some towns]]\n\nCeawlin lost the throne of Wessex in 592.  The annal for that year reads, in part: \"Here there was great slaughter at Woden's Barrow, and Ceawlin was driven out.\"  Woden's Barrow is a tumulus, now called [[Adam's Grave]], at [[Alton Priors]], [[Wiltshire]].<ref name=Swanton_14 />  No details of his opponent are given.  The medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in about 1120, says that it was \"the Angles and the British conspiring together\".<ref name=Plummer_2_17>Quoted in Plummer, ''Two Saxon Chronicles'', vol. 2 p. 17</ref>  Alternatively, it may have been Ceol, who is supposed to have been the next king of Wessex, ruling for six years according to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List.<ref name=Kirby_56 />  According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Ceawlin died the following year.  The relevant part of the annal reads: \"Here Ceawlin and Cwichelm and Crida perished.\"<ref name=Swanton_14 />  Nothing more is known of Cwichelm and Crida, although they may have been members of the Wessex royal house \u2013 their names fit the alliterative pattern common to royal houses of the time.<ref name=Stenton_30 /><ref name=Yorke_143>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 143</ref>\n\nAccording to the Regnal List, Ceol was a son of Cutha, who was a son of Cynric; and Ceolwulf, his brother, reigned for seventeen years after him.  It is possible that some fragmentation of control among the West Saxons occurred at Ceawlin's death: Ceol and Ceolwulf may have been based in Wiltshire, as opposed to the upper Thames valley.  This split also may have contributed to \u00c6thelberht's ability to rise to dominance in southern England.  The West Saxons remained influential in military terms, however: the ''Chronicle'' and Bede record continued military activity against Essex and Sussex within twenty or thirty years of Ceawlin's death.<ref name=Kirby_17/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[House of Wessex family tree]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n'''Primary sources'''\n* {{cite book |last= Bede|authorlink= Bede|title= [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]|translator= Leo Sherley-Price|others= Revised by R.E.

A CD-R disc is a [[compact disc]] that can be [[Write once read many|written once and read arbitrarily many]] times.\n\nCD-R discs (CD-Rs) are readable by most plain CD readers, i.e., CD readers manufactured prior to the introduction of CD-R. This is an advantage over [[CD-RW]], which can be re-written but cannot be played on many plain CD readers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CD-R.jpg|left|thumb|Assorted CD-Rs]]\nOriginally named CD [[Write once read many|'''W'''rite-'''O'''nce (WO)]], the CD-R specification was first published in 1988 by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] in the 'Orange Book'. The Orange Book consists of several parts, furnishing details of the CD-WO, CD-MO ('''M'''agneto-'''O'''ptic), and CD-RW ('''R'''e'''W'''ritable). The latest editions have abandoned the use of the term \"CD-WO\" in favor of \"CD-R\", while \"[[CD-MO]]\" were used very little.  Written CD-Rs and CD-RWs are, in the aspect of low-level encoding and data format, fully compatible with the audio CD (''Red Book'' [[CD-DA]]) and data CD (''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]]) standards.  (Note that the Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM only specifies a high-level data format and refers to the Red Book for all physical format and low-level code details, such as track pitch, linear bit density, and bitstream encoding.)  This means they use [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation]], [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]] error correction, and, for [[CD-ROM]], the third error correction layer defined in the Yellow Book.  Properly written CD-R discs on blanks of less than 80 minutes length are fully compatible with the audio CD and CD-ROM standards in all details including physical specifications.  80 minute CD-R discs marginally violate the Red Book physical format specifications, and longer discs are noncompliant.  CD-RW discs have lower reflectivity than CD-R or pressed (non-writable) CDs and for this reason cannot meet the Red Book standard (or come close).  Some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and, because of their lower reflectivity, especially CD-RWs.  To the extent that CD hardware can read extended-length discs or CD-RW discs, it is because that hardware has capability beyond the minimum required by the Red Book and Yellow Book standards (the hardware is more capable than it needs to be to bear the Compact Disc logo).\n\nCD-R recording systems available in 1990 were similar to the washing machine-sized Meridian CD Publisher, based on the two-piece rack mount [[Yamaha]] PDS audio recorder costing $35,000, not including the required external [[Error correction code|ECC]] circuitry for data encoding, [[SCSI]] hard drive subsystem, and [[MS-DOS]] control computer. By 1992, the cost of typical recorders was down to $10,000\u201312,000, and in September 1995, [[Hewlett-Packard]] introduced its model 4020i manufactured by Philips, which, at $995, was the first recorder to cost less than $1000.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030202233907/http://www.roxio.com/en/support/cdr/historycdr.html Roxio history of CD-R] from Roxio Newsletter 17 January 2000. Retrieved 19 September 2009</ref>\n\nThe dye materials developed by [[Taiyo Yuden]] made it possible for CD-R discs to be compatible with Audio CD and CD-ROM discs.\n\nInitially, in the United States, there was a market separation between \"music\" CD-Rs and \"data\" CD-Rs, the former being several times more expensive than the latter due to industry [[copyright]] arrangements with the [[RIAA]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988955,00.html A New Spin], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', August 24, 1998</ref> Physically, there is no difference between the discs save for the Disc Application Flag that identifies their type: standalone audio recorders will only accept \"music\" CD-Rs to enforce the RIAA arrangement, while computer CD-R drives can use either type of media to burn either type of content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq07.html#S7-17 |title=What's the difference between \"data\" and \"music\" blanks? |publisher=Cdrfaq.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\nA standard CD-R is a {{convert|1.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick disc made of [[polycarbonate]] about 120&nbsp;mm (4.7&nbsp;in) or 80&nbsp;mm (3.150&nbsp;in) diameter. The 120&nbsp;mm disc has a storage capacity of 74 minutes of audio or 650 [[Megabyte]]s of data. CD-R/RWs are available with capacities of 80 minutes of audio or 737,280,000 bytes (700&nbsp;[[MiB]]), which they achieve by molding the disc at the tightest allowable tolerances specified in the [[Orange Book (CD standard)|Orange Book]] CD-R/CD-RW standards. The engineering margin that was reserved for manufacturing tolerance has been used for data capacity instead, leaving no tolerance for manufacturing; for these discs to be truly compliant with the Orange Book standard, the manufacturing process must be perfect .{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nDespite the foregoing, most CD-Rs on the market have an 80-minute capacity.  There are also 90 minute/790&nbsp;MiB and 99 minute/870&nbsp;MiB discs, although they are less common (and depart from the Orange Book standard outright).  Also, due to the limitations of the data structures in the ATIP (see below), 90 and 99 minute blanks will identify as 80 minute ones. (As the ATIP is part of the Orange Book standard, it is natural that its design does not support some nonstandard disc configurations.) Therefore, in order to use the additional capacity, these discs have to be burned using \"[[Overburn#Overburning|overburn]]\" options in the CD recording software.  (Overburning itself is so named because it is outside the written standards, but, due to market demand, it has nonetheless become a de facto standard function in most CD writing drives and software for them.)\n\nSome drives use special techniques, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, to write more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently deviations from the Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group and will not be archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2&nbsp;GiB with GigaRec or 1.8&nbsp;GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a proprietary data storage format, assuming that it works reliably as designed, is that it may be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware used to read the media if it fails, is damaged, or is lost after its original vendor discontinues it.\n\nNothing in the Red, Yellow or Orange Book standards prohibits disc reading/writing devices from having the capacity to read or write discs beyond the Compact Disc standards.  The standards do require discs to meet precise requirements in order to be called Compact Discs, but the other discs may be called by other names; if this were not true, no DVD drive could legally bear the Compact Disc logo.  While disc players and drives may have capabilities beyond the standards, enabling them to read and write nonstandard discs, there is no assurance, in the absence of explicit additional manufacturer specifications beyond normal Compact Disc logo certification, that any particular player or drive will perform beyond the standards at all or consistently. Furthermore, if the same device with no explicit performance specs beyond the Compact Disc logo initially handles nonstandard discs reliably, there is no assurance that it will not later stop doing so, and in that case, there is no assurance that it can be made to do so again by service or adjustment.  Therefore, discs with capacities larger than 650 MB, and especially those larger than 700 MB, are less interchangeable among players/drives than standard discs and are not very suitable for archival use, as their readability on future equipment, or even on the same equipment at a future time, is not assured, even under the assumption that the discs will not degrade at all.\n\n[[File:CDgroove.jpg|thumb|right|Photomicrograph of the groove in a CD-R disc]]\nThe polycarbonate disc contains a spiral groove, called the \"pregroove\" (because it is molded in before data are written to the disc), to guide the [[laser]] beam upon writing and reading information. The pregroove is molded into the top side of the polycarbonate disc, where the pits and lands would be molded if it were a pressed (nonrecordable) Red Book CD; the bottom side, which faces the laser beam in the player or drive, is flat and smooth. The polycarbonate disc is coated on the pregroove side with a very thin layer of organic dye. Then, on top of the dye is coated a thin, reflecting layer of [[silver]], a silver [[alloy]], or [[gold]]. Finally, a protective coating of a photo-polymerizable lacquer is applied on top of the metal reflector and cured with [[ultraviolet|UV]]-light.\n\nA blank CD-R is not \"empty\"; the pregroove has a wobble (the [[Absolute Time in Pregroove|ATIP]]), which helps the writing laser to stay on track and to write the data to the disc at a constant rate. Maintaining a constant rate is essential to ensure proper size and spacing of the pits and lands burned into the dye layer. As well as providing timing information, the ATIP (absolute time in pregroove) is also a data track containing information about the CD-R manufacturer, the dye used and media information (disc length and so on). The pregroove is not destroyed when the data are written to the CD-R, a point which some [[copy protection]] schemes use to distinguish copies from an original CD.\n\n{{anchor|dyes}}\nThere are three basic formulations of dye used in CD-Rs:\n# [[Cyanine]] dye CD-Rs were the earliest ones developed, and their formulation is [[patent]]ed by [[Taiyo Yuden]]. CD-Rs based on this dye are mostly green in color. The earlier models were very chemically unstable and this made cyanine based discs unsuitable for archival use; they could fade and become unreadable in a few years. Many manufacturers like Taiyo Yuden use proprietary chemical additives to make more stable cyanine discs (\"metal stabilized Cyanine\", \"Super Cyanine\"). Older cyanine dye based CD-Rs, as well as all the hybrid dyes based on cyanine, were very sensitive to UV-rays and could have become unreadable after only a few days if they were exposed to direct sunlight. Although the additives used have made cyanine more stable, it is still the most sensitive of the dyes in UV rays (showing signs of degradation within a week of direct sunlight exposure). A common mistake users make is to leave the CD-Rs with the \"clear\" (recording) surface upwards, in order to protect it from scratches, as this lets the sun hit the recording surface directly.\n# [[Phthalocyanine]] dye CD-Rs are usually silver, gold or light green. The patents on phthalocyanine CD-Rs are held by [[Mitsui]] and [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals]]. Phthalocyanine is a natively stable dye (has no need for stabilizers) and CD-Rs based on this are often given a rated lifetime of hundreds of years. Unlike [[cyanine]], phthalocyanine is less resistant to UV rays and CD-Rs based on this dye show signs of degradation only after two weeks of direct sunlight exposure.{{Clarify|date=April 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} However, phthalocyanine is more sensitive than cyanine to writing laser power calibration, meaning that the power level used by the writing laser has to be more accurately adjusted for the disc in order to get a good recording; this may erode the benefits of dye stability, as marginally written discs (with higher correctable error rates) will lose data (i.e. have uncorrectable errors) after less dye degradation than well written discs (with lower correctable error rates).\n# [[Azo dye]] CD-Rs are dark blue in color, and their formulation is patented by [[Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation]]. Azo dyes are also chemically stable, and Azo CD-Rs are typically rated with a lifetime of decades. Azo is the most resistant dye against UV light and begins to degrade only after the third or fourth week of direct sunlight exposure. More modern implementations of this kind of dye include Super Azo which is not as deep blue as the earlier Metal Azo. This change of composition was necessary in order to achieve faster writing speeds.\n\nThere are many hybrid variations of the dye formulations, such as [[Formazan]] by [[Kodak]] (a hybrid of cyanine and phthalocyanine).\n\nUnfortunately, many manufacturers have added additional coloring to disguise their unstable cyanine CD-Rs in the past, so the formulation of a disc cannot be determined based purely on its color. Similarly, a gold reflective layer does not guarantee use of phthalocyanine dye. The quality of the disc is also not only dependent on the dye used, it is also influenced by sealing, the top layer, the reflective layer, and the polycarbonate. Simply choosing a disc based on its dye type may be problematic. Furthermore, correct power calibration of the laser in the writer, as well as correct timing of the laser pulses, stable disc speed, and so on, is critical to not only the immediate readability but the longevity of the recorded disc, so for archiving it is important to have not only a high quality disc but a high quality writer. In fact, a high quality writer may produce adequate results with medium quality media, but high quality media cannot compensate for a mediocre writer, and discs written by such a writer cannot achieve their maximum potential archival lifetime.\n\n==Speed==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Data writing speed\n!Data writing rate\n!Write time for 80 minute/700&nbsp;MiB CD-R\n|-\n|1\u00d7||150 [[Kilobyte|kB]]/s||80 minutes\n|-\n|2\u00d7||300 kB/s||40 minutes\n|-\n|4\u00d7||600 kB/s||20 minutes\n|-\n|8\u00d7||1.2 MB/s||10 minutes\n|-\n|12\u00d7||1.8 MB/s||7.5 minutes\n|-\n|16\u00d7||2.4 MB/s||5 minutes\n|-\n|20\u00d7||3.0 MB/s||4 minutes\n|-\n|24\u00d7||3.6 MB/s||3.4 minutes (see below)\n|-\n|32\u00d7||4.8 MB/s||2.5 minutes (see below)\n|-\n|40\u00d7||6.0 MB/s||2 minutes (see below)\n|-\n|48\u00d7||7.2 MB/s||1.7 minutes (see below)\n|-\n|52\u00d7||7.8 MB/s||1.5 minutes (see below)\n|}\n\nThese times only include the actual optical writing pass over the disc.  For most disc recording operations, additional time is used for overhead processes, such as organizing the files and tracks, which adds to the theoretical minimum total time required to produce a disc.  (An exception might be making a disc from a prepared ISO image, for which the overhead would likely be trivial.)  At the lowest write speeds, this overhead takes so much less time than the actual disc writing pass that it may be negligible, but at higher write speeds, the overhead time becomes a larger proportion of the overall time taken to produce a finished disc and may add significantly to it.\n\nAlso, above 20\u00d7 speed, drives use a [[Constant linear velocity#Zoned Constant Linear Velocity|Zoned-CLV]] or CAV strategy, where the advertised maximum speed is only reached near the outer rim of the disc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdspeed2000.com/faq.html#4 |title=Explanation of CLV, CAV, P-CAV and Z-CLV with diagrams |publisher=Cdspeed2000.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref> This is not taken into account by the above table.  (If this were not done, the faster rotation that would be required at the inner tracks could cause the disc to fracture and/or could cause excessive vibration which would make accurate and successful writing impossible.)\n\n==Writing methods==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe blank disc has a pre-groove track onto which the data are written. The pre-groove track, which also contains timing information, ensures that the recorder follows the same spiral path as a conventional CD. A [[CD recorder]] writes data to a CD-R disc by pulsing its laser to heat areas of the organic dye layer. The writing process does not produce indentations (pits); instead, the heat permanently changes the optical properties of the dye, changing the reflectivity of those areas. Using a low laser power, so as not to further alter the dye, the disc is read back in the same way as a CD-ROM. However, the reflected light is modulated not by pits, but by the alternating regions of heated and unaltered dye.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: CD-Recordable|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=31|quote=In actual CDs, pits carved into the surface of the CD are read by the laser in the CD-ROM drive. CD-Recordables, or CD-Rs, simulate the pits by putting ink spots on the CD.}}</ref> The change of the intensity of the reflected laser radiation is transformed into an electrical signal, from which the digital information is recovered (\"decoded\"). Once a section of a CD-R is written, it cannot be erased or rewritten, unlike a [[CD-RW]]. A CD-R can be recorded in multiple sessions.\nA [[CD recorder]] can write to a CD-R using several methods including:\n# [[Disc At Once]] \u2013 the whole CD-R is written in one session with no gaps and the disc is \"closed\" meaning no more data can be added and the CD-R effectively becomes a standard read-only CD. With no gaps between the tracks the Disc At Once format is useful for \"live\" audio recordings.\n# [[Track At Once]] \u2013 data are written to the CD-R one track at a time but the CD is left \"open\" for further recording at a later stage. It also allows data and audio to reside on the same CD-R.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalexpressmastering.com/mastering/|title=Audio Mastering Is Now Possible|last=|first=|date=|website=digitalexpressmastering.com|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522224807/http://digitalexpressmastering.com/mastering/|archive-date=2014-05-22|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref>\n# [[Packet Writing]] \u2013 used to record data to a CD-R in \"packets\", allowing extra information to be appended to a disc at a later time, or for information on the disc to be made \"invisible\". In this way, CD-R can emulate CD-RW; however, each time information on the disc is altered, more data has to be written to the disc. There can be compatibility issues with this format and some CD drives.\n\nWith careful examination, the written and unwritten areas can be distinguished by the naked eye. CD-Rs are written from the center outwards, so the written area appears as an inner band with slightly different shading.\n\n==Lifespan==\nReal-life (not accelerated aging) tests have revealed that some CD-Rs degrade quickly even if stored normally.<ref>{{cite web | work=myce.com| url=http://www.myce.com/news/cd-recordable-discs-unreadable-in-less-than-two-years-6450 | title=CD-R Unreadable in Less Than Two Years| accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pc-active.nl/toonArtikel.asp?artikelID=508 | work = PC-Active.com via archive.org | accessdate = 2007-02-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050309065410/http://www.pc-active.nl/toonArtikel.asp?artikelID=508 | archivedate = 2005-03-09 | title = CD-R's binnen twee jaar onleesbaar; Steekproef levert verontrustende resultaten op |trans-title=CD-Rs within two years unreadable; Sample produces troubling results | language = Dutch | date = August 19, 2003 | first = Jeroen | last = Horlings }}</ref> The quality of a CD-R disc has a large and direct influence on longevity\u2014low quality discs should not be expected to last very long.

Instead they are sourced from different manufacturers of varying quality. For best results, the actual manufacturer and material components of each batch of discs should be verified.\n\n[[File:CD-R with degraded dye - 20080220.jpg|thumb|225px|An example of a CD-R burned in 2000 showing dye degradation in 2008. Part of the data on it has been lost.]]Burned CD-Rs suffer from material degradation, just like most writable media. CD-R media have an internal layer of dye used to store data. In a [[CD-RW]] disc, the recording layer is made of an alloy of silver and other metals\u2014indium, antimony, and tellurium.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.imation.com/products/cd-r_media/la_cdrw_technology.html | title=CD-R & CD-RW Media Technology Primer| work=imation.com| accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> In CD-R media, the dye itself can degrade, causing data to become unreadable.\n\nAs well as degradation of the [[dye]], failure of a CD-R can be due to the reflective surface. While [[silver]] is less expensive and more widely used, it is more prone to [[oxidation]] resulting in a non-reflecting surface. [[Gold]] on the other hand, although more expensive and no longer widely used, is an inert material, so gold-based CD-Rs do not suffer from this problem. Manufacturers have estimated the longevity of gold-based CD-Rs to be as high as 100 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delkin.com/i-5937134-archival-gold-cd-r-300-year-disc-binder-of-10-discs-with-scratch-armor-surface.html|title=Archival Gold CD-R \"300 Year Disc\" Binder of 10 Discs with Scratch Armor Surface|work=[[Internet Archive]]|archivedate=September 27, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927170900/http://delkin.com/i-5937134-archival-gold-cd-r-300-year-disc-binder-of-10-discs-with-scratch-armor-surface.html }}</ref>\n\n==Labeling==\nIt is recommended if using adhesive-backed paper labels that the labels be specially made for CD-Rs. A balanced CD vibrates only slightly when rotated at high speed. Bad or improperly made labels, or labels applied off-center, unbalance the CD and can cause it to vibrate when it spins, which causes read errors and even risks damaging the drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dpfwiw.com/cd-r.htm |title=CD-R Labeling |publisher=Dpfwiw.com |date=2004-07-27 |accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref>\n\nA professional alternative to CD labels is pre-printed CDs using a 5-color silkscreen or offset press. Using a permanent marker pen is also a common practice. However, solvents from such pens can affect the dye layer.\n\n==Disposal==\n\n===Data confidentiality===\nSince CD-Rs in general cannot be logically erased to any degree, the disposal of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave oven for 10\u201315 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the microwave oven. Many office paper shredders are also designed to shred CDs.\n\nSome recent burners (Plextor, LiteOn) support erase operations on -R media, by \"overwriting\" the stored data with strong laser power, although the erased area cannot be overwritten with new data.\n\n===Recycling===\nThe polycarbonate material and possible gold or silver in the reflective layer would make CD-Rs highly recyclable. However, the polycarbonate is of very little value and the quantity of precious metals is so small that it is not profitable to recover them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obviously.com/recycle/guides/hard.html |title=The Consumer Recycling Guide: Recycling More Obscure Materials (toxics, batteries, mercury, computers, eyeglasses, foam peanuts) |publisher=Obviously.com |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref> Consequently, recyclers that accept CD-Rs typically do not offer compensation for donating or transporting the materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdrecyclingcenter.com/pages/suggested_programs |title=CD Recycling Center \u2013 Suggested_programs \u2013 CD and DVD Recycling |publisher=Cdrecyclingcenter.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greendisk.com/gdsite/pack-ITservices.aspx |title=GreenDisk [Technotrash Pack-IT&#93; |publisher=Greendisk.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Absolute Time In Pregroove]]\n* [[Blu-ray Disc]]\n* [[CD recorder]]\n* [[CD caddy|CD-R caddy]]\n* [[CD-ROM]], [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]]\n* [[DVD]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], [[DVD+R DL]]\n* [[HD DVD]]\n* [[Labelflash]]\n* [[LightScribe]]\n* [[MultiLevel Recording]], an obsolete technology (with non-binary modulation)\n* [[Optical disc authoring]]\n* [[Rainbow Books]]\n* [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[MIL-CD]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-394.htm ECMA-394: Recordable Compact Disc Systems CD-R Multi-Speed] (standardized Orange Book, Part II, Volume 2)\n* [http://www.cdrfaq.org/ The CD-R FAQ]\n* [http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa.htm Understanding CD-R & CD-RW] at the [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] site.\n\n{{Rainbow Books}}\n{{CD}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cd-R}}\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1988]]\n[[Category:Compact disc]]\n[[Category:Audio storage]]\n[[Category:Video storage]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]\n[[Category:Dutch inventions]]\n[[Category:Information technology in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Information technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]", "sha1": "8dbwtm8esazfpbeiaegbihtum67chlq"}}, {"title": "Cytosol", "ns": "0", "id": "6781", "revision": {"id": "861484631", "parentid": "855254669", "timestamp": "2018-09-27T19:22:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Sigmund2018", "id": "34749334"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Protein complexes */  Fix broken links", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Crowded cytosol.png|thumb|right|300px|The cytosol is a crowded solution of many different types of molecules that fills much of the volume of cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodsell DS |title=Inside a living cell |journal=Trends Biochem.

For example, the [[mitochondrial matrix]] separates the [[mitochondrion]] into many compartments.\n\nIn the [[eukaryotic cell]], the cytosol is surrounded by the [[cell membrane]] and is part of the [[cytoplasm]], which also comprises the mitochondria, [[plastid]]s, and other [[organelle]]s (but not their internal fluids and structures); the [[cell nucleus]] is separate. The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In [[prokaryotes]], most of the chemical reactions of [[metabolism]] take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the [[periplasmic space]]. In eukaryotes, while many [[metabolic pathway]]s still occur in the cytosol, others take place within organelles.\n\nThe cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although water forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of [[ion]]s such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] are different in the cytosol than in the [[extracellular fluid]]; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as [[osmoregulation]], [[cell signaling]], and the generation of [[action potentials]] in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of [[macromolecule]]s, which can alter how molecules behave, through [[macromolecular crowding]].\n\nAlthough it was once thought to be a simple solution of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include [[diffusion|concentration gradient]]s of small molecules such as [[calcium]], large complexes of [[enzyme]]s that act together and take part in [[metabolic pathway]]s, and [[protein complex]]es such as [[proteasome]]s and [[carboxysome]]s that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe term \"cytosol\" was first introduced in 1965 by H.

A person can be recognized or granted citizenship on a number of bases. Usually citizenship based on circumstances of birth is automatic, but in other cases an application may be required.\n\n* Citizenship by birth (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). If one or both of a person's parents are citizens of a given state, then the person may have the right to be a citizen of that state as well.{{efn|Examples: [[Philippine nationality law#Citizenship by birth|Philippines]],<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/article4.htm Article IV of the Philippine Constitution].</ref> [[Title 8 of the United States Code|United States]].<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-I 8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization]</ref>}} Formerly this might only have applied through the paternal line, but [[sex equality]] became common since the late twentieth century. Citizenship is granted based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]] and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in Europe. Where ''jus sanguinis'' holds, a person born outside a country, one or both of whose parents are citizens of the country, is also a citizen. States normally{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} limit the right to citizenship by descent to a certain number of generations born outside the state, although some do not.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} This form of citizenship is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.\n* Born within a country (''[[jus soli]]''). Some people are automatically citizens of the state in which they are born. This form of citizenship originated in [[England]] where those who were born within the realm were [[British subject#Prior to 1949|subjects of the monarch]] (a concept pre-dating citizenship) and is common in [[common law]] countries.\n** In many cases, both ''jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis'' hold citizenship either by place or parentage (or both).\n* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jus matrimonii]]''). Many countries fast-track naturalization based on the marriage of a person to a citizen. Countries which are destinations for such immigration often have regulations to try to detect [[sham marriage]]s, where a citizen marries a non-citizen typically for payment, without them having the intention of living together.<ref>[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/sham-marriage-bishops UK government Web site: Bishops act to tackle sham marriages - New UK Border Agency approved guidance for clergy should help prevent weddings for visas, 11 April 2011]</ref>\n* [[Naturalization]]. States normally grant citizenship to people who have entered the country legally and been granted permit to stay, or been granted [[political asylum]], and also lived there for a specified period. In some countries, naturalization is subject to conditions which may include passing a test demonstrating reasonable knowledge of the language or way of life of the host country, good conduct (no serious criminal record) and moral character (such as drunkenness, or gambling), vowing allegiance to their new state or its ruler and renouncing their prior citizenship. Some states allow [[dual citizenship]] and do not require naturalized citizens to formally renounce any other citizenship.\n* Citizenship by investment or [[Economic Citizenship]]. Wealthy people invest money in property or businesses, buy government bonds or simply donate cash directly, in exchange for citizenship and a passport. Whilst legitimate and usually limited in quota, the schemes are controversial. Costs for citizenship by investment range from as little as $100,000 (\u00a374,900) to as much as \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.19m)<ref>{{cite web |title=Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n* Excluded categories. In the past there have been exclusions on entitlement to citizenship on grounds such as skin color, ethnicity, sex, and free status (not being a [[slave]]). Most of these exclusions no longer apply in most places. Modern examples include some [[Arab countries]] which rarely grant citizenship to non-Muslims, e.g. [[Qatar]] is known for granting citizenship to foreign athletes, but they all have to profess the [[Islamic]] faith in order to receive citizenship. The United States grants citizenship to those born as a result of reproductive technologies, and internationally adopted children born after February 27, 1983. Some exclusions still persist for internationally adopted children born before February 27, 1983 even though their parents meet citizenship criteria.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of citizenship}}\n\n===Polis===\n{{Main article|Polis}}\nMany thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early [[city-state]]s of [[ancient Greece]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for humanity, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s.

After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ...

Inequality of status was widespread; citizens (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ''polit\u0113s'' < \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 'city') had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves, and resident foreigners ([[metic]]s).<ref name=tws2Y16/>{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one's everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of Egypt or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: \"To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!\" This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.\n\n===Roman ideas===\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], citizenship expanded from small-scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realized that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency, as it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.<ref>See [[Civis romanus sum]].</ref> Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that \"no one citizen should have too much power for too long\",<ref name=twsffujfk>{{Cite book\n  | last = Hosking\n  | first = Geoffrey\n  | title = Epochs of European Civilization: Antiquity to Renaissance\n  | publisher = The Modern Scholar via Recorded Books\n  | series = Lecture 5: Rome as a city-state\n  | year = 2005\n  | location = United Kingdom\n  | pages = tracks 1 through 9\n  | isbn =1-4025-8360-5}}</ref> but Rome offered relatively generous terms to its captives, including chances for lesser forms of citizenship.<ref name=twsffujfk/> If Greek citizenship was an \"emancipation from the world of things\",{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=35}} the Roman sense increasingly reflected the fact that citizens could act upon material things as well as other citizens, in the sense of buying or selling property, possessions, titles, goods. One historian explained:\n\n{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A.

Titles such as [[Burgher (title)|burgher]], [[grand burgher]] (German ''Gro\u00dfb\u00fcrger'') and [[bourgeoisie]] denoted political affiliation and identity in relation to a particular locality, as well as membership in a mercantile or trading class; thus, individuals of respectable means and socioeconomic status were interchangeable with citizens.\n\nDuring this era, members of the [[nobility]] had a range of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), though political upheavals and reforms, beginning most prominently with the [[French Revolution]], abolished privileges and created an egalitarian concept of citizenship.\n\n===Renaissance===\n <!-- linked from redirect [[Subject (monarchy)]] -->\n{{anchor|Subject}}\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.<ref name=tws2Y14/>{{rp|p.161}} Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} Membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}} The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept,<ref name=tws2Y12/> and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having [[rights]] and duties.<ref name=tws2Y12/>\n\n===Modern times===\nThe modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through \"elaborate systems of political representation at a distance\" such as [[representative democracy]].<ref name=tws2Y17/> Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.<ref name=tws2Y17/> Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.<ref name=tws2Y17/>\n\n====United States====\n[[File:DredScott.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Dred Scott, plaintiff in the infamous ''[[Dred Scott v.

The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on males of German (or so-called \"Aryan\") heritage who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. The Reich Citizenship Law of 1935 established [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial criteria for citizenship in the German Reich]], and because of this law Jews and others who could not prove \"German\" racial heritage were stripped of their citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nurmlaw3.html|title=The Nuremberg Laws: The Reich Citizenship Law (September 15, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. All women were to be conferred \"subject\" status upon birth, and could only obtain \"citizen\" status if they worked independently or if they married a German citizen (see [[women in Nazi Germany]]).\n\nThe final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights.\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.\n\nThe principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.\n\nThe young boy or girl who is of German nationality and is a subject of the German State is bound to complete the period of school education which is obligatory for every German. Thereby he submits to the system of training which will make him conscious of his race and a member of the folk-community. Then he has to fulfil all those requirements laid down by the State in regard to physical training after he has left school; and finally he enters the army. The training in the army is of a general kind. It must be given to each individual German and will render him competent to fulfil the physical and mental requirements of military service. The rights of citizenship shall be conferred on every young man whose health and character have been certified as good, after having completed his period of military service. This act of inauguration in citizenship shall be a solemn ceremony.\n\nAnd the diploma conferring the rights of citizenship will be preserved by the young man as the most precious testimonial of his whole life. It entitles him to exercise all the rights of a citizen and to enjoy all the privileges attached thereto. For the State must draw a sharp line of distinction between those who, as members of the nation, are the foundation and the support of its existence and greatness, and those who are domiciled in the State simply as earners of their livelihood there.\n\nOn the occasion of conferring a diploma of citizenship the new citizen must take a solemn oath of loyalty to the national community and the State. This diploma must be a bond which unites together all the various classes and sections of the nation. It shall be a greater honour to be a citizen of this Reich, even as a street-sweeper, than to be the King of a foreign State.\n\nThe citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State.\n\nThe German girl is a subject of the State but will become a citizen when she marries. At the same time those women who earn their livelihood independently have the right to acquire citizenship if they are German subjects.\"|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}\n\n==Different senses==\n[[File:Citizenship contrasting views.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Many theorists suggest that there are two opposing conceptions of citizenship: an economic one, and a political one.

The relation of citizenship has never been fixed or static, but constantly changes within each society. While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, and within societies over time, there are some common elements but they vary considerably as well. As a bond, citizenship extends beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds. It usually signifies membership in a political body. It is often based on, or was a result of, some form of military service or expectation of future service. It usually involves some form of political participation, but this can vary from token acts to active service in government. \n\nCitizenship is a status in society. It is an ideal state as well. It generally describes a person with legal rights within a given political order. It almost always has an element of exclusion, meaning that some people are not citizens, and that this distinction can sometimes be very important, or not important, depending on a particular society. Citizenship as a concept is generally hard to isolate intellectually and compare with related political notions, since it relates to many other aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, [[political freedom|freedom]], [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.<ref name=tws2Y14/> When there are many different groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination\u2014it is a \"broad bond\" linking \"a person with the state\" and gives people a universal identity as a legal member of a specific nation.<ref name=tws2Y15>{{Cite book\n  | last = Gross\n  | first = Feliks \n  | title = Citizenship and ethnicity: the growth and development of a democratic multiethnic institution\n  | publisher = Greenwood Press\n  | year = 1999\n  | location = Westport, Connecticut\n  | pages = xi, xii, xiii,4\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I6wM4X9UQ8QC&pg=PR8&dq=%22history+of+citizenship%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=h4YhT_b0Mcbl0gHF9MH_CA&ved=0CF0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22history%20of%20citizenship%22&f=false\n  | isbn = 0-313-30932-9\n  | jfm = }}</ref>\n\nModern citizenship has often been looked at as two competing underlying ideas:<ref name=tws2Y18>{{Cite book\n  | last = Beiner (editor)\n  | first = Ronald\n  | title = Theorizing Citizenship\n  | publisher = State University of New York, Albany\n  | series = J.

As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:\n* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.\n* In some Commonwealth countries [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.\n* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions, such as in the defense departments, [[Governor-General]] or [[President]] or [[Prime Minister]].\n\nAlthough [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1949 because it declared itself a republic, Ireland is generally treated as if it were still a member. Legislation often specifically provides for equal treatment between Commonwealth countries and Ireland and refers to \"Commonwealth countries and Ireland\".<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/246/pdfs/uksi_20050246_en.pdf The Commonwealth Countries and Ireland (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendment) Order 2005]</ref> Ireland's citizens are not classified as foreign nationals in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nCanada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship. However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth.<ref>''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123.</ref> The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] of 1947 provided for a distinct Canadian Citizenship, automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada, with some exceptions, and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[dominion]]s adopted this principle such as [[New Zealand]],  by way of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act of 1948.\n\n==Subnational==\nCitizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at the subnational level. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]] may impose requirements, of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as \"citizens\" of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]], from which follows citizenship of a [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]] and of the Confederation. Another example is [[\u00c5land]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsr\u00e4tt''.\n\nThe United States has a federal system in which a person is a citizen of their specific state of residence, such as [[New Jersey]] or [[California]], as well as a [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen of the United States]]. State [[constitution]]s may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the [[United States Constitution]] and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service; each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, and some states maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization.\n\n[[File:Diagram of citizenship.jpg|thumb|Diagram of relationship between; Citizens, Politicians + Laws]]\n\n==Education==\n{{Main article|Citizenship education (subject)}}\n\"[[Active citizenship]]\" is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public, volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, citizenship education is taught in schools, as an academic subject in some countries. By the time children reach secondary education there is an emphasis on such unconventional subjects to be included in academic curriculum. While the diagram on citizenship to the right is rather facile and depth-less, it is simplified to explain the general model of citizenship that is taught to many secondary school pupils. The idea behind this model within education is to instill in young pupils that their actions (i.e. their [[Election|vote]]) affect collective citizenship and thus in turn them.\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\nIt is taught in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). A new Leaving Certificate exam subject with the working title 'Politics & Society' is being developed by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] (NCCA) and is expected to be introduced to the curriculum sometime after 2012.<ref>http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nCitizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools in the [[United Kingdom]]. As well as teaching knowledge about [[democracy]], parliament, government, the justice system, [[human rights]] and the UK's relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.\n*Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11\u201316. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at [[GCSE]] and [[A level]]. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in citizenship to parents.<ref name=dfes>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/citizenship/\n|title=National curriculum\n|publisher=British Government, Department for Children, Schools and Families\n|accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref>\n*In [[Wales]] the model used is [[Personal and Social Education]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://new.wales.gov.uk/publications/circular/circulars03/NAFWC132003?lang=en\n|title= NAFWC 13/2003 Personal and Social Education (PSE) and Work-Related Education (WRE) in the Basic Curriculum.

However they do teach a subject called \"Modern Studies\" which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.msa-scotland.co.uk/\n|title=Modern Studies Association\n|accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref>\n*Citizenship is taught as a standalone subject in all state [[Education in Northern Ireland|schools in Northern Ireland]] and most other schools in some forms from year 8 to 10 prior to [[GCSEs]]. Components of Citizenship are then also incorporated into GCSE courses such as 'Learning for Life and Work'.\n\n==Criticism of citizenship education in schools==\nThere are two kinds of criticism of citizenship education in schools. Firstly, some philosophers of education argue that most governments and mainstream policies stimulate and advocate questionable approaches of citizenship education. These approaches aim to develop specific dispositions in students, dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship and education should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. Therefore, it requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education.<ref name=\"Van der Ploeg & Gu\u00e9rin\">Van der Ploeg, P.A. & L.J.F. Gu\u00e9rin (2016) Questioning Participation and Solidarity as Goals of Citizenship Education.

They suggest that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instill in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact.<ref name=Greenberg>Greenberg, D.

Development of this culture was agricultural villages during the pre-Classic period with city building during the Classic as social stratification became more complex. The Mayans built cities on the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] and west into [[Guatemala]]. In Chiapas, Mayan sites are concentrated along the state's borders with [[Tabasco]] and Guatemala, near Mayan sites in those entities. Most of this area belongs to the [[Lacandon Jungle]].<ref name=\"rincones2930\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 29\u201330.</ref>\n\nMayan civilization in the Lacandon area is marked by rising exploitation of rain forest resources, rigid social stratification, fervent local identity, waging war against neighboring peoples.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> At its height, it had large cities, a writing system, and development of scientific knowledge, such as mathematics and astronomy. Cities were centered on large political and ceremonial structures elaborately decorated with murals and inscriptions. Among these cities are [[Palenque]], [[Bonampak]], [[Yaxchilan]], [[Chinkultic]], [[Tonin\u00e1]] and Ten\u00f3n. The Mayan civilization had extensive trade networks and large markets trading in goods such as animal skins, [[indigo]], [[amber]], [[vanilla]] and [[quetzal]] feathers.<ref name=\"rincones2930\"/>  It is not known what ended the civilization but theories range from over population size, natural disasters, disease, and loss of natural resources through over exploitation or climate change.\n\nNearly all Mayan cities collapsed around the same time, 900{{nbsp}}CE. From then [[Pre-Columbian era|until 1500 CE]], social organization of the region fragmented into much smaller units and social structure became much less complex. There was some influence from the rising powers of central Mexico but two main indigenous groups emerged during this time, the Zoques and the various Mayan descendents. The Chiapans, for whom the state is named, migrated into the center of the state during this time and settled around Chiapa de Corzo, the old Mixe\u2013Zoque stronghold.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> There is evidence that the [[Aztec]]s appeared in the center of the state around Chiapa de Corza in the 15th{{nbsp}}century, but were unable to displace the native Chiapa tribe. However, they had enough influence so that the name of this area and of the state would come from [[Nahuatl]].<ref name=\"historycom\"/>\n\n===Colonial period===\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of Chiapas}}\n[[File:ChiapadeCorzoFuenteColonial.jpg|thumbnail|The Royal Crown centered in the main plaza of [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]] built in 1562.]]\nWhen the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, they found the indigenous peoples divided into Mayan and non-Mayan, with the latter dominated by the [[Zoque people|Zoques]] and [[Chiapa people|Chiapa]].<ref name=\"enchis\"/> The first contact between Spaniards and the people of Chiapas came in 1522, when [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] sent tax collectors to the area after Aztec Empire was subdued. The first military incursion was headed by Luis Mar\u00edn, who arrived in 1523. For three years, Mar\u00edn was able to subjugate a number of the local peoples, but met with fierce resistance from the [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzils]] in the highlands. The Spanish colonial government then sent a new expedition under [[Diego de Mazariegos]]. Mazariegos had more success than his predecessor, but many indigenes preferred to commit suicide rather than submit to the Spanish. One famous example of this is the [[Battle of Tepetchia]], where many jumped to their deaths in the [[Sumidero Canyon]].<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"jrodriguez\"/>\n\nIndigenous resistance was weakened by continual warfare with the Spaniards as well as disease, and by 1530, almost all of the indigenous peoples of the area had been subdued with the exception of the [[Lakandon Ch'ol|Lacandons]] in the deep jungles who actively resisted until 1695.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"historycom\"/><ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> However, the main two groups, the Tzotzils and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltals]] of the central highlands were subdued enough to establish the first Spanish city, today called [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]], in 1528. It was one of two settlements initially called Villa Real de Chiapa de los Espa\u00f1oles and the other called Chiapa de los Indios.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"jrodriguez\"/>\n\n[[File:RemnantPaintCupolaSanMarcosTuxtla.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Remnants of frescos at the Saint Mark Cathedral of [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]]]]\nSoon after, the [[encomienda]] system was introduced, which reduced most of the indigenous population to serfs and many even as slaves, paid as a form of tribute. The [[conquistador]]s brought previously unknown diseases. This, as well as overwork on plantations, dramatically decreased the indigenous population.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> The Spanish also established missions, mostly under the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], with the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Crist\u00f3bal de Las Casas|Diocese of Chiapas]] established in 1538 by [[Pope Paul III]].<ref name=\"jrodriguez\"/> The Dominican evangelizers became early advocates of the indigenous' plight, with [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] winning a battle with the passing of a law in 1542 for their protection. This order also worked to make sure that communities would keep their indigenous name with a saint's prefix leading to names such as [[Chamula|San Juan Chamula]] and [[Zinacant\u00e1n|San Lorenzo Zinacant\u00e1n]]. He also advocated adapting the teaching of Christianity to indigenous language and culture. The encomienda system that had perpetrated much of the abuse of the indigenous peoples fell away by the end of the 16th century, and was replaced by [[hacienda]]s. However, the use and misuse of Indian labor remained a large part of Chiapas politics into modern times.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"jrodriguez\"/> This treatment and tribute payments would create an undercurrent of resentment in the indigenous population that passed on from generation to generation. One uprising against high tribute payments occurs in the Tzeltal communities in the Los Alto region in 1712. Soon, the Tzoltzils and Ch'ols joined the Tzeltales in rebellion, but within a year, the government was able to extinguish the rebellion.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/>\n\nAs of 1778, [[Thomas Kitchin]] described Chiapas as \"the metropolis of the original Mexicans,\" with a population of approximately 20,000, and consisting mainly of indigenous peoples.<ref name=Kitchin>{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R.

Livestock such as cattle, horses and sheep were introduced as well. Regions would specialize in certain crops and animals depending on local conditions and for many of these regions, communication and travel were difficult.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> Most Europeans and their descendents tended to concentrate in cities such as [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas|Ciudad Real]], [[Comit\u00e1n]], [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa]] and [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez|Tuxtla]]. Intermixing of the races was prohibited by colonial law but by the end of the 17th century there was a significant [[mestizo]] population. Added to this was a population of [[Afro-Mexican|African slaves brought in by the Spanish]] in the middle of the 16th century due to the loss of native workforce.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"rincones3031\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nInitially, \"Chiapas\" referred to the first two cities established by the Spanish in what is now the center of the state and the area surrounding them. Two other regions were also established, the [[Soconusco]] and Tuxtla, all under the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|regional colonial government of Guatemala]]. Chiapas, Soconusco and Tuxla regions were united to the first time as an ''intendencia'' during the [[Bourbon Reforms]] in 1790 as an administrative region under the name of Chiapas. However, within this intendencia, the division between Chiapas and Soconusco regions would remain strong and have consequences at the end of the colonial period.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"rincones35\" />\n\n===Era of Independence===\nSince the colonial period, Chiapas had been relatively isolated from colonial authorities in Mexico City and regional authorities in Guatemala. One reason for this was the rugged terrain but the other was that much of Chiapas was not attractive to the Spanish for its lack of mineral wealth, large areas of arable land, and easy access to markets.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> This isolation spared it from battles related to Independence. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n]] did enter the city of [[Tonal\u00e1, Chiapas|Tonal\u00e1]] but incurred no resistance. The only other insurgent activity was the publication of a newspaper called ''El Pararrayos'' by Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas.<ref name=\"rincones31\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 31.</ref>\n\n[[File:ComitanDecIndependence.jpg|thumb|Comit\u00e1n's declaration of independence from 1823]]\n[[File:StateConstitution1824Tuxtla.jpg|thumb|Copy of the 1825 state constitution]]\n[[File:1856MapChiapasTuxtla.jpg|thumb|1856 map of the state]]\nFollowing the end of Spanish rule in [[New Spain]], it was unclear what new political arrangements would emerge. The isolation of Chiapas from centers of power, along with the strong internal divisions in the intendencia caused a political crisis after royal government collapsed in Mexico City in 1821, ending the [[Mexican War of Independence]].<ref name=\"enchis\"/> During this war, a group of influential Chiapas merchants and ranchers sought the establishment of the Free State of Chiapas. This group became known as the ''La Familia Chiapaneca''. However, this alliance did not last with the lowlands preferring inclusion among the new republics of [[Central America]] and the highlands annexation to Mexico.<ref name=\"higgens81\">Higgens, p. 81.</ref> In 1821, a number of cities in Chiapas, starting in Comit\u00e1n, declared the state's separation from the Spanish empire. In 1823, Guatemala became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]], which united to form a federal republic that would last from 1823 to 1839. With the exception of the pro-Mexican Ciudad Real (San Crist\u00f3bal) and some others, many Chiapanecan towns and villages favored a Chiapas independent of Mexico and some favored unification with Guatemala.\n\nElites in highland cities pushed for incorporation into Mexico.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> In 1822, then Emperor [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] decreed that Chiapas was part of Mexico. In 1823, the Junta General de Gobierno was held and Chiapas declared independence again.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> In July 1824, the Soconusco District of southwestern Chiapas split off from Chiapas, announcing that it would join the Central American Federation.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> In September of the same year, a referendum was held on whether the intendencia would join Central America or Mexico, with many of the elite endorsing union with Mexico. This referendum ended in favor of incorporation with Mexico (allegedly through manipulation of the elite in the highlands), but the [[Soconusco]] region maintained a neutral status until 1842, when Oaxacans under General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] occupied the area, and declared it reincorporated into Mexico. Elites of the area would not accept this until 1844.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"higgens81\"/><ref name=\"rincones32\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 32.</ref> Guatemala would not recognize Mexico's annexation of the Soconusco region until 1895 even though a final border between Chiapas and the country was finalized until 1882.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"rincones32\"/> The State of Chiapas was officially declared in 1824, with its first constitution in 1826. Ciudad Real was renamed San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas in 1828.<ref name=\"rincones35\"/>\n\nIn the decades after the official end of the war, the provinces of Chiapas and Soconusco unified, with power concentrated in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas. The state's society evolved into three distinct spheres: indigenous peoples, mestizos from the farms and haciendas and the Spanish colonial cities. Most of the political struggles were between the latter two groups especially over who would control the indigenous labor force. Economically, the state lost one of its main crops, indigo, to synthetic dyes. There was a small experiment with democracy in the form of \"open city councils\" but it was short lived because voting was heavily rigged.<ref name=\"enchis\"/>\n\nThe Universidad Pontificia y Literaria de Chiapas was founded in 1826, with Mexico's second teacher's college founded in the state in 1828.<ref name=\"enchis\"/>\n\n===Era of the Liberal Reform===\nWith the ouster of conservative [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], Mexican liberals came to power. The [[War of the Reform|Reform War]] (1858\u20131861) fought between Liberals, who favored federalism and sought economic development, decreased power of the Roman Catholic Church, and Mexican army, and Conservatives, who favored centralized autocratic government, retention of elite privileges, did not lead to any military battles in the state. Despite that it strongly affected Chiapas politics.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> In Chiapas, the Liberal-Conservative division had its own twist. Much of the division between the highland and lowland ruling families was for whom the Indians should work for and for how long as the main shortage was of labor.<ref name=\"higgens84\">Higgens, p. 84.</ref> These families split into Liberals in the lowlands, who wanted further reform and Conservatives in the highlands who still wanted to keep some of the traditional colonial and church privileges.<ref name=\"higgens85\">Higgens, p. 85.</ref> For most of the early and mid 19th century, Conservatives held most of the power and were concentrated in the larger cities of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, Chiapa (de Corzo), Tuxtla and Comit\u00e1n. As Liberals gained the upper hand nationally in the mid-19th century, one Liberal politician \u00c1ngel Albino Corzo gained control of the state. Corzo became the primary exponent of Liberal ideas in the southeast of Mexico and defended the Palenque and [[Pichucalco]] areas from annexation by Tabasco. However, Corzo's rule would end in 1875, when he opposed the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]].<ref name=\"enchis\"/>\n\nLiberal land reforms would have negative effects on the state's indigenous population unlike in other areas of the country. Liberal governments expropriated lands that were previously held by the [[Spanish Crown]] and [[Catholic Church]] in order to sell them into private hands. This was not only motivated by ideology, but also due to the need to raise money. However, many of these lands had been in a kind of \"trust\" with the local indigenous populations, who worked them. Liberal reforms took away this arrangement and many of these lands fell into the hands of large landholders who when made the local Indian population work for three to five days a week just for the right to continue to cultivate the lands. This requirement caused many to leave and look for employment elsewhere. Most became \"free\" workers on other farms, but they were often paid only with food and basic necessities from the farm shop. If this was not enough, these workers became indebted to these same shops and then unable to leave.<ref name=\"higgens8283\">Higgens, p. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe opening up of these lands also allowed many whites and mestizos (often called Ladinos in Chiapas) to encroach on what had been exclusively indigenous communities in the state. These communities had had almost no contact with the Ladino world, except for a priest. The new Ladino landowners occupied their acquired lands as well as others, such as shopkeepers, opened up businesses in the center of Indian communities. In 1848, a group of [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltals]] plotted to kill the new mestizos in their midst, but this plan was discovered, and was punished by th removal of large number of the community's male members. The changing social order had severe negative effects on the indigenous population with alcoholism spreadings, leading to more debts as it was expensive.<ref name=\"higgens84\"/> The struggles between Conservatives and Liberals nationally disrupted commerce and confused power relations between Indian communities and Ladino authorities. It also resulted in some brief respites for Indians during times when the instability led to uncollected taxes.<ref name=\"higgens86\">Higgens, p. 86.</ref>\n\nOne other effect that Liberal land reforms had was the start of coffee plantations, especially in the [[Soconusco]] region. One reason for this push in this area was that Mexico was still working to strengthen its claim on the area against Guatemala's claims on the region. The land reforms brought colonists from other areas of the country as well as foreigners from England, the United States and France. These foreign immigrants would introduce coffee production to the areas, as well as modern machineray and professional administration of coffee plantations. Eventually, this production of coffee would become the state's most important crop.<ref name=\"martineztorres\"/>\n\nAlthough the Liberals had mostly triumphed in the state and the rest of the country by the 1860s, Conservatives still held considerable power in Chiapas. Liberal politicians sought to solidify their power among the indigenous groups by weakening the Roman Catholic Church. The more radical of these even allowed indigenous groups the religious freedoms to return to a number of native rituals and beliefs such as pilgrimages to natural shrines such as mountains and waterfalls.<ref name=\"higgens8788\">Higgens, p. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nThis culminated in the Chiapas \"caste war\", which was an uprising the [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzils]] beginning in 1868.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"higgens88\">Higgens, p. 88.</ref> The basis of the uprising was the establishment of the \"three stones cult\" in Tzajahemal.<ref name=\"higgens88\"/> [[Agustina G\u00f3mez Checheb]] was a girl tending her father's sheep when three stones fell from the sky. Collecting them, she put them on her father's altar and soon claimed that the stone communicated with her. Word of this soon spread and the \"talking stones\" of Tzajahemel soon became a local indigenous pilgrimage site. The cult was taken over by one pilgrim, [[Pedro D\u00edaz Cuzcat]], who also claimed to be able to communicate with the stones, and had knowledge of Catholic ritual, becoming a kind of priest. However, this challenged the traditional Catholic faith and non Indians began to denounce the cult.<ref name=\"higgens80\">Higgens, p. 80.</ref> Stories about the cult include embellishments such as the [[crucifixion]] of a young Indian boy.<ref name=\"higgens81\"/>\n\nThis led to the arrest of Checheb and Cuzcat in December 1868. This caused resentment among the Tzotzils. Although the Liberals had earlier supported the cult, Liberal landowners had also lost control of much of their Indian labor and Liberal politicians were having a harder time collecting taxes from indigenous communities.<ref name=\"higgens8990\">Higgens, p. 89\u201390.</ref> An Indian army gathered at Zontehuitz then attacked various villages and haciendas.<ref name=\"rincones32\"/> By the following June the city of San Crist\u00f3bal was surrounded by several thousand Indians, who offered the exchanged of several Ladino captives for their religious leaders and stones.<ref name=\"higgens90\">Higgens, p. 90.</ref> Chiapas governor Domingu\u00e9z come to San Crist\u00f3bal with about three hundred heavily armed men, who then attacked the Indian force armed only with sticks and [[machete]]s.<ref name=\"higgens91\">Higgens, p. 91.</ref> The indigenous force was quickly dispersed and routed with government troops pursuing pockets of guerrilla resistance in the mountains until 1870. The event effectively returned control of the indigenous workforce back to the highland elite.<ref name=\"rincones32\"/><ref name=\"higgens9192\">Higgens, p. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n===Porfiriato, 1876-1911===\nThe [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] era at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th was initially thwarted by regional bosses called [[cacique]]s, bolstered by a wave of Spanish and mestizo farmers who migrated to the state and added to the elite group of wealthy landowning families.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> There was some technological progress such as a highway from San Crist\u00f3bal to the Oaxaca border and the first telephone line in the 1880s, but Porfirian era economic reforms would not begin until 1891 with Governor [[Emilio Rabasa]].<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"rincones32\"/> This governor took on the local and regional caciques and centralized power into the state capital, which he moved from San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas to Tuxtla in 1892.<ref name=\"rincones32\"/><ref name=\"higgens98\">Higgens, p. 98.</ref>  He modernized public administration, transportation and promoted education.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> Rabasa also introduced [[telegraph]], limited public schooling, sanitation and road construction, including a route from San Crist\u00f3bal to Tuxtla then Oaxaca, which signaled the beginning of favoritism of development in the central valley over the highlands.<ref name=\"higgens99\">Higgens, p. 99.</ref> He also changed state policies to favor foreign investment, favored large land mass consolidation for the production of cash crops such as henequen, rubber, guayule, cochineal and coffee.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"higgens96\">Higgens, p. 96.</ref> Agricultural production boomed, especially coffee, which induced the construction of port facilities in [[Tonal\u00e1, Chiapas|Tonal\u00e1]]. The economic expansion and investment in roads also increased access to tropical commodities such as hardwoods, rubber and [[chicle]].<ref name=\"higgens99\"/>\n\nThese still required cheap and steady labor to be provided by the indigenous population.<ref name=\"higgens99\"/> By the end of the 19th century, the four main indigenous groups, Tzeltals, Tzotzils, Tojolabals and Ch\u2019ols were living in \"reducciones\" or reservations, isolated from one another.<ref name=\"mhidalgo105\"/> Conditions on the farms of the Porfirian era was serfdom, as bad if not worse than for other indigenous and mestizo populations leading to the [[Mexican Revolution]]. While this coming event would affect the state, Chiapas did not follow the uprisings in other areas that would end the Porfirian era.<ref name=\"rincones3233\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[Japanese Mexican|Japanese immigration]] to Mexico began in 1897 when the first thirty five migrants arrived in Chiapas to work on coffee farms, so that Mexico was the first Latin American country to receive organized Japanese immigration.<ref name=\"MOFA\">{{cite web | author=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan | title=Japan-Mexico foreign relations | year=2012 | url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/data.html | publisher=MOFA | accessdate=October 22, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011193215/http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/data.html | archivedate=October 11, 2014 | df= }}</ref> Although this colony ultimately failed, there remains a small Japanese community in [[Acacoyagua]], Chiapas.\n\n===Early 20th century to 1960===\n\n[[File:Palacio de Gobierno de Chiapas en Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The Palace of Government of Chiapas (Governor's Office) at Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]]\n\n[[File:AtriumCongresoTuxla.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Palacio Legislativo (Legislative Palace) at Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]]\n\n[[File:SugarCaneMillTapachula.jpg|thumb|Sugar cane mill from Tapachula on display at the Regional Museum in Chiapas]]\n\nIn the early 20th century and into the [[Mexican Revolution]], the production of coffee was particularly important but labor-intensive. This would lead to a practice called ''enganche'' (hook), where recruiter would lure workers with advanced pay and other incentives such as alcohol and then trap them with debts for travel and other items to be worked off. This practice would lead to a kind of indentured servitude and uprisings in areas of the state, although they never led to large rebel armies as in other parts of Mexico.<ref name=\"martineztorres\"/>\n\nA small war broke out between [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]] and San Cristobal in 1911. San Crist\u00f3bal, allied with [[San Juan Chamula]], tried to regain the state's capital but the effort failed. San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, who had a very limited budget, to the extent that it had to ally with San Juan Chamula, and Tuxtla Gutierrez, which was enough only a small ragtag army to beat overwhelmingly the army helped by chamulas from San Crist\u00f3bal. There were three years of peace after that until troops allied with \"First Chief\" of the revolutionary Constitutionalist forces, [[Venustiano Carranza]], entered in 1914 taking over the government, with the aim of imposing the ''Ley de Obreros'' (Workers' Law) to address injustices against the state's mostly indigenous workers. Conservatives responded violently months later when they were certain the Carranza forces would take their lands. This was mostly by way of guerrilla actions headed by farm owners who called themselves the ''Mapaches''. This action continued for six years, until President Carranza was assassinated in 1920 and revolutionary general [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] became president of Mexico. This allowed the Mapaches to gain political power in the state and effectively stop many of the social reforms occurring in other parts of Mexico.\n\nThe Mapaches continued to fight against socialists and communists in Mexico from 1920 to 1936, to maintain their control over the state.<ref name=\"rincones35\"/> In general, elite landowners also allied with the nationally dominant party founded by [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] following the assassination of president-elect Obreg\u00f3n in 1928; that party was renamed the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] in 1946.  Through that alliance, they could block land reform in this way as well.<ref name=\"historycom\"/> The Mapaches were first defeated in 1925 when an alliance of socialists and former Carranza loyalists had Carlos A. Vidal selected as governor, although he was assassinated two years later. The last of the Mapache resistance was over come in the early 1930s by Governor Victorico Grajales, who pursued President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]]' social and economic policies including persecution of the Catholic Church. These policies would have some success in redistributing lands and organizing indigenous workers but the state would remain relatively isolated for the rest of the 20th{{nbsp}}century.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"rincones35\"/> The territory was reorganized into municipalities in 1916. The current state constitution was written in 1921.<ref name=\"enchis\"/>\n\nThere was political stability from the 1940s to the early 1970s; however, regionalism regained with people thinking of themselves as from their local city or municipality over the state. This regionalism impeded the economy as local authorities restrained outside goods. For this reason, construction of highways and communications were pushed to help with economic development. Most of the work was done around Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez and Tapachula. This included the Sureste railroad connecting northern municipalities such as Pichucalco, Salto de Agua, Palenque, [[Catazaj\u00e1]] and [[La Libertad, Chiapas|La Libertad]]. The Cristobal Colon highway linked Tuxtla to the Guatemalan border. Other highways included El Escopetazo to Pichucalco, a highway between San Crist\u00f3bal and Palenque with branches to Cuxtepeques and La{{nbsp}}Frailesca. This helped to integrate the state's economy, but it also permitted the political rise of communal land owners called ejidatarios.<ref name=\"enchis\"/>\n[[File:Lacanja burn crop.JPG|thumb|Area of the Lacandon Jungle burned to plant crops]]\n\n===Mid-20th century to 1990===\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the state experienced a significant rise in population, which outstripped local resources, especially land in the highland areas.<ref name=\"sspeed\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Shannon |editor1-last=Speed |others=Aida Hernandez Castillo and Lynne Stephen |title= Dissident Women : Gender and Cultural Politics in Chiapas |year=2006 |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |isbn= 0-292-71417-3 |pages=13\u201314 }}</ref> Since the 1930s, many indigenous and mestizos have migrated from the highland areas into the [[Lacandon Jungle]] with the populations of Altamirano, Las Margaritas, Ocosingo and Palenque rising from less than 11,000 in 1920 to over 376,000 in 2000. These migrants came to the jungle area to clear forest and grow crops and raise livestock, especially cattle.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"mhidalgo106\"/> Economic development in general raised the output of the state, especially in agriculture, but it had the effect of deforesting many areas, especially the Lacandon. Added to this was there were still serf like conditions for many workers and insufficient educational infrastructure. Population continued to increase faster than the economy could absorb<ref name=\"enchis\"/> There were some attempts to resettle peasant farmers onto non cultivated lands, but they were met with resistance. President [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] awarded a land grant to the town of Venustiano Carranza in 1967, but that land was already being used by cattle-ranchers who refused to leave. The peasants tried to take over the land anyway, but when violence broke out, they were forcibly removed.<ref name=\"Hamnett264\">Hamnett, p. 264.</ref> In Chiapas poor farmland and severe poverty afflict the Mayan Indians which led to unsuccessful non violent protests and eventually armed struggle started by the Zapatista National Liberation Army in January 1994.<ref>{{cite book|page=75|edition=|pages=|year=1997|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=Educators Progress Service.|others=Educators Progress Service|volume=|quote=|location=|title=Educators Guide to Free Guidance Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a5MrAQAAMAAJ&q=mayan+girls+chinese&dq=mayan+girls+chinese&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sDShVbyxJ4HtgwT585_4DQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAzgo|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThese events began to lead to political crises in the 1970s, with more frequent land invasions and takeovers of municipal halls.<ref name=\"enchis\"/><ref name=\"Hamnett264\"/> This was the beginning of a process that would lead to the emergence of the [[EZLN|Zapatista movement]] in the 1990s. Another important factor to this movement would be the role of the Catholic Church from the 1960s to the 1980s. In 1960, [[Samuel Ruiz]] became the bishop of the Diocese of Chiapas, centered in San Crist\u00f3bal. He supported and worked with [[Marist Brothers|Marist priests and nuns]] following an ideology called [[liberation theology]]. In 1974, he organized a statewide \"Indian Congress\" with representatives from the Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal and Ch'ol peoples from 327 communities as well as Marists and the [[Maoist People's Union]]. This congress was the first of its kind with the goal of uniting the indigenous peoples politically. These efforts were also supported by leftist organizations from outside Mexico, especially to form unions of [[ejido]] organizations. These unions would later form the base of the [[EZLN]] organization.<ref name=\"sspeed\"/> One reason for the Church's efforts to reach out to the indigenous population was that starting in the 1970s, a shift began from traditional Catholic affiliation to Protestant, Evangelical and other Christian sects.<ref name=\"mhidalgo108\"/>\n\nThe 1980s saw a large wave of refugees coming into the state from [[Central America]] as a number of these countries, especially [[Guatemala]], were in the midst of violent political turmoil. The Chiapas/Guatemala border had been relatively porous with people traveling back and forth easily in the 19th and 20th{{nbsp}}centuries, much like the Mexico/U.S. border around the same time. This is in spite of tensions caused by Mexico's annexation of the [[Soconusco]] region in the 19th{{nbsp}}century. The border between Mexico and Guatemala had been traditionally poorly guarded, due to diplomatic considerations, lack of resources and pressure from landowners who need cheap labor sources.<ref name=\"mgarcia46\">Garc\u00eda, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe arrival of thousands of refugees from Central America stressed Mexico's relationship with Guatemala, at one point coming close to war as well as a politically destabilized Chiapas. Although Mexico is not a signatory to the UN [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], international pressure forced the government to grant official protection to at least some of the refugees. Camps were established in Chiapas and other southern states, and mostly housed [[Mayan peoples]]. However, most Central American refugees from that time never received any official status, estimated by church and charity groups at about half a million from [[El Salvador]] alone.<ref name=\"mgarcia9\">Garc\u00eda, p. 9.</ref> The Mexican government resisted direct international intervention in the camps, but eventually relented somewhat because of finances.<ref name=\"mgarcia50\">Garc\u00eda, p. 50.</ref> By 1984, there were 92 camps with 46,000 refugees in Chiapas, concentrated in three areas, mostly near the Guatemalan border.<ref name=\"mgarcia52\">Garc\u00eda, p. 52.</ref> To make matters worse, the Guatemalan army conducted raids into camps on Mexican territories with significant casualties, terrifying the refugees and local populations.<ref name=\"mgarcia53\">Garc\u00eda, p. 53.</ref> From within Mexico, refugees faced threats by local governments who threatened to deport them, legally or not, and local paramilitary groups funded by those worried about the political situation in Central American spilling over into the state.<ref name=\"mgarcia54\">Garc\u00eda, p. 54.</ref> The official government response was to militarize the areas around the camps, which limited international access and migration into Mexico from Central America was restricted.<ref name=\"mgarcia56\">Garc\u00eda, p. 56.</ref> By 1990, it was estimated that there were over 200,000 Guatemalans and half a million from El Salvador, almost all peasant farmers and most under age twenty.<ref name=\"mgarcia45\">Garc\u00eda, p. 45.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the politization of the indigenous and rural populations of the state that began in the 1960s and 1970s continued. In 1980, several [[ejido]] (communal land organizations) joined to form the Union of Ejidal Unions and United Peasants of Chiapas, generally called the Union of Unions, or UU. It had a membership of 12,000 families from over 180 communities. By 1988, this organization joined with other to form the ARIC-Union of Unions (ARIC-UU) and took over much of the Lacandon Jungle portion of the state.<ref name=\"sspeed\"/> Most of the members of these organization were from Protestant and Evangelical sects as well as \"Word of God\" Catholics affiliated with the political movements of the Diocese of Chiapas. What they held in common was indigenous identity vis-\u00e0-vis the non-indigenous, using the old 19th century \"caste war\" word \"Ladino\" for them.<ref name=\"higgens81\"/><ref name=\"sspeed\"/><ref name=\"mhidalgo108\"/>\n\n===Neoliberalism and the EZLN===\nThe adoption of [[neoliberalism]] by the Mexican federal government clashed with the leftist political ideals of these groups, notably as the reforms began to have negative economic effects on poor farmers, especially small-scale indigenous coffee-growers. Opposition would coalesce into the [[EZLN|Zapatista movement]] in the 1990s.<ref name=\"sspeed\"/> Although the Zapatista movement couched its demands and cast its role in response to contemporary issues, especially in its opposition to neoliberalism, it operates in the tradition of a long line of peasant and indigenous uprisings that have occurred in the state since the colonial era. This is reflected in its indigenous vs. Ladino character.<ref name=\"higgens81\"/><ref name=\"Hamnett296\">Hamnett, p. 296.</ref> However, the movement was an economic one as well. Although the area has extensive resources, much of the local population of the state, especially in rural areas, did not benefit from this bounty. In the 1990s, two thirds of the state's residents did not have sewage service, only a third had electricity and half did not have potable water. Over half of the schools offered education only to the third grade and most pupils dropped out by the end of first grade.<ref name=\"mgarcia54\"/> Grievances, strongest in the San Crist\u00f3bal and [[Lacandon Jungle]] areas, were taken up by a small leftist guerrilla band led by a man called only \"[[Subcomandante Marcos]].\"<ref name=\"Hamnett297\">Hamnett, p. 297.</ref>\n\nThis small band, called the [[EZLN|Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, EZLN)]], came to the world's attention when on January 1, 1994 (the day the [[NAFTA]] treaty went into effect) EZLN forces occupied and took over the towns of [[San Cristobal de las Casas]], [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas|Las Margaritas]], [[Altamirano, Chiapas|Altamirano]], [[Ocosingo]] and three others. They read their proclamation of revolt to the world and then laid siege to a nearby military base, capturing weapons and releasing many prisoners from the jails.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> This action followed previous protests in the state in opposition to neoliberal economic policies.<ref name=\"kovic\"/>\n\nAlthough it has been estimated{{by whom|date=November 2016}} as having no more than 300 armed guerrilla members, the EZLN paralyzed the Mexican government, which balked at the political risks of direct confrontation.<ref name=\"Hamnett296\"/> The major reason for this was that the rebellion caught the attention of the national and world press, as Marcos made full use of the then-new Internet to get the group's message out, putting the spotlight on indigenous issues in Mexico in general. Furthermore, the opposition press in Mexico City, especially ''[[La Jornada]]'', actively supported the rebels. These factors encouraged the rebellion to go national.<ref name=\"Hamnett296297\">Hamnett, p. 296\u2013297.</ref> Many{{quantify|date=November 2016}} blamed the unrest on infiltration of leftists among the large Central American refugee population in Chiapas,<ref name=\"mgarcia55\">Garc\u00eda, p. 55.</ref> and the rebellion opened up splits in the countryside between those supporting and opposing the EZLN.<ref name=\"Hamnett296\"/> Zapatista sympathizers have included mostly Protestants and [[Word of God (community)|Word of God]] Catholics, opposing those \"traditionalist\" Catholics who practiced a syncretic form of Catholicism and indigenous beliefs. This split had existed in Chiapas since the 1970s, with the latter group supported by the [[cacique]]s and others in the traditional power-structure. Protestants and Word of God Catholics (allied directly with the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Crist\u00f3bal de Las Casas|bishopric in San Crist\u00f3bal]]) tended to oppose traditional power structures.<ref name=\"kovic\"/>\n\nThe Bishop of Chiapas, [[Samuel Ruiz]], and the Diocese of Chiapas reacted by offering to mediate between the rebels and authorities. However, because of this diocese's activism since the 1960s, authorities{{which|date=November 2016}} accused the clergy of being involved with the rebels.<ref name=\"mhidalgo112\">Hidalgo, p. 112.</ref>  There was some ambiguity about the relationship between Ruiz and Marcos and it was a constant feature of news coverage, with many in official circles using such to discredit Ruiz. Eventually, the activities of the Zapatistas began to worry the Roman Catholic Church in general and to upstage the diocese's attempts to re establish itself among Chiapan indigenous communities against Protestant evangelization. This would lead to a breach between the Church and the Zapatistas.<ref name=\"Hamnett296298\">Hamnett, p. 296\u2013298.</ref>\n\nThe Zapatista story remained in headlines for a number{{quantify|date=November 2016}} of years. One reason for this was the December 1997 massacre of forty-five Tzotzil peasants, mostly women and children in the Zapatista-controlled village of [[Acteal]] in the [[Chenhal\u00f3]] municipality just north of San Crist\u00f3bal. This allowed many media outlets in Mexico to step up their criticisms of the government.

It focussed more on trying to manipulate public opinion in order to obtain concessions from the government. This has linked the Zapatistas to other indigenous and [[identity politics|identity-politics]] movements that arose in the late-20th century.<ref name=\"mhidalgo113\">Hidalgo, p. 113.</ref> The main concession that the group received was the [[San Andr\u00e9s Accords]] (1996), also known as the Law on Indian Rights and Culture.<ref name=\"jrodriguez\"/> The Accords appear to grant certain indigenous zones autonomy, but this is against the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican constitution]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} so its legitimacy has been questioned.

This problem has been at crisis proportions since the 1970s, and the government's reaction has been to encourage peasant farmers\u2014mostly indigenous\u2014to migrate into the sparsely populated Lacandon Jungle, a trend since earlier in the century.<ref name=\"Hamnett296\"/>\n\nFrom the 1970s on, some 100,000 people set up homes in this rainforest area, with many being recognized as ''[[Ejido|ejidos]]'', or communal land-holding organizations.<ref name=\"Hamnett296\"/> These migrants included Tzeltals, Tojolabals, Ch'ols and mestizos, mostly farming corn and beans and raising livestock.

The Zapatistas support these actions as part of indigenous rights, but that has put them in conflict with international environmental groups and with the indigenous inhabitants of the rainforest area, the [[Lacandon people|Lacandons]]. Environmental groups state that the settlements pose grave risks to what remains of the Lacandon, while the Zapatistas accuse them of being fronts for the government, which wants to open the rainforest up to multinational corporations.<ref name=\"stevenson\"/><ref name=\"weinberg\"/> Added to this is the possibility that significant oil and gas deposits exist under this area.<ref name=\"martineztorres\"/>\n\nThe Zapatista movement has had some successes. The agricultural sector of the economy now favors ''[[Ejido|ejidos]]'' and other commonly-owned land.<ref name=\"enchis\"/> There have been some other gains economically as well. In the last decades of the 20th century, Chiapas's traditional agricultural economy has diversified somewhat with the construction of more roads and better infrastructure by the federal and state governments.

A significant percentage of PEMEX's drilling and refining takes place in Chiapas and Tabasco, and Chiapas produces fifty-five percent of Mexico's hydroelectric energy.<ref name=\"mgarcia54\"/>\n\nHowever, Chiapas remains one of the poorest states in Mexico. Ninety-four of its 111 municipalities have a large percentage of the population living in poverty. In areas such as Ocosingo, Altamirano and Las Margaritas, the towns where the Zapatistas first came into prominence in 1994, 48% of the adults are illiterate. Chiapas is still considered{{by whom|date=November 2016}} isolated and distant from the rest of Mexico, both culturally and geographically. It has significantly underdeveloped infrastructure compared to the rest of the country, and its significant indigenous population with isolationist tendencies keep the state distinct culturally.<ref name=\"rincones34\"/> Cultural stratification, neglect and lack of investment by the Mexican federal government has exacerbated this problem.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Political geography===\n{{main article|Municipalities of Chiapas}}\nChiapas is located in the south east of Mexico, bordering the states of [[Tabasco]], [[Veracruz]] and [[Oaxaca]] with the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south and [[Guatemala]] to the east.

The higher altitudes also have [[mesophile]] forests, oak/pine forests in the Los Altos, Northern Mountains and Sierra Madre and the extensive [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[mangrove]] wetlands along the coast.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nChiapas has about thirty percent of Mexico's fresh water resources. The Sierra Madre divides them into those that flow to the Pacific and those that flow to the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the first are short rivers and streams; most longer ones flow to the Gulf. Most Pacific side rivers do not drain directly into this ocean but into [[lagoon]]s and estuaries. The two largest rivers are the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and the [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]], with both part of the same system. The Grijalva has four dams built on it the Belisario Dominguez (La Angostura); Manuel Moreno Torres (Chicoas\u00e9n); Nezahualc\u00f3yotl (Malpaso); and Angel Albino Corzo (Pe\u00f1itas). The Usumacinta divides the state from Guatemala and is the longest river in [[Central America]]. In total, the state has {{convert|110,000|ha}} of surface waters, {{convert|260|km|abbr=on}} of coastline, control of {{convert|96,000|km2|abbr=on}} of ocean, {{convert|75,230|ha}} of estuaries and ten lake systems.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> Laguna Miramar is a lake in the Montes Azules reserve and the largest in the Lacandon Jungle at 40&nbsp;km in diameter. The color of its waters varies from [[indigo]] to [[emerald]] green and in ancient times, there were settlements on its islands and its caves on the shoreline. The Catazaj\u00e1 Lake is 28&nbsp;km north of the city of [[Palenque, Chiapas|Palenque]]. It is formed by rainwater captured as it makes it way to the Usumacinta River. It contains wildlife such as [[manatee]]s and [[iguana]]s and it is surrounded by rainforest. Fishing on this lake is an ancient tradition and the lake has an annual bass fishing tournament. The Welib J\u00e1 Waterfall is located on the road between Palenque and Bonampak.<ref name=\"zonasarq\"/>\n[[File:MalpasoDam02.JPG|left|thumb|Overlooking part of the Malpaso or Nezahualcoyotl Reservoir]]\nThe state has thirty-six protected areas at the state and federal levels along with 67 areas protected by various municipalities. The [[Sumidero Canyon National Park]] was decreed in 1980 with an extension of {{convert|21,789|ha}}. It extends over two of the regions of the state, the Central Depression and the Central Highlands over the municipalities of [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]], [[Nuevo Usumacinta]], [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[San Fernando, Chiapas|San Fernando]]. The [[Sumidero Canyon|canyon]] has steep and vertical sides that rise to up to 1000 meters from the river below with mostly tropical rainforest but some areas with [[xerophile]] vegetation such as cactus can be found. The river below, which has cut the canyon over the course of twelve million years, is called the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]].

Many Chiapanecans chose to throw themselves from the high edges of the canyon rather than be defeated by Spanish forces. Today, the canyon is a popular destination for [[ecotourism]]. Visitors often take boat trips down the river that runs through the canyon and enjoy the area's natural beauty including the many birds and abundant vegetation.<ref name=\"historycom\"/>\n\nThe [[Montes Azules Integral Biosphere Reserve]] was decreed in 1978. It is located in the northeast of the state in the [[Lacandon Jungle]]. It covers {{convert|331,200|ha}} in the municipalities of [[Maravilla Tenejapa]], [[Ocosingo]] and [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas|Las Margaritas]]. It conserves highland perennial rainforest. The jungle is in the Usumacinta River basin east of the Chiapas Highlands. It is recognized by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] for its global biological and cultural significance. In 1992, the {{convert|61,874|ha|adj=on}} Lacantun Reserve, which includes the Classic Maya archaeological sites of [[Yaxchilan]] and [[Bonampak]], was added to the biosphere reserve.<ref name=\"weinberg\"/><ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\n[[Agua Azul|Agua Azul Waterfall Protection Area]] is in the Northern Mountains in the municipality of [[Tumbal\u00e1]].

The rugged terrain encourages waterfalls with large pools at the bottom, that the falling water has carved into the sedimentary rock and limestone. Agua Azul is one of the best known in the state. The waters of the Agua Azul River emerge from a cave that forms a natural bridge of thirty meters and five small waterfalls in succession, all with pools of water at the bottom. In addition to Agua Azul, the area has other attractions&mdash;such as the Shumulj\u00e1 River, which contains rapids and waterfalls, the [[Misol H\u00e1]] Waterfall with a thirty-meter drop, the Bol\u00f3n Ajau Waterfall with a fourteen-meter drop, the Gallito Copet\u00f3n rapids, the Blacquiazules Waterfalls, and a section of calm water called the Agua Clara.<ref name=\"azulinsolito\">{{cite journal |date=March 2009 |title= Cascadas de Agua Azul |trans-title=Waterfalls of Agua Azul |journal=Insolito \u2013 Maravillas Naturales de M\u00e9xico |page=33 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Corporativeo Mina SA de CV |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nThe [[El Ocote Biosphere Reserve]] was decreed in 1982 located in the Northern Mountains at the boundary with the Sierra Madre del Sur in the municipalities of [[Ocozocoautla de Espinosa|Ocozocoautla]], [[Cintalapa]] and [[Tecpat\u00e1n]].

The [[Laguna B\u00e9lgica Conservation Zone]] is located in the north west of the state in the municipality of Ocozocoautla. It covers forty-two hectares centered on the B\u00e9lgica Lake. The El [[Zapotal Ecological Center]] was established in 1980.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> Nah\u00e1 \u2013 Metzabok is an area in the [[Lacandon Jungle]] whose name means \"place of the black lord\" in [[Nahuatl]]. It extends over {{convert|617.49|km2|abbr=on}} and in 2010, it was included in the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves]]. Two main communities in the area are called Nah\u00e1 and Metzabok.

This is particularly significant problem among the Tzeltals and Tzotzils. Starting in the 1970s, traditional leaders in San Juan Chamula began expelling dissidents from their homes and land, amounting to about 20,000 indigenous forced to leave over a thirty-year period.

Many Protestant Tzotzil have accused the Tzeltal of ethnic discrimination and intimidation due to their religious beliefs and the Tzeltal have in return accused the Tzotzil of singling them out for discrimination.\n\nClothing, especially women's clothing, varies by indigenous group. For example, women in Ocosingo tend to wear a blouse with a round collar embroidered with flowers and a black skirt decorated with ribbons and tied with a cloth belt. The Lacandon people tend to wear a simple white tunic. They also make a ceremonial tunic from [[amate|bark]], decorated with astronomy symbols.

Tzeltal Mayan, part of the Mayan language family, today is spoken by about 375,000 people making it the fourth-largest language group in Mexico. There are two main dialects; highland (or Oxchuc) and lowland (or Bachajonteco) .<ref name=\"jrodriguez\"/> This language, along with Tzotzil, is from the Tzeltalan subdivision of the Mayan language family.

Their hair is tied with ribbons and covered with a cloth. Most men do not use traditional attire.<ref name=\"rincones19\"/> Agriculture is the basic economic activity of the Tzeltal people. Traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n crops such as maize, beans, squash, and [[chili pepper]]s are the most important, but a variety of other crops, including wheat, [[manioc]], [[sweet potato]]es, cotton, [[chayote]], some fruits, other vegetables, and coffee.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"jrodriguez\"/>\n\n====Tzotzils====\n[[File:San Cristobal - Indianische Stra\u00dfenh\u00e4ndlerinnen.jpg|thumb|Tzotzil women in San Cristobal de las Casas]]\nTzotzil speakers number just slightly less than theTzeltals at 226,000, although those of the ethnicity are probably higher.<ref name=\"rincones20\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 20.</ref> Tzotzils are found in the highlands or Los Altos and spread out towards the northeast near the border with Tabasco.

Their language is closely related to Tzeltal and distantly related to [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Mayan]] and Lacandon.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"mhidalgo108\">Hidalgo, p. 108.</ref> Men dress in short pants tied with a red cotton belt and a shirt that hangs down to their knees. They also wear leather huaraches and a hat decorated with ribbons. The women wear a red or blue skirt, a short huipil as a blouse, and use a chal or [[rebozo]] to carry babies and bundles. Tzotzil communities are governed by a katinab who is selected for life by the leaders of each neighborhood. The Tzotzils are also known for their continued use of the [[temazcal]] for hygiene and medicinal purposes.<ref name=\"rincones20\"/>\n\n====Ch\u2019ols====\n[[File:IndigenousWomanPalenque2.JPG|thumb|Ch'ol woman in Palenque]]\nThe [[Ch'ol people|Ch\u2019ols of Chiapas]] migrated to the northwest of the state starting about 2,000 years ago, when they were concentrated in Guatemala and [[Honduras]]. Those Ch\u2019ols who remained in the south are distinguished by the name [[Ch'orti' people|Chort\u00eds]]. Chiapas Ch\u2019ols are closely related to the Chontal in Tabasco as well.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> Choles are found in Tila, Tumbal\u00e1, Sabanilla, Palenque, and [[Salto de Agua]], with an estimated population of about 115,000 people.<ref name=\"rincones20\"/> The Ch\u2019ol language belongs to the Maya family and is related to Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Lacandon, Tojolabal, and Yucatec Mayan. There are three varieties of Chol (spoken in Tila, Tumbal\u00e1, and Sabanilla), all mutually intelligible.<ref name=\"mhidalgo108\"/> Over half of speakers are monolingual in the Chol language. Women wear a long navy blue or black skirt with a white blouse heavily embroidered with bright colors and a sash with a red ribbon. The men only occasionally use traditional dress for events such as the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This dress usually includes pants, shirts and huipils made of undyed cotton, with leather [[huarache (shoe)|huarache]]s, a carrying sack and a hat.<ref name=\"rincones20\"/> The fundamental economic activity of the Ch\u2019ols is agriculture. They primarily cultivate corn and beans, as well as sugar cane, rice, coffee, and some fruits.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> They have Catholic beliefs strongly influenced by native ones. Harvests are celebrated on the Feast of Saint Rose on 30 August.<ref name=\"rincones20\"/>\n\n====Tojolabals====\nThe Totolabals are estimated at 35,000 in the highlands.<ref name=\"rincones21\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 21.</ref>  According to oral tradition, the Tojolabales came north from Guatemala.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> The largest community is Ingeniero Gonz\u00e1lez de Le\u00f3n in the La Ca\u00f1ada region, an hour outside the municipal seat of Las Margaritas.<ref name=\"rincones21\"/> Tojolabales are also found in Comit\u00e1n, Trinitaria, Altamirano and La Independencia.<ref name=\"mhidalgo109\"/> This area is filled with rolling hills with a temperate and moist climate. There are fast moving rivers and jungle vegetation.<ref name=\"rincones21\"/> Tojolabal is related to Kanjobal, but also to Tzeltal and Tzotzil.<ref name=\"mhidalgo109\"/> However, most of the youngest of this ethnicity speak Spanish. Women dress traditionally from childhood with brightly colored skirts decorated with lace or ribbons and a blouse decorated with small ribbons, and they cover their heads with kerchiefs. They embroider many of their own clothes but do not sell them. Married women arrange their hair in two braids and single women wear it loose decorated with ribbons. Men no longer wear traditional garb daily as it is considered too expensive to make.<ref name=\"rincones21\"/>\n\n====Zoques====\nThe Zoques are found in 3,000 square kilometers the center and west of the state scattered among hundreds of communities. These were one of the first native peoples of Chiapas, with archeological ruins tied to them dating back as far as 3500 BCE.<ref name=\"rincones20\"/> Their language is not Mayan but rather related to [[Mixe languages|Mixe]], which is found in [[Oaxaca]] and [[Veracruz]].<ref name=\"mhidalgo109\"/> By the time the Spanish arrived, they had been reduced in number and territory. Their ancient capital was Quechula, which was covered with water by the creation of the Malpaso Dam, along with the ruins of Guelegas, which was first buried by an eruption of the [[El Chich\u00f3n|Chichonal volcano]]. There are still Zoque ruins at Janepaguay, the Ocozocuautla and La Ci\u00e9nega valleys.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"rincones20\"/>\n\n====Lacandons====\nThe Lacandons are one of the smallest native indigenous groups of the state with a population estimated between 600 and 1000.<ref name=\"rincones1921\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 19\u201321.</ref> They are mostly located in the communities of Lacanj\u00e1, Chansayab and Mensabak in the [[Lacandon Jungle]]. They live near the ruins of [[Bonampak]] and [[Yaxchilan]] and local lore states that the gods resided here when they lived on Earth. They inhabit about a million hectares of rainforest but from the 16th century to the present, migrants have taken over the area, most of which are indigenous from other areas of Chiapas. This dramatically altered their lifestyle and worldview. Traditional Lacandon shelters are huts made with fonds and wood with an earthen floor, but this has mostly given way to modern structures.<ref name=\"rincones20\"/>\n\n====Moch\u00f3s====\nThe Moch\u00f3s or Motozintlecos are concentrated in the municipality of [[Motozintla]] on the Guatemalan border. According to anthropologists, these people are an \"urban\" ethnicity as they are mostly found in the neighborhoods of the municipal seat. Other communities can be found near the [[Volc\u00e1n Tacan\u00e1|Tacan\u00e1 volcano]], and in the municipalities of [[Tuzant\u00e1n]] and Belisario Dominguez. The name \"Moch\u00f3\" comes from a response many gave the Spanish whom they could not understand and means \"I don't know.\" This community is in the process of disappearing as their numbers shrink.<ref name=\"rincones22\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 22.</ref>\n\n====Mams====\nThe Mams are a Mayan ethnicity that numbers about 20,000 found in thirty municipalities, especially [[Tapachula]], Motozintla, El Porvenir, [[Cacahoat\u00e1n]] and Amatenango in the southeastern Sierra Madre of Chiapas.<ref name=\"rosalva\"/><ref name=\"rincones22\"/> The Mame language is one of the most ancient Mayan languages with 5,450 Mame speakers were tallied in Chiapas in the 2000 census.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> These people first migrated to the border region between Chiapas and Guatemala at the end of the nineteenth century, establishing scattered settlements. In the 1960s, several hundred migrated to the Lacandon rain forest near the confluence of the Santo Domingo and Jatat\u00e9 Rivers. Those who live in Chiapas are referred to locally as the \"Mexican Mam (or Mame)\" to differientiate them from those in Guatemala.<ref name=\"rosalva\"/> Most live around the Tacan\u00e1 volcano, which the Mams call \"our mother\" as it is considered to be the source of the fertility of the area's fields. The masculine deity is the Tajumulco volcano, which is in Guatemala.<ref name=\"rosalva\"/><ref name=\"rincones22\"/>\n\n====Guatemalan migrant groups====\nIn the last decades of the 20th century, Chiapas received a large number of indigenous refugees, especially from Guatemala, many of whom remain in the state. These have added ethnicities such as the [[Q'eqchi' people|Kekchi]], Chuj, [[Ixil people|Ixil]], Kanjobal, [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] and [[Kaqchikel people|Cakchikel]] to the population.<ref name=\"rincones19\"/> The Kanjobal mainly live along the border between Chiapas and Guatemala, with almost 5,800 speakers of the language tallied in the 2000 census. It is believed that a significant number of these Kanjobal-speakers may have been born in Guatemala and immigrated to Chiapas, maintaining strong cultural ties to the neighboring nation.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Economic indicators===\nChiapas accounts for 1.73% of Mexico's [[GDP]].

The crop was introduced in 1846 by Jeronimo Manchinelli who brought 1,500 seedlings from Guatemala on his farm La Chacara. This was followed by a number of other farms as well. Coffee production intensified during the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] and the Europeans who came to own many of the large farms in the area. By 1892, there were 22 coffee farms in the region, among them Nueva Alemania, Hamburgo, Chiripa, Irlanda, Argovia, San Francisco, and Linda Vista in the [[Soconusco]] region.<ref name=\"abianco\"/> Since then coffee production has grown and diversified to include large plantations, the use and free and forced labor and a significant sector of small producers.<ref name=\"martineztorres\"/> While most coffee is grown in the Soconusco, other areas grow it, including the municipalities of [[Oxchuc]], [[Panthel\u00f3]], [[El Bosque, Chiapas|El Bosque]], [[Tenejapa]], [[Chenalh\u00f3]], [[Larr\u00e1inzar]], and [[Chalchihuit\u00e1n]], with around six thousand producers.<ref name=\"martineztorres\"/> It also includes organic coffee producers with 18 million tons grown annually 60,000 producers. One third of these producers are indigenous women and other peasant farmers who grow the coffee under the shade of native trees without the use of agro chemicals. Some of this coffee is even grown in environmentally protected areas such as the El Triunfo reserve, where ejidos with 14,000 people grow the coffee and sell it to cooperativers who sell it to companies such as [[Starbucks]], but the main market is Europe. Some growers have created cooperatives of their own to cut out the middleman.<ref name=\"historycom\"/><ref name=\"cafeorganico\"/>\n\nRanching occupies about three million hectares of natural and induced pasture, with about 52% of all pasture induced. Most livestock is done by families using traditional methods. Most important are meat and dairy cattle, followed by pigs and domestic fowl. These three account for 93% of the value of production.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/> Annual milk production in Chiapas totals about 180 million liters per year.<ref name=\"historycom\"/> The state's cattle production, along with timber from the Lacandon Jungle and energy output gives it a certain amount of economic clouts compared to other states in the region.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/>\n\nForestry is mostly based on conifers and common tropical species producing 186,858 m3 per year at a value of 54,511,000 pesos. Exploited non-wood species include the Camedor palm tree for its fronds. The fishing industry is underdeveloped but includes the capture of wild species as well as fish farming. Fish production is generated both from the ocean as well as the many freshwater rivers and lakes. In 2002, 28,582 tons of fish valued at 441.2 million pesos was produced. Species include [[tuna]], shark, shrimp, [[mojarra]] and crab.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/>\n\n===Industry and energy===\nThe state's abundant rivers and streams have been dammed to provide about fifty five percent of the country's hydroelectric energy. Much of this is sent to other states accounting for over six percent of all of Mexico's energy output.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/><ref name=\"acteconom\"/><ref name=\"mhidalgo112113\">Hidalgo, p. 112\u2013113.</ref> Main power stations are located at Malpaso, La Angostura, Chicoas\u00e9n and Pe\u00f1itas, which produce about eight percent of Mexico's hydroelectric energy.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> [[Chicoas\u00e9n Dam|Manuel Moreno Torres plant]] on the Grijalva River the most productive in Mexico. All of the hydroelectric plants are owned and operated by the Federal Electricity Commission ([[Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad]], CFE).<ref name=\"CFE\" />\n\nChiapas is rich in petroleum reserves. Oil production began during the 1980s and Chiapas has become the fourth largest producer of crude oil and natural gas among the Mexican states.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/> Many reserves are yet untapped, but between 1984 and 1992, PEMEX drilled nineteen oil wells in the Lacandona Jungle.<ref name=\"mhidalgo112113\"/> Currently, petroleum reserves are found in the municipalities of Ju\u00e1rez, [[Ostuac\u00e1n]], [[Pichucalco]] and Reforma in the north of the state with 116 wells accounting for about 6.5% of the country's oil production. It also provides about a quarter of the country's natural gas. This production equals {{convert|6313.6|m3|cuft}} of natural gas and 17,565,000 barrels of oil per year.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/><ref name=\"acteconom\"/>\n\nIndustry is limited to small and micro enterprises and include auto parts, bottling, fruit packing, coffee and chocolate processing, production of [[lime (material)|lime]], bricks and other construction materials, sugar mills, furniture making, textiles, printing and the production of handcrafts. The two largest enterprises is the [[Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad]] and a [[Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos]] refinery.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/> Chiapas opened its first assembly plant in 2002, a fact that highlights the historical lack of industry in this area.<ref name=\"historycom\"/>\n\n===Handcrafts===\n[[File:TextileStallSantoDomingoSanCris02.JPG|thumb|Textiles for sale at Santo Domingo in San Crist\u00f3bal]]\nChiapas is one of the states that produces a wide variety of [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts and folk art in Mexico]]. One reason for this is its many indigenous ethnicities who produce traditional items out of identity as well as commercial reasons.<ref name=\"rincones42\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 42.</ref> One commercial reason is the market for crafts provided by the tourism industry. Another is that most indigenous communities can no longer provide for their own needs through agriculture. The need to generate outside income has led to many indigenous women producing crafts communally, which has not only had economic benefits but also involved them in the political process as well.<ref name=\"kovic\"/> Unlike many other states, Chiapas has a wide variety of wood resources such as [[cedar wood|cedar]] and [[mahogany]] as well as plant species such as reeds, [[ixtle]] and palm. It also has minerals such as [[obsidian]], [[amber]], [[jade]] and several types of clay and animals for the production of leather, dyes from various insects used to create the colors associated with the region. Items include various types of handcrafted clothing, dishes, jars, furniture, roof tiles, toys, musical instruments, tools and more.<ref name=\"rincones42\"/>\n\nChiapas\u2019 most important handcraft is [[Textiles of Mexico|textiles]], most of which is cloth woven on a backstrap loom.<ref name=\"artepopdes\"/> Indigenous girls often learn how to sew and embroider before they learn how to speak Spanish. They are also taught how to make natural dyes from insects, and weaving techniques. Many of the items produced are still for day-to-day use, often dyed in bright colors with intricate embroidery. They include skirts, belts, [[rebozo]]s, blouses, [[huipil]]s and shoulder wraps called chals. Designs are in red, yellow, turquoise blue, purple, pink, green and various pastels and decorated with designs such as flowers, butterflies, and birds, all based on local flora and fauna. Commercially, indigenous textiles are most often found in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, San Juan Chamula and Zinacant\u00e1n. The best textiles are considered to be from Magdalenas, Larr\u00e1inzar, Venustiano Carranza and Sibaca.<ref name=\"rincones43\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 43.</ref>\n[[File:PolishedAmberMuseumAmberSanCris03.JPG|thumb|Display of polished amber at the Museum of Amber]]\nOne of the main minerals of the state is [[amber]], much of which is 25 million years old, with quality comparable to that found in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Chiapan amber has a number of unique qualities, including much that is clear all the way through and some with fossilized insects and plants. Most Chiapan amber is worked into jewelry including [[pendant]]s, rings and necklaces. Colors vary from white to yellow/orange to a deep red, but there are also green and pink tones as well. Since pre-Hispanic times, native peoples have believed amber to have healing and protective qualities. The largest amber mine is in Simojovel, a small village 130&nbsp;km from Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, which produces 95% of Chiapas' amber. Other mines are found in Huitiup\u00e1n, Totolapa, El Bosque, Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuac\u00e1n, Pantelh\u00f3 and San Andr\u00e9s Duraznal. According to the Museum of Amber in San Crist\u00f3bal, almost 300&nbsp;kg of amber is extracted per month from the state. Prices vary depending on quality and color.<ref name=\"rincones43\"/>\n\nThe major center for ceramics in the state is the city of [[Amatenango del Valle]], with its barro blanco (white clay) pottery.<ref name=\"rincones44\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 44.</ref> The most traditional ceramic in Amatenango and Aguacatenango is a type of large jar called a [[cantaro]] used to transport water and other liquids.<ref name=\"artepopdes\"/> Many pieces created from this clay are ornamental as well as traditional pieces for everyday use such as comals, dishes, storage containers and flowerpots. All pieces here are made by hand using techniques that go back centuries. Other communities that produce ceramics include [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Tonal\u00e1, Chiapas|Tonal\u00e1]], [[Ocuilpa]], [[Suchiapa]] and San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas.<ref name=\"rincones44\"/>\n\nWood crafts in the state center on furniture, brightly painted sculptures and toys. The Tzotzils of San Juan de Chamula are known for their sculptures as well as for their sturdy furniture. Sculptures are made from woods such as [[cedar wood|cedar]], [[mahogany]] and [[Muntingia calabura|strawberry tree]]. Another town noted for their sculptures is [[Tecpat\u00e1n]]. The making [[lacquer]] to use in the decoration of wooden and other items goes back to the colonial period. The best-known area for this type of work, called \"laca\" is Chiapa de Corzo, which has a museum dedicated to it. One reason this type of decoration became popular in the state was that it protected items from the constant humidity of the climate.<ref name=\"rincones44\"/> Much of the laca in Chiapa de Corzo is made in the traditional way with natural pigments and sands to cover gourds, dipping spoons, chests, niches and furniture. It is also used to create the Parachicos masks.<ref name=\"artepopdes\"/>\n\n[[Traditional Mexican handcrafted toys|Traditional Mexican toys]], which have all but disappeared in the rest of Mexico, are still readily found here and include the [[cajita de la serpiente]], [[yo yos]], [[ball in cup]] and more. Other wooden items include masks, cooking utensils, and tools.<ref name=\"rincones44\"/> One famous toy is the \"mu\u00f1ecos zapatistas\" (Zapatista dolls), which are based on the revolutionary group that emerged in the 1990s.<ref name=\"artepopdes\"/>\n\n===Tourism and general commerce/services===\n[[File:LanchaBoatFronteraCorozal02.JPG|thumb|Boats at the docks of Frontera Corozal, which mostly serves the nearby Yaxchilan archeological site]]\nNinety four percent of the state's commercial outlets are small retail stores with about 6% wholesalers.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/> There are 111 [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal markets]], 55 [[tianguis]], three wholesale food markets and 173 large vendors of staple products.<ref name=\"infraes\"/> The service sector is the most important to the economy, with mostly commerce, warehousing and tourism.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/>\n\nTourism brings large numbers of visitors to the state each year.<ref name=\"historycom\"/> Most of Chiapas' tourism is based on its culture, colonial cities and ecology. The state has a total of 491 ranked hotels with 12,122 rooms. There are also 780 other establishments catering primarily to tourism, such as services and restaurants.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/>\n\n[[File:Misol-H\u00e1 Waterfall.jpg|thumb|Misol-H\u00e1 Waterfall]]\nThere are three main tourist routes: the Maya Route, the Colonial Route and the Coffee Route. The Maya Route runs along the border with [[Guatemala]] in the [[Lacandon Jungle]] and includes the sites of [[Palenque]], [[Bonampak]], [[Yaxchilan]] along with the natural attractions of [[Agua Azul|Agua Azul Waterfalls]], Misol-H\u00e1 Waterfall, and the Catazaj\u00e1 Lake.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/> Palenque is the most important of these sites, and one of the most important tourist destinations in the state. Yaxchilan was a Mayan city along the [[Usumacinta River]]. It developed between 350 and 810 CE.  Bonampak is known for its well preserved murals. These Mayan sites have made the state an attraction for international tourism.<ref name=\"hisschmal\"/><ref name=\"zonasarq\"/> These sites contain a large number of structures, most of which date back thousands of years, especially to the sixth century.<ref name=\"zonasarq\"/><ref name=\"rincones12\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 12.</ref> In addition to the sites on the Mayan Route, there are others within the state away from the border such as [[Tonin\u00e1]], near the city of [[Ocosingo]].<ref name=\"zonasarq\"/>\n[[File:RealdeGuadalupeEastSanCris.JPG|thumb|Real de Guadalupe street in San Cristobal de las Casas]]\nThe Colonial Route is mostly in the central highlands with a significant number of churches, monasteries and other structures from the colonial period along with some from the 19th century and even into the early 20th.<ref name=\"rincones12\"/> The most important city on this route is [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]], located in the Los Altos region in the Jovel Valley. The historic center of the city is filled with tiled roofs, patios with flowers, balconies, [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] facades along with [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] designs. It is centered on a main plaza surrounded by the cathedral, the municipal palace, the Portales commercial area and the San Nicol\u00e1s church. In addition, it has museums dedicated to the state's indigenous cultures, one to amber and one to jade, both of which have been mined in the state.<ref name=\"ciudadescol\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/ciudades-coloniales |title=Ciudades coloniales |publisher=State of Chiapas |location=Chiapas, Mexico |language=Spanish |date=March 2, 2011 |trans-title=Location |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808132331/http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/ciudades-coloniales |archivedate=August 8, 2011 |df= }}</ref> Other attractions along this route include [[Comit\u00e1n de Dom\u00ednguez]] and [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]], along with small indigenous communities such as [[Chamula|San Juan Chamula]].<ref name=\"acteconom\"/><ref name=\"rincones12\"/> The state capital of [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]] does not have many colonial era structures left, but it lies near the area's most famous natural attraction of the [[Sumidero Canyon]]. This canyon is popular with tourists who take boat tours into it on the [[Grijalva River]] to see such features such as caves (La Cueva del Hombre, La Cueva del Silencio) and the Christmas Tree, which is a rock and plant formation on the side of one of the canyon walls created by a seasonal waterfall.<ref name=\"aventuragob\"/><ref name=\"atraccultur\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title=Atractivos Culturales y Tur\u00edsticos |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de M\u00e9xico Estado de Chiapas |publisher=INAFED Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal/ SEGOB Secretar\u00eda de Gobernaci\u00f3n |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Cultural and Tourist Attractions |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616204839/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Coffee Route begins in [[Tapachula]] and follows a mountainous road into the Suconusco regopm. The route passes through [[Port of Chiapas|Puerto Chiapas]], a port with modern infrastructure for shipping exports and receiving international cruises.<ref name=\"abianco\"/>  The route visits a number of coffee plantations, such as Hamburgo, Chiripa, Violetas, Santa Rita, Lindavista, Per\u00fa-Par\u00eds, San Antonio Chicarras and Rancho Alegre. These haciendas provide visitors with the opportunity to see how coffee is grown and initially processed on these farms. They also offer a number of ecotourism activities such as mountain climbing, rafting, rappelling and mountain biking.  There are also tours into the jungle vegetation and the [[Volc\u00e1n Tacan\u00e1|Tacan\u00e1 Volcano]]. In addition to coffee, the region also produces most of Chiapas\u2019 soybeans, bananas and cacao.<ref name=\"atoussaint\"/>\n\nThe state has a large number of ecological attractions most of which are connected to water. The main beaches on the coastline include [[Puerto Arista]], [[Boca del Cielo]], Playa Linda, Playa Aventuras, Playa Azul and Santa Brigida.<ref name=\"acteconom\"/><ref name=\"solplaya\">{{cite web |url= http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/sol-y-playa |title= Sol y playa |publisher= State of Chiapas |location= Chiapas, Mexico |language= Spanish |date= March 2, 2011 |trans-title= Sun and beach |accessdate= May 8, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110808155300/http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/sol-y-playa |archivedate= August 8, 2011 |df=  }}</ref> Others are based on the state's lakes and rivers. Laguna Verde is a lake in the Coapilla municipality. The lake is generally green but its tones constantly change through the day depending on how the sun strikes it. In the early morning and evening hours there can also be blue and ochre tones as well. The El Chifl\u00f3n Waterfall is part of an ecotourism center located in a valley with reeds, sugarcane, mountains and rainforest. It is formed by the San Vicente River and has pools of water at the bottom popular for swimming. The Las Nubes Ecotourism center is located in the Las Margaritas municipality near the Guatemalan border. The area features a number of turquoise blue waterfalls with bridges and lookout points set up to see them up close.<ref name=\"aventuragob\"/>\n\nStill others are based on conservation, local culture and other features. The Las Guacamayas Ecotourism Center is located in the [[Lacandon Jungle]] on the edge of the Montes Azules reserve. It is centered on the conservation of the red [[macaw]], which is in danger of extinction. The Tziscao Ecotourism Center is centered on a lake with various tones. It is located inside the [[Lagunas de Montebello National Park]], with kayaking, mountain biking and archery. [[Lacanj\u00e1 Chansayab]] is located in the interior of the Lacandon Jungle and a major Lacandon people community. It has some activities associated with ecotourism such as mountain biking, hiking and cabins. The Grutas de Rancho Nuevo Ecotourism Center is centered on a set of caves in which appear capricious forms of stalagmite and stalactites.  There is horseback riding as well.<ref name=\"aventuragob\"/>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Architecture===\nArchitecture in the state begins with the archeological sites of the Mayans and other groups who established color schemes and other details that echo in later structures. After the Spanish subdued the area, the building of Spanish style cities began, especially in the highland areas.\n\nMany of the colonial-era buildings are related to [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] who came from [[Seville]]. This Spanish city had much [[Moorish architecture|Arabic influence in its architecture]], and this was incorporated into the colonial architecture of Chiapas, especially in structures dating from the 16th to 18th centuries. However, there are a number of architectural styles and influences present in Chiapas colonial structures, including colors and patterns from [[Oaxaca]] and [[Central America]] along with indigenous ones from Chiapas.\n\nThe main colonial structures are the cathedral and Santo Domingo church of San Crist\u00f3bal, the Santo Domingo monastery and La Pila in Chiapa de Corzo. The San Crist\u00f3bal cathedral has a Baroque facade that was begun in the 16th century but by the time it was finished in the 17th, it had a mix of Spanish, Arabic, and indigenous influences.<ref name=\"rincones13\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 13.</ref> It is one of the most elaborately decorated in Mexico.<ref name=\"rincones14\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 14.</ref>\n\nThe churches and former monasteries of Santo Domingo, La Merced and San Francisco have ornamentation similar to that of the cathedral. The main structures in Chiapa de Corzo are the Santo Domingo monastery and the La Pila fountain. Santo Domingo has indigenous decorative details such as double headed eagles as well as a statue of the founding monk. In San Crist\u00f3bal, the Diego de Mazariegos house has a [[Plateresque]] facade, while that of Francisco de Montejo, built later in the 18th century has a mix of Baroque and Neoclassical. [[Art Deco]] structures can be found in San Crist\u00f3bal and Tapachula in public buildings as well as a number of rural coffee plantations from the [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] era.<ref name=\"rincones14\"/>\n\n===Art and literature===\n\nArt in Chiapas is based on the use of color and has strong indigenous influence. This dates back to cave paintings such as those found in [[Sima de las Cotorras]] near [[Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez]] and the caverns of Rancho Nuevo where human remains and offerings were also found. The best-known pre-Hispanic artwork is the Maya murals of [[Bonampak]], which are the only [[Mesoamerica]]n murals to have been preserved for over 1500 years. In general, Mayan artwork stands out for its precise depiction of faces and its narrative form. Indigenous forms derive from this background and continue into the colonial period with the use of indigenous color schemes in churches and modern structures such as the municipal palace in [[Tapachula]]. Since the colonial period, the state has produced a large number of painters and sculptors. Noted 20th-century artists include [[L\u00e1zaro G\u00f3mez]], [[Ramiro Jim\u00e9nez Chac\u00f3n]], [[H\u00e9ctor Ventura Cruz]], [[M\u00e1ximo Prado Pozo]], and [[Gabriel Gallegos Ramos]].<ref name=\"rincones1416\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 14\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe two best-known poets from the state are [[Jaime Sabines]] and [[Rosario Castellanos]], both from prominent Chiapan families. The first was a merchant and diplomat and the second was a teacher, diplomat, theatre director and the director of the Instituto Nacional Indigenista.<ref name=\"rincones16\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 16.</ref> Jaime Sabines is widely regarded as Mexico's most influential contemporary poet. His work celebrates everyday people in common settings.<ref name=\"historycom\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe most important instrument in the state is the [[marimba]]. In the pre-Hispanic period, indigenous peoples had already been producing music with wooden instruments. The marimba was introduced by African slaves brought to Chiapas by the Spanish. However, it achieved its widespread popularity in the early 20th century due to the formation of the Cuarteto Marimbistico de los Hermanos G\u00f3mez in 1918, who popularized the instrument and the popular music that it plays not only in Chiapas but in various parts of Mexico and into the United States. Along with Cuban Juan Arozamena, they composed the piece \"Las chiapanecas\" considered to be the unofficial anthem of the state. In the 1940s, they were also featured in a number of Mexican films.<ref name=\"rincones18\" /> Marimbas are constructed in Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas de Corzo and Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez.<ref name=\"atraccultur\"/>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|cuisine of Chiapas}}\nLike the rest of [[Mesoamerica]], the basic diet has been based on corn and Chiapas cooking retains strong indigenous influence. One important ingredient is [[Crotalaria|chipilin]], a fragrant and strongly flavored herb and [[hoja santa]], the large anise-scented leaves used in much of southern Mexican cuisine.<ref name=\"bsantos\">{{cite journal |last=Santos Pruneda |first=Beatriz |date=October 2008 |title= Chiapas, el sue\u00f1o de los trotamundos de buen apetito |trans-title=Chiapas, the dream of globetrotters with good appetite |journal=Mexico Desconocido |volume=380 |pages=58\u201366 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Grupo Editorial Impresiones Aereas |language=Spanish |issn=1870-9397 }}</ref><ref name=\"chicuisine\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2081-the-cuisine-of-chiapas-dining-in-mexico-s-last-frontier |title= The Cuisine of Chiapas: Dining in Mexico's Last Frontier |first= Karen  |last=Hursh Graber |year=2008 |publisher=MexConnect newsletter  |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}</ref>  Chiapan dishes do not incorporate many chili peppers as part of their dishes. Rather, chili peppers are most often found in the condiments. One reason for that is that a local chili pepper, called the simojovel, is far too hot to use except very sparingly. Chiapan cuisine tends to rely more on slightly sweet seasonings in their main dishes such as cinnamon, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, prunes and pineapple are often found in meat and poultry dishes.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/>\n\n[[Tamale]]s are a major part of the diet and often include chipil\u00edn mixed into the dough and hoja santa, within the tamale itself or used to wrap it. One tamale native to the state is the \"picte\", a fresh sweet corn tamale.<ref name=\"bsantos\"/><ref name=\"chicuisine\"/> Tamales juacanes are filled with a mixture of black beans, dried shrimp, and pumpkin seeds.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/>\n\nMeats are centered on the European introduced beef, pork and chicken as many native game animals are in danger of extinction. Meat dishes are frequently accompanied by vegetables such as squash, [[chayote]] and carrots. Black beans are the favored type. Beef is favored, especially a thin cut called [[tasajo]] usually served in a sauce.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/> Pepita con tasajo is a common dish at festivals especially in Chiapa de Corzo. It consists of a squash seed based sauced over reconstituted and shredded dried beef.  As a cattle raising area, beef dishes in Palenque are particularly good. Pux-Xax\u00e9 is a stew with beef organ meats and [[Mole (sauce)|mole sauce]] made with tomato, chili bolita and corn flour.<ref name=\"bsantos\"/>  Tzispol\u00e1 is a beef broth with chunks of meat, chickpeas, cabbage and various types of chili peppers.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/> Pork dishes include cochito, which is pork in an [[adobo]] sauce. In Chiapa de Corzo, their version is cochito horneado, which is a roast suckling pig flavored with adobo.<ref name=\"bsantos\"/><ref name=\"chicuisine\"/>  Seafood is a strong component in many dishes along the coast.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/>  Turula is dried shrimp with tomatoes. Sausages, ham and other cold cuts are most often made and consumed in the highlands.<ref name=\"bsantos\"/>\n[[File:TaxcalatePalenque.JPG|thumb|175px|Drink called taxcalate]]\nIn addition to meat dishes, there is chirmol, a cooked tomato sauced flavored with chili pepper, onion and cilantro and zats, butterfly caterpillars from the Altos de Chiapas that are boiled in salted water, then saut\u00e9ed in [[lard]] and eaten with tortillas, limes, and green chili pepper.\n\nSopa de pan consists of layers of bread and vegetables covered with a broth seasoned with saffron and other flavorings.<ref name=\"bsantos\"/> A Comit\u00e1n speciality is [[hearts of palm]] salad in [[vinaigrette]] and Palenque is known for many versions of fried plaintains, including filled with black beans or cheese.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/>\n\nCheese making is important, especially in the municipalities of Ocosingo, Rayon and Pijijiapan. Ocosingo has its own self-named variety, which is shipped to restaurants and gourmet shops in various parts of the country.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/> Regional sweets include crystallized fruit, coconut candies, flan and [[compote]]s. San Cristobal is noted for its sweets, as well as chocolates, coffee and baked goods.<ref name=\"chicuisine\"/>\n\nWhile Chiapas is known for good coffee, there are a number of other local beverages. The oldest is [[pozol]], originally the name for a fermented corn dough. This dough has its origins in the pre-Hispanic period. To make the beverage, the dough is dissolved in water and usually flavored with cocoa and sugar, but sometimes it is left to ferment further.

Catholic beliefs were mixed with indigenous ones to form what is now called \"traditionalist\" Catholic belief.<ref name=\"relmix\">{{cite news |title=Chiapas, Mexico Offers Ancient, Modern Religion Mix |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-08-03-voa12-68756032.html |newspaper=Voice of America |date=August 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002409/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-08-03-voa12-68756032.html |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |df= }}</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Crist\u00f3bal de Las Casas|Diocese of Chiapas]] comprises almost the entire state, and centered on San Cristobal de las Casas.

One particular area where this is strong is the central highlands in small communities such as San Juan Chamula. In one church in San Cristobal, Mayan rites including the sacrifice of animals is permitted inside the church to ask for good health or to \"ward off the evil eye.\"<ref name=\"relmix\"/>\n\nStarting in the 1970s, there has been a shift away from traditional Catholic affiliation to Protestant, Evangelical and other Christian denominations. [[Presbyterians]] and [[Pentecostals]] attracted a large number of converts, with percentages of Protestants in the state rising from five percent in 1970 to twenty-one percent in 2000. This shift has had a political component as well, with those making the switch tending to identify across ethnic boundaries, especially across indigenous ethnic boundaries and being against the traditional power structure.<ref name=\"mhidalgo108\"/><ref name=\"kovic\"/> The [[National Presbyterian Church in Mexico]] is particularly strong in Chiapas, the state can be described as one of the strongholds of the denomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=13218&lg=eng|title=Address data base of Reformed churches and institutions|first=Christoph|last=Fasse|date=|website=www.reformiert-online.net|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183517/http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=13218&lg=eng|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nTo counter this, the Diocese of Chiapas began to actively re-evangelize among the indigenous populations, and working on their behalf politically as well, following an ideology called [[liberation theology]]. Those attracted by this movement call themselves \"Word of God\" Catholics and identify directly with the Diocese, rather than with local Catholic authorities. Both Protestants and Word of God Catholics tend to oppose traditional cacique leadership and often worked to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The latter had the effect of attracting many women to both movements.<ref name=\"kovic\"/>\n\nThe growing number of Protestants, Evangelicals and Word of God Catholics challenging traditional authority has caused religious strife in a number of indigenous communities. Tensions have been strong, at times, especially in rural areas such as San Juan Chamula. Tension among the groups reached its peak in the 1990s with a large number of people injured during open clashes.<ref name=\"relmix\"/> In the 1970s, caciques began to expel dissidents from their communities for challenging their power, initially with the use of violence. By 2000, more than 20,000 people had been displaced, but state and federal authorities did not act to stop the expulsions.<ref name=\"kovic\"/> Today, the situation has quieted but the tension remains, especially in very isolated communities.<ref name=\"relmix\"/>\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:TiltepecSculptureMusRegTuxtla2.JPG|thumb|Olmec style stone sculpture from Tiltepec at the Regional Museum of Chiapas]]\n\nThe earliest population of Chiapas was in the coastal [[Soconusco]] region, where the [[Chantuto Archaeological Site|Chantuto peoples]] appeared, going back to 5500 BC. This was the oldest Mesoamerican culture discovered to date.\n\nThe largest and best-known archaeological sites in Chiapas belong to the Mayan civilization. Apart from a few works by [[Franciscan]] friars, knowledge of Maya civilisation largely disappeared after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]]. In the mid-19th century, [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] traveled though the sites in Chiapas and other Mayan areas and published their writings and illustrations. This led to serious work on the culture including the deciphering of its hieroglyphic writing.<ref name=\"Hamnett32\">Hamnett, p. 32.</ref>\n\nIn Chiapas, principal Mayan sites include [[Palenque]], [[Tonin\u00e1]], [[Bonampak]], [[Chinkoltic]] and [[Tenam Puentes]], all or near in the [[Lacandon Jungle]]. They are technically more advanced than earlier [[Olmec]] sites, which can best be seen in the detailed sculpting and novel construction techniques, including structures of four stories in height. Mayan sites are not only noted for large numbers of structures, but also for glyphs, other inscriptions, and artwork that has provided a relatively complete history of many of the sites.<ref name=\"rincones13\"/>\n\nPalenque is the most important Mayan and archaeological site. Though much smaller than the huge sites at [[Tikal]] or [[Cop\u00e1n]], Palenque contains some of the finest architecture, sculpture and [[stucco]] reliefs the Mayans ever produced.<ref name=\"historycom\"/> The history of the Palenque site begins in 431 with its height under Pakal I (615-683), Chan-Bahlum II (684-702) and Kan-Xul who reigned between 702 and 721. However, the power of Palenque would be lost by the end of the century.

This includes the [[Mokaya culture]], the oldest ceramic culture of Mesoamerica. Later, [[Paso de la Amada]] became important. Many of these sites are in [[Mazatan, Chiapas]] area.\n\n[[Izapa]] became an important pre-Mayan site as well.\n\nThere are also other ancient sites including [[Tapachula]] and [[Tepcat\u00e1n]], and [[Pijijiapan]]. These sites contain numerous embankments and foundations that once lay beneath pyramids and other buildings. Some of these buildings have disappeared and others have been covered by jungle for about 3,000 years, unexplored.\n\nPijijiapan and Izapa are on the Pacific coast and were the most important pre Hispanic cities for about 1,000 years, as the most important commercial centers between the [[Mexican Plateau]] and Central America.<ref name=\"rincones1213\">Jim\u00e9nez Gonz\u00e1lez, p. 12\u201313.</ref> [[Sima de las Cotorras]] is a sinkhole 140 meters deep with a diameter of 160 meters in the municipality of [[Ocozocoautla]].

The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with [[40 Wall Street]] and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as [[Walter P.

The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. The area between floors 28 and 31 added \"visual interest to the middle of the building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial. They provide a base to the column of the tower, effecting a transition between the blocky lower stories and the lofty shaft.\"{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}\n\n==== Designs between setbacks ====\nThe ground floor exterior is covered in polished [[black granite]] from Shastone, while the three floors above it are done in [[white marble]] from Georgia. There are two main entrances, on Lexington Avenue and on 42nd Street, each three floors high with Shastone granite surrounding each [[proscenium]]-shaped entryway. At some distance into each main entryway, there are revolving doors located \"beneath intricately patterned metal and glass screens\", designed so as to embody the Art Deco tenet of amplifying the entrance's visual impact. A smaller side entrance on 43rd Street is only one story high.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=175}} There are storefronts consisting of large Nirosta-steel-framed windows at ground level, with office windows on the second through fourth floors.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}\n\nThe west and east elevations of the building contain the air shafts above the fourth floor, while the north and south sides contain the receding setbacks.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Below the 16th floor, the facade is clad with white brick interrupted by white-marble bands in a manner similar to a [[basket weaving]].{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=161}} The windows, arranged in grids, do not have [[window sill]]s, the frames being flush with the facade.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Between the 16th and 24th floors, the exterior exhibits vertical white brick columns that are separated by windows on each floor. This visual effect is made possible by the presence of aluminum [[spandrel]]s between the columns of windows on each floor. There are abstract reliefs on the 20th through 22nd-floor spandrels, while the 24th floor contains {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} decorative pineapples.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}\n\nAbove the third setback, consisting of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}} The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders,{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} which symbolizes both the Chrysler Corporation and serves as a visual signature of the building's Art Deco design.<ref name=\"jayebee.com\"/><ref name=\"emporis\" /> The bonnet embellishments take the shape of [[Mercury (god)|Mercury's]] [[Petasos|winged helmet]] and resemble hood ornaments installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}}\n\nThe shaft of the tower was designed to emphasize both the horizontal and vertical: each of the tower's four sides contains three columns of windows, each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along the entirety of each side. The spandrels separating the windows contain \"alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick\", while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe interior of the building contains several innovative elements. The partitions between the offices are soundproofed and divided into interchangeable sections, so that the layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably.

The dimensions of each elevator were {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} deep by {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods.<ref name=\"in-arch\"/> When the doors are closed, they resemble \"tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies\" from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles \"an exquisite Art Deco room\".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} These elements were influenced by Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} According to Vincent Curcio, \"these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building.\"{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}\n\nEven though the woods in the elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns, each cab had a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that \"if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [the elevators] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences on the design of the entire building.\"{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}  The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} Curcio wrote that these elevators \"are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and it is fair to say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them\".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} Curcio compared the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings.{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary [[marquetry]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Knowles | first=Eric | title=Art Deco | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | series=Shire Collections | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-7478-1521-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OhjDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA115 | access-date=November 5, 2017 | page=115}}</ref>\n\n=== {{Anchor|Subway entrance}}Basement ===\nOn the 42nd Street side of the Chrysler Building, a staircase from the street leads directly under the building to the [[New York City Subway]] station at [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central\u201342nd Street]].<ref name=\"MTAMidtownEastGrandCentralMap-2015\">{{Cite NYCS map|neighborhood|Midtown East}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://subwaynut.com/ct/gct_456/|title=Grand Central-42nd Street|last=Cox|first=Jeremiah|accessdate=October 4, 2013}}</ref> It is part of the structure's original design.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/11/24/317430812.pdf|title=Subway Construction Planned For the Chrysler Building|last=|first=|date=November 24, 1929|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]], which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding,<ref>{{cite news | title=I.R.T.

It was located on the night of March 24 in a photograph taken with the {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[Schmidt camera|Schmidt telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in [[California]]. It was the first comet observed to be orbiting a planet, and had probably been captured by Jupiter around 20\u201330 years earlier.\n\nCalculations showed that its unusual fragmented form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's [[Roche limit]], and Jupiter's [[tidal force]]s had acted to pull apart the comet. The comet was later observed as a series of fragments ranging up to {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July 16 and 22, 1994 at a speed of approximately {{convert|60|km/s|0|abbr=on}} (Jupiter's escape velocity) or {{convert|216000|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

S. Aagard and Knud Redelien, as the city's seventh brewery. It was named after the [[Rome|Roman]] goddess [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], and its opening was announced in the local newspaper, ''[[\u00c5rhus Stiftstidende|Stiftstidende]]'', in 1856.\n\nThe brewery was successful, and Lottrup became one of the most prominent people of Aarhus. After ten years, he expanded the brewery, adding a grand new building as his own private residence, where he entertained other local figures.\n\nLottrup's son-in-law, [[Laurits Christian Meulengracht]], took over the running of the brewery after that, and was in charge for nearly thirty years, expanding it further.

However, it is verbose and uses over 300 [[reserved word]]s. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like {{code|1=y = x;|lang=c}}, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, {{code|MOVE x TO y|lang=cobolfree}}).\nCOBOL code is split into four ''divisions'' (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large [[standard library]], the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n\nAcademic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.brown.edu/~adf/programming_languages.html|title=A History of Computer Programming Languages|first=Andrew|last=Ferguson|date=|website=cs.brown.edu}}</ref>\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life, however, for its verbosity, design process and poor support for [[structured programming]].

A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new [[Timeline of programming languages|programming languages were proliferating]] at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=282}}\n\n[[File:Grace Hopper.jpg|thumb|alt=caption|[[Grace Hopper]], the inventor of [[FLOW-MATIC]], a predecessor to COBOL]]\n\nIn April 1959, [[Mary K.

The delegation impressed Charles A. Phillips, director of the Data System Research Staff at the DoD, who thought that they \"thoroughly understood\" the DoD's problems. The DoD operated 225 computers, had a further 175 on order and had spent over $200 million on implementing programs to run on them.

They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=286}}\n\nThe meeting resulted in the creation of a [[steering committee]] and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/9}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=201}} Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create a new language.{{sfn|Sammet|2004|p=104}}\nThe deadline was met with disbelief by the short-range committee.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}}\nOne member, [[Betty Holberton]], described the three-month deadline as \"gross optimism\" and doubted that the language really would be a stopgap.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=288}}\n\nThe steering committee met on June 4 and agreed to name the entire activity as the ''Committee on Data Systems Languages'', or [[CODASYL]], and to form an executive committee.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=203}}\n\nThe short-range committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were [[Burroughs Corporation]], [[IBM]], [[Honeywell|Minneapolis-Honeywell]] (Honeywell Labs), [[RCA]], [[Sperry Rand]], and [[Sylvania Electric Products]].

While some members thought the language had too many compromises and was the result of [[design by committee]], others felt it was better than the three languages examined. Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|pp=205\u2013206}}\nControversial features included those some considered useless or too advanced for data processing users. Such features included [[boolean expression]]s, [[formula]]s and table ''{{dfn|subscripts}}'' (indices).{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|loc=Figure 8}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|pp=230\u2013231}} Another point of controversy was whether to make keywords context-sensitive and the effect that would have on readability.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|loc=Figure 8}} Although context-sensitive keywords were rejected, the approach was later used in [[PL/I]] and partially in COBOL from 2002.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|p=846}} Little consideration was given to [[interactivity]], interaction with [[operating system]]s (few existed at that time) and functions (thought of as purely mathematical and of no use in data processing).{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=220}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=228}}\n\nThe specifications were presented to the Executive Committee on September 4.

The subcommittee was given until December to improve it.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}}\n\nAt a mid-September meeting, the committee discussed the new language's name.

Instead, some businesses have migrated their systems from expensive mainframes to cheaper, more modern systems, while maintaining their COBOL programs.<ref name=\"Computerworld Not Dead Yet\" />\n\n==Features==\n\n===Syntax===\nCOBOL has an English-like syntax, which is used to describe nearly everything in a program. For example, a condition can be expressed as &nbsp;{{code|x IS GREATER THAN y|lang=cobolfree}} or more concisely as &nbsp;{{code|x GREATER y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; or &nbsp;{{code|x > y|lang=cobolfree}}. More complex conditions can be \"abbreviated\" by removing repeated conditions and variables. For example, &nbsp;{{code|1=a > b AND a > c OR a = d|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; can be shortened to {{code|1=a > b AND c OR = d|lang=cobolfree}}. As a consequence of this English-like syntax, COBOL has over 300 [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]].{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.9}}{{efn|Vendor-specific extensions cause many implementations to have far more: one implementation recognizes over 1,100 keywords.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://documentation.microfocus.com/help/topic/com.microfocus.eclipse.infocenter.visualcobol.vs2013/HRLHLHARES01U005.html | title=Reserved Words Table | publisher=[[Micro Focus]] | work=Micro Focus Visual COBOL 2.2 COBOL Language Reference | accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>}} Some of the keywords are simple alternative or pluralized spellings of the same word, which provides for more English-like statements and clauses; e.g., the {{code|IN}} and {{code|OF}} keywords can be used interchangeably, as can {{code|IS}} and {{code|ARE}}, and {{code|VALUE}} and {{code|VALUES}}.\n\nEach COBOL program is made up of four basic [[lexical items]]: words, literals, picture character-strings (see {{slink||PICTURE clause}}) and separators. Words include reserved words and user-defined identifiers. They are up to 31 characters long and may include letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. Literals include numerals (e.g. {{code|12}}) and strings (e.g. {{code|'Hello!'}}).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.1.2}} Separators include the space character and commas and semi-colons followed by a space.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.2}}\n\nA COBOL program is split into four divisions: the identification division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division. The identification division specifies the name and type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running it, such as [[computer files|files]] and [[character sets]]. The data division is used to declare [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s and [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s. The procedure division contains the program's [[statement (computer science)|statement]]s. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which are made up of paragraphs.\n\n====Metalanguage====\n\nCOBOL's syntax is usually described with a unique [[metalanguage]] using braces, brackets, bars and underlining. The metalanguage was developed for the original COBOL specifications. Although [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] did exist at the time, the committee had not heard of it.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=349}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Elements of COBOL's metalanguage\n|-\n!

In fixed-format, code must be aligned to fit in certain areas (a hold-over from using punched cards). Until COBOL 2002, these were:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Column(s)\n! Usage\n|-\n| Sequence number area\n| 1\u20136\n| Originally used for card/line numbers, this area is ignored by the compiler\n|-\n| Indicator area\n| 7\n| The following characters are allowed here:\n* <code>*</code> \u2013 Comment line\n* <code>/</code> \u2013 Comment line that will be printed on a new page of a source listing\n* <code>-</code> \u2013 Continuation line, where words or literals from the previous line are continued\n* <code>D</code> \u2013 Line enabled in debugging mode, which is otherwise ignored\n|-\n| Area A\n| 8\u201311\n| This contains: <code>DIVISION</code>, <code>SECTION</code> and procedure headers; 01 and 77 level numbers and file/report descriptors\n|-\n| Area B\n| 12\u201372\n| Any other code not allowed in Area A\n|-\n| Program name area\n| 73\u2013\n| Historically up to column 80 for punched cards, it is used to identify the program or sequence the card belongs to\n|}\n\nIn COBOL 2002, Areas A and B were merged to form the program-text area, which now ends at an implementor-defined column.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\nCOBOL 2002 also introduced free-format code. Free-format code can be placed in any column of the file, as in newer programming languages. Comments are specified using <code>*></code>, which can be placed anywhere and can also be used in fixed-format source code. Continuation lines are not present, and the <code>>>PAGE</code> directive replaces the <code>/</code> indicator.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\n===Identification division===\nThe identification division identifies the following code entity and contains the definition of a class or interface.\n\n====Object-oriented programming====\n[[class (computer programming)|Classes]] and [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]] have been in COBOL since 2002. Classes have factory objects, containing class [[method (computer programming)|methods]] and variables, and instance objects, containing instance methods and variables.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18.2}} Inheritance and interfaces provide [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. Support for [[generic programming]] is provided through parameterized classes, which can be instantiated to use any class or interface. Objects are stored as references which may be restricted to a certain type. There are two ways of calling a method: the {{code|INVOKE}} statement, which acts similarly to {{code|CALL}}, or through inline method invocation, which is analogous to using functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> These are equivalent.\nINVOKE my-class \"foo\" RETURNING var\nMOVE my-class::\"foo\" TO var *> Inline method invocation\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nCOBOL does not provide a way to [[Member visibility|hide]] methods. Class data can be hidden, however, by declaring it without a [[property (programming)|{{code|PROPERTY}}]] clause, which leaves the user with no way to access it.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=108}} [[Method overloading]] was added in COBOL 2014.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=896}}\n\n===Environment division===\nThe environment division contains the configuration section and the input-output section. The configuration section is used to specify variable features such\nas currency signs, locales and character sets. The input-output section contains file-related information.\n\n====Files====\nCOBOL supports three file formats, or ''{{dfn|organizations}}'': sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, records are contiguous and must be traversed [[sequential access|sequentially]], similarly to a [[linked list]]. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be [[random access|randomly accessed]] and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a [[unique key]], but other, ''{{dfn|alternate}}'', record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as [[C-ISAM|C&#8209;ISAM]] and [[VSAM]], are based on IBM's [[ISAM]]. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, but they do not have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.2.1}}\n\nA common non-standard extension is the ''{{dfn|line sequential}}'' organization, used to process text files. Records in a file are terminated by a [[newline]] and may be of varying length.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://supportline.microfocus.com/documentation/books/nx30books/fhorgs.htm | title=File Organizations | publisher=Micro Focus | work=File Handling | date=1998 | accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Data division===\nThe data division is split into six sections which declare different items: the file section, for file records; the working-storage section, for [[static variable]]s; the local-storage section, for [[automatic variable]]s; the linkage section, for parameters and the return value; the report section and the screen section, for [[text-based user interface]]s.\n\n====Aggregated data====\nData items in COBOL are declared hierarchically through the use of level-numbers which indicate if a data item is part of another. An item with a higher level-number is subordinate to an item with a lower one. Top-level data items, with a level-number of 1, are called ''{{dfn|records}}''. Items that have subordinate aggregate data are called ''{{dfn|group items}}''; those that do not are called ''{{dfn|elementary items}}''. Level-numbers used to describe standard data items are between 1 and 49.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.1.2}}{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=Appendix A}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  some-record.                   *> Aggregate group record item\n           05  num            PIC 9(10).  *> Elementary item\n           05  the-date.                  *> Aggregate (sub)group record item\n               10  the-year   PIC 9(4).   *> Elementary item\n               10  the-month  PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n               10  the-day    PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above example, elementary item {{code|num}} and group item {{code|the-date}} are subordinate to the record {{code|some-record}}, while elementary items {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are part of the group item {{code|the-date}}.\n\nSubordinate items can be disambiguated with the {{code|IN}} (or {{code|OF}}) keyword. For example, consider the example code above along with the following example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  sale-date.\n           05  the-year       PIC 9(4).\n           05  the-month      PIC 99.\n           05  the-day        PIC 99.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe names {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are ambiguous by themselves, since more than one data item is defined with those names. To specify a particular data item, for instance one of the items contained within the {{code|sale-date}} group, the programmer would use {{code|the-year IN sale-date}} (or the equivalent {{code|the-year OF sale-date}}). (This syntax is similar to the \"dot notation\" supported by most contemporary languages.)\n\n====Other data levels====\nA level-number of 66 is used to declare a re-grouping of previously defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated {{dfn|{{code|RENAMES}} clause}}, is rarely used<ref>{{cite book | title=Sams Teach Yourself COBOL in 24 hours | publisher=[[Sams|SAMS Publishing]] | year=1999 | pages=40 | isbn=978-0672314537 | first=Thane | last=Hubbell | lccn=98087215}}</ref> and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 19.9}}\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  customer-record.\n           05  cust-key            PIC X(10).\n           05  cust-name.\n               10  cust-first-name PIC X(30).\n               10  cust-last-name  PIC X(30).\n           05  cust-dob            PIC 9(8).\n           05  cust-balance        PIC 9(7)V99.\n           \n       66  cust-personal-details   RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-dob.\n       66  cust-all-details        RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-balance.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA 77 level-number indicates the item is stand-alone, and in such situations is equivalent to the level-number 01. For example, the following code declares two 77-level data items, {{code|property-name}} and {{code|sales-region}}, which are non-group data items that are independent of (not subordinate to) any other data items:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       77  property-name      PIC X(80).\n       77  sales-region       PIC 9(5).\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn 88 level-number declares a ''{{dfn|condition name}}'' (a so-called 88-level) which is true when its parent data item contains one of the values specified in its {{code|VALUE}} clause.{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=\u00a7 5.8.5}} For example, the following code defines two 88-level condition-name items that are true or false depending on the current character data value of the {{code|wage-type}} data item. When the data item contains a value of {{code|'H'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-hourly}} is true, whereas when it contains a value of {{code|'S'}} or {{code|'Y'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-yearly}} is true. If the data item contains some other value, both of the condition-names are false.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  wage-type          PIC X.\n           88  wage-is-hourly VALUE \"H\".\n           88  wage-is-yearly VALUE \"S\", \"Y\".\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Data types====\nStandard COBOL provides the following data types:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.2}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric data can be placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.24}} In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.35}}\n\n=====PICTURE clause=====\nA {{code|PICTURE}} (or {{code|PIC}}) clause is a string of characters, each of which represents a portion of the data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a {{code|9}} indicates a decimal digit, and an {{code|S}} indicates that the item is [[signedness|signed]]. Other picture characters (called ''{{dfn|insertion}}'' and ''{{dfn|editing}}'' characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of {{code|+}} characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a {{code|+}} to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, {{code|9(7)}} is equivalent to {{code|9999999}}. Picture specifications containing only digit ({{code|9}}) and sign ({{code|S}}) characters define purely ''{{dfn|numeric}}'' data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic ({{code|A}}) or alphanumeric ({{code|X}}) characters define ''{{dfn|alphanumeric}}'' data items. The presence of other formatting characters define ''{{dfn|edited numeric}}'' or ''{{dfn|edited alphanumeric}}'' data items.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.40}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n! {{code|PICTURE}} clause\n!

Depending on the data type, it can either complement or be used instead of a {{code|PICTURE}} clause. While it can be used to declare pointers and object references, it is mostly geared towards specifying numeric types. These numeric formats are:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.60.3}}\n\n* Binary, where a minimum size is either specified by the <code>PICTURE</code> clause or by a <code>USAGE</code> clause such as <code>BINARY-LONG</code>.\n* {{code|USAGE COMPUTATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data may be stored in whatever format the implementation provides; often equivalent to &nbsp;{{code|USAGE BINARY|lang=cobolfree}}\n* {{code|USAGE DISPLAY|lang=cobolfree}}, the default format, where data is stored as a string\n* Floating-point, in either an implementation-dependent format or according to IEEE 754.\n* {{code|USAGE NATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored as a string using an extended character set\n* {{code|USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored in the smallest possible decimal format (typically [[packed binary-coded decimal]])\n\n====Report writer====\nThe report writer is a [[declarative programming|declarative]] facility for creating reports. The programmer need only specify the report layout and the data required to produce it, freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks, data formatting, and headings and footings.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=855}}\n\nReports are associated with report files, which are files which may only be written to through report writer statements.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       FD  report-out REPORT sales-report.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nEach report is defined in the report section of the data division. A report is split into report groups which define the report's headings, footings and details. Reports work around hierarchical ''{{dfn|control breaks}}''. Control breaks occur when a key variable changes it value; for example, when creating a report detailing customers' orders, a control break could occur when the program reaches a different customer's orders. Here is an example report description for a report which gives a salesperson's sales and which warns of any invalid records:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       RD  sales-report\n           PAGE LIMITS 60 LINES\n           FIRST DETAIL 3\n           CONTROLS seller-name.\n\n       01  TYPE PAGE HEADING.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Sales Report\".\n           03  COL 74                   VALUE \"Page\".\n           03  COL 79                   PIC Z9 SOURCE PAGE-COUNTER.\n\n       01  sales-on-day TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"Sales on\".\n           03  COL 12                   PIC 99/99/9999 SOURCE sales-date.\n           03  COL 21                   VALUE \"were\".\n           03  COL 26                   PIC $$$$9.99 SOURCE sales-amount.\n\n       01  invalid-sales TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"INVALID RECORD:\".\n           03  COL 19                   PIC X(34) SOURCE sales-record.\n\n       01  TYPE CONTROL HEADING seller-name, LINE + 2.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Seller:\".\n           03  COL 9                    PIC X(30) SOURCE seller-name.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe above report description describes the following layout:\n<pre>\nSales Report                                                             Page  1\n\nSeller: Howard Bromberg\n  Sales on 10/12/2008 were $1000.00\n  Sales on 12/12/2008 were    $0.00\n  Sales on 13/12/2008 were   $31.47\n  INVALID RECORD: Howard Bromberg             XXXXYY\n\nSeller: Howard Discount\n...\nSales Report                                                            Page 12\n\n  Sales on 08/05/2014 were  $543.98\n  INVALID RECORD: William Selden      12O52014FOOFOO\n  Sales on 30/05/2014 were    $0.00\n</pre>\n\nFour statements control the report writer: {{code|INITIATE}}, which prepares the report writer for printing; {{code|GENERATE}}, which prints a report group; {{code|SUPPRESS}}, which suppresses the printing of a report group; and {{code|TERMINATE}}, which terminates report processing. For the above sales report example, the procedure division might look like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n           OPEN INPUT sales, OUTPUT report-out\n           INITIATE sales-report\n \n           PERFORM UNTIL 1 <> 1\n               READ sales\n                   AT END\n                       EXIT PERFORM\n               END-READ\n \n               VALIDATE sales-record\n               IF valid-record\n                   GENERATE sales-on-day\n               ELSE\n                   GENERATE invalid-sales\n               END-IF\n           END-PERFORM\n \n           TERMINATE sales-report\n           CLOSE sales, report-out\n           .\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Procedure division===\n\n====Procedures====\nThe sections and paragraphs in the procedure division (collectively called procedures) can be used as [[label (programming)|labels]] and as simple [[subroutines]]. Unlike in other divisions, paragraphs do not need to be in sections.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.4}}\nExecution goes down through the procedures of a program until it is terminated.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.6.3}}\nTo use procedures as subroutines, the {{code|PERFORM}} verb is used. This transfers control to the specified range of procedures and returns only upon reaching the end.\n\n[[File:COBOL Mine.svg|thumb|left|upright|alt=PROCEDURE DIVISION. PERFORM update-screen. GOBACK. fix-screen SECTION. MOVE \"Error fixed\" TO screen-line. PERFORM update-screen. update-screen SECTION. IF invalid-screen, GO TO fix-screen. END-IF.|A mine is \"armed\" when the screen is invalid.]]\n\nUnusual control flow can trigger ''{{dfn|mines}}'', which cause control in performed procedures to return at unexpected times to unexpected locations. Procedures can be reached in three ways: they can be called with {{code|PERFORM}}, jumped to from a {{code|GO TO}} or through execution \"falling through\" the bottom of an above paragraph. Combinations of these invoke [[undefined behavior]], creating mines. Specifically, mines occur when execution of a range of procedures would cause control flow to go past the last statement of a range of procedures already being performed.<ref name=\"FR99\">{{cite conference | url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ramali/Papers/paste99.pdf | title=Identifying Procedural Structure in Cobol Programs | doi=10.1145/381788.316163 | first1=John | last1=Field | first2=G. | last2=Ramalingam | format=PDF | conference=PASTE '99 | ISBN=1581131372 | conferenceurl=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/paste99.html | date=September 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"VV07\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | title=Cobol minefield detection | journal=Software\u2014Practice and Experience |date=November 2006 | volume=36 | issue=14 | doi=10.1002/spe.v36:14 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306135410/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | deadurl=yes | archivedate=6 March 2007 | publisher=Wiley | last1=Veerman | first1=Niels | last2=Verhoeven | first2=Ernst-Jan | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in the code in the adjacent image, a mine is tripped at the end of {{code|update-screen}} when the screen is invalid. When the screen is invalid, control jumps to the {{code|fix-screen}} section, which, when done, performs {{code|update-screen}}. This recursion triggers undefined behavior as there are now two overlapping ranges of procedures being performed. The mine is then triggered upon reaching the end of {{code|update-screen}} and means control could return to one of two locations:\n\n* The first {{code|PERFORM}} statement\n* The {{code|PERFORM}} statement in {{code|fix-screen}}, where it would then \"fall-through\" into {{code|update-screen}} and return to the first {{code|PERFORM}} statement upon reaching the end.\n\n====Statements====\nCOBOL 2014 has 47 statements (also called ''{{dfn|verbs}}''),{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9}} which can be grouped into the following broad categories: control flow, I/O, data manipulation and the report writer. The report writer statements are covered in the [[#Report writer|report writer section]].\n\n=====Control flow=====\nCOBOL's [[conditional (computer programming)|conditional statements]] are {{code|IF}} and {{code|EVALUATE}}. {{code|EVALUATE}} is a [[switch statement|switch-like statement]] with the added capability of evaluating multiple values and conditions. This can be used to implement [[decision table]]s. For example, the following might be used to control a [[CNC lathe]]: <!-- a more common appliance would be more suitable. -->\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nEVALUATE TRUE ALSO desired-speed ALSO current-speed\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO LESS THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM speed-up-machine\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO GREATER THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM slow-down-machine\n    WHEN lid-open ALSO ANY ALSO NOT ZERO\n        PERFORM emergency-stop\n    WHEN OTHER\n        CONTINUE\nEND-EVALUATE\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe {{code|PERFORM}} statement is used to define loops which are executed {{em|until}} a condition is true (not {{em|while}} true, which is more common in other languages). It is also used to call procedures or ranges of procedures (see the [[#Procedures|procedures section]] for more details). {{code|CALL}} and {{code|INVOKE}} call subprograms and methods, respectively. The name of the subprogram/method is contained in a string which may be a literal or a data item.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7\u00a7 14.9.4, 14.9.22}} Parameters can be passed [[call by reference|by reference]], by content (where a copy is passed by reference) or [[call by value|by value]] (but only if a [[function prototype|prototype]] is available).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.6.5.2.2}}\n{{code|CANCEL}} unloads subprograms from memory. {{code|GO TO}} causes the program to jump to a specified procedure.\n\nThe {{code|GOBACK}} statement is a [[return statement]] and the {{code|STOP}} statement stops the program. The {{code|EXIT}} statement has six different formats: it can be used as a return statement, a [[break statement]], a [[continue statement]], an end marker or to leave a procedure.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.13.1}}\n\n[[Exception handling|Exceptions]] are raised by a {{code|RAISE}} statement and caught with a handler, or ''{{dfn|declarative}}'', defined in the {{code|DECLARATIVES}} portion of the procedure division. Declaratives are sections beginning with a {{code|USE}} statement which specify the errors to handle. Exceptions can be names or objects. {{code|RESUME}} is used in a declarative to jump to the statement after the one that raised the exception or to a procedure outside the {{code|DECLARATIVES}}. Unlike other languages, uncaught exceptions may not terminate the program and the program can proceed unaffected.\n\n=====I/O=====\nFile I/O is handled by the self-describing {{code|OPEN}}, {{code|CLOSE}}, {{code|READ}}, and {{code|WRITE}} statements along with a further three: {{code|REWRITE}}, which updates a record; {{code|START}}, which selects subsequent records to access by finding a record with a certain key; and {{code|UNLOCK}}, which releases a [[lock (database)|lock]] on the last record accessed.\n\nUser interaction is done using {{code|ACCEPT}} and {{code|DISPLAY}}.\n\n=====Data manipulation=====\nThe following verbs manipulate data:\n* {{code|INITIALIZE}}, which sets data items to their default values.\n* {{code|MOVE}}, which [[assignment (computer science)|assigns]] values to data items.\n* {{code|SET}}, which has 15 formats: it can modify indices, assign object references and alter table capacities, among other functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a714.9.35.1}}\n* {{code|ADD}}, {{code|SUBTRACT}}, {{code|MULTIPLY}}, {{code|DIVIDE}}, and {{code|COMPUTE}}, which handle arithmetic (with {{code|COMPUTE}} assigning the result of a formula to a variable).\n* {{code|ALLOCATE}} and {{code|FREE}}, which handle [[dynamic memory]].\n* {{code|VALIDATE}}, which validates and distributes data as specified in an item's description in the data division.\n* {{code|STRING}} and {{code|UNSTRING}}, which [[Concatenation|concatenate]] and split [[string (computer science)|string]]s, respectively.\n* {{code|INSPECT}}, which tallies or replaces instances of specified [[substring]]s within a string.\n* {{code|SEARCH}}, which searches a table for the first entry satisfying a condition.\n\nFiles and tables are sorted using {{code|SORT}} and the {{code|MERGE}} verb merges and sorts files. The {{code|RELEASE}} verb provides records to sort and {{code|RETURN}} retrieves sorted records in order.\n\n====Scope termination====\nSome statements, such as {{code|IF}} and {{code|READ}}, may themselves contain statements. Such statements may be terminated in two ways: by a period (''{{dfn|implicit termination}}''), which terminates ''all'' unterminated statements contained, or by a scope terminator, which terminates the nearest matching open statement.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> Terminator period (\"implicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        NEXT SENTENCE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE.\n\n*> Scope terminators (\"explicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        CONTINUE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE\n        END-READ\n    END-IF\nEND-IF\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNested statements terminated with a period are a common source of bugs.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=899}}{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 8.4}} For example, examine the following code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nIF x\n    DISPLAY y.\n    DISPLAY z.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere, the intent is to display <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> if condition <code>x</code> is true. However, <code>z</code> will be displayed whatever the value of <code>x</code> because the <code>IF</code> statement is terminated by an erroneous period after {{code|DISPLAY y|lang=cobolfree}}.\n\nAnother bug is a result of the [[dangling else problem]], when two <code>IF</code> statements can associate with an <code>ELSE</code>.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nIF x\n    IF y\n        DISPLAY a\nELSE\n    DISPLAY b.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above fragment, the <code>ELSE</code> associates with the &nbsp;{{code|IF y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement instead of the &nbsp;{{code|IF x|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement, causing a bug. Prior to the introduction of explicit scope terminators, preventing it would require &nbsp;{{code|ELSE NEXT SENTENCE|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; to be placed after the inner <code>IF</code>.{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 8.4}}\n\n====Self-modifying code====\nThe original (1959) COBOL specification supported the infamous &nbsp;{{code|ALTER X TO PROCEED TO Y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement, for which many compilers generated [[self-modifying code]]. <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are procedure labels, and the single &nbsp;{{code|GO TO|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement in procedure <code>X</code> executed after such an {{code|ALTER}} statement means &nbsp;{{code|GO TO Y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; instead. Many compilers still support it,<ref>Examples of compiler support for {{code|ALTER}} can be seen in the following:\n\n* {{cite web\n |last=Tiffin \n |first=Brian \n |title=September 2014 \n |url=http://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/discussion/cobol/thread/7dc2941f/#5ee9 \n |work=GNU Cobol \n |date=18 September 2013 \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://documentation.microfocus.com/help/topic/com.microfocus.eclipse.infocenter.visualcobol.vs2013/HRLHLHPDF803.html \n |title=The ALTER Statement \n |publisher=Micro Focus \n |work=Micro Focus Visual COBOL 2.2 for Visual Studio 2013 COBOL Language Reference \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://www.csim.scu.edu.tw/~kuo/COBOL/COBOLCompiler/COBOL%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8A/cob_lrf.pdf \n |title=ALTER Statement (Nucleus) \n |publisher=Fujitsu \n |work=COBOL85 Reference Manual \n |date=November 1996 \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n |page=555 \n |format=PDF \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031540/http://www.csim.scu.edu.tw/~kuo/COBOL/COBOLCompiler/COBOL%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8A/cob_lrf.pdf \n |archivedate=6 January 2014 \n |deadurl=yes \n |df= \n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/pdthelp/v1r1/topic/com.ibm.entcobol.doc_5.1/PGandLR/ref/rlpsalte.html \n |title=ALTER Statement \n |publisher=IBM \n |work=Enterprise COBOL for z/OS Language Reference \n |date=June 2013 \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n}}</ref>\nbut it was deemed [[deprecation|obsolete]] in the COBOL 1985 standard and deleted in 2002.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.1}}\n\n===Hello, world===\nA \"[[Hello, world]]\" program in COBOL:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID. hello-world.\n       PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n           DISPLAY \"Hello, world!\"\n           .\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWhen the \u2013 now famous \u2013 [[\"Hello, World!\" program]] example in ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]'' was first published in 1978 a similar mainframe COBOL program sample would have been submitted through [[Job Control Language|JCL]], very likely using a punch card reader, and 80 column punch cards.

[[Edsger Dijkstra]], a preeminent computer scientist, wrote a [[letter to the editor]] of [[Communications of the ACM]], published 1975 entitled \"How do we tell truths that might hurt?\", in which he was critical of COBOL and several other contemporary languages; remarking that \"the use of COBOL cripples the mind\".<ref name=\"Dijkstra1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html|title=How do we tell truths that might hurt? |accessdate=August 29, 2007|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|date=18 June 1975|author=Dijkstra, Edsger W. | id=EWD498}}</ref>\nIn a published dissent to Dijkstra's remarks, the computer scientist Howard E. Tompkins claimed that unstructured COBOL tended to be \"written by programmers that have never had the benefit of structured COBOL taught well\", arguing that the issue was primarily one of training.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/948176.948186| title = In defense of teaching structured COBOL as computer science| journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices| volume = 18| issue = 4| pages = 86| year = 1983| last1 = Tompkins | first1 = H. E. | subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\nOne cause of [[spaghetti code]] was the {{code|GO TO}} statement. Attempts to remove {{code|GO TO}}s from COBOL code, however, resulted in convoluted programs and reduced code quality.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} {{code|GO TO}}s were largely replaced by the {{code|PERFORM}} statement and procedures, which promoted [[modular programming]]{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} and gave easy access to powerful looping facilities. However, {{code|PERFORM}} could only be used with procedures so loop bodies were not located where they were used, making programs harder to understand.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\nCOBOL programs were infamous for being monolithic and lacking modularization.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJmJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4 | title=Beginning COBOL for Programmers | publisher=Apress | accessdate=13 August 2014 | page=4 | first=Michael | last=Coughlan | isbn=1430262532 | date=16 March 2014}}</ref>\nCOBOL code could only be modularized through procedures, which were found to be inadequate for large systems. It was impossible to restrict access to data, meaning a procedure could access and modify {{em|any}} data item. Furthermore, there was no way to pass [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s to a procedure, an omission Jean Sammet regarded as the committee's biggest mistake.{{sfn|Sammet|1978b|p=258}}\nAnother complication stemmed from the ability to {{code|PERFORM THRU}} a specified sequence of procedures. This meant that control could jump to and return from any procedure, creating convoluted control flow and permitting a programmer to break the [[single-entry single-exit]] rule.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=126}}\n\nThis situation improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers the ability to control the data each part of the program could access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=127}} Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object-oriented programming, user-defined functions and user-defined data types were included.\n\nNevertheless, much important legacy COBOL software uses unstructured code, which has become unmaintainable. It can be too risky and costly to modify even a simple section of code, since it may be used from unknown places in unknown ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/07/cobol-and-legacy-code-as-a-systemic-risk.html?imm_mid=0e6043&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20160723|title=COBOL and Legacy Code as a Systemic Risk {{!}} naked capitalism|date=2016-07-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Compatibility issues===\nCOBOL was intended to be a highly portable, \"common\" language.

Yet by 1984, maintainers of COBOL programs were struggling to deal with \"incomprehensible\" code{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/10}} and the main changes in COBOL-85 were there to help ease maintenance.<ref name=\"Computerworld Garfunkel\" />\n\nJean Sammet, a short-range committee member, noted that \"little attempt was made to cater to the professional programmer, in fact people whose main interest is programming tend to be very unhappy with COBOL\" which she attributed to COBOL's verbose syntax.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/14}}\n\n===Isolation from the computer science community===\nThe COBOL community has always been isolated from the computer science community. No academic computer scientists participated in the design of COBOL: all of those on the committee came from commerce or government. Computer scientists at the time were more interested in fields like numerical analysis, physics and system programming than the commercial file-processing problems which COBOL development tackled.{{sfn|Sammet|1961|p=380}} Jean Sammet attributed COBOL's unpopularity to an initial \"snob reaction\" due to its inelegance, the lack of influential computer scientists participating in the design process and a disdain for business data processing.{{sfn|Marcotty|1978|p=266}} The COBOL specification used a unique \"notation\", or [[metalanguage]], to define its syntax rather than the new [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] which the committee did not know of. This resulted in \"severe\" criticism.{{sfn|Sammet|1978b|p=255}}{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|pp=348\u2013349}}{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=133}}\n\nLater, COBOL suffered from a shortage of material covering it; it took until 1963 for introductory books to appear (with Richard D. Irwin publishing a college textbook on COBOL in 1966).<ref>https://books.bibliopolis.com/main/find/2200821/COBOL-Logic-and-Programming-third-edition-1974-McCameron-Fritz-oldcomputerbooks-com.html</ref> By 1985, there were twice as many books on Fortran and four times as many on BASIC as on COBOL in the [[Library of Congress]].{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=349}} University professors taught more modern, state-of-the-art languages and techniques instead of COBOL which was said to have a \"trade school\" nature.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=351}} Donald Nelson, chair of the CODASYL COBOL committee, said in 1984 that \"academics ... hate COBOL\" and that computer science graduates \"had 'hate COBOL' drilled into them\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQhbdDusHcsC&pg=RA1-PA61 | title=An interview: Cobol defender | work=Computerworld | date=10 September 1984 | accessdate=8 June 2014 | author=<!-- Staff writer(s); No by-line --> | pages=ID/29\u2013ID/32 | issn=0010-4841 | volume=18 | issue=37}}</ref> A 2013 poll by [[Micro Focus]] found that 20% of university academics thought COBOL was outdated or dead and that 55% believed their students thought COBOL was outdated or dead.

Short-term committee member Howard Bromberg said that there was \"little control\" over the development process and that it was \"plagued by discontinuity of personnel and ... a lack of talent.\"{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=301}} Jean Sammet and Jerome Garfunkel also noted that changes introduced in one revision of the standard would be reverted in the next, due as much to changes in who was in the standard committee as to objective evidence.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Summary of Changes in COBOL, 1960\u20131985 | journal=Annals of the History of Computing | date=October 1985 | volume=7 | issue=4 | pages=342 | first1=Jean | last1=Sammet | first2=Jerome | last2=Garfunkel | publisher=IEEE | doi=10.1109/MAHC.1985.10033 | subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\nCOBOL standards have repeatedly suffered from delays: COBOL-85 arrived five years later than hoped,<ref>{{cite conference | url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/afips/1978/5086/00/50861107.pdf | title=Data Base Facility for COBOL 80 | first=Margaret M. | last=Cook | conference=1978 National Computer Conference | quote=The earliest date that a new COBOL standard could be developed and approved is the year 1980 [...]. | pages=1107\u20131112 | publisher=AFIPS Press | date=June 1978 | location=Anaheim, California | lccn= 55-44701 | doi=10.1109/AFIPS.1978.63 | accessdate=2 September 2014 | format=PDF | editor1-last=Ghosh | editor1-first=Sakti P. | editor2-last=Liu | editor2-first=Leonard Y.}}</ref>\nCOBOL 2002 was five years late,<ref name=\"SW95\"/>\nand COBOL 2014 was six years late.<ref name=\"cobolstandards.com\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cobolstandard.info/wg4/open/wg4n0188.doc | title=Resolutions from WG4 meeting 24 - June 26-28, 2003 Las Vegas, Nevada, USA | date=11 July 2003 | accessdate=29 June 2014 | format=doc | quote=a June 2008 revision of the COBOL standard | page=1 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308015945/http://www.cobolstandard.info/wg4/open/wg4n0188.doc | archivedate=8 March 2016}}</ref>\nTo combat delays, the standard committee allowed the creation of optional addenda which would add features more quickly than by waiting for the next standard revision.

Its record and file structure influenced [[PL/I]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and the <code>REDEFINES</code> clause was a predecessor to Pascal's variant records. Explicit file structure definitions preceded the development of [[database management systems]] and aggregated data was a significant advance over Fortran's arrays.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=349}}\n<code>PICTURE</code> data declarations were incorporated into PL/I, with minor changes.\n\nCOBOL's {{code|COPY}} facility, although considered

This is achieved by \"shifting\" the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive ''bins'' in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins.\n\nIn recent years CCD has become a major technology for [[digital imaging]]. In a CCD [[image sensor]], [[pixel]]s are represented by [[Doping (semiconductor)|p-doped]] [[MOSFET#Metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor structure|metal-oxide-semiconductors]] (MOS) capacitors. These capacitors are biased above the threshold for inversion when image acquisition begins, allowing the conversion of incoming [[photon]]s into electron charges at the semiconductor-oxide interface; the CCD is then used to read out these charges. Although CCDs are not the only technology to allow for light detection, CCD image sensors are widely used in professional, medical, and scientific applications where high-quality image data are required. In applications with less exacting quality demands, such as consumer and professional [[digital camera]]s, [[active pixel sensor]]s, also known as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors ([[CMOS]]) are generally used; the large quality advantage CCDs enjoyed early on has narrowed over time.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nobel Prize 2009-Press Conference KVA-19.jpg|thumb|240px|George E.

Applying positive voltage to the gate electrode in the correct sequence transfers the charge packets.]]\n\nIn a CCD for capturing images, there is a photoactive region (an [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] layer of silicon), and a transmission region made out of a [[shift register]] (the CCD, properly speaking).\n\nAn image is projected through a [[lens (optics)|lens]] onto the capacitor array (the photoactive region), causing each capacitor to accumulate an electric charge proportional to the [[light]] intensity at that location. A one-dimensional array, used in line-scan cameras, captures a single slice of the image, whereas a two-dimensional array, used in video and still cameras, captures a two-dimensional picture corresponding to the scene projected onto the focal plane of the sensor. Once the array has been exposed to the image, a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer its contents to its neighbor (operating as a shift register). The last capacitor in the array dumps its charge into a [[charge amplifier]], which converts the charge into a [[voltage]]. By repeating this process, the controlling circuit converts the entire contents of the array in the semiconductor to a sequence of voltages. In a digital device, these voltages are then sampled, digitized, and usually stored in memory; in an analog device (such as an analog video camera), they are processed into a continuous analog signal (e.g. by feeding the output of the charge amplifier into a low-pass filter), which is then processed and fed out to other circuits for transmission, recording, or other processing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Gilbert F.

The gate is then biased at a positive potential, above the threshold for strong inversion, which will eventually result in the creation of a ''n'' channel below the gate as in a [[MOSFET]]. However, it takes time to reach this thermal equilibrium: up to hours in high-end scientific cameras cooled at low temperature.<ref>For instance, the specsheet of PI/Acton's [http://www.princetoninstruments.com/Uploads/Princeton/Documents/Datasheets/Princeton_Instruments_SPEC-10_2K_eXcelon_rev_N3_9.22.2011.pdf SPEC-10 camera] specifies a dark current of 0.3 electron per pixel per hour at -110 \u00b0C.</ref> Initially after biasing, the holes are pushed far into the substrate, and no mobile electrons are at or near the surface; the CCD thus operates in a non-equilibrium state called deep depletion.<ref name=sze>{{cite book\n | last1 = Sze\n | first1 = S.

Four pair-generation processes can be identified:\n* photo-generation (up to 95% of [[quantum efficiency]]),\n* generation in the depletion region,\n* generation at the surface, and\n* generation in the neutral bulk.\n\nThe last three processes are known as dark-current generation, and add noise to the image; they can limit the total usable integration time. The accumulation of electrons at or near the surface can proceed either until image integration is over and charge begins to be transferred, or thermal equilibrium is reached. In this case, the well is said to be full. The maximum capacity of each well is known as the well depth,<ref>[http://www.ccd.com/ccd103.html Apogee CCD University - Pixel Binning]</ref> typically about 10<sup>5</sup> electrons per pixel.<ref name=sze />\n\n=== Design and manufacturing ===\nThe photoactive region of a CCD is, generally, an [[epitaxial]] layer of [[silicon]]. It is lightly ''p'' doped (usually with [[boron]]) and is grown upon a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]] material, often p++. In buried-channel devices, the type of design utilized in most modern CCDs, certain areas of the surface of the silicon are [[ion implantation|ion implanted]] with [[phosphorus]], giving them an n-doped designation. This region defines the channel in which the photogenerated charge packets will travel. [[Simon Sze]] details the advantages of a buried-channel device:<ref name=sze />\n<blockquote>This thin layer (= 0.2\u20130.3 micron) is fully depleted and the accumulated photogenerated charge is kept away from the surface. This structure has the advantages of higher transfer efficiency and lower dark current, from reduced surface recombination. The penalty is smaller charge capacity, by a factor of 2\u20133 compared to the surface-channel CCD.</blockquote> The gate oxide, i.e. the [[capacitor]] [[dielectric]], is grown on top of the epitaxial layer and substrate.\n\nLater in the process, [[polysilicon]] gates are deposited by [[chemical vapor deposition]], patterned with [[photolithography]], and etched in such a way that the separately phased gates lie perpendicular to the channels. The channels are further defined by utilization of the [[LOCOS]] process to produce the [[channel stop]] region.\n\nChannel stops are thermally grown [[oxide]]s that serve to isolate the charge packets in one column from those in another. These channel stops are produced before the polysilicon gates are, as the LOCOS process utilizes a high-temperature step that would destroy the gate material. The channel stops are parallel to, and exclusive of, the channel, or \"charge carrying\", regions.\n\nChannel stops often have a p+ doped region underlying them, providing a further barrier to the electrons in the charge packets (this discussion of the physics of CCD devices assumes an [[electron]] transfer device, though hole transfer is possible).\n\nThe clocking of the gates, alternately high and low, will forward and reverse bias the diode that is provided by the buried channel (n-doped) and the epitaxial layer (p-doped). This will cause the CCD to deplete, near the [[p\u2013n junction]] and will collect and move the charge packets beneath the gates\u2014and within the channels\u2014of the device.\n\nCCD manufacturing and operation can be optimized for different uses. The above process describes a frame transfer CCD. While CCDs may be manufactured on a heavily doped p++ wafer it is also possible to manufacture a device inside p-wells that have been placed on an n-wafer. This second method, reportedly, reduces smear, [[dark current (physics)|dark current]], and [[infrared]] and red response. This method of manufacture is used in the construction of interline-transfer devices.\n\nAnother version of CCD is called a peristaltic CCD. In a peristaltic charge-coupled device, the charge-packet transfer operation is analogous to the peristaltic contraction and dilation of the [[digestive system]]. The peristaltic CCD has an additional implant that keeps the charge away from the silicon/[[silicon dioxide]] interface and generates a large lateral electric field from one gate to the next. This provides an additional driving force to aid in transfer of the charge packets.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe CCD image sensors can be implemented in several different architectures. The most common are full-frame, frame-transfer, and interline. The distinguishing characteristic of each of these architectures is their approach to the problem of shuttering.\n\nIn a full-frame device, all of the image area is active, and there is no electronic shutter. A mechanical shutter must be added to this type of sensor or the image smears as the device is clocked or read out.\n\nWith a frame-transfer CCD, half of the silicon area is covered by an opaque mask (typically aluminum). The image can be quickly transferred from the image area to the opaque area or storage region with acceptable smear of a few percent. That image can then be read out slowly from the storage region while a new image is integrating or exposing in the active area. Frame-transfer devices typically do not require a mechanical shutter and were a common architecture for early solid-state broadcast cameras. The downside to the frame-transfer architecture is that it requires twice the silicon real estate of an equivalent full-frame device; hence, it costs roughly twice as much.\n\nThe interline architecture extends this concept one step further and masks every other column of the image sensor for storage. In this device, only one pixel shift has to occur to transfer from image area to storage area; thus, shutter times can be less than a microsecond and smear is essentially eliminated. The advantage is not free, however, as the imaging area is now covered by opaque strips dropping the [[fill factor (image sensor)|fill factor]] to approximately 50 percent and the effective [[quantum efficiency]] by an equivalent amount. Modern designs have addressed this deleterious characteristic by adding microlenses on the surface of the device to direct light away from the opaque regions and on the active area. Microlenses can bring the fill factor back up to 90 percent or more depending on pixel size and the overall system's optical design.\n\n[[Image:ArgusCCD.jpg|thumb|right|CCD from a 2.1 [[megapixel]] [[Argus (camera company)|Argus]] digital camera]]\n\n[[File:CCD SONY ICX493AQA sensor side.jpg|thumb|CCD Sony ICX493AQA 10.14 (Gross 10.75) [[megapixel|Mpixels]] [[APS-C]] 1.8\" (23.98 x 16.41mm) sensor side]]\n\n[[File:CCD SONY ICX493AQA pins side.jpg|thumb|CCD Sony ICX493AQA 10.14 (Gross 10.75) [[megapixel|Mpixels]] [[APS-C]] 1.8\" (23.98 x 16.41mm) pins side]]\n\nThe choice of architecture comes down to one of utility. If the application cannot tolerate an expensive, failure-prone, power-intensive mechanical shutter, an interline device is the right choice. Consumer snap-shot cameras have used interline devices. On the other hand, for those applications that require the best possible light collection and issues of money, power and time are less important, the full-frame device is the right choice. Astronomers tend to prefer full-frame devices. The frame-transfer falls in between and was a common choice before the fill-factor issue of interline devices was addressed. Today, frame-transfer is usually chosen when an interline architecture is not available, such as in a back-illuminated device.\n\nCCDs containing grids of [[pixel]]s are used in [[digital camera]]s, [[image scanner|optical scanners]], and video cameras as light-sensing devices. They commonly respond to 70 percent of the [[Ray_(optics)#incident_ray|incident]] light (meaning a quantum efficiency of about 70 percent) making them far more efficient than [[photographic film]], which captures only about 2 percent of the incident light.\n\n[[Image:2.1 MP CCD Close Up.JPG|thumb|right|CCD from a 2.1 [[megapixel]] [[Hewlett-Packard]] digital camera]]\n\nMost common types of CCDs are sensitive to near-infrared light, which allows [[infrared photography]], [[night-vision]] devices, and zero [[lux]] (or near zero lux) video-recording/photography. For normal silicon-based detectors, the sensitivity is limited to 1.1&nbsp;\u03bcm. One other consequence of their sensitivity to infrared is that infrared from [[remote control]]s often appears on CCD-based digital cameras or camcorders if they do not have infrared blockers.\n\nCooling reduces the array's [[dark current (physics)|dark current]], improving the sensitivity of the CCD to low light intensities, even for ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. Professional observatories often cool their detectors with [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce the dark current, and therefore the [[thermal noise]], to negligible levels.\n\n===Frame transfer CCD===\n[[File:IECCD55-20.jpg|thumb|top|A frame transfer CCD sensor]]\n\nThe frame transfer CCD imager was the first imaging structure proposed for CCD Imaging by Michael Tompsett at Bell Laboratories. A '''frame transfer CCD''' is a specialized CCD, often used in [[astronomy]] and some [[professional video camera]]s, designed for high exposure efficiency and correctness.\n\nThe normal functioning of a CCD, astronomical or otherwise, can be divided into two phases: exposure and readout. During the first phase, the CCD passively collects incoming [[photon]]s, storing [[electron]]s in its cells. After the exposure time is passed, the cells are read out one line at a time. During the readout phase, cells are shifted down the entire area of the CCD. While they are shifted, they continue to collect light. Thus, if the shifting is not fast enough, errors can result from light that falls on a cell holding charge during the transfer. These errors are referred to as \"vertical smear\" and cause a strong light source to create a vertical line above and below its exact location. In addition, the CCD cannot be used to collect light while it is being read out. Unfortunately, a faster shifting requires a faster readout, and a faster readout can introduce errors in the cell charge measurement, leading to a higher noise level.\n\nA frame transfer CCD solves both problems: it has a shielded, not light sensitive, area containing as many cells as the area exposed to light. Typically, this area is covered by a reflective material such as aluminium. When the exposure time is up, the cells are transferred very rapidly to the hidden area. Here, safe from any incoming light, cells can be read out at any speed one deems necessary to correctly measure the cells' charge. At the same time, the exposed part of the CCD is collecting light again, so no delay occurs between successive exposures.\n\nThe disadvantage of such a CCD is the higher cost: the cell area is basically doubled, and more complex control electronics are needed.\n\n===Intensified charge-coupled device===\n{{Main article|Image intensifier}}\nAn intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) is a CCD that is optically connected to an image intensifier that is mounted in front of the CCD.\n\nAn image intensifier includes three functional elements: a [[photocathode]], a [[micro-channel plate]] (MCP) and a [[phosphor]] screen. These three elements are mounted one close behind the other in the mentioned sequence. The photons which are coming from the light source fall onto the photocathode, thereby generating photoelectrons. The photoelectrons are accelerated towards the MCP by an electrical control voltage, applied between photocathode and MCP. The electrons are multiplied inside of the MCP and thereafter accelerated towards the phosphor screen. The phosphor screen finally converts the multiplied electrons back to photons which are guided to the CCD by a fiber optic or a lens.\n\nAn image intensifier inherently includes a [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] functionality: If the control voltage between the photocathode and the MCP is reversed, the emitted photoelectrons are not accelerated towards the MCP but return to the photocathode. Thus, no electrons are multiplied and emitted by the MCP, no electrons are going to the phosphor screen and no light is emitted from the image intensifier. In this case no light falls onto the CCD, which means that the shutter is closed. The process of reversing the control voltage at the photocathode is called ''gating'' and therefore ICCDs are also called gateable CCD cameras.\n\nBesides the extremely high sensitivity of ICCD cameras, which enable single photon detection, the gateability is one of the major advantages of the ICCD over the [[charge-coupled device#Electron-multiplying CCD|EMCCD]] cameras. The highest performing ICCD cameras enable shutter times as short as 200 [[picosecond]]s.\n\nICCD cameras are in general somewhat higher in price than EMCCD cameras because they need the expensive image intensifier. On the other hand, EMCCD cameras need a cooling system to cool the EMCCD chip down to temperatures around 170 [[Kelvin|K]]. This cooling system adds additional costs to the EMCCD camera and often yields heavy condensation problems in the application.\n\nICCDs are used in [[night vision devices]] and in various scientific applications.\n\n=== Electron-multiplying CCD ===\n[[Image:EMCCD2 color en.svg|thumb|Electrons are transferred serially through the gain stages making up the multiplication register of an [[#Electron-multiplying CCD|EMCCD]]. The high voltages used in these serial transfers induce the creation of additional charge carriers through impact ionisation.]]\n[[Image:Output vs input electrons.png|thumb|in an [[#Electron-multiplying CCD|EMCCD]] there is a dispersion (variation) in the number of electrons output by the multiplication register for a given (fixed) number of input electrons (shown in the legend on the right). The probability distribution for the number of output electrons is plotted [[logarithm]]ically on the vertical axis for a simulation of a multiplication register. Also shown are results from the [[empiricism|empirical]] fit equation shown on this page.]]\n\nAn '''electron-multiplying CCD''' (EMCCD, also known as an L3Vision CCD, a product commercialized by e2v Ltd., GB, L3CCD or Impactron CCD, a now-discontinued product offered in the past by Texas Instruments) is a charge-coupled device in which a gain register is placed between the shift register and the output amplifier. The gain register is split up into a large number of stages. In each stage, the electrons are multiplied by [[impact ionization]] in a similar way to an [[avalanche diode]]. The gain probability at every stage of the register is small (''P'' < 2%), but as the number of elements is large (N > 500), the overall gain can be very high (<math>g = (1 + P)^N</math>), with single input electrons giving many thousands of output electrons. Reading a signal from a CCD gives a noise background, typically a few electrons. In an EMCCD, this noise is superimposed on many thousands of electrons rather than a single electron; the devices' primary advantage is thus their negligible readout noise. It is to be noted that the use of [[avalanche breakdown]] for amplification of photo charges had already been described in the {{US patent|3761744}} in 1973 by George E. Smith/Bell Telephone Laboratories.\n\nEMCCDs show a similar sensitivity to [[charge-coupled device#Intensified charge-coupled device|intensified CCDs]] (ICCDs). However, as with ICCDs, the gain that is applied in the gain register is stochastic and the ''exact'' gain that has been applied to a pixel's charge is impossible to know. At high gains (> 30), this uncertainty has the same effect on the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) as halving the [[quantum efficiency]] (QE) with respect to operation with a gain of unity. However, at very low light levels (where the quantum efficiency is most important), it can be assumed that a pixel either contains an electron &mdash; or not. This removes the noise associated with the stochastic multiplication at the risk of counting multiple electrons in the same pixel as a single electron. To avoid multiple counts in one pixel due to coincident photons in this mode of operation, high frame rates are essential. The dispersion in the gain is shown in the graph on the right. For multiplication registers with many elements and large gains it is well modelled by the equation:\n\n<math>P\\left (n \\right ) = \\frac{\\left\n (n-m+1\\right )^{m-1}}{\\left (m-1 \\right )!\\left\n (g-1+\\frac{1}{m}\\right )^{m}}\\exp \\left ( -\n \\frac{n-m+1}{g-1+\\frac{1}{m}}\\right )</math> if <math>n \\ge m </math>\n\nwhere ''P'' is the probability of getting ''n'' output electrons given ''m'' input electrons and a total mean multiplication register gain of ''g''.\n\nBecause of the lower costs and better resolution, EMCCDs are capable of replacing ICCDs in many applications. ICCDs still have the advantage that they can be gated very fast and thus are useful in applications like [[range gate|range-gated imaging]]. EMCCD cameras indispensably need a cooling system &mdash; using either [[thermoelectric cooling]] or liquid nitrogen &mdash; to cool the chip down to temperatures in the range of {{convert|-65|to|-95|C}}. This cooling system unfortunately adds additional costs to the EMCCD imaging system and may yield condensation problems in the application. However, high-end EMCCD cameras are equipped with a permanent hermetic vacuum system confining the chip to avoid condensation issues.\n\nThe low-light capabilities of EMCCDs find use in astronomy and biomedical research, among other fields.  In particular, their low noise at high readout speeds makes them very useful for a variety of astronomical applications involving low light sources and transient events such as [[lucky imaging]] of faint stars, high speed [[photon counting]] photometry, [[Fabry-P\u00e9rot|Fabry-P\u00e9rot spectroscopy]] and high-resolution spectroscopy. More recently, these types of CCDs have broken into the field of biomedical research in low-light applications including [[small animal imaging]], [[single-molecule|single-molecule imaging]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[super resolution microscopy]] as well as a wide variety of modern [[fluorescence microscopy]] techniques thanks to greater SNR in low-light conditions in comparison with traditional CCDs and ICCDs.\n\nIn terms of noise, commercial EMCCD cameras typically have clock-induced charge (CIC) and dark current (dependent on the extent of cooling) that together lead to an effective readout noise ranging from 0.01 to 1 electrons per pixel read. However, recent improvements in EMCCD technology have led to a new generation of cameras capable of producing significantly less CIC, higher charge transfer efficiency and an EM gain 5 times higher than what was previously available. These advances in low-light detection lead to an effective total background noise of 0.001 electrons per pixel read, a noise floor unmatched by any other low-light imaging device.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Daigle | first1 = Olivier\n | last2 = Djazovski | first2 = Oleg\n | last3 = Laurin | first3 = Denis\n | last4 = Doyon | first4 = Ren\u00e9\n | last5 = Artigau | first5 = \u00c9tienne\n | title = Characterization results of EMCCDs for extreme low light imaging\n | date = July 2012\n | url = http://www.nuvucameras.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Characterization-results-of-EMCCDs-for-extreme-low-light-imaging.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Use in astronomy ==\nDue to the high quantum efficiencies of CCDs (for a [[quantum efficiency]] of 100%, one count equals one photon), linearity of their outputs, ease of use compared to photographic plates, and a variety of other reasons, CCDs were very rapidly adopted by astronomers for nearly all UV-to-infrared applications.\n\nThermal noise and [[cosmic ray]]s may alter the pixels in the CCD array. To counter such effects, astronomers take several exposures with the CCD shutter closed and opened. The average of images taken with the shutter closed is necessary to lower the random noise. Once developed, the [[dark frame subtraction|dark frame average image is then subtracted]] from the open-shutter image to remove the dark current and other systematic defects ([[dead pixel]]s, hot pixels, etc.) in the CCD.\n\nThe [[Hubble Space Telescope]], in particular, has a highly developed series of steps (\u201cdata reduction pipeline\u201d) to convert the raw CCD data to useful images.<ref name = \"ESO-Hainaut-CCD image processing\">\n{{Cite web| url = http://www.eso.org/~ohainaut/ccd | title = Basic CCD image processing |date = December 2006| last = Hainaut | first = Oliver R. | accessdate = January 15, 2011 }}<br>\n{{Cite web| url = http://www.eso.org/~ohainaut/ccd/sn.html | title = Signal, Noise and Detection | date = June 1, 2005 | last = Hainaut | first = Oliver R. | accessdate = October 7, 2009 }}<br>\n{{Cite web| url = http://www.eso.org/~ohainaut/images/imageProc.html | title = Retouching of astronomical data for the production of outreach images | date = May 20, 2009 | last = Hainaut | first = Oliver R. | accessdate = October 7, 2009 }} <br>(Hainaut is an astronomer at the [http://www.eso.org/~ohainaut/cv.html European Southern Observatory]) <br>\n</ref>\n\nCCD cameras used in [[astrophotography]] often require sturdy mounts to cope with vibrations from wind and other sources, along with the tremendous weight of most imaging platforms. To take long exposures of galaxies and nebulae, many astronomers use a technique known as [[autoguider|auto-guiding]]. Most autoguiders use a second CCD chip to monitor deviations during imaging. This chip can rapidly detect errors in tracking and command the mount motors to correct for them.\n\n[[Image:SDSSFaceplate.gif|thumb|right|Array of 30 CCDs used on the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] telescope imaging camera, an example of \"drift-scanning\".]]\n\nAn unusual astronomical application of CCDs, called drift-scanning, uses a CCD to make a fixed telescope behave like a tracking telescope and follow the motion of the sky. The charges in the CCD are transferred and read in a direction parallel to the motion of the sky, and at the same speed. In this way, the telescope can image a larger region of the sky than its normal field of view. The [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] is the most famous example of this, using the technique to a survey of over a quarter of the sky.\n\nIn addition to imagers, CCDs are also used in an array of analytical instrumentation  including [[spectrometer]]s<ref>V. Deckert and W. Kiefer, Scanning multichannel technique for improved spectrochemical measurements with a CCD camera and its application to Raman spectroscopy, ''Appl. Spectros.''

Each square of four pixels has one filtered red, one blue, and two green (the [[human eye]] is more sensitive to green than either red or blue). The result of this is that [[luminance]] information is collected at every pixel, but the color resolution is lower than the luminance resolution.\n\nBetter color separation can be reached by three-CCD devices ([[3CCD]]) and a [[dichroic prism|dichroic beam splitter prism]], that splits the [[image]] into [[red]], [[green]] and [[blue]] components. Each of the three CCDs is arranged to respond to a particular color. Many [[professional video camera|professional video]] camcorders, and some semi-professional camcorders, use this technique, although developments in competing CMOS technology have made CMOS sensors, both with beam-splitters and bayer filters, increasingly popular in high-end video and digital cinema cameras. Another advantage of 3CCD over a Bayer mask device is higher [[quantum efficiency]] (and therefore higher light sensitivity for a given aperture size). This is because in a 3CCD device most of the light entering the aperture is captured by a sensor, while a Bayer mask absorbs a high proportion (about 2/3) of the light falling on each CCD pixel.\n\nFor still scenes, for instance in microscopy, the resolution of a Bayer mask device can be enhanced by [[microscanning]] technology. During the process of [[co-site sampling|color co-site sampling]], several frames of the scene are produced. Between acquisitions, the sensor is moved in pixel dimensions, so that each point in the visual field is acquired consecutively by elements of the mask that are sensitive to the red, green and blue components of its color. Eventually every pixel in the image has been scanned at least once in each color and the resolution of the three channels become equivalent (the resolutions of red and blue channels are quadrupled while the green channel is doubled).\n\n===Sensor sizes===\n{{Main article|Image sensor format}}\nSensors (CCD / CMOS) come in various sizes, or image sensor formats. These sizes are often referred to with an inch fraction designation such as 1/1.8\u2033 or 2/3\u2033 called the [[optical format]]. This measurement actually originates back in the 1950s and the time of [[video camera tube|Vidicon tubes]].\n\n== Blooming ==<!--[[Blooming (CCD)]] redirects here-->\n[[Image:Vertical smear.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vertical smear]]\nWhen a CCD exposure is long enough, eventually the electrons that collect in the \"bins\" in the brightest part of the image will overflow the bin, resulting in blooming. The structure of the CCD allows the electrons to flow more easily in one direction than another, resulting in vertical streaking.<ref>\nPhil Plait.

Computer memory operates at a high speed, for example [[random-access memory]] (RAM), as a distinction from [[Computer data storage|storage]] that provides slow-to-access [[Computer data storage|information]] but offers higher capacities. If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to [[secondary storage]]; a very common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called \"[[virtual memory]]\". An archaic synonym for memory is '''store'''.<ref>[[Alan Turing|A.M. Turing]] and R.A. Brooker (1952).

University of Manchester.</ref>\n\nThe term \"memory\", meaning \"primary storage\" or \"[[main memory]]\", is often associated with addressable [[semiconductor memory]], i.e. integrated circuits consisting of [[silicon]]-based [[transistor]]s, used for example as primary storage but also other purposes in computers and other [[Digital data|digital]] [[Electronics|electronic]] devices. There are two main kinds of semiconductor memory, [[volatile memory|volatile]] and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]]. Examples of [[non-volatile memory]] are [[flash memory]] (used as secondary memory) and [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]], [[EPROM]] and [[EEPROM]] memory (used for storing [[firmware]] such as [[BIOS]]). Examples of [[volatile memory]] are primary storage, which is typically [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM), and fast [[CPU cache]] memory, which is typically [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM) that is fast but energy-consuming, offering lower memory [[Areal density (computer storage)|areal density]] than DRAM.\n\nMost semiconductor memory is organized into [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cells]] or [[bistable flip-flop]]s, each storing one [[bit]] (0 or 1). [[Flash memory]] organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multiple bits per cell (called MLC, Multiple Level Cell).  The memory cells are grouped into words of fixed [[word length]], for example 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bit. Each word can be accessed by a binary address of ''N'' bit, making it possible to store 2 raised by ''N'' words in the memory. This implies that [[processor register]]s normally are not considered as memory, since they only store one word and do not include an addressing mechanism.\n\nTypical secondary storage devices are [[hard disk drive]]s and [[solid-state drive]]s.\n\n[[File:RAM Module (SDRAM-DDR4).jpg|thumb|Modern DDR4 SDRAM module, usually found in desktop computers]]\n\n== History ==\n[[File:ENIAC Penn2.jpg|left|thumbnnail200px|thumb|Detail of the back of a section of ENIAC, showing vacuum tubes]]\n\nIn the early 1940s, memory technology often permitted a capacity of a few bytes.  The first electronic programmable [[digital computer]], the [[ENIAC]], using thousands of octal-base radio [[vacuum tube]]s, could perform simple calculations involving 20 numbers of ten decimal digits which were held in the vacuum tube [[accumulator (computing)|accumulators]].\n\nThe next significant advance in computer memory came with acoustic [[delay line memory]], developed by [[J. Presper Eckert]] in the early 1940s.  Through the construction of a glass tube filled with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and plugged at each end with a quartz crystal, delay lines could store bits of information in the form of sound waves propagating through mercury, with the quartz crystals acting as [[transducer]]s to read and write bits. [[Delay line memory]] would be limited to a capacity of up to a few hundred thousand bits to remain efficient.\n\nTwo alternatives to the delay line, the [[Williams tube]] and [[Selectron tube]], originated in 1946, both using electron beams in glass tubes as means of storage.  Using [[cathode ray tube]]s, Fred Williams would invent the Williams tube, which would be the first [[random-access memory|random-access computer memory]].  The Williams tube would prove more capacious than the Selectron tube (the Selectron was limited to 256 bits, while the Williams tube could store thousands) and less expensive.  The Williams tube would nevertheless prove to be frustratingly sensitive to environmental disturbances.\n\nEfforts began in the late 1940s to find [[non-volatile memory]]. [[Jay Forrester]], [[Jan A. Rajchman]] and [[An Wang]] developed [[magnetic-core memory]], which allowed for recall of memory after power loss.  Magnetic core memory would become the dominant form of memory until the development of [[transistor]]-based memory in the late 1960s.\n\nDevelopments in technology and economies of scale have made possible so-called Very Large Memory (VLM) computers.<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Stanek\n |first       = William R.\n |title       = Windows Server 2008 Inside Out\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=SbxixF4iAEcC\n |accessdate  = 2012-08-20\n |year        = 2009\n |publisher   = O'Reilly Media, Inc.\n |isbn        = 978-0-7356-3806-8\n |pages       = 1520\n |quote       = [...] Windows Server Enterprise supports clustering with up to eight-node clusters and very large memory (VLM) configurations of up to 32&nbsp;GB on 32-bit systems and 2&nbsp;TB on 64-bit systems.\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130127064935/http://books.google.com/books?id=SbxixF4iAEcC\n |archivedate = 2013-01-27\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"memory\" when used with reference to computers generally refers to [[random-access memory]] (RAM).\n\n== Volatile memory ==\n[[File:Kinds-of-RAM.JPG|thumb|Various memory modules containing different types of DRAM (from top to bottom): DDR SDRAM, SDRAM, EDO DRAM, and FPM DRAM]]\n{{Main|Volatile memory}}\n\nVolatile memory is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information.  Most modern [[semiconductor]] volatile memory is either static RAM ([[Static random-access memory|SRAM]]) or dynamic RAM ([[DRAM]]). SRAM retains its contents as long as the power is connected and is easy for interfacing, but uses six transistors per bit. Dynamic RAM is more complicated for interfacing and control, needing regular refresh cycles to prevent losing its contents, but uses only one transistor and one capacitor per bit, allowing it to reach much higher densities and much cheaper per-bit costs.\n\nSRAM is not worthwhile for desktop system memory, where DRAM dominates, but is used for their cache memories.  SRAM is commonplace in small embedded systems, which might only need tens of kilobytes or less. Forthcoming volatile memory technologies that aim at replacing or competing with SRAM and DRAM include [[Z-RAM]] and [[A-RAM]].\n\n== Non-volatile memory ==\n[[File:Intel X25-M Solid-State Drive.jpg|thumb|[[Solid-state drive]]s are one example of non-volatile memory.]]\n{{Main|Non-volatile memory}}\n\nNon-volatile memory is computer memory that can retain the stored information even when not powered. Examples of non-volatile memory include read-only memory (see [[Read-only memory|ROM]]), [[flash memory]], most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g. [[hard disk drive]]s, [[floppy disk]]s and [[magnetic tape]]), [[optical disc]]s, and early computer storage methods such as [[paper tape]] and [[punched card]]s.\n\nForthcoming non-volatile memory technologies include [[FeRAM]], [[CBRAM]], [[parallel random-access machine|PRAM]], [[STT-RAM]], [[SONOS]], [[RRAM]], [[racetrack memory]], [[Nano-RAM|NRAM]], [[3D XPoint]], and [[millipede memory]].\n\n== Semi-volatile memory ==\n\nA third category of memory is \"semi-volatile\".  The term is used to describe a memory which has some limited non-volatile duration after power is removed, but then data is ultimately lost.  A typical goal when using a semi-volatile memory is to provide high performance/durability/etc. associated with volatile memories, while providing some benefits of a true non-volatile memory.\n\nFor example, some non-volatile memory types can wear out, where a \"worn\" cell has increased volatility but otherwise continues to work.  Data locations which are written frequently can thus be directed to use worn circuits.  As long as the location is updated within some known retention time, the data stays valid.  If the retention time \"expires\" without an update, then the value is copied to a less-worn circuit with longer retention.  Writing first to the worn area allows a high write rate while avoiding wear on the not-worn circuits.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Montierth, Briggs, Keithley|title=Semi-volatile NAND flash memory|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7710777B1/|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs a second example, an [[Spin-transfer_torque#Spin-transfer_torque_memory|STT-RAM]] can be made non-volatile by building large cells, but the cost per bit and write power go up, while the write speed goes down.  Using small cells improves cost, power, and speed, but leads to semi-volatile behavior.  In some applications the increased volatility can be managed to provide many benefits of a non-volatile memory, for example by removing power but forcing a wake-up before data is lost; or by caching read-only data and discarding the cached data if the power-off time exceeds the non-volatile threshold.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keppel, Naeimi, Nasrullah|title=Method and apparatus for managing a spin transfer torque memory|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US9342403B2/|website=Google Patents|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe term semi-volatile is also used to describe semi-volatile behavior constructed from other memory types.  For example, a volatile and a non-volatile memory may be combined, where an external signal copies data from the volatile memory to the non-volatile memory, but if power is removed without copying, the data is lost.  Or, a battery-backed volatile memory, and if external power is lost there is some known period where the battery can continue to power the volatile memory, but if power is off for an extended time, the battery runs down and data is lost.\n\n== Management ==\n{{Main|Memory management}}\nProper management of memory is vital for a computer system to operate properly. Modern [[operating system]]s have complex systems to properly manage memory. Failure to do so can lead to bugs, slow performance, and at worst case, takeover by [[virus (computing)|viruses]] and [[malicious software]].\n\nNearly everything computer programmers do requires them to consider how to manage memory. Even storing a number in memory requires the programmer to specify how the memory should store it.\n\n=== Bugs ===\nImproper management of memory is a common cause of bugs, including the following types:\n\n* In an [[arithmetic overflow]], a calculation results in a number larger than the allocated memory permits. For example, a signed 8-bit integer allows the numbers \u2212128 to +127. If its value is 127 and it is instructed to add one, the computer can not store the number 128 in that space. Such a case will result in undesired operation, such as changing the number's value to \u2212128 instead of +128.\n* A [[memory leak]] occurs when a program requests memory from the operating system and never returns the memory when it's done with it. A program with this bug will gradually require more and more memory until the program fails as it runs out.\n* A [[segmentation fault]] results when a program tries to access memory that it does not have permission to access. Generally a program doing so will be terminated by the operating system.\n* A [[buffer overflow]] means that a program writes data to the end of its allocated space and then continues to write data to memory that has been allocated for other purposes. This may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a crash, or a breach of system security. They are thus the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be maliciously exploited.\n\n=== Early computer systems ===\nIn early computer systems, programs typically specified the location to write memory and what data to put there. This location was a physical location on the actual memory hardware. The slow processing of such computers did not allow for the complex memory management systems used today. Also, as most such systems were single-task, sophisticated systems were not required as much.\n\nThis approach has its pitfalls. If the location specified is incorrect, this will cause the computer to write the data to some other part of the program. The results of an error like this are unpredictable. In some cases, the incorrect data might overwrite memory used by the operating system. Computer crackers can take advantage of this to create [[Malware|viruses and malware]].\n\n=== Virtual memory ===\n{{Main|Virtual memory}}\nVirtual memory is a system where all [[physical memory]] is controlled by the operating system. When a program needs memory, it requests it from the operating system. The operating system then decides what physical location to place the memory in.\n\nThis offers several advantages. Computer programmers no longer need to worry about where the memory is physically stored or whether the user's computer will have enough memory. It also allows multiple types of memory to be used. For example, some memory can be stored in physical RAM chips while other memory is stored on a [[hard drive]] (e.g. in a [[swapfile]]), functioning as an extension of the [[cache hierarchy]]. This drastically increases the amount of memory available to programs. The operating system will place actively used memory in physical RAM, which is much faster than hard disks. When the amount of RAM is not sufficient to run all the current programs, it can result in a situation where the computer spends more time moving memory from RAM to disk and back than it does accomplishing tasks; this is known as [[Thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]].\n\nVirtual memory systems usually include protected memory, but this is not always the case.\n\n=== Protected memory ===\n{{Main|Memory protection}}\nProtected memory is a system where each program is given an area of memory to use and is not permitted to go outside that range. Use of protected memory greatly enhances both the reliability and security of a computer system.\n\nWithout protected memory, it is possible that a bug in one program will alter the memory used by another program. This will cause that other program to run off of corrupted memory with unpredictable results. If the operating system's memory is corrupted, the entire computer system may crash and need to be [[Reboot (computing)|rebooted]]. At times programs intentionally alter the memory used by other programs. This is done by viruses and malware to take over computers. It may also be used benignly by desirable programs which are intended to modify other programs; in the modern age, this is generally considered bad programming practice for application programs, but it may be used by system development tools such as debuggers, for example to insert breakpoints or hooks.\n\nProtected memory assigns programs their own areas of memory. If the operating system detects that a program has tried to alter memory that does not belong to it, the program is terminated (or otherwise restricted or redirected). This way, only the offending program crashes, and other programs are not affected by the misbehavior (whether accidental or intentional).\n\nProtected memory systems almost always include virtual memory as well.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Computer memory}}\n \n* [[Semiconductor memory]]\n* [[Memory geometry]]\n* [[Memory hierarchy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{citation\n| last = Miller\n| first = Stephen W.\n| title = Memory and Storage Technology\n| year = 1977\n| publisher = AFIPS Press\n| location = Montvale.}}\n\n* {{citation\n| title = Memory and Storage Technology\n| year = 1988\n| publisher = Time Life Books\n| location = Alexandria, Virginia.}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computer memory| ]]", "sha1": "q454jc4sw3xbp3yh5h35hmq50lxqrtv"}}, {"title": "Citrate cycle", "ns": "0", "id": "6808", "redirect": {"title": "Citric acid cycle"}, "revision": {"id": "783861055", "parentid": "79320936", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:33:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Citric acid cycle]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative name}}\n}}", "sha1": "8ax1973m61jbiztnjhzqcgl7uygszah"}}, {"title": "CDC", "ns": "0", "id": "6809", "revision": {"id": "859330007", "parentid": "859291246", "timestamp": "2018-09-13T09:27:37Z", "contributor": {"username": "GB fan", "id": "7997523"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/Mjdtjm|Mjdtjm]]: All entries on diambiguation pages must include a blue link where someone can find information no red link only entries, if you want an article write it yourself.

The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, a white dwarf with a mass greater than the limit is subject to further gravitational collapse, [[Stellar evolution|evolving]] into a different type of [[Compact star|stellar remnant]], such as a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]].  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs.<ref name = DarkMatter>Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 page 44, Accessed Oct. 7, 2013, \"...Chandrasekhar limit: The maximum mass of a white dwarf star, about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

C. Stoner]] for a  uniform density star.  Importantly, the existence of a limit, based on the conceptual breakthrough of  combining relativity with  Fermi degeneracy, was indeed first established  in separate  papers published by [[Wilhelm Anderson]] and E. C. Stoner in 1929.  The limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of [[black hole]]s, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time. That the roles of Stoner and Anderson are often forgotten in the astronomy community has been noted.<ref>Eric G.

The green curve uses the general pressure law for an ideal [[Fermi gas]], while the blue curve is for a non-relativistic ideal Fermi gas. The black line marks the [[ultrarelativistic limit]].]]\n\nElectron degeneracy pressure is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] effect arising from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Since [[electron]]s are [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can be in the same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a [[Electronic band structure|band]] of [[energy levels]]. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons increases on compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of [[electron capture]], relieving the pressure.\n\nIn the nonrelativistic case, electron degeneracy pressure gives rise to an [[equation of state]] of the form {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c1''<sup>{{sfrac|5|3}}</sup>}}, where {{mvar|P}} is the [[pressure]], {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the [[mass density]], and {{math|''K''<sub>1</sub>}} is a constant.  Solving the hydrostatic equation leads to a model white dwarf that is a [[polytrope]] of index {{sfrac|3|2}} \u2013 and therefore has radius inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass, and volume inversely proportional to its mass.<ref name=\"chandra3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S. | year = 1931 | title = The Density of White Dwarf Stars | url = | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 592\u2013596 | doi=10.1080/14786443109461710}}</ref>\n\nAs the mass of a model white dwarf increases, the typical energies to which degeneracy pressure forces the electrons are no longer negligible relative to their rest masses. The velocities of the electrons approach the speed of light, and [[special relativity]] must be taken into account. In the strongly relativistic limit, the equation of state takes the form {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''<sub>2</sub>''\u03c1''<sup>{{sfrac|4|3}}</sup>}}.

According to a group of astronomers at the [[University of Toronto]] and elsewhere, the observations of this supernova are best explained by assuming that it arose from a white dwarf that grew to twice the mass of the [[Sun]] before exploding. They believe that the star, dubbed the \"[[SN 2003fg|Champagne Supernova]]\" by University of Oklahoma astronomer David R. Branch, may have been spinning so fast that a centrifugal tendency allowed it to exceed the limit. Alternatively, the supernova may have resulted from the merger of two white dwarfs, so that the limit was only violated momentarily. Nevertheless, they point out that this observation poses a challenge to the use of type Ia supernovae as [[standard candles]].<ref>[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-09/dbnl-twt092006.php The weirdest Type Ia supernova yet], LBL press release, web page accessed 13-I-2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Champagne_Supernova_Challenges_Ideas_about_How_Supernovae_Work_999.html Champagne Supernova Challenges Ideas about How Supernovae Work], web page, spacedaily.com, accessed 13-I-2007.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | arxiv = astro-ph/0609616 | doi=10.1038/nature05103 | volume=443 | title=The type Ia supernova SNLS-03D3bb from a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf star | year=2006 | journal=Nature | pages=308\u2013311 | last1 = Howell | first1 = D.

Its first articulation in writing is the [[Cambridge Platform]] of 1648 in [[New England]]. Among those major [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christian traditions that employ congregationalism are those [[Congregational churches]] known by the ''Congregationalist'' name that descended from the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] Reformed wing of the Anglo-American [[Puritan]] movement of the 17th century, [[Quakerism]], the [[Baptists|Baptist]] churches, and most of the groups brought about by the [[Anabaptist]] movement in [[Germany]] that migrated to the US in the late 18th century, as well as the [[Congregational Methodist Church]]. More recent generations have witnessed also a growing number of [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]] churches, which are most often congregationalist in their governance.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} In [[Christianity]], congregationalism is distinguished {{citation needed span |date=June 2018 |text=most clearly}} from [[episcopal polity]],{{sfn|Doe|2013|p=118}} which is governance by a hierarchy of [[bishop]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} But it is also distinct from [[presbyterian polity]],{{sfn|Doe|2013|p=118}} in which higher assemblies of congregational representatives can exercise considerable authority over individual congregations.\n\nCongregationalism is not limited only to organization of Christian church congregations. The principles of congregationalism have been inherited by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]]. Most [[Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s, many [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwaras]] and most [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]]s in the US operate under congregational government, with no hierarchies.\n\n==Basic form==\nThe term ''congregationalist polity'' describes a form of church governance that is based on the local congregation.  Each local congregation is independent and self-supporting, governed by its own members.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Some band into loose voluntary associations with other congregations that share similar beliefs (e.g., the [[Willow Creek Association]] and the [[American Unitarian Association]]).{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}}  Others join \"conventions\", such as the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] or the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] (formerly the Northern Baptist Convention).{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} In Quaker Congregationalism, [[monthly meetings]], which are the most basic unit of administration, may be organized into larger Quarterly meetings or [[Yearly Meetings]]. Monthly, quarterly, or yearly meetings may also be associated with large \"umbrella\" associations such as [[Friends General Conference]] or [[Friends United Meeting]]. These conventions generally provide stronger ties between congregations, including some doctrinal direction and pooling of financial resources.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Congregations that belong to associations and conventions are still independently governed.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Most [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational churches]] are organized along congregationalist lines.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Many do not see these voluntary associations as \"[[Christian denomination|denominations]]\", because they \"believe that there is no church other than the local church, and denominations are in variance to Scripture.\"{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}}\n\n==Congregational church==\n{{see also|Congregational church}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2009}}\nThe earmarks of Congregationalism can be traced back to the Pilgrim societies of the United States in the early 17th century. Congregationalism expressed the viewpoint that (1) every local church is a full realization in miniature of the [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church|entire Church]] of [[Jesus Christ]]; and (2) the Church, while on earth, besides the local church, can '''only''' be invisible and ideal. While other theories may insist on the truth of the former, the latter precept of congregationalism gives the entire theory a unique character among plans of church government. There is no other reference than the local congregation for the \"visible church\" in Congregationalism. And yet, the connection of all Christians is also asserted, albeit in a way that defenders of this view usually decline, often intentionally, to elaborate more clearly or consistently. This first, foundational principle by which congregationalism is guided results in confining it to operate with the consent of each gathering of believers.\n\nAlthough \"congregational rule\" may seem to suggest that [[direct democracy|pure democracy]] reigns in congregational churches, this is seldom the case. It is granted, with few exceptions (namely in some Anabaptist churches), that [[God]] has given the government of the Church into the hands of an [[ordination|ordained]] ministry. What makes congregationalism unique is its system of checks and balances, which constrains the authority of the clergy, the lay officers, and the members.\n\nMost importantly, the boundaries of the powers of the ministers and church officers are set by clear and constant reminders of the freedoms guaranteed by the [[Gospel]] to the laity, collectively and individually. With that freedom comes the responsibility upon each member to govern himself or herself under Christ. This requires lay people to exercise great charity and patience in debating issues with one another and to seek the glory and service of God as the foremost consideration in all of their decisions.\n\nThe authority of all of the people, including the officers, is limited in the local congregation by a definition of union, or a covenant, by which the terms of their cooperation together are spelled out and agreed to. This might be something as minimal as a charter specifying a handful of [[doctrine]]s and behavioral expectations, or even a statement only guaranteeing specific freedoms. Or, it may be a [[constitution]] describing a comprehensive doctrinal system and specifying terms under which the local church is connected to other local churches, to which participating congregations give their assent. In congregationalism, rather uniquely, the church is understood to be a truly voluntary association.\n\nFinally, the congregational theory strictly forbids ministers from ruling their local churches by themselves. Not only does the minister serve by the approval of the congregation, but committees further constrain the pastor from exercising power without consent by either the particular committee, or the entire congregation. It is a contradiction of the congregational principle if a minister makes decisions concerning the congregation without the vote of these other officers.\n\nThe other officers may be called ''deacons'', ''elder'' or ''session'' (borrowing [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] terminology), or even ''[[vestry]]'' (borrowing the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] term)&nbsp;\u2013 it is not their label that is important to the theory, but rather their lay status and their equal vote, together with the pastor, in deciding the issues of the church. While other forms of church government are more likely to define ''tyranny'' as \"the imposition of unjust rule\", a congregationally governed church would more likely define ''tyranny'' as \"transgression of liberty\" or equivalently, \"rule by one man\". To a congregationalist, no abuse of authority is worse than the concentration of all decisive power in the hands of one ruling body, or one person.\n\nFollowing this sentiment, congregationalism has evolved over time to include even more participation of the congregation, more kinds of lay committees to whom various tasks are apportioned, and more decisions subject to the vote of the entire membership.\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of New England (or British)-heritage Congregationalism has been its consistent leadership role in the formation of \"unions\" with other churches. Such sentiments especially grew strong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when ecumenism evolved out of a liberal, non-sectarian perspective on relations to other Christian groups that accompanied the relaxation of [[Calvinist]] stringencies held by earlier generations. The congregationalist theory of independence within a union has been a cornerstone of most ecumenical movements since the 18th century.\n\n==Baptist churches==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2010}}\nMost [[Baptists]] hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pinson |first=William M., Jr. |year=2005 |title=Trends in Baptist Polity |url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm |dead-url=yes |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013130242/http://baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm |archive-date=13 October 2007}}</ref> Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of [[elder (Christianity)#Baptists|elders]], as well as the [[Episcopal Baptist]]s that have an [[episcopal polity|episcopal system]].\n\n[[Independent Baptist]] churches have no formal organizational structure above the level of the local congregation. More generally among [[Baptists]], a variety of [[Parachurch organization|parachurch]] agencies and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] educational institutions may be supported generously or not at all, depending entirely upon the local congregation's customs and predilections. Usually doctrinal conformity is held as a first consideration when a church makes a decision to grant or decline financial contributions to such agencies, which are legally external and separate from the congregations they serve. These practices also find currency among non-denominational fundamentalist or [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]] fellowships, many of which derive from Baptist origins, culturally if not theologically.\n\nMost [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] and [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist]] congregations, by contrast, generally relate more closely to external groups such as mission agencies and educational institutions than do those of independent persuasion. However, they adhere to a very similar [[ecclesiology]], refusing to permit outside control or oversight of the affairs of the local church.\n\n==Churches of Christ==\n{{see also|Sponsoring church (Churches of Christ)}}\nEcclesiastical government is congregational rather than denominational.

''cheval'' 'horse') or '''horsemen''' are [[soldier]]s or [[warrior]]s who fight mounted on [[horseback]]. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the [[combat arms]]. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as '''cavalryman''', '''horseman''', '''[[dragoon]]''' or '''[[trooper (rank)|trooper]]'''. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any [[Military animal|military forces that used other animals]], such as [[Camel cavalry|camels]], mules or [[War elephant|elephants]]. [[Infantry]] who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as [[dragoon]]s, a class of [[mounted infantry]] which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.\n\nCavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and inertial mass over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.\n\nThe speed, mobility and shock value of the cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the [[Ancient era|Ancient]] and [[Middle Ages]]; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in [[eurasian nomads|nomadic societies of Asia]], notably the [[Mongol Army|Mongol armies]]. In Europe cavalry became increasingly [[Heavy cavalry|armoured (heavy)]], and eventually became known for the mounted [[knight]]s. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened [[cuirass]] that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.\n\nIn [[Interwar period|the period]] between the [[World Wars]], many cavalry units were converted into [[motorized infantry]] and [[mechanized infantry]] units, or reformed as tank troops. However, some cavalry still served during [[World War II]], notably in the [[Red Army]], the [[Mongolian People's Army]], the [[Royal Italian Army]], the [[Romania during World War II|Romanian Army]], the [[Polish Land Forces]], and light reconnaissance units within the [[Waffen SS]]. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term generally refers to specialist units equipped with tanks (\"[[armored cavalry]]\") or aircraft (\"[[air cavalry]]\").\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Role of cavalry==\n{{Main|Cavalry tactics}}\n[[File:Rytter fra Bagirmi.jpg|thumb|upright|African horseman of [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] in full [[gambeson|padded armour]] suit]]\n\nIn many modern armies, the term ''cavalry'' is still often used to refer to units that are a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of the [[armed forces]] which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat [[light cavalry]] roles. These include [[reconnaissance|scouting]], [[skirmishing]] with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of own disposition of troops, forward security, offensive [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance by combat]], defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement, [[retreat (military)|retreat]], restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines, [[relief in place]], linkup, [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] operations, and [[Raid (military)|raiding]]. The [[shock attack|shock]] role, traditionally filled by [[heavy cavalry]], is generally filled by [[Military unit|unit]]s with the \"[[Armoured warfare|armored]]\" designation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n[[File:Assyriancavalry.JPG|thumb|left|Assyrian cavalry]]\nBefore the [[Iron Age]], the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light [[chariot]]s. The chariot originated with the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in [[Central Asia]] and spread by [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic [[Indo-Iranians]].<ref>p.1, Menon</ref> The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] as well as the [[Assyrian army]] and [[Babylonia]]n royalty.<ref>Terrence Wise, page 18, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 ISBN 85045-384-4</ref>\n\nThe power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of [[horse]]s (then mostly small) to carry heavy [[armor]]. Cavalry techniques were an innovation of [[equestrian nomad]]s of the Central Asian and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] steppe and [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] [[tribe]]s such as the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Parthia|Parthians]] and [[Sarmatians]].\n[[File:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]\n\nThe photograph above left shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865\u2013860 BC. At this time, the men had no [[spur]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[saddle cloth]]s, or [[stirrup]]s. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the mounted archer were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.<ref>Terrence Wise, plate H, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 ISBN 85045-384-4</ref>\n\nAs early as 490 BC a breed of large horses was bred in the Nisaean plain in Media to carry men with increasing amounts of armour (Herodotus 7,40 & 9,20), but large horses were still very exceptional at this time. By the 4th century BC the Chinese during the [[Warring States period]] (403&ndash;221 BC) began to use cavalry against rival states,<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\">Ebrey and others, ''Pre-Modern East Asia'', pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref> and by 331 BC when [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in most nations; despite a few ineffective attempts to revive [[scythed chariot]]s. The last recorded use of chariots as a shock force in continental Europe was during the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=164|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\nHowever, chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a [[Roman triumph]], or for racing.\n\nOutside of mainland Europe, the southern [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] met [[Julius Caesar]] with chariots in [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|55 and 54 BC]], but by the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a century later chariots were obsolete, even in Britannia. The last mention of chariot use in Britain was by the [[Caledonia]]ns at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius|Mons Graupius]], in 84 AD.\n\n===Ancient Greece: city-states, Thebes, Thessaly and Macedonia===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Amphora Louvre F12.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Warrior's departure; an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[amphora]] dated 550\u2013540 BC.]]\n{{main|hippeis|companion cavalry}}\n\nDuring the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war-horses. Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with javelins, could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using lances, had the ability to close with their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the [[hoplites]] or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=37|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nCavalry played a relatively minor role in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-states]], with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] produced [[Pelopidas]], her first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by [[Phillip II of Macedon]] when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes. [[Thessaly]] was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen, and later experiences in wars both with and against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s taught the [[Greeks]] the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The [[Athens|Athenian]] author and soldier [[Xenophon]] in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.\n\nThe [[Macedon]]ian Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]]) of Philip II of Macedon and [[Alexander the Great]]. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen called [[prodromoi]] for scouting and screening, as well as the [[Macedonian phalanx|Macedonian pike phalanx]] and various kinds of [[light infantry]]. There were also the ''Ippiko'' (or \"Horserider\"), Greek \"heavy\" cavalry, armed with kontos (or cavalry lance), and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet. They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. This combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and were used effectively to dominate the opponents of the kingdom.\n\nThe effectiveness of this combined-arms system was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquest of [[Persia]], [[Bactria]], and northwestern India.\n\n===Roman Republic and Early Empire===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n{{main|Roman cavalry}}\n[[File:K\u00f6ln Reitergrabmal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tombstone of a Roman [[auxilia]]ry trooper from [[History of Cologne|Cologne]], Germany. Second half of the 1st century AD]]\nThe cavalry in the early [[Roman Republic]] remained the preserve of the wealthy [[landed class]] known as the ''[[equites]]''\u2014men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common [[Roman legion|legion]]s. As the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian [[socii]] for filling the ranks of their cavalry. The weakness of Roman cavalry was demonstrated by Hannibal Barca during the [[Second Punic War]] where he used his superior mounted forces to win several battles. The most notable of these was the [[Battle of Cannae]], where he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], and [[Numidians]], the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts (see [[Numidian cavalry]]). [[Julius Caesar]] had a high opinion of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the ''[[cohors equitata|Cohortes Equitatae]]''. Early emperors maintained an [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an cavalry as their [[Germanic bodyguard|personal bodyguards]] until the unit was dismissed by [[Galba]] after the [[Batavian Rebellion]].\n\nFor the most part, Roman cavalry during the Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the showing force. This does not mean that its utility should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the [[Battle of Aquilonia]].\n\nAfter defeats such as the [[Battle of Carrhae]], the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. They would begin to substantially increase both the numbers and the training standards of the cavalry in their employ, just as nearly a thousand years earlier the first Iranians to reach the [[Iranian Plateau]] forced the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to undertake a similar reform. Nonetheless, the Romans would continue to rely mainly on their [[heavy infantry]] supported by auxiliary cavalry.\n\n[[File:Roman Cavalry 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reenactor as a Roman [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cavalryman.]]\n\n===Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period===\nIn the army of the late [[Roman Empire]], cavalry played an increasingly important role. The [[Spatha]], the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire's cavalry forces.\n\nThe most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the [[Parthia]]ns and their [[Iran]]ian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] successors. Both, but especially the former, were famed for the [[cataphract]] (fully armored cavalry armed with lances) even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter [[horse archer]]s. The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the [[Hellenistic]] period with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]\u2013[[History of Iran|Persian]] [[wars]]. At first the Parthians' mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and ''clibanarii''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/mhq/blromespersianmirage/ |title=Roman-Persian Wars |work=Historynet.com |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] and cantle,<ref>The raised rear part of a saddle</ref> was also a significant factor as was the adoption of [[stirrup]]s and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider's seat. Armored cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the Near East, following the precedents established by [[History of Iran|Persia]]n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.\n\nThe late-Roman cavalry tradition of organized units in a standing army differed fundamentally from the nobility of the Germanic invaders - individual warriors who could afford to provide their own horses and equipment. While there was no direct linkage with these predecessors the early medieval knight also developed as a member of a social and martial elite, able to meet the considerable expenses required by his role from grants of land and other incomes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Newark|pages=23\u201324|title=Sabre & Lance.

As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic [[nation-states]] supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders.\n[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders II.jpg|thumb|Mongols at war 14th century]]\n\nThe best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of the [[Russian Empire]]. In eastern Europe, Russia, and out onto the [[steppes]], cavalry remained important much longer and dominated the scene of warfare until the early 17th century and even beyond, as the strategic mobility of cavalry was crucial for the semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lives that many steppe cultures led.<!-- This needs a re-write as the chronology is all over the place --> [[Tibet]]ans also had a tradition of cavalry warfare, in several military engagements with the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618 \u2013 907 AD).\n\n=====Khanates of Central Asia=====\n{{main|Horse archer}}\n<gallery widths=180>\nFile:Mongol warrior of Genghis Khan.jpg|[[Mongol]] mounted archer of Genghis Khan late 12th century.\nFile:Ryszkiewicz Tatars in the vanguard.jpg|[[Tatar]] vanguard in [[Eastern Europe]] 13th-14th centuries.\n</gallery>\n\n====East Asia====\n{{further|Horses in East Asian warfare}}\n\n{{multiple image| align = left | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = An [[Eastern Han]] glazed ceramic statue of a horse with [[bridle]] and [[halter]] headgear, from [[Sichuan]], late 2nd century to early 3rd century AD| footer_align = left | image1 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 02.JPG | width1 = 108 | caption1 = | image2 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 03.JPG | width2 = 220| caption2 = }}\n\nFurther east, the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|military history of China]], specifically [[North China|northern China]], held a long tradition of intense military exchange between [[Han Chinese]] infantry forces of the settled dynastic empires and the mounted [[nomads]] or \"barbarians\" of the north. The [[naval history of China]] was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept [[Naval warfare|navy]].\n\nIn 307 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]], the ancient Chinese ruler of the former [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the [[trousers]] of the [[nomad]]s as well as practice the nomads' form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\" />\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|right|A bas-[[relief]] of a soldier and horse with saddle and [[stirrup]]s, from the tomb of Chinese [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626\u2013649), c. 650]]\nThe adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]-riding [[Four occupations|Chinese aristocracy]] in battle, which had been in use since the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC-1050 BC).<ref name=\"ebrey 29\">Ebrey, 29.</ref> By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force.<ref name=\"ebrey 30\">Ebrey, 30.</ref> The handheld pistol-and-trigger [[crossbow]] was invented in China in the 4th century BC;<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 41\">Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 41.</ref> it was written by the [[Song dynasty]] scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (1044 AD) that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges.<ref name=\"peers 130\">Peers, 130.we can right anything</ref>\n\n[[File:The Qianlong Emperor in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in ceremonial armor on horseback, painted by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (1688\u20131766)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], dated 1739 or 1758]]\nOn many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279\u20131368). The Chinese recognized early on during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141 BC \u2013 87 BC) went to war with the [[Dayuan]] for this reason, since the Dayuan were hoarding a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the [[Hellenized]]\u2013[[Greeks|Greek]] region of [[Fergana]] (established slightly earlier by [[Alexander the Great]]). Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wu's war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.\n\nCavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached [[stirrup]] by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of the year 322 AD.<ref name=\"Dien\">[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/stirrup.shtml Dien, Albert. \"THE STIRRUP AND ITS EFFECT ON CHINESE MILITARY HISTORY\"]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231319/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 \"The stirrup \u2013 history of Chinese science\".

Since at least the 3rd century BC, there was influence of northern [[nomad]]ic peoples and [[Yemaek]] peoples on Korean warfare. By roughly the 1st century BC, the ancient kingdom of [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]] also had mounted warriors.<ref>Ebrey, 120.</ref> The cavalry of [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], were called ''Gaemamusa'' (\uac1c\ub9c8\ubb34\uc0ac, \u93a7\u99ac\u6b66\u58eb), and were renowned as a fearsome heavy cavalry force. [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|King Gwanggaeto the Great]] often led expeditions into the [[Baekje]], [[Gaya confederacy]], [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Later Yan]] and against [[Yamato period|Japanese]] invaders with his cavalry.<ref>Lee, Peter H & Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition, page 24-26. Columbia University Press, 1997.</ref>\nIn the 12th century, [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes began to violate the Goryeo\u2013Jurchen borders, and eventually invaded [[Goryeo]] Korea. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general [[Yun Gwan]] realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo\u2013Jurchen borders (\ub3d9\ubd81 9\uc131, \u6771\u5317 \u4e5d\u57ce).\n\n====Japan====\n[[File:Samurai on horseback.png|thumb|upright|A mounted [[samurai]] with bow & arrows, wearing a horned helmet. Circa 1878.]]\n\nThe [[History of Japan|ancient Japanese]] of the [[Kofun period]] also adopted [[Kofun period#Introduction of equine culture to Japan|cavalry and equine culture]] by the 5th century AD. The emergence of the [[samurai]] aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging lancer cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.\n\nAn example is Yabusame (\u6d41\u93d1\u99ac?), a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special \"turnip-headed\" arrows successively at three wooden targets.\n\nThis style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.\nCurrently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto (during Aoi Matsuri in early May). It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.\n\nKasagake or Kasakake (\u7b20\u61f8, \u304b\u3055\u304c\u3051 lit. \"hat shooting\") is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.\n\n====South Asia====\nIn the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the [[Gupta Dynasty]] (320-600) period onwards. India has also the oldest evidence for the introduction of toe-[[stirrup]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/invention-of-the-stirrup-195161|title=Invention of the Stirrup|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIndian literature contains numerous references to the cavalry forces of the [[Central Asia]]n horse nomads like the [[Saka]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yona|Yavanas]], [[The Pahlavas|Pahlavas]] and [[Paradas]].

The arms and armour for heavy cavalry increased, the high-backed [[saddle]] developed, and [[stirrup]]s and [[spur]]s were added, increasing the advantage of heavy cavalry even more.\n\nThis shift in military importance was reflected in society as well; [[knight]]s took centre stage both on and off the battlefield. These are considered the \"ultimate\" in heavy cavalry: well-equipped with the best weapons, state-of-the-art armour from head to foot, leading with the [[lance]] in battle in a full-gallop, close-formation \"knightly charge\" that might prove irresistible, winning the battle almost as soon as it begun.\n\n[[File:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th-century depiction of a riding horse. Note resemblance to the modern [[Paso Fino]].]]\n[[File:Husitsky bojovy vuz replika.jpg|thumb|right|A Hussite war wagon: it enabled peasants to defeat knights]]\nBut knights remained the minority of total available combat forces; the expense of arms, armour, and horses was only affordable to a select few. While mounted men-at-arms focused on a narrow combat role of shock combat, medieval armies relied on a large variety of foot troops to fulfill all the rest ([[skirmishing]], flank guards, scouting, holding ground, etc.). Medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the common soldiers, which led early students of military history to suppose that heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields. But well-trained and disciplined infantry could defeat knights.\n\nMassed [[English longbow]]men triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339),<ref>{{cite book|first=H.W.|last=Koch|page=189|title=Medieval Warfare|ISBN=0-86124-008-1}}</ref> foot-soldiers proved they could resist cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] developed their [[pike square]]s for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive [[combined arms]] doctrine, as evidenced in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[hand cannon]], also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics.\n\nThis gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the [[Battle of the Dyle]] (891) and the [[Battle of Bremule]] (1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed [[sword]]s and [[poleaxe]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.\n\n===Greater Middle East===\n{{main|Religious war|Muslim conquests}}\n\n====Arabs====\n{{main|Mobile guard|List of battles of Muhammad}}\n[[File:Ikhwan.jpg|thumb|left|Arab camel cavalry]]\n\nThe Islamic Prophet Muhammad made use of cavalry in many of his military campaigns including the [[Expedition of Dhu Qarad]],<ref>Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 231.

Its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear. These relatively lightly armored horsemen formed the most effective element of the Muslim armies during the later stages of the Islamic conquest of the Levant. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the '''[[Battle of Yarmouk]]''' (636 AD) in which [[Khalid ibn Walid]], knowing the skills of his horsemen, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage, disengage, then turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name ''Mutaharrik tulai'a''( \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0637\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0629 ), or the [[Mobile guard]]. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine]] army. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.<ref>p.239, Muir</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 AD was a conflict between the Arab [[Abbasid]] Caliphate and the [[China|Chinese]] [[Tang dynasty]] over the control of [[Central Asia]].

The elite corps were the ''ahadi'' who provided direct service to the Emperor and acted as guard cavalry. Supplementary cavalry or ''dakhilis'' were recruited, equipped and paid by the central state. This was in contrast to the ''tabinan'' horsemen who were the followers of individual noblemen. Their training and equipment varied widely but they made up the backbone of the Mughal cavalry. Finally there were tribal irregulars led by and loyal to tributary chiefs. These included Hindus, Afghans and Turks summoned for military service when their autonomous leaders were called on by the Imperial government.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dr. David|last=Nicolle|pages=10\u201311|title=Mughul India 1504-1761|ISBN=1-85532-344-3}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mughal Troops Chase the Armies of Da'ud.jpg|Akbar leads the [[Mughal Army]] during a campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Renaissance Europe===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u20131441).]]\nIronically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the \"golden age\" of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th-century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter.\n\nKnighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society. With the rise of drilled and trained infantry, the mounted men-at-arms, now sometimes called ''[[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]]'' and often part of the standing army themselves, adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age, that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged, either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander-in-chief.\n\n[[File:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Polish hussars|Husarz]]'' (Polish Hussar) by [[J\u00f3zef Brandt]].]]\n\nFrom the 1550s onwards, the use of [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder weapons]] solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost, and were much easier to replace.\n\nThe Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try to bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, pistol, or lance) remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the [[Polish Hussars|Polish winged hussars]], a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].\n\n===18th-century Europe and Napoleonic Wars===\n[[File:Battle of Eylau 1807 by Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on.jpg|thumb|left|Cavalry charge at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], painted by [[Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on Fort]].]]\n\nCavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on usually resulted in failure, but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] (1757), [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (1807), remaining significant throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThe greatest cavalry charge of modern history was at the 1807 [[battle of Eylau]], when the entire 11,000-strong French cavalry reserve, led by Mar\u00e9chal Murat, launched a huge charge on and through the Russian infantry lines. However, in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], repeated [[Battle of Waterloo#The French cavalry attack|charges by up to 9,000 French cavalrymen]] failed to break the line of the British and German infantry, who had formed [[Infantry square|square]]s.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/battle_waterloo_01.shtml#five BBC History: The Battle of Waterloo]</ref>\n\nMassed infantry was deadly to cavalry, but offered an excellent target for [[artillery]]. Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation, cavalry were able to [[rout]] and pursue the scattered foot soldiers. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of World War I.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The charge of the Venezuelan First Division's cavalry at the [[Battle of Carabobo]].]]\n\n====Europe====\nBy the 19th century, European cavalry fell into four main categories:\n\n* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry\n* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry\n* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry\n* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s\n\nThere were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: France had the ''chasseurs \u00e0 cheval''; Germany had the ''J\u00e4ger zu Pferd''; [[Bavaria]] had the ''Chevaulegers''; and Russia had Cossacks. Britain, from the mid-18th century, had Light Dragoons as light cavalry and Dragoons, Dragoon Guards and [[Household Cavalry]] as heavy cavalry. Only after the end of the Napoleonic wars were the Household Cavalry equipped with cuirasses, and some other regiments were converted to lancers. In the [[United States Army]] the cavalry were almost always dragoons. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had its cavalry uniformed as [[hussar]]s, but they fought as dragoons.\n\nIn the [[Crimean War]], the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] and the [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|Thin Red Line]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] showed the vulnerability of cavalry, when deployed without effective support.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&pg=PA40 |first=Guy |last=Arnold |title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War |publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc |year=2002 |isbn=0-8108-4276-9 |pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\n\n[[File:Union cavalry charge culpepper.jpg|right|thumb|left|[[Union Cavalry]] capture [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] guns at [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpepper]].]]\n\nIn the early [[American Civil War]] the regular United States Army mounted rifle, dragoon, and two existing cavalry regiments were reorganized and renamed cavalry regiments, of which there were six.<ref>Gervase Phillips, \"Writing Horses into American Civil War History\".

However, cavalry saw a role as part of screening forces and in foraging and scouting. The later phases of the war saw the [[Union Army|Federal army]] developing a truly effective cavalry force fighting as [[Reconnaissance|scouts]], raiders, and, with repeating rifles, as [[mounted infantry]]. The distinguished 1st Virginia Cavalry ranks as one of the most effectual and successful cavalry units on the Confederate side. Noted cavalry commanders included Confederate general [[J.E.B.

The black units, along with others (both cavalry and infantry), collectively became known as the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s. According to [[Robert M. Utley]]: \n:the frontier army was a conventional military force trying to control, by conventional military methods, a people that did not behave like conventional enemies and, indeed, quite often were not enemies at all.

Following the experience of the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] of 1899\u20131902 (where mounted Boer citizen commandos fighting on foot from cover proved more effective than regular cavalry) the British Army withdrew lances for all but ceremonial purposes and placed a new emphasis on training for dismounted action.

The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles: the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps; and the [[Australian Light Horse]] served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign. In September 1914 cavalry comprised 9.28% of the total manpower of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France\u2014by July 1918 this proportion had fallen to 1.65%.<ref>page 212, ''The Oxford History of the British Army'', {{ISBN|0-19-285333-3}}</ref> As early as the first winter of the war most French cavalry regiments had dismounted a squadron each, for service in the trenches.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ian|last=Sumner|page=12|title=French Poilu 1914-18|ISBN=978-1-84603-332-2}}</ref> The French cavalry numbered 102,000 in May 1915 but had been reduced to 63,000 by October 1918.<ref>page 216, Vol. XXX, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 12th Edition, 1922</ref>\nThe German Army dismounted nearly all their cavalry in the West, maintaining only one mounted division on that front by January 1917.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R42025, Warschau, Einmarsch deutscher Kavallerie.jpg|thumb|right|German [[Uhlan]]s after the capture of Warsaw, August 1915]]\nItaly entered the war in 1915 with thirty regiments of line cavalry, lancers and light horse. While employed effectively against their Austro-Hungarian counterparts during the initial offensives across the [[Isonzo River]], the Italian mounted forces ceased to have a significant role as the front shifted into mountainous terrain. By 1916 all cavalry machine-gun sections and two complete cavalry divisions had been dismounted and seconded to the infantry.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Nicolle|pages=34\u201335|title=The Italian Army of World War I|ISBN=1-84176-398-5}}</ref>\n\nSome cavalry were retained as mounted troops behind the lines in anticipation of a penetration of the opposing trenches that it seemed would never come. [[Tanks]], introduced on the Western Front by the British in September 1916, had the capacity to achieve such breakthroughs but did not have the reliable range to exploit them. In their first major use at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)]], the plan was for a cavalry division to follow behind the tanks, however they were not able to cross a canal because a tank had broken the only bridge.<ref>[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/battle_of_cambrai.htm History Learning Site: Battle of Cambrai]</ref> It was not until the German Army had been forced to retreat in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] of 1918, that cavalry were again able to operate in their intended role. There was a successful charge by the British [[7th Dragoon Guards]] on the last day of the war.<ref>page 45 \"The Royal Dragoon Guards 1685\u20131988\", Regiment Issue Thirty Four</ref>\n\nIn the wider spaces of the Eastern Front a more fluid form of warfare continued and there was still a use for mounted troops. Some wide-ranging actions were fought, again mostly in the early months of the war.<ref name=\"Willmott\">''First World War'', Willmott, H.P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003</ref> However, even here the value of cavalry was overrated and the maintenance of large mounted formations at the front by the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Russian Army]] put a major strain on the railway system, to little strategic advantage.<ref>{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Stone|page=220|title=The Eastern Front 1914-17|ISBN=0-684-14492-1}}</ref> In February 1917 the Russian regular cavalry (exclusive of Cossacks) was reduced by nearly a third from its peak number of 200,000, as two squadrons of each regiment were dismounted and incorporated into additional infantry battalions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=220|title=Russian Hussar|ISBN=1-59048-256-5}}</ref> Their Austro-Hungarian opponents, plagued by a shortage of trained infantry, had been obliged to progressively convert most horse cavalry regiments to dismounted rifle units starting in late 1914.<ref>{{cite book|first=James|last=Lucas|page=99|title=Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914|ISBN=0-946771-04-9}}</ref>\n\n====Middle East====\nIn the Middle East, during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] mounted forces (British, Indian, Ottoman, Australian, Arab and New Zealand) retained an important strategic role both as mounted infantry and cavalry.\n\nIn Egypt the [[mounted infantry]] formations like the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]] and [[Australian Light Horse]] of [[ANZAC Mounted Division]], operating as mounted infantry, drove German and Ottoman forces back from [[Battle of Romani|Romani]] to [[Battle of Magdhaba|Magdhaba]] and [[Battle of Rafa|Rafa]] and out of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula in 1916.\n\nAfter a stalemate on the Gaza\u2014Beersheba line between March and October 1917, [[Beersheba]] was captured by the [[Australian Mounted Division]]'s 4th Light Horse Brigade. Their mounted charge succeeded after a [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|coordinated attack]] by the British Infantry and Yeomanry cavalry and the Australian and New Zealand Light Horse and Mounted Rifles brigades. A series of coordinated attacks by these [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] infantry and mounted troops were also successful at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], during which the British infantry divisions and the Desert Mounted Corps drove two Ottoman armies back to the Jaffa\u2014Jerusalem line. The infantry with mainly dismounted cavalry and mounted infantry fought in the [[Judean Hills]] to eventually almost encircle [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem]] which was occupied shortly after.\n\nDuring a pause in operations necessitated by the [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 on the Western Front joint infantry and mounted infantry attacks towards [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|Es Salt]] resulted in retreats back to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] which continued to be occupied by mounted divisions during the summer of 1918.\n\nThe Australian Mounted Division was armed with swords and in September, after the successful [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|breaching]] of the Ottoman line on the Mediterranean coast by [[Battle of Sharon (1918)|the British Empire infantry]] XXI Corps was followed by cavalry attacks by the [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|4th Cavalry Division]], [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|5th Cavalry Division]] and [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Australian Mounted Division]]s which almost encircled two Ottoman armies in the Judean Hills [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|forcing their retreat]]. Meanwhile, [[Chaytor's Force]] of infantry and mounted infantry in ANZAC Mounted Division [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley (1918)|held the Jordan Valley]], covering the right flank to later advance eastwards to [[Third Transjordan attack|capture Es Salt and Amman]] and half of a third Ottoman army. A subsequent pursuit by the [[Charge at Irbid|4th Cavalry Division]] and the [[Battle of Jisr Benat Yakub|Australian Mounted Division]] followed by the [[Charge at Kiswe|5th Cavalry Division]] to [[Damascus]]. Armoured cars and 5th Cavalry Division lancers were continuing the pursuit of Ottoman units north of [[Aleppo]] when the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed by the Ottoman Empire.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Falls |first=Cyril\n|author2=G.

There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.\n\nCavalry was extensively used in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komar\u00f3w]] in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier]] of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.\n[[File:Lietuvos kavalerija.Lithuanian cavalry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Lithuania]]n lancers training in the 1930s]]\nThe post-war German Army ([[Reichsheer]]) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nThe [[British Army]] mechanised all cavalry regiments between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] together with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.\n\nDuring the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.\n\nThe thirty-nine cavalry regiments of the [[British Indian Army]] were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanism began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanized initially, in the majority of cases, to motorized infantry transported in 15cwt trucks.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=382|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}</ref> The last horsed regiment of the British Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its final mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists in the Pakistan Army as an amored regiment.\n\n===World War II===\nWhile most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns.\n\n====Polish====\n[[File:Polski u\u0142an z karabinem przeciwpancernym UR.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Polish [[uhlan]] with [[wz. 35 anti-tank rifle]]. Military instruction published in [[Warsaw]] in 1938.]]\nA popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zaloga\n | first = S.

First, because motorised vehicles were in short supply, the Poles used horses to pull anti-tank weapons into position.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Time Staff|date=April 22, 1940|number= |title= The New Pictures|journal= Time|volume= |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763905-1,00.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> Second, there were a few incidents when Polish cavalry was trapped by German tanks, and attempted to fight free. However, this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry.<ref name=Davies324>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' pp. 324-325</ref> Later, on the Eastern Front, the [[Red Army]] did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans.<ref name=Davies325>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' p. 325</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-054-1525-26, Frankreich, Kavallerie am Ausgang eines Dorfes.jpg|thumb|left|A German cavalry patrol in May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].]]\nA more correct term would be \"mounted infantry\" instead of \"cavalry\", as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation, for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre-war Poland. Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, and in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]] included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled), the [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35]], anti-aircraft weapons, anti tank artillery such as the [[Bofors 37 mm]], also light and scout tanks, etc. The last cavalry vs. cavalry mutual charge in Europe took place in Poland during the [[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d]], when Polish and German cavalry units clashed with each other.\n\nThe last classical cavalry charge of the war was that made on March 1, 1945 during the [[Battle of Schoenfeld]] by the 1st \"Warsaw\" Independent Cavalry Brigade. Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position, both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157, overlooking the wetlands. The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which, combined with the \"Warsaw\"s swift assault, overran the German anti-tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself, now supported by infantry and tanks.\n\n====Greek====\nThe [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania. Three Greek cavalry regiments (two mounted and one partially mechanized) played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain.<ref>''The Armed Forces of World War II 1914\u20131945'', Andrew Mollo, {{ISBN|0-85613-296-9}}</ref>\n\n====Soviet====\nBy the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers, some in combined mechanized and horse units. The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks. Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian [[Cossacks]] and other horse cavalry; and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front. Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops. The main usage of Soviet cavalry involved infiltration through front lines with subsequent deep raids, which disorganised German supply lines. Another role was the pursuit of retreating enemy forces during major frontline operations and breakthroughs.\n\n====Italian====\nThe last mounted sabre charge by Italian cavalry occurred on August 24, 1942 at [[Isbuscenskij Charge|Isbuscenski]] (Russia), when a squadron of the Savoia Cavalry Regiment charged the 812th Siberian Infantry Regiment. The remainder of the regiment, together with the Novara Lancers made a dismounted attack in an action that ended with the retreat of the Russians after heavy losses on both sides.<ref>Jeffrey T. Fowler, page 45 \"Axis Cavalry in World War II, {{ISBN|1-84176-323-3}}</ref> The final Italian cavalry action occurred on October 17, 1942 in Poloj (now Croatia) by a squadron of the Alexandria Cavalry Regiment against a large group of Yugoslav partisans.\n\n====Other Axis====\nRomanian, Hungarian and Italian cavalry were dispersed or disbanded following the retreat of the Axis forces from Russia.<ref>Jeffrey T.

The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near [[Toungoo]] airfield in central [[Myanmar]]. The [[Sikh]] [[sowar]]s of the Frontier Force cavalry, led by Captain Arthur Sandeman of [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)]], charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed.\n\n====Mongolia====\n\n[[File:Battle of Khalkhin Gol-Mongolian cavalry.jpg|right|thumb|Mongolian cavalry in the Khalkhin Gol (1939)]]\n\nIn the early stages of World War II, mounted units of the Mongolian People's Army were involved in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against invading Japanese forces. Soviet forces under the command of Georgy Zhukov, together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars. After the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941, Mongolia remained neutral throughout most of the war, but its geographical situation meant that the country served as a buffer between Japanese forces and the Soviet Union. In addition to keeping around 10% of the population under arms, Mongolia provided half a million trained horses for use by the Soviet Army. In 1945 a partially mounted Soviet-Mongolian [[Cavalry Mechanized Group]] played a supporting role on the western flank of the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The last active service seen by cavalry units of the Mongolian Army occurred in 1946\u20131948, during border clashes between Mongolia and the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\n===Post\u2013World War II to present day===\n\n[[File:US soldiers on horseback 1991 Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] and [[Combat Controller]]s on horseback with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]], which frequently used horses as military transport.]]\nWhile most modern \"cavalry\" units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case. The modern Irish Defence Force (IDF) includes a \"Cavalry Corps\" equipped with armoured cars and [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles]]. The IDF has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922 (other than a small mounted escort of [[Blue Hussars]] drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions). However, the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force.\n\nSome engagements in late 20th and early 21st century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involved mounted troops, particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure. Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry. Examples occurred in Afghanistan, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of [[Spahi]]s to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War (1954\u201362) and the Swiss Army maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973. The [[Portuguese Army]] used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique]] in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1964-79 [[Rhodesian Bush War]] the [[Rhodesian Army]] created an elite mounted infantry unit called [[Grey's Scouts]] to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]. The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were effective and reportedly feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces. In the 1978 to present [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghan Civil War]] period there have been several instances of horse mounted combat.\n\nSouth and Central American armies maintained mounted cavalry for longer than those of Europe, Asia or North America. The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid-1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=English|first=Adrian J.|date=May 1985 |title=Armed Forces of Latin America:Their Histories, Development, Present Strength and Military Potential|url= |location= |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|page= |isbn=978-0710603210 |access-date= }}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Soviet Army]] retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955, and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in [[Kyrgyzstan]].<ref>Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, p.133-134</ref>\n\n====Operational horse cavalry====\nToday, the [[Indian Army]]'s [[61st Cavalry Regiment (India)|61st Cavalry]] is reported to be the largest remaining horse-mounted cavalry unit with operational potential in the world.<ref>[http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html India Polo Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703113133/http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html |date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated state cavalry squadrons of Gwalior, Jodhpur, and Mysore.

The PLA mounted units last saw action during border clashes with [[Vietnam]] in the 1970s and 80s, after which most cavalry units were disbanded as part of the major military downsizing of the 1980s.\nIn the wake of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], there were calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain. Subsequent Chinese media reporting<ref>''Global Times'' 20 November 2009 and Xinhua News Agency 22 August 2011</ref> confirms that the Chinese Army maintains operational horse cavalry at squadron strength in the Mongolia Autonomous Region for scouting and logistical purposes.\n\n====Ceremonial horse cavalry and armored cavalry retaining traditional titles====\nCavalry or mounted gendarmerie units continue to be maintained for purely or primarily ceremonial purposes by the Algerian, Argentine, Bolivian, Brazilian, British, Bulgarian, Canadian, Chilean, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Indian, Italian, Jordanian, Moroccan, Nepalese, Nigerian, North Korean, Omani, Pakistani, Panamanian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Senegalese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Tunisian, Turkmenistan, United States, and Venezuelan armed forces.\n\nA number of armoured regiments in the [[British Army]] retain the historic designations of Hussars, Dragoons, Light Dragoons, Dragoon Guards, Lancers and Yeomanry. Only the [[Household Cavalry]] (consisting of the [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]]' mounted squadron, The [[Blues and Royals]]' mounted squadron, the State Trumpeters of The [[Household Cavalry]] and the [[Household Cavalry]] Mounted Band) are maintained for mounted (and dismounted) ceremonial duties in London.\n\nThe [[French Army]] still has regiments with the historic designations of [[Cuirassier]]s, [[Hussar]]s, [[Chasseur]]s, [[Dragoon]]s and [[Spahi]]s. Only the cavalry of the [[French Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] and a ceremonial ''fanfare'' detachment of trumpeters for the cavalry/armoured branch<ref>Cyr Darnoc De Saint-mande, pages 33-36, ''Gazette des Uniformes'', December 2002</ref> as a whole are now mounted.\n\nIn the [[Canadian Army]], a number of regular and reserve units have cavalry roots, including [[The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal)]], [[the Governor General's Horse Guards]], [[Lord Strathcona's Horse]], the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]], and the [[South Alberta Light Horse]]. Of these, only Lord Strathcona's Horse and the Governor General's Horse Guards maintain an official ceremonial horse-mounted cavalry troop or squadron.<ref>The Honours, Flags, and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces</ref>\n\nIn 2002 the Army of the Russian Federation reintroduced a ceremonial mounted squadron wearing historic uniforms.\n\nBoth the Australian and New Zealand armies follow the British practice of maintaining traditional titles ([[Australian Light Horse|Light Horse]] or Mounted Rifles) for modern mechanised units. However, neither country retains a horse-mounted unit.\n\nSeveral [[armour|armored]] units of the modern [[United States Army]] retain the designation of \"[[Armored cavalry]]\". The United States also has \"[[Air assault|air cavalry]]\" units equipped with [[helicopter]]s. The Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army's [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], made up of active duty soldiers, still functions as an active unit; trained to approximate the weapons, tools, equipment and techniques used by the United States Cavalry in the 1880s.<ref>[http://pao.hood.army.mil/1stCavDiv/horseDet/default.html First Team!

The differences were their role in combat, the size of the mount, and how much armor was worn by the mount and [[Equestrianism|rider]].\n\nEarly light cavalry (like the [[auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliaries of the Roman army]]) were typically used to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[skirmish]], to cut down retreating infantry, and for defeating enemy [[projectile|missile]] troops. Armoured cavalry such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cataphract]] were used as shock troops\u2014they would charge the main body of the enemy and in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term \"battle cavalry\".<ref>p.490, Lynn</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Gunpowder warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry units still retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective value against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes, and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and heavy cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.\n\nSince the development of [[armored warfare]], the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car (military)|Armored car]]s and [[light tank]]s have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while [[medium tank|medium]] and [[heavy tank]]s are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].\n\n==Social status==\nFrom the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.\n\nFor this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of lightly armed [[peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasant levies came into conflict, the poorly trained footmen would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.\n\nIn later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the [[line infantry]] regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian [[Cossacks]] or the French [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]].\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their [[Royal Guards|royal or imperial guards]]. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards, through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Imperial Guard]] an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.\n\n==On film==\nSome sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', which featured some 2,000 cavalrymen,<ref>{{citation |last=Corrigan |first=Major J G H |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/waterloo.html |title=Waterloo (review) |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327224105/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/waterloo.html |archivedate=27 March 2009}}</ref> some of them Cossacks.

The cycle consumes acetate (in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]]) and [[water]], reduces [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct.

In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, which lack mitochondria, the citric acid cycle reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The overall yield of energy-containing compounds from the TCA cycle is three NADH, one FAD(2H), and one GTP.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/769803483|title=Marks' basic medical biochemistry : a clinical approach|last=1950-|first=Lieberman, Michael,|date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|others=Marks, Allan D., Peet, Alisa.|isbn=9781608315727|edition=Fourth|location=Philadelphia|oclc=769803483}}</ref>\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nSeveral of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the 1930s by the research of [[Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1937 specifically for his discoveries pertaining to [[fumaric acid]], a key component of the cycle.<ref name=\"Nobel_Prize_1937\">{{cite web | url =  http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1937/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1937 | accessdate = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> He was able to make this discovery successful with the help of pigeon breast muscle.

The reactions of the cycle are carried out by eight enzymes that completely oxidize acetate, in the form of acetyl-CoA, into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water. Through [[catabolism]] of sugars, fats, and proteins, the two-carbon organic product acetyl-CoA (a form of acetate) is produced which enters the citric acid cycle. The reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>) into three equivalents of reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> (NADH), one equivalent of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) into one equivalent of FADH<sub>2</sub>, and one equivalent each of [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>) into one equivalent of [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). The NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> generated by the citric acid cycle are, in turn, used by the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway to generate energy-rich ATP.\n\nOne of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is from the breakdown of sugars by [[glycolysis]] which yield [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that in turn is decarboxylated by the enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction scheme:\n\n: [[pyruvic acid|{{underset|pyruvate|2=CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)C(=O)O<sup>\u2212</sup>}}]] + [[Coenzyme A|HSCoA]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] \u2192 [[acetyl-CoA|{{underset|acetyl-CoA|2=CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)SCoA}}]] + NADH + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids. Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:\n* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from acetyl-CoA to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).\n* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO<sub>2</sub>. The carbons lost as CO<sub>2</sub> originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO<sub>2</sub> requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in [[anabolic|anabolism]],  they might not be lost, since many citric acid cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.<ref name=\"pmid2106256\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolfe RR, Jahoor F | title = Recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation | journal = Am.

For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced.\n* In addition, electrons from the succinate oxidation step are transferred first to the [[FAD]] cofactor of succinate dehydrogenase, reducing it to FADH<sub>2</sub>, and eventually to [[ubiquinone]] (Q) in the mitochondrial membrane, reducing it to ubiquinol (QH<sub>2</sub>) which is a substrate of the electron transfer chain at the level of [[Complex III]].\n* For every NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> that are produced in the citric acid cycle, 2.5 and 1.5 ATP molecules are generated in oxidative phosphorylation, respectively.\n* At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.\n\n== Steps ==\nTwo [[carbon]] atoms  are [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], the energy from these reactions is transferred to other metabolic processes through [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (or ATP), and as electrons in [[NADH]] and [[Ubiquinol|QH<sub>2</sub>]].

Most of these reactions add intermediates to the citric acid cycle, and are therefore known as [[anaplerotic reactions]], from the Greek meaning to \"fill up\".  These increase the amount of acetyl CoA that the cycle is able to carry, increasing the mitochondrion's capability to carry out respiration if this is otherwise a limiting factor. Processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed \"cataplerotic\" reactions.\n\nIn this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are indicated in ''italics'' to distinguish them from other substrates and end-products.\n\n[[Pyruvate]] molecules produced by [[glycolysis]] are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the inner [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] membrane, and into the matrix.

Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' available to combine with ''acetyl-CoA'' to form ''citric acid''. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.<ref name=stryer />\n\n''Acetyl-CoA'', on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acids]], is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of ''acetyl-CoA'' is consumed for every molecule of ''oxaloacetate'' present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of ''acetyl-CoA'' that produces CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with the energy thus released captured in the form of ATP.<ref name=stryer /> The three steps of beta-oxidation resemble the steps that occur in the production of oxaloacetate from succinate in the TCA cycle. Acyl-CoA is oxidized to trans-Enoyl-CoA while FAD is reduced to FADH2, which is similar to the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Following, trans-Enoyl-CoA is hydrated across the double bond to beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA, just like fumarate is hydrated to malate. Lastly, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA is oxidized to beta-ketoacyl-CoA while NAD+ is reduced to NADH, which follows the same process as the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Biochemistry |last=Garrett |first=Reginald H. |date=2013 |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning |last2=Grisham |first2=Charles M. |isbn=9781133106296 |edition=5th |location=Belmont, CA |pages=623-625, 771-773 |oclc=777722371}}</ref>\n\nIn the liver, the carboxylation of [[cytosol]]ic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is an early step in the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway which converts [[lactic acid|lactate]] and de-aminated [[alanine]] into glucose,<ref name=Voet /><ref name=stryer /> under the influence of high levels of [[glucagon]] and/or [[epinephrine]] in the blood.<ref name=stryer /> Here the addition of ''oxaloacetate'' to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (''malate'') is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of [[glycolysis]].<ref name=stryer />\n\nIn [[protein catabolism]], [[protein]]s are broken down by [[protease]]s into their constituent amino acids.

Two support functions for these Engineer Tanks were developed: bridging and mine clearance. The bridging component involved an assault bridge, designed by Major [[Charles Inglis (engineer)|Charles Inglis]] RE, called the Canal Lock Bridge, which had sufficient length to span a [[canal lock]]. Major Martel mated the bridge with the tank and used [[Fluid power|hydraulic power]] generated by the tank's engine to manoeuvre the bridge into place. For mine clearance the tanks were equipped with 2 ton [[Mine roller|rollers]].\n\n===1918-1939===\nBetween the wars various experimental bridging tanks were used to test a series of methods for bridging obstacles and developed by the Experimental Bridging Establishment (EBE). Captain SG Galpin RE conceived a prototype [[Light Tank Mk V]] to test the Scissors Assault Bridge. This concept was realised by Captain SA Stewart RE with significant input from a Mr DM Delany, a scientific civil servant in the employ of the EBE. MB Wild & Co, Birmingham, also developed a bridge that could span gaps of 26 feet using a complex system of steel wire ropes and a travelling jib, where the front section was projected and then attached to the rear section prior to launching the bridge. This system had to be abandoned due to lack of success in getting it to work, however the idea was later used successfully on the [[Leopard 1#Other modifications|Beaver Bridge Laying Tank]].<ref name=\"remuseum.org.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.ca/wiki/index.php/Beaver_AVLB|title=Canadian Defence Force Website|publisher=Army.ca|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Early World War Two===\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1945 NA23553.jpg|thumb|A Churchill bridgelayer of 51st Royal Tank Regiment in action during a demonstration in the Mezzano area, 30 March 1945.]]\n\nOnce World War Two had begun, the development of armoured vehicles for use by engineers in the field was accelerated under Delaney's direction. The EBE rapidly developed an assault bridge carried on a modified [[Covenanter tank]] capable of deploying a 24-ton tracked load capacity bridge (Class 24) that could span gaps of 30 feet.

A heavily modified [[Churchill tank|Churchill]] used a single-piece bridge mounted on a turret-less tank and was able to lay the bridge in 90 seconds; this bridge was able to carry a 60-ton tracked or 40-ton wheeled load.<ref name=\"remuseum.org.uk\"/>\n\n===Late World War 2: Hobart's 'Funnies' and D-Day===\n{{main|Hobart's Funnies}}\n[[Hobart's Funnies]] were a number of unusually modified [[tank]]s operated during the [[World War II|Second World War]] by the [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]] of the [[British Army]] or by specialists from the [[Royal Engineers]]. They were designed in light of problems that more standard tanks experienced during the amphibious [[Dieppe Raid]], so that the new models would be able to overcome the problems of the planned [[Invasion of Normandy]]. These tanks played a major part on the Commonwealth beaches during the landings. They were forerunners of the modern combat engineering vehicle and were named after their commander, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[Percy Hobart]].\n\nHobart's unusual, specialized tanks, nicknamed \"funnies\", included:\n* [[AVRE]] (Assault Vehicle Royal Engineer), used to protect engineers in an assault role, and enable combat engineering.\n* ARK (Armoured Ramp Carrier) where the tank itself was the \"bridge\". Multiple vehicles could be used to span gaps in both the vertical and horizontal. The tank had the turret removed and trackways fitted to the hull. Ramps were attached at each end of the trackways extending the bridging potential and allowing its use in difficult terrain. The tank would need recovery after its use was no longer required.<ref name=\"remuseum.org.uk\"/>\n* Crab: A modified Sherman tank equipped with a [[mine flail]], a rotating cylinder of weighted chains that exploded mines in the path of the tank.\n* [[Armored bulldozer|Armoured Bulldozer]]: A conventional [[Caterpillar D7]] [[bulldozer]] fitted with armour to protect the driver and the engine.

These were produced because of a need for a well-armoured obstacle-clearing vehicle that, unlike a conventional bulldozer, would be fast enough to keep up with tank formations. They were not used on D-Day but were issued to the 79th Armoured Division in Belgium during the latter part of 1944.\n\nIn U.S. Forces, [[Sherman tank]]s were also fitted with dozer blades, and anti-mine roller devices were developed, enabling engineering operations and providing similar capabilities.\n\n===Post War===\nPost war, the value of the combat engineering vehicles had been proven, and armoured multi-role engineering vehicles have been added to the majority of armoured forces.\n\n== Types ==\n=== Civilian and militarized heavy equipment ===\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - D9s Hold Drill Near Gaza Border (1).jpg|thumb|300px|[[IDF Caterpillar D9]]R [[armored bulldozer]]s carry out [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]].

[[Bulldozer]]s, [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, [[grader]]s, [[excavator]]s, [[dump truck]]s, loaders, and backhoes all see extensive use by military engineers.\n\nMilitary engineers may also use civilian heavy equipment which was modified for military applications. Typically, this involves adding armour for protection from battlefield hazards such as artillery, unexploded ordnance, mines, and small arms fire. Often this protection is provided by [[armour plate]]s and steel jackets. Some examples of armoured civilian heavy equipment are the [[IDF Caterpillar D9]], American D7 TPK, Canadian D6 [[Armored bulldozer|armoured bulldozer]], cranes, graders, excavators, and [[M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck]].\n\nMilitarized heavy equipment may also take on the form of traditional civilian equipment designed and built to unique military specifications. These vehicles typically sacrifice some depth of capability from civilian models in order to gain greater speed and independence from prime movers. Examples of this type of vehicle include high speed backhoes such as the Australian Army's High Mobility Engineering Vehicle (HMEV) from Thales or the Canadian Army's Multi-Purpose Engineer Vehicle (MPEV) from Arva.\n\n''The main article for civilian heavy equipment is:'' [[Heavy equipment (construction)]]\n\n=== Armoured engineering vehicle ===\n[[File:Pionierpanzer Dachs (2008).jpg|thumb|''PiPz Dachs'' AEV of the [[German Army]] (2008)]]\n[[File:MID Polish.jpg|right|thumb|Polish Army [[PT-91 Twardy#MID Bizon-S|MID Bizon-S]]]]\nTypically based on the platform of a main battle tank, these vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the US the term \"combat engineer vehicle (CEV)\" is used, in the UK the term \"[[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVRE)\" is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term \"armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)\" is used. There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes or lifting booms.\n\nThese vehicles are designed to directly conduct obstacle breaching operations and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield. Good examples of this type of vehicle include the UK [[Trojan Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|Trojan AVRE]], the Russian IMR, and the US [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]]. Although the term \"armoured engineer vehicle\" is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces. Thus, \"armoured engineer vehicle\" used generically would refer to AEV, AVLB, Assault Breachers, and so on.\n\n=== Armoured earth mover ===\nLighter and less multi-functional than the CEVs or AEVs described above, these vehicles are designed to conduct earth-moving work on the battlefield. These vehicles have greater high speed mobility than traditional heavy equipment and are protected against the effects of blast and fragmentation. Good examples are the American [[M9 ACE]] and the UK [[FV180 Combat Engineer Tractor]].\n\n=== Breaching vehicle ===\n[[Image:M1 Assault Breacher Vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|Marines with 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion launch a [[M58 MICLIC]] from an [[Assault Breacher Vehicle]].]]\nThese vehicles are equipped with mechanical or other means for the breaching of man made obstacles. Common types of breaching vehicles include mechanical [[Mine flail|flails]], mine plough vehicles, and mine roller vehicles. In some cases, these vehicles will also mount [[Mine-clearing line charge]]s. Breaching vehicles may be either converted armoured fighting vehicles or purpose built vehicles. In larger militaries, converted AFV are likely to be used as ''assault breachers'' while the breached obstacle is still covered by enemy observation and fire, and then purpose built breaching vehicles will create additional lanes for following forces.\n\nGood examples of breaching vehicles include the USMC M1 [[Assault Breacher Vehicle]], the UK [[Aardvark JSFU]], and the Singaporean Trailblazer.\n\n=== Bridging vehicles ===\n[[File:M104 HAB.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Army [[M104 Wolverine]] Heavy Assault Bridge]]\nSeveral types of military bridging vehicles have been developed. An [[armoured vehicle-launched bridge]] (AVLB) is typically a modified tank hull converted to carry a bridge into battle in order to support crossing ditches, small waterways, or other gap obstacles.\n\nAnother type of bridging vehicle is the truck launched bridge. The Soviet TMM bridging truck could carry and launch a 10-meter bridge that could be daisy-chained with other TMM bridges to cross larger obstacles. More recent developments have seen the conversion of AVLB and truck launched bridge with launching systems that can be mounted on either tank or truck for bridges that are capable of supporting heavy main battle tanks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces-int.com/article/leguan-system.html|title=The LEGUAN System|work=armedforces-int.com|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nEarlier examples of bridging vehicles include a type in which a converted tank hull is the bridge. On these vehicles, the hull deck comprises the main portion of the tread way while ramps extend from the front and rear of the vehicle to allow other vehicles to climb over the bridging vehicle and cross obstacles. An example of this type of armoured bridging vehicle was the [[Churchill Ark]] used in the Second World War.\n\n=== Combat engineer section carriers ===\n[[File:Nammer-Handasa -- Our-IDF-2018-IZE-073 (44815210772).jpg|thumb|[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] [[Namer]] CEV is used both to carry section of sappers and to operate combat engineering devices.]]\n[[File:Stryker ESV front q.jpg|thumb|right|[[M1132 Engineer Squad Vehicle]] (ESV) issued to combat engineer squads in the US Army [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team]]s.]]\nAnother type of CEVs are armoured fighting vehicles which are used to transport [[sapper]]s ([[combat engineer]]s) and can be fitted with a [[bulldozer]]'s blade and other mine-breaching devices. They are often used as APCs because of their carrying ability and heavy protection. They are usually armed with [[machine gun]]s and grenade launchers and usually tracked to provide enough tractive force to push blades and rakes. Some examples are the U.S. [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113 APC]], [[IDF Puma]], [[Nagmachon]], Husky, and U.S. [[M1132 Engineer Support Vehicle|M1132 ESV]] (a [[Stryker]] variant).\n\n=== Military ferries and amphibious crossing vehicles ===\n[[Image:French army EFA DSC00859.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This field-deployable apparatus, known as [[EFA (mobile bridge)|EFA]], used by the engineers of the [[French Army]], may either be used as a [[bridge]] (deployed in a series), or as a [[ferry]] ]]\nOne of the major tasks of military engineering is crossing major rivers. Several military engineering vehicles have been developed in various nations to achieve this task. One of the more common types is the amphibious [[ferry]] such as the [[M3 Amphibious Rig]]. These vehicles are self-propelled on land, they can transform into raft type ferries when in the water, and often multiple vehicles can connect to form larger rafts or [[pontoon bridge|floating bridge]]s. Other types of military ferries, such as the Soviet ''[[PTS (amphibious vehicle)|Plavayushij Transportyor - Srednyj]]'', are able to load while still on land and transport other vehicles cross country and over water.\n\nIn addition to amphibious crossing vehicles, military engineers may also employ several types of boats. Military assault boats are small boats propelled by oars or an outboard motor and used to ferry dismounted infantry across water.\n\n== Tank-based combat engineering vehicles ==\n[[Image:AVRE-Bobbin.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill \"Bobbin\", a rolled roadsurface (like a chespaling mat) that could be laid for following vehicles to cross loose sand on a beach. The raised boxes at the rear of the vehicle are radiator extensions to allow deep wading in water.]] \nMost CEVs are [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s that may be based on a [[tank]] [[chassis]] and have special attachments in order to breach obstacles. Such attachments may include dozer blades, [[land mine|mine]] rollers, cranes etc. An example of an engineering vehicle of this kind is a bridgelaying tank, which replaces the turret with a segmented hydraulic [[bridge]]. The [[Hobart's Funnies]] of the Second World War were a wide variety of armoured vehicles for combat engineering tasks. They were allocated to the initial beachhead assaults by the British and Commonwealth forces in the D-Day landings\n\n===Churchill tank===\nThe British [[Churchill tank]] because of its good cross-country performance and capacious interior with side hatches became the most adapted with modifications, the base unit being the AVRE carrying a large demolition gun.\n\n===M4 Sherman===\n[[Image:M4A3-Sherman-105mm-Dozer-latrun-1.jpg|right|thumb|M4 with 105 mm howitzer and a dozer blade.]] \n*'''Dozer''': The bulldozer blade was a valuable battlefield tool on the WWII [[M4 Sherman tank]]. A 1943 field modification added the hydraulic dozer blade from a [[Caterpillar D8]] to a Sherman. The later M1 dozer blade was standardized to fit any Sherman with VVSS suspension and the M1A1 would fit the wider HVSS. Some M4s made for the Engineer Corps had the blades fitted permanently and the turrets removed. In the early stages of the 1944 [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] before the [[Rhino tank|Culin Cutter]], breaking through the [[Bocage]] hedgerows relied heavily on Sherman dozers.\n*'''M4 Doozit''': Engineer Corps' Sherman dozer with demolition charge on wooden platform and T40 ''Whizbang'' rocket launcher (the ''Doozit'' did not see combat but the ''[[Rocket artillery|Whizbang]]'' did).\n*'''Bridgelayer''': The US field-converted a few M4 in Italy with A-frame-supported bridge and heavy rear counter-weight to make the Mobile Assault Bridge. British developments for Shermans included the [[fascine]] (used by [[79th Armoured Division]]), Crib, Twaby Ark, Octopus, Plymouth ([[Bailey Bridge]]), and AVRE ([[Small Box Girder|SBG]] bridge).\n*'''Mine-Clearing''': British conversions included the [[Sherman Crab]]. The US developed an extensive array of experimental types:\n**'''T15/E1/E2''': Series of mine resistant Shermans based on the T14 kit.

Each treadway is made up of a box-type aluminum girder with a folding ramp attached to both ends to save space in the travel position. Because of that the vehicle with the bridge on board is only 11.6 m long, but the overall span length is 20 m. This is an increase of about 62% over that of the older MTU-1. The bridge is launched by the cantilever method. First the ramps are lowered and fully extended before the treadways are forward with the full load of the bridge resting on the forward support plate during launch. The span is moved out over the launching girder until the far end reaches the far bank. Next the near end is lowered onto the near bank. This method of launching gives the bridgelayer a low silhouette which makes it less vulnerable to detection and destruction.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n** '''MTU-20''' based on the T-55 chassis.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n* '''BTS-1''' (''Bronetankoviy Tyagach Sredniy'' - Medium Armoured Tractor) - This is basically a turretless T-54A with a stowage basket.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/><ref name=\"softland.com.pl\">[http://softland.com.pl/aerojac/aaa/wzt-1/wzt1.htm softland.com.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321113355/http://softland.com.pl/aerojac/aaa/wzt-1/wzt1.htm |date=2009-03-21 }}</ref>\n** '''BTS-1M''' - improved or remanufactured BTS-1.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n* '''BTS-2 (Ob'yekt 9)''' (''Bronetankoviy Tyagach Sredniy'' - Medium Armoured Tractor) - BTS-1 upgraded with a hoist and a small folding crane with a capacity of 3,000&nbsp;kg.

The eastern counties of these marches were united under the rule of the Frankish vassal, the [[County of Barcelona|count of Barcelona]], and were later called Catalonia. In 1137, Catalonia and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] were united by marriage under the [[Crown of Aragon]], and the [[Principality of Catalonia]] developed its own institutional system, such as [[Catalan Courts|courts]] ([[parliament]]), and [[Catalan constitutions|constitutions]], becoming the base for the Crown of Aragon's naval power, trade and expansionism in the Mediterranean. In the later Middle Ages, [[Catalan literature]] flourished. During the last Medieval centuries natural disasters, social turmoils and military conflicts affected the Principality. Between 1469 and 1516, the king of Aragon and the queen of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] married and ruled their kingdoms together, retaining all of them their distinct institutions and legislation.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)|Franco-Spanish War]] (1635\u20131659), [[Reapers' War|Catalonia revolted]] (1640\u20131652) against a large and burdensome presence of the royal army in its territory, being briefly proclaimed a [[Catalan Republic (1641)|republic]] under French protection. Within a brief period France took full control of Catalonia, until it was largely reconquered by the Spanish army. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, the [[Spanish Crown]] ceded the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly the [[County of Roussillon]], to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714), the Crown of Aragon sided against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain]]; following Catalan defeat on 11 September 1714, Philip V, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], suppressing the main Catalan institutions and rights like in the other realms of the Crown of Aragon. This led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature, replaced by Spanish. Along the 18th century, Catalonia experienced economic growth, reinforced in the late quarter of the century when the Castile's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.\n\nIn the 19th century, Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[Carlist Wars]]. In the second half of the century, Catalonia experienced significant industrialisation. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a [[Renaixen\u00e7a|cultural renaissance]] coupled with incipient [[Catalan nationalism|nationalism]] while several workers movements appeared. In 1914, the four Catalan provinces formed a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|commonwealth]], and with the return of democracy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931\u20131939), the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat of Catalonia]] was restored as an autonomous government. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan self-government and banning the official use of the Catalan language again. After a first period of [[Autarky|autarky]], from the late 1950s through to the 1970s Catalonia saw [[Spanish miracle|rapid economic growth]], drawing many workers from across Spain, making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas and turning Catalonia into a major tourist destination. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1975\u20131982), Catalonia has regained considerable autonomy in political, educational, environmental, and cultural affairs and is now one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. In the 2010s there has been growing support for [[Catalan independence movement|Catalan independence]].\n\nOn 27 October 2017, the Catalan Parliament declared independence from Spain following a disputed referendum. The Spanish Senate voted in favour of enforcing direct rule by removing the entire Catalan government and calling [[Catalan regional election, 2017|a snap regional election for 21 December]]. On 2 November of the same year, the Spanish Supreme Court imprisoned 7 former ministers of the Catalan government on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, while several others, including the President Carles Puigdemont, fled to European countries.\n\n== Etymology and pronunciation ==\nThe name Catalonia\u2014''Catalunya'' in Catalan, spelled ''Cathalonia'', or ''Cathalaunia'' in [[Medieval Latin]]\u2014began to be used for the homeland of the [[Catalans]] (''Cathalanenses'') in the late 11th century and was probably used before as a territorial reference to the group of counties that comprised part of the March of Gothia and [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]] under the control of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and his relatives.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana online: Catalunya (\"Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112\")] (in Catalan) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211826/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 |date=6 February 2012 }}</ref> The origin of the name ''Catalunya'' is subject to diverse interpretations because of a lack of evidence.\n\nOne theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' derives from the name ''Gothia'' (or ''Gauthia'') ''Launia'' (\"Land of the [[Goths]]\"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, known as ''Gothia'', whence ''Gothland'' > ''Gothlandia'' > ''Gothalania'' > ''Cathalaunia'' > ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.<ref name=\"Books.google.com\"/><ref>{{cite book| author = Ulick Ralph Burke| title = A history of Spain from the earliest times to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic| url = https://books.google.com/?id=tz3g_YzTQaUC&pg=PA154| year = 1900| publisher = Longmans, Green, and co.| page = 154}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chroniclers claimed that ''Catalania'' derives from the local medley of [[Goths]] with [[Alans]], initially constituting a ''Goth-Alania''.<ref>The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, 19 August 2002.</ref>\n\nOther less plausible or recent theories suggest:\n\n* ''Catalunya'' derives from the term \"land of castles\", having evolved from the term ''castl\u00e0'' or ''castlan'', the medieval term for a [[castellan]] (a ruler of a [[castle]]).<ref name=\"Books.google.com\">{{cite book| author = Maximiano Garc\u00eda Venero| title = Historia del nacionalismo catal\u00e1n: 2a edici\u00f3n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 25 April 2010| date = 7 July 2006| publisher = Ed.

The most important sites from these eras, all excavated in the region of [[Moian\u00e8s]], are the Balma del Gai (Epipaleolithic) and the Balma de l'Espluga (late Epipaleolithic and Early Neolithic).<ref>Jean Guilaine, Michel Barbaza, David Geddes, Jean-Louis Vernet, Miguel Llongueras & Maria Hopf (1982) Prehistoric Human Adaptations in Catalonia (Spain), Journal of Field Archaeology, 9:4, 407-416.</ref>\n\nThe [[Neolithic]] era began in Catalonia around 5000 BC, although the population was slower to develop fixed settlements than in other places, thanks to the abundance of woods, which allowed the continuation of a fundamentally [[hunter-gatherer]] culture. An example of such settlements would be La Draga, an \"early Neolithic village which dates from the end of the 6th millennium BC.\"<ref>Tarrus, Josep. \"La Draga (Banyoles, Catalonia), an Early Neolithic Lakeside Village in Mediterranean Europe.\" ''CATALAN HISTORICAL REVIEW'', vol. 1, 2008, pp. 17\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe [[Chalcolithic]] period developed in Catalonia between 2500 and 1800 BCE, with the beginning of the construction of copper objects. The [[Bronze Age]] occurred between 1800 and 700 BCE. There are few remnants of this era, but there were some known settlements in the [[Segre (river)|low Segre]] zone. The Bronze Age coincided with the arrival of the [[proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] through the [[Urnfield Culture]], whose successive waves of migration began around 1200 BC, and they were responsible for the creation of the first proto-urban settlements. Around the middle of the 7th century BC, the [[Iron Age]] arrived in Catalonia.\n\n=== Pre-Roman and Roman period ===\n[[File:Els Vilars \u2014 vista sud-oest 01.jpg|thumb|Iberian fortress [[Els Vilars]] in [[Arbeca]]]]\n[[File:Tarragona.Pont del diable aq\u00fceducte.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman aqueduct]] in [[Tarragona]] ]]\nIn pre-Roman times, the area that is now called Catalonia in the north-east of [[Iberian Peninsula]] \u2013 like the rest of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] side of the peninsula \u2013 was populated by the [[Iberians]]. The Iberians of this area \u2013 the [[Ilergetes]], [[Indigetes]] and [[Lacetani]] (Cerretains) \u2013 also maintained relations with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda (Lleida) inland, Hibera (perhaps [[Amposta]] or [[Tortosa]]) or Indika ([[Ullastret]]). Coastal trading colonies were established by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Gulf of Roses]], in Emporion ([[Emp\u00faries]]) and [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] in the [[Colonies in antiquity|8th century BC]]. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] briefly ruled the territory in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] and traded with [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|the surrounding Iberian population]].\n\nAfter the Carthaginian defeat by the [[Roman Republic]], the north-east of Iberia became the first to come under Roman rule and became part of [[Hispania]], the westernmost part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Tarraco (Tarragona)|Tarraco]] (modern [[Tarragona]]) was one of the most important Roman cities in Hispania and the capital of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Tarraconensis]]. Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuri\u00e6 (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). As for the rest of Hispania, [[Latin law]] was granted to all cities under the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69-79 AD), while [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all free men of the empire by the [[Edict of Caracalla|Edict of]] [[Caracalla]] in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of [[Roman law]] since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, [[wheat]]), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the [[Via Augusta]], parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]].\n\nConversion to [[Christianity]], attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of [[Vandals]], [[Swabians]] and [[Alans]] in the 5th century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some [[deurbanization]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\n[[File:Origen de l'escut del comtat de Barcelona de Lorenzale.jpg|thumb|left|''Origins of the blason of the County of Barcelona'', by [[Claudi Lorenzale]] ]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the area was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] and was ruled as part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] for almost two and a half centuries. In 718, it came under [[Muslim]] control and became part of [[Al-Andalus]], a province of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. From the conquest of Roussillon in 760, to the conquest of Barcelona in 801, the [[Frankish empire]] took control of the area between Septimania and the [[Llobregat]] river from the Muslims and created heavily militarised, self-governing [[county|counties]]. These counties formed part of the [[Septimania|Gothic]] and [[Spanish March|Hispanic]] marches, a [[buffer zone]] in the south of the Frankish empire in the former province of Septimania and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to act as a defensive barrier for the Frankish empire against further Muslim invasions from Al-Andalus.\n[[File:Petronila Ramon Berenguer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Petronilla of Aragon]] and [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], dynastic union of the [[Crown of Aragon]]]]\nThese counties came under the rule of the [[Count of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]], who were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor of the Franks, to whom they were [[feudatory|feudatories]] (801\u2013987). The earliest known use of the name \"[[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]\" for these counties dates to 1117. During the 9th century, the Count [[Wifred the Hairy]] made its title hereditary and founded the dynasty of the [[House of Barcelona]], which ruled part of today's Catalonia until 1410.\n\n[[File:Hug IV Empuries Pero Ma\u00e7a Croada Mayurqa 1229.jpg|thumb|170px|Hug IV, count of Emp\u00faries, and Pero Ma\u00e7a during the conquest of Mallorca (1229)]]\n[[File:Cortes Catalanas.jpg|thumb|A 15th-century miniature of the Catalan Courts]]\nIn 987 [[Borrell II]], Count of Barcelona, did not recognise [[Hugh Capet]] as his king, making his successors (from Ramon Borrell I to Ramon Berenguer IV) de facto independent of the Capetian crown whom they regarded as usurpers of the Carolingian Frankish realm. At the start of eleventh century the Catalan Counties suffer an important process of feudalisation, partially controlled by the [[Peace and Truce of God|Peace and Truce Assemblies]] and by the power and negotiation skills of the Counts of Barcelona like [[Ramon Berenguer I]]. In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] decided to accept [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II of Aragon]]'s proposal to marry Queen [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronila]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], joining the [[Crown of Aragon]] and making the Catalan counties that were united under the county of Barcelona into a [[principality]] of the Aragonese Crown.\n\nIn 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], the [[Count of Barcelona]] and King of Aragon, of Mallorca and of Valencia, [[James I of Aragon]] renounced his family rights and dominions in [[Occitania]] and recognised the king of France as heir of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Dynasty]]. The king of France formally relinquished his nominal feudal lordship over all the Catalan counties, except the [[County of Foix]], despite the opposition of the king of Aragon and count of Barcelona. This treaty transformed the principality's ''[[de facto]]'' union with Aragon into a ''[[de jure]]'' one and was the origin of the definitive separation between the geographical areas of Catalonia and [[Languedoc]].\n\nAs a coastal territory, Catalonia became the base of the Aragonese Crown's maritime forces, which spread the power of the Aragonese Crown in the Mediterranean, and made Barcelona into a powerful and wealthy city. In the period of 1164\u20131410, new territories, the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], [[Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Corsica]], and (briefly) the [[Duchy|Duchies]] of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]], were incorporated into the dynastic domains of the [[House of Aragon]].\n\nAt the same time, the Principality of Catalonia developed a complex institutional and political system based in the concept of a pact between the [[estates of the realm]] and the king. Laws had to be approved in the [[Catalan Courts|General Court of Catalonia]], one of the first parliamentary bodies of Europe that banned the royal power to create legislation unilaterally (since 1283).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://usuarios.multimania.es/maarian/Catalunya/historiacataluna/las_cortes_catalanas_.htm |title=Las Cortes Catalanas y la primera Generalidad medieval (s.

In order to collect general taxes, the Courts of 1359 established a permanent representative of deputies position, called the Deputation of the General (and later usually known as [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat]]), which gained political power over the next centuries.\n\nThe domains of the Aragonese Crown were severely affected by the [[Black Death]] pandemic and by later outbreaks of the [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Between 1347 and 1497 Catalonia lost 37 percent of its population.<ref>According to John Huxtable Elliott, \"Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality [Catalonia] had lost 37% of its inhabitants, and was reduced to a population of something like 300,000.\" {{cite book| author = John Huxtable Elliott| title = The revolt of the Catalans: a study in the decline of Spain (1598\u20131640)| url = https://books.google.com/?id=X2Hf-crzPjUC&pg=PA26| year = 1984| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn = 0-521-27890-2| page = 26 }}</ref> In 1410, King [[Martin of Aragon|Martin I]] died without surviving descendants. Under the [[Compromise of Caspe]], Ferdinand from the Castilian [[House of Trast\u00e1mara]] received the Crown of Aragon as [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]]. During the reign of his son, [[John II of Aragon and Navarre|John II]], social and political tensions caused the [[Catalan Civil War]] (1462\u20131472).\n\n=== Modern Era ===\n[[File:Cataloniae principatus 1608.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Principality of Catalonia]] (1608)]]\n[[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the grandson of Ferdinand I, and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] were married in 1469, later taking the title the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; subsequently, this event was seen by historiographers as the dawn of a unified Spain. At this time, though united by marriage, the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] maintained distinct territories, each keeping its own traditional institutions, parliaments, and laws. Castile commissioned expeditions to the [[Americas]] and benefited from the riches acquired in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonisation of the Americas]], but, in time, also carried the main burden of military expenses of the united Spanish kingdoms. After Isabella's death, Ferdinand II personally ruled both kingdoms.\n\nBy virtue of descent from his maternal grandparents, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, in 1516 [[Charles I of Spain]] became the first king to rule the Crowns of Castile and Aragon simultaneously by his own right. Following the death of his paternal ([[House of Habsburg]]) grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he was also elected [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], in 1519.<ref>{{cite web |last=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica online |title=Charles V |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107009/Charles-V |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Els segadors.jpg|thumb|''[[Corpus de Sang]]'' (7 June 1640), one of the main events of the Catalan Revolt. Painted in 1910]]\nOver the next few centuries, the Principality of Catalonia was generally on the losing side of a series of wars that led steadily to more centralization of power in Spain. Despite this fact, between the 16th and 18th centuries, the participation of the political community in the local and the general Catalan government was increased, while the kings remained absent and its constitutional system continued to consolidate. The [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] (1640\u20131652) saw Catalonia rebel (briefly as a [[Catalan Republic (1641)|republic]] led by [[Pau Claris]]) with French help against the Spanish Crown for overstepping Catalonia's rights during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Most of Catalonia was reconquered by the Spanish monarchy but Catalan rights were recognised. Roussillon was lost to France by the [[Peace of the Pyrenees]] (1659).\n\nThe most significant conflict concerning the governing monarchy was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which began when the childless [[Charles II of Spain]], the last Spanish Habsburg, died without an heir in 1700. Charles II had chosen [[Philip V of Spain]] from the French [[House of Bourbon]]. Catalonia, like other territories that formed the Crown of Aragon, rose up in support of the Austrian Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], in his claim for the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain. The fight between the houses of Bourbon and Habsburg for the Spanish Crown split Spain and Europe.\n\nThe [[Siege of Barcelona (1713\u201314)|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714 to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] militarily ended the Habsburg claim to the Spanish Crown, which became legal fact in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Philip felt that he had been betrayed by the Catalan Courts, as it had initially sworn its loyalty to him when he had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, the first Bourbon king introduced the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] that incorporated the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, within a united kingdom of Spain. During the second half of 18th century Catalonia started a successful process of [[proto-industrialization]].\n\n=== Industrialisation, Republic and autonomy ===\n[[File:Cesar Alvarez Dumont - El Gran dia de Girona.jpg|thumb|[[Third Siege of Girona]] (1809), [[Peninsular War]] against Napoleon]]\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1808 it was occupied by the French troops, the resistance against the occupation eventually developed into the [[Peninsular War]]. Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to establish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of [[Marshall Augereau]], and making Catalan briefly an official language again. Between 1812 and 1814 Catalonia was annexed to France and organized as four [[French departments of Spain|d\u00e9partements]]. The French troops evacuated Catalan territory at the end of 1814. After the Bourbon restoration in Spain and the death of the abolutist king [[Ferdinand VII]], [[Carlist Wars]] erupted against the new born [[Liberalism|liberal state]] of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. Catalonia was divided, the coast and most industrialized areas support liberalism, while many inland areas were in the hands of Carlists. \n\n[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]], 1909]]\nIn the second third of the 19th century, it became an industrial center. This process was boosted by, amongst other things, national [[:es:Ley de Relaciones Comerciales con las Antillas|protectionist laws]] (although the policy of the Spanish government during those times changed many times between free trade and protectionism) and the conditions of proto-industrialization of the prior two centuries of the Catalan urban areas and its countryside. To this day it remains one of the most industrialised areas of Spain. In 1832 it was inaugurated in Barcelona the factory Bonaplata, the first of the country which worked with [[steam engine]]. During those years, Barcelona was the focus of important revolutionary uprisings, called \"bullangues\", causing a difficult relation between many sectors of Catalan society and the central government and, in Catalonia, a [[republicanism|republican]] current began to develop; also, inevitably, many Catalans favored a more federal Spain. Meanwhile the Catalan language saw a cultural renaissance (the ''[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]'') at popular and bourgeois level. After the fall of the [[First Spanish Republic]] and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty (1874), Catalan nationalism grew in importance.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11543, Madrid, Ausrufung der Zweiten Spanischen Republik.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] on 14 April 1931 in Barcelona]]\nThe Anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, founding the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] trade union and achieving one of the first [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] in Europe in 1919. Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in Barcelona in 1909. In the first third of the 20th century, Catalonia gained and lost varying degrees of autonomy several times. In 1914, the four Catalan provinces were authorized to create a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|Commonwealth]] (''Mancomunitat''), without any legislative power or specific autonomy which carried out an ambicious program of modernization, but that was disbanded in 1925 by the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]. During the last steps of the Dictatorship, Barcelona celebrated the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|1929 International Exposition]], while Spain started to suffer an economical crisis. \n\nAfter the fall of the dictator and a brief proclamation of the [[Catalan Republic (1931)|Catalan Republic]], it received its [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1932|first Statute of Autonomy]] during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931\u20131939), establishing an autonomous body, the Generalitat of Catalonia, which included a parliament, a government and a [[Tribunal de Cassaci\u00f3|court of appeal]], and the left-wing independentist leader [[Francesc Maci\u00e0]] was elected its first president. The governments of the Republican Generalitat, leaded by the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) members Francesc Maci\u00e0 (1931-1933) and [[Llu\u00eds Companys]] (1933-1940) tried to implement an advanced social program, despite the internal difficulties. This period was marked by political unrest, the effects of the economic crisis and its social repercussions. The Statute was suspended in 1934, due to the [[Events of 6 October]] in Barcelona, as a response to the accession of right-wing Spanish nationalist party [[CEDA]] to the government of the Republic, considered close to [[fascism]]. After the electoral victory of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] in February 1936, the Government of Catalonia was pardoned and the self-government restored.\n\n=== Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939) and Franco's rule (1939\u20131975) ===\n{{main|Revolutionary Catalonia|Francoist Catalonia}}\n{{double image|right|Strijdlustige vrouw - Woman ready to fight (3334194838).jpg|188|Barcelona bombing (1938).jpg|223|Left: [[Spanish Revolution of 1936]]. Right: [[Bombing of Barcelona]] (1938)}}\nThe defeat of the [[July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona|military rebellion against the Republican government in Barcelona]] placed Catalonia firmly in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican side]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the war, there were two rival powers in Catalonia: the de jure power of the Generalitat and the de facto power of the armed popular militias. Violent confrontations between the workers' parties ([[CNT-FAI]] and [[Workers Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] against the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia|PSUC]]) culminated in the defeat of the first ones in 1937. The situation resolved itself progressively in favor of the Generalitat, but at the same time the Generalitat was partially losing its autonomous power within Republican Spain. In 1938 Franco's troops broke the Republican territory in two, isolating Catalonia from the rest of the Republic. The defeat of the Republican army in the [[Battle of the Ebro]] led in 1938 and 1939 to the occupation of Catalonia by Franco's forces.\n\nThe defeat of the Spanish Republic in the [[Spanish Civil War]] brought ultraconservative dictator<ref>Payne, Stanley Fascism in Spain, 1923\u20131977, p. 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press</ref> [[Francisco Franco]] to power. His regime imposed linguistic, political and cultural restrictions across Spain. In Catalonia, any kind of public activities associated with [[Catalan nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[democracy]] or [[communism]], including the publication of books on those subjects or simply discussion of them in open meetings, was banned. [[File:FrancoenReus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francisco Franco]] in [[Reus]], 1940]] Franco's regime banned the use of Catalan in government-run institutions and during public events, and also the Catalan institutions of self-government were abolished. The pro-Republic of Spain president of Catalonia, [[Llu\u00eds Companys]], was taken to Spain from his exile in the German-occupied France, and was tortured and executed in the [[Montju\u00efc Castle]] of Barcelona for the crime of 'military rebellion'.<ref>Preston, Paul. (2012). ''The Spanish Holocaust.'' Harper Press. London p. 493</ref>\n\nDuring later stages of [[Francoist Spain]], certain folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated.

Catalonia, like many other parts of Spain, had been devastated by the war. Recovery from the war damage was slow and made more difficult by the international trade embargo and the [[Autarky|autarkic]] politics of Franco's regime. By the late 1950s the region had recovered its pre-war economic levels and in the 1960s was the second fastest growing economy in the world in what became known as the [[Spanish miracle]]. During this period there was a spectacular growth of industry and tourism in Catalonia that drew large numbers of workers to the region from across Spain and made the area around Barcelona into one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas.\n\n=== Transition and democratic period (1975\u2013present) ===\n\n[[File:Barcelona AUGUST 1992 the Olympic Games (Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de Barcelona 1992) - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200px|The Olympic flame in the [[Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys|Olympic Stadium Llu\u00eds Companys]] of [[Barcelona]] during the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]]]\nAfter Franco's death in 1975, Catalonia voted for the adoption of a democratic Spanish Constitution in 1978, in which Catalonia recovered political and cultural autonomy, restoring the Generalitat (exiled since the end of the Civil War in 1939) in 1977 and adopting a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|new Statute of Autonomy]] in 1979. [[Catalan regional election, 1980|First election]] to the Parliament of Catalonia under this Statute gave the Catalan presidency to [[Jordi Pujol]], a position he would hold until 2003. During this time he also led [[Convergence and Unity|Converg\u00e8ncia i Uni\u00f3]] (CiU) a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the institutions of Catalan autonomy continued to develop, among them an autonomous police force (''[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]'', in 1983),<ref>[https://mossos.gencat.cat/ca/els_mossos_desquadra/historia_de_la_pg-me/ History of the Mossos d'Esquadra] mossos.gencat.cat</ref> and the broadcasting network [[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]] and its first channel [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], created in 1983.<ref>[http://www.ccma.cat/corporatiu/en/historia/ History of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya] ccma.cat</ref> Today, Catalonia is one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. The Catalan capital and largest city, Barcelona, is a major international cultural centre and a major tourist destination. In 1992, [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona hosted]] the [[Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nIn November 2003, elections to the Parliament of Catalonia gave the government to a left-wing catalanist coalition formed by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] (PSC-PSOE), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] (ICV), and the socialist [[Pasqual Maragall]] was appointed President. The new government redacted a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|new version of the Statute of Autonomy]], which consolidated and extended certain aspects of self-government.\n\nThe new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved after a referendum in 2006, was contested by important sectors of the Spanish society, especially by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], which sent the law to the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].

The Catalan territory is divided into three main geomorphological units:<ref>{{cite web|title=Geological map of Catalonia|url=http://www.icgc.cat/en/Public-Administration-and-Enterprises/Downloads/Geological-and-geothematic-cartography/Geological-mapping/Geological-map-of-Catalonia-1-50.000|publisher=Institut Cartogr\u00e0fic i Geol\u00f2gic de Catalunya|accessdate=11 October 2017|date=2016}}</ref>\n\n* The Pyrenees: mountainous formation that connects the Iberian Peninsula with the [[Continental Europe|European continental territory]], and located in the north of Catalonia;\n* The Catalan Coastal mountain ranges or the Catalan Mediterranean System: an alternating delevacions and planes parallel to the Mediterranean coast;\n* The [[Catalan Central Depression]]: structural unit which forms the eastern sector of the Valley of the Ebro.\n\n[[File:Montserrat - 20.jpg|thumb|left|Pla de [[Bages]] (part of the [[Catalan Central Depression|Central Depression]]) and the mountain of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]]]]\nThe Catalan Pyrenees represent almost half in length of the Pyrenees, as it extends more than {{convert|200|km|abbr=off}}. Traditionally differentiated the Axial Pyrenees (the main part) and the [[Pre-Pyrenees]] (southern from the Axial) which are mountainous formations parallel to the main mountain ranges but with lower altitudes, less steep and a different geological formation. The highest mountain of Catalonia, located north of the comarca of Pallars Sobir\u00e0 is the Pica d'Estats (3,143&nbsp;m), followed by the Puigpedr\u00f3s (2,914&nbsp;m). On the Pre-Pyrenees is located the [[Serra del Cad\u00ed]], that separates the valley of [[Cerdanya]] from the Central Depression.\n\nCentral Catalan Depression is a plain located between the Pyrenees and Pre-Coastal Mountains. The Depression lands are located between {{convert|200|and|600|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The plains and the water that descend from the Pyrenees have made it fertile territory for [[agriculture]] and there are built numerous irrigation canals. Other important plain is the [[Empord\u00e0]], located on the northeast.\n\nThe Catalan Mediterranean system is based on two (more or less) parallel ranges to the coast, in a Northwest direction towards the Southwest. These two mountain ranges are the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal. The Coastal Range is minor extent and it has lower altitudes, while the Pre-Coastal is larger in both length and height. The most relevant mountains of this area are [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], [[Montseny Massif|Montseny]] and [[Ports de Tortosa-Beseit|Ports]]. Within the ranges are a series of plains, the entities over which form the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal Depressions. The Coastal Depression is located on the East of the Coastal Range towards the coast. The Pre-Coastal, on the other hand, is located in the interior, between the two mountain ranges, and constitutes the basis of the plains of [[Vall\u00e8s]] and [[Pened\u00e8s]].\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n[[File:BennyTrapp Montseny-Gebirgsmolch Calotriton arnoldi Montseny-Gebirge Spanien.jpg|thumb|Montseny brook newt (''[[Calotriton arnoldi]]''), [[endemic]] to the [[Montseny Massif]]]]\nCatalonia is a showcase of European [[landscapes]] on a small scale.

The area is of great ecological diversity and a remarkable wealth of landscapes, habitats and species.\n\nThe fauna of Catalonia comprises a minority of animals endemic to the region and a majority of non-native animals. Much of Catalonia enjoys a Mediterranean climate (except mountain areas), which makes many of the animals that live there adapted to Mediterranean ecosystems. Of mammals, there are plentiful [[wild boar]], red foxes, as well as [[roe deer]] and in the Pyrenees, the [[Pyrenean chamois]]. Other large species such as the [[bear]] have been recently reintroduced.\n\nWaters of [[Balearic Sea]] are rich in biodiversity, and even the [[megafauna]]s of ocean; various type of whales (such as [[fin whale|fin]], [[sperm whale|sperm]], and [[long-finned pilot whale|pilot]]) and [[dolphin]]s live within the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmaktub.org/en/home-2/|title=EDMAKTUB I Estudio de cet\u00e1ceos|website=www.edmaktub.org}}</ref><ref>Casinos A.

The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the [[Ebro]] and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia (respectively covering 46.84% and 51.43% of the territory), all of them flow to the [[Mediterranean]]. Furthermore, there is the [[Garona]] river basin that flows to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but it only covers 1.73% of the Catalan territory.\n\nThe hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebro river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of {{convert|18,700|hm3|cumi|lk=on|abbr=off}} per year, while the second only provides an average of {{convert|2,020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on}}/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebro river, from which the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] is an important tributary.

It is elected every four years by [[universal suffrage]], and it has powers to legislate in different matters such as education, health, culture, internal institutional and territorial organization, election and control of the president of the Generalitat and the Government, budget and others, according with the Statute of Autonomy. The last Catalan election was held on 21 December 2017, and its current president is [[Roger Torrent]], incumbent since January 2018.\n\n==== Presidency ====\nThe [[president of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] (in Catalan: ''president de la Generalitat de Catalunya'') is the highest representative of Catalonia, and is also responsible of leading the government's action. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|presidents of Catalonia]] have been [[Josep Tarradellas]] (1977\u20131980, president in exile since 1954), [[Jordi Pujol]] (1980\u20132003), [[Pasqual Maragall]] (2003\u20132006), [[Jos\u00e9 Montilla]] (2006\u20132010), [[Artur Mas]] (2010\u20132016), [[Carles Puigdemont]] (2016&ndash;2017) and, after the imposition of direct rule from Madrid, [[Quim Torra]] (2018\u2013).\n\n==== Executive ====\nThe [[Executive Council of Catalonia|Executive Council]] (in Catalan: ''Consell Executiu'') or Government (''Govern''), is the body responsible of the government of the Generalitat, it holds executive and regulatory power.

Since 1980 they have been under the command of the Generalitat, and since 1994 they have expanded in number in order to replace the national [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and [[National Police Corps]], which report directly to the Homeland Department of Spain. The national bodies retain personnel within Catalonia to exercise functions of national scope such as overseeing ports, airports, coasts, international borders, custom offices, the identification of documents and arms control, immigration control, terrorism prevention, arms trafficking prevention, amongst others.\n\nMost of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions, the highest body and last judicial instance in the Catalan jurisdiction, integrating the Spanish judiciary, is the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]]. The [[criminal justice]] system is uniform throughout Spain, while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is administered separately within Catalonia.

Each municipality is run by a council (''ajuntament'') elected by the residents in local elections. The council consists of a number of members (''regidors'') depending on population, who elect the [[Mayor|mayor]] (''alcalde'' or ''batlle'').

The first begins with the historiography chronicles of the 13th century (chronicles written between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries narrating the deeds of the monarchs and leading figures of the Crown of Aragon) and the subsequent Golden Age of the 14th and 15th centuries. After that period, between the 16th and 19th centuries the Romantic [[historiography]] defined this era as the ''[[Decad\u00e8ncia]]'', considered as the \"decadent\" period in Catalan literature because of a general falling into disuse of the vernacular language in cultural contexts and lack of patronage among the nobility.\n\n[[File:Rodoreda.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|left|[[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]] ]]\nThe second moment of splendor began in the 19th century with the cultural and political ''[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]'' (Renaissance) represented by writers and poets such as [[Jacint Verdaguer]], [[Narc\u00eds Oller]], [[Joan Maragall]] and [[\u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0]]. During the 20th century were developed the avant-garde movements initiated by the Generation of '14 (called [[Noucentisme]] in Catalonia), represented by [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Joan Salvat-Papasseit]], [[Josep Carner]], [[Carles Riba]], [[Josep Vicen\u00e7 Foix i Mas|J.V. Foix]] and others. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Civil War ([[Generation of '36]]) and the Francoist period, Catalan literature is maintained despite the repression against the Catalan language, being often produced in exile. [[File:Ana Mar\u00eda Matute.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|[[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]] ]] The most outstanding authors of this period are [[Salvador Espriu]], [[Josep Pla]], [[Josep Maria de Sagarra]] (the latter three being considered as the main responsible of the renewal of Catalan prose), [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]], Joan Oliver Sallar\u00e8s or \"[[Pere Quart]]\", [[Pere Calders]], [[Gabriel Ferrater]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Agust\u00ed Bartra]] or [[Miquel Mart\u00ed i Pol]]. In addition, several foreign writers who fought in the framework of the [[International Brigades]] then recount their experiences of fighting in their works, historical or fictional, with for example ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' of the British [[George Orwell]] in 1938 or ''[[Le Palace (Claude Simon)|Le Palace]]'' in 1962 and ''[[The Georgics (Claude Simon)|The Georgics]]'' in 1981 by Frenchman [[Claude Simon]].\n\nAfter the transition to democracy (1975\u20131978) and the restoration of the Generalitat (1977), literary life and the editorial market have returned to normality and literary production in Catalan is being bolstered with a number of language policies intended to protect Catalan culture. Besides the aforementioned authors, other relevant 20th-century writers of the Francoist and democracy periods include [[Joan Brossa]], [[Agust\u00ed Bartra]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Pere Calders]] or [[Quim Monz\u00f3]].\n\n[[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n]] and [[Juan Goytisolo]] are among the most prominent Catalan writers in the Spanish language since the democratic restoration in Spain.\n\n=== Festivals and public holidays ===\n{{Main|Traditions of Catalonia}}\n[[File:4 de 9 amb folre i pilar.jpg|thumb|Castell 4 de 9 amb folre i pilar by Colla Vella de Valls]]\n\n[[Castell]]s are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing ''colles castelleres'' (teams). This practice originated in [[Valls]], on the region of the Camp de Tarragona, during the 18th century, and later it was extended along the next two centuries to the rest of the territory. The tradition of [[Castell|els Castells i els Castellers]] was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 2010.\n\nIn the greater celebrations other elements of the Catalan popular culture are usually present: the parades of ''[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]'' (giants) and ''[[correfoc]]s'' of devils and firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is ''[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]'', declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] on 25 November 2005.<ref>[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227050231/http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp |date=27 February 2009 }}</ref>\n[[File:Festa major de la Seu d'Urgell.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gigantes y cabezudos|''Gegants'' and ''capgrossos'']] during the festa major of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] ]]\n\nThere are some local [[Christmas traditions]]; one of them is the popular figure of the [[Ti\u00f3 de Nadal]], consisting in a hollow log which after few days taking care of it, during [[Christmas Day]] or on [[Christmas Eve]] one orders it to defecate presents and, in order to make this, children beats the ti\u00f3 with sticks, while they singing various traditional songs.

Other tunes and dances of the traditional music are the contrap\u00e0s (obsolete today), [[ball de bastons]] (the \"dance of sticks\"), the moixiganga, the goigs (popular songs), the [[galop]]s or the [[Jota (music)|jota]] in the southern part. The [[Habanera (music)|havaneres]] are characteristic in some marine localities of the Costa Brava, especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a ''cremat'' of burned rum.\n\nPerformances of [[opera]], mostly imported from Italy, began in the 18th century, but some native operas were written as well, including the ones by [[Dom\u00e8nec Terradellas]], [[Carles Baguer]], [[Ramon Carles]], [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] and [[Enric Granados]]. The Barcelona main opera house, [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] (opened in 1847), remains one of the most important in Spain, hosting one of the most prestigious music schools in Barcelona, the [[Conservatori Superior de M\u00fasica del Liceu]]. Several lyrical artists trained by this institution gained international renown during the 20th century, such as [[Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles]], [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]], [[Giacomo Aragall]] and [[Josep Carreras]].\n\nCellist [[Pau Casals]] is admired as an outstanding player. Other popular musical styles were born in the second half of the 20th century such as [[Nova Can\u00e7\u00f3]] from the 1960s with [[Llu\u00eds Llach]] and the group [[Els Setze Jutges]], the [[Catalan rumba]] in the 1960s with [[Peret]], [[Catalan Rock]] from the late 1970s with [[La Banda Trapera del R\u00edo]] and [[Decibelios]] for Punk Rock, [[Sau (band)|Sau]], [[Els Pets]], [[Sopa de Cabra]] or [[Lax'n'Busto]] for [[Pop Rock]] or [[Sangtra\u00eft]] for hard rock, electropop since the 1990s with [[OBK]] and [[indie pop]] from the 1990s.\n\n=== Media and cinema ===\n{{Main|Media of Catalonia|Cinema of Catalonia}}\n[[File:TVC.svg|thumb|Logo of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]]\nCatalonia is the autonomous community, along with Madrid, that has the most media (TV, Magazines, Newspapers etc.).\n\n[[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]], which broadcasts entirely in the Catalan language, is the main Catalan public TV.

[[File:Pep Guardiola 2.1.jpg|170px|thumb|left|[[Pep Guardiola]]]] Despite the fact that the most popular sports are represented outside by the Spanish national teams, Catalonia can officially play as itself in some others, like [[korfball]], [[futsal]] or [[Rugby league football|rugby league]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seleccions.cat/index.php/seleccions-reconegudes/esports-reconeguts|title=Esports reconeguts|website=www.seleccions.cat|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catalan Football Federation]] also periodically fields a [[Catalonia national football team|national team]] against international opposition, organizing friendly matches. In the recent years they have played with Bulgaria, Argentina, Brazil, Basque Country, Colombia, Nigeria, Cape Verde and Tunisia. The biggest football clubs are [[FC Barcelona]] (also known as Bar\u00e7a), who have won five European Cups ([[UEFA Champions League]]), and [[RCD Espanyol]], who have twice been runner-up of the [[UEFA Cup]]. Both play in [[La Liga]].\n\nThe Catalan [[waterpolo]] is one of the main powers of the Iberian Peninsula. The Catalans won triumphs in waterpolo competitions at European and world level by club (the Barcelona was champion of Europe in 1981/82 and the Catalonia in 1994/95) and national team (one gold and one silver in Olympic Games and World Championships). It also has many international [[synchronized swimming]] champions.\n\nMotorsport has a long tradition in Catalonia involving many people, with some world champions and several competitions organized since the beginning of the 20th century. The [[Circuit de Catalunya]], built in 1991, is one of the main motorsport venues, holding the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish F1 Grand Prix, a DTM race, and several other races.\n\nCatalonia hosted many relevant international sport events, such as the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, and also the [[1955 Mediterranean Games]] or the [[2013 World Aquatics Championships]].

Various local food recipes have been described in documents dating from the fifteenth century. As with all the cuisines of the Mediterranean, Catatonian dishes make abundant use of [[fish]], seafood, [[olive oil]], [[bread]] and [[vegetables]]. Regional specialties include the ''[[pa amb tom\u00e0quet]]'' (bread with tomato), which consists of bread (sometimes toasted), and [[tomato]] seasoned with olive oil and salt. Often the dish is accompanied with any number of sausages (cured [[Botifarra|botifarres]], [[fuet]], iberic ham, etc.), ham or cheeses. Others dishes include the ''[[cal\u00e7otada]]'', ''[[escudella i carn d'olla]]'', ''suquet de peix'' (fish stew), and a [[dessert]], [[Catalan cream]].\n\nCatalan vineyards also have several ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen|Denominacions d'Origen]]'' wines, such as: [[Priorat (DOQ)|Priorat]], [[Montsant DO|Montsant]], [[Pened\u00e8s (DO)|Pened\u00e8s]] and [[Empord\u00e0 (DO)|Empord\u00e0]].

His exact year of birth is unknown. The official records of the [[Hellenic Navy]] indicate 1795 but modern Greek historians believe that 1793 is more probable.\n\nConstantine was left an orphan at a young age. Having to support himself, he chose to become a seaman like most members of his family since the beginning of the 18th century. He was hired as a boy on the brig of his uncle Dimitris Bourekas.\n\n==Military career==\nConstantine gained his fame during the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821&ndash;1829). Unlike most other prominent figures of the War, he had never been initiated into the [[Filiki Eteria]] (Friendly Society), which played a significant role in the revolution against the [[Ottoman Empire]], primarily by secret recruitment of supporters against the Empire.\n\nBy early 1821, it had gained enough support to declare a revolution. This declaration seems to have surprised Constantine, who was absent at Odessa. He returned to [[Psara]] in haste and was there when the island joined the Revolution on April 10, 1821.\n\nThe island formed its own fleet of ships and the famed seamen of Psara, already known for their successful naval combats against [[pirate]]s and their well-equipped ships, proved to be effective at full naval war. Constantine soon distinguished himself as a [[fire ship]] captain.<ref name=Woodhouse138>Woodhouse, p. 138.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lytras-nikiforos-pyrpolisi-tourkikis-navarhidas-apo-kanari.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|The destruction of the Ottoman flagship at [[Chios]] by Kanaris.]]\n\nAt [[Chios]], on the moonless night of June 6/June 7, 1822 forces under his command destroyed the flagship of the Turkish admiral Nasuhzade Ali Pasha (or Kara-Ali Pasha) in revenge for the [[Chios Massacre]]. The admiral was holding a celebration ([[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayram]]), so Kanaris and his men managed to place a fire ship next to it without being noticed. When the flagship's powder store caught fire, all men aboard were instantly killed. The Ottoman casualties comprised 2000 men, both naval officers and common sailors, as well as Kara-Ali himself.\n\nLater in the year he led another successful attacks against the Turkish fleet at [[Tenedos]] in November 1822. {{citation needed span|He was famously said to have encouraged himself by murmuring \"''Konstant\u00ed, you are going to die''\" every time he was approaching a Turkish warship on the fire boat he was about to detonate.|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Kanaris_Musket.jpg|thumb|The [[Nock gun|seven-barrled musket]] of Kanaris.]]\n\nThe Turkish fleet [[Destruction of Psara|captured Psara]] on June 21, 1824. A part of the population, including Kanaris, managed to flee the island, but those who didn't were either sold into [[slave]]ry or slaughtered.\n\nAfter the destruction of his home island, Kanaris continued to lead his men into attacks against the Turks. He took part to sea fights in the Dodecanese in August 1824.\n\nIn August 1825, Kanaris led the [[Greek raid on Alexandria (1825)|raid on Alexandria]], a daring attempt to destroy the Egyptian fleet via fire ships that might have been successful if the wind had not failed just after the Greek ships entered Alexandria harbor.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 244.</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the war and the independence of Greece, Constantine became an officer of the new Greek Navy, reaching the rank of admiral, and later became a prominent politician.\n\n==Political career==\n[[Image:Oldkanaris.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Constantine Kanaris (c.1793-1877); Photographic Archive of Hellenic Literary and Historical Museum, Athens.]]\n\nConstantine Kanaris was one of the few with the personal confidence of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] the first Head of State of independent Greece.<ref name=Woodhouse152>Woodhouse, p. 152.</ref> Kanaris served as Minister in various governments and then as [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]], in the provisional government, from March 11-April 11, 1844. He served a second term (October 27, 1848{{spaced ndash}}December 24, 1849), and as Navy Minister in Mavrokordatos' 1854 cabinet.\n\nIn 1862, he was one of the few War of Independence veterans that helped in the bloodless revolution that deposed King [[Otto of Greece]] and put Prince William of Denmark on the Greek throne as King [[George I of Greece]]. Under George I, he served as a prime minister for a third term (March 17{{spaced ndash}}April 28, 1864), fourth term (August 7, 1864{{spaced ndash}}February 9, 1865) and fifth and last term (June 7{{spaced ndash}}September 14, 1877).\n\nKanaris died on 2 September 1877 whilst still serving in office as Prime Minister. Following his death his government remained in power until September 14, 1877 without agreeing on a replacement at its head. He was buried in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]], where most Greek prime ministers and celebrated figures are also buried. After his death he was honored as a national hero.\n\nTo honour Kanaris, three ships of the [[Hellenic Navy]] have been named after him;\n* {{Ship|Greek destroyer|Kanaris|L53|3}}; a [[Hunt class destroyer|Hunt-class Type III]] destroyer, formerly HMS ''Hatherleigh'', transferred from the Royal Navy on 18 December 1941.\n* {{Ship|Greek destroyer|Kanaris|D212|3}}; a {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}}, formerly USS ''Stickell'' (DD-888), transferred from the U.S. Navy on 1 July 1972.\n* {{Ship|Greek frigate|Kanaris|F464|3}}; an {{sclass-|Elli|frigate}}, formerly the HNLMS ''Jan van Brakel'' (F825), bought from The Netherlands on 29 November 2002.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Constantine Kanaris, munument in Kypseli, Athens.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Monument of Constantine Kanaris in [[Kypseli, Athens]].]]\nIn 1817, he married Despina Maniatis, from a historical family of [[Psara]].

He is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on [[extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acids]] from basic chemicals by [[radiation]]. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the [[Voyager Golden Record]], universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them.

He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at [[Cornell University]], where he directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]]. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[Public Welfare Medal]], the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] for his book ''The Dragons of Eden'', and, regarding ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage'', two [[Emmy Award]]s, the [[Peabody Award]], and the [[Hugo Award]]. He married three times and had five children. After suffering from [[myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]], Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996.\n\n== Early life and education==\nCarl Sagan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York.<ref name=poundstone>[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], pp. 363\u2013364, 374\u2013375</ref> His father, Samuel Sagan, was an immigrant [[Sewing|garment worker]] from [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], then in the [[Russian Empire]],<ref name=\"Internet Accuracy Project\">{{cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Sagan,Carl.html |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=Internet Accuracy Project |location=Grandville, MI |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> in today's [[Ukraine]]. His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife from New York. Carl was named in honor of Rachel's [[biological mother]], Chaiya Clara, in Sagan's words, \"the mother she never knew.\"<!-- note: \"she\" is correct, refers to Rachel. Please do not turn this into \"he\" --><ref name=\"Davidson\">[[#Davidson|Davidson 1999]]</ref>\n\nHe had a sister, Carol, and the family lived in a modest apartment near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]], the most liberal of North American Judaism's four main groups. Carl and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother \"definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple;... and served only [[Kosher foods|kosher]] meat.\"<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|12}} During the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], his father worked as a theater usher.\n\nAccording to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's \"inner war\" was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents, who were in many ways \"opposites.\" Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in New York City during [[World War I]] and the 1920s.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|2}} As a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions, but they were frustrated by social restrictions: her poverty, her status as a woman and a wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore \"worshipped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams.\"<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|2}}\n\nHowever, he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father, who in his free time gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's garment industry.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|2}} Although he was awed by Carl's intellectual abilities, he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|2}} In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|9}} Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:\n{{quote|My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method.<ref name=\"Spangenburg\">[[#Spangenburg & Moser|Spangenburg & Moser 2004]], pp. 2\u20135</ref>}}\n\n=== 1939 World's Fair ===\nSagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] when he was four years old. The exhibits became a turning point in his life. He later recalled the moving map of the ''[[Futurama (New York World's Fair)|America of Tomorrow]]'' exhibit: \"It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses\u2014and it looked great!\"<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|14}} At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a [[Solar cell|photoelectric cell]] created a crackling sound, and how the sound from a [[tuning fork]] became a wave on an [[oscilloscope]]. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television. Sagan wrote:\n{{quote|Plainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed. How could a tone become a picture and light become a noise?<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|14}}}}\n\nHe also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events, the burial of a [[time capsule]] at [[Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park|Flushing Meadows]], which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. \"The time capsule thrilled Carl,\" writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules\u2014capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy; these were the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the ''[[Voyager Golden Record]]'' pr\u00e9cis, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World's Fair.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|15}}\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring [[World War&nbsp;II]] Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He wrote, \"Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was not a popular fellow in our household...&nbsp;But on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war.\" His sister, Carol, said that their mother \"above all wanted to protect Carl...&nbsp;She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War&nbsp;II and the Holocaust.\"<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|15}} Sagan's book, ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' (1996), included his memories of this conflicted period, when his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.<ref name=\"Spangenburg\" />\n\n=== Inquisitiveness about nature ===\nSoon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the [[public library]] alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:\n{{quote|I went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars;... And the answer was stunning. It was that the Sun was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light&nbsp;... The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It was a kind of religious experience. There was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|18}}}}\n\nAt about age six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] across the East River in [[Manhattan]]. While there, they went to the [[Hayden Planetarium]] and walked around the museum's exhibits of [[outer space|space]] objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits:\n{{quote|I was transfixed by the dioramas\u2014lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. Penguins on the dimly lit Antarctic ice;&nbsp;...a family of [[gorilla]]s, the male beating his chest,&nbsp;...an American [[grizzly bear]] standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|18}}}}\n\nHis parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials. His interest in space, however, was his primary focus, especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as [[Mars]]. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a \"driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten.\"<ref name=\"Spangenburg\" />\n\nIn 1947 he discovered ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine, which introduced him to more [[hard science fiction]] speculations than those in Burroughs's novels. That same year inaugurated the \"[[flying saucer]]\" [[mass hysteria]] with the young Carl suspecting the \"discs\" might be alien spaceships.<ref name=\"anb.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-02612-print.html |title=American National Biography Online, Carl Sagan}}</ref>\n\n=== High school years ===\nSagan had lived in Bensonhurst where he went to David A. Boody Junior High School. He had his [[bar mitzvah]] in Bensonhurst when he turned 13.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|23}} The following year, 1948, his family moved to the nearby town of [[Rahway, New Jersey]] for his father's work, where Sagan then entered [[Rahway High School]]. He graduated in 1951.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|23}} Rahway was an older industrial town, and the Sagans were among its few Jewish families.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|23}}\n\n[[File:Carl Sagan 1951.png|thumb|right|Photo of Sagan from high school yearbook, 1951]]\nSagan was a straight-A student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|23}} His teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school, the administrator telling them, \"This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, he has something really remarkable.\"<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|24}} This they couldn't do, partly because of the cost.\n\nSagan was made president of the school's chemistry club, and at home he set up his own laboratory. He taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how [[molecules]] were formed: \"I found that about as interesting as doing [chemical] experiments,\" he said.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|24}} Sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby, and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed: \"That was a splendid day&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;\u2014when I began to suspect that if I tried hard I could do astronomy full-time, not just part-time.\"<ref name=\"Davidson\"/>{{rp|25}}\n\nBefore the end of high school, he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on Earth as it was for Native Americans when they first had contact with Europeans.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], p. 15</ref> The subject was considered controversial, but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> By graduation, his classmates had voted him \"Most likely to succeed,\" and put him in line to be valedictorian.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== University education ===\nSagan attended the [[University of Chicago]], which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a sixteen-year-old, despite his excellent high school grades. Its Chancellor, Robert Hutchins, structured the school as an \"ideal meritocracy,\" with no age requirement.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], p. 14</ref> The school also employed a number of the nation's leading scientists, including [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Edward Teller]], along with operating the famous [[Yerkes Observatory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDuring his time as an honors program [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]], Sagan worked in the laboratory of the [[geneticist]] [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]] and wrote a thesis on the [[abiogenesis|origins of life]] with [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Harold Urey]]. Sagan joined the Ryerson Astronomical Society,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astro.uchicago.edu/RAS/ |title=Ryerson Astronomical Society |work=Ryerson Astronomical Society (RAS) |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in laughingly self-proclaimed \"nothing\"<ref>[[#Spangenburg & Moser|Spangenburg & Moser 2004]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z01FzDkprgUC&pg=PA28 p. 28]</ref> with general and special honors in 1954, and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[physics]] in 1955. He went on to earn a  [[Master of Science|M.S.]] degree in [[physics]] in 1956, before earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1960 with his thesis ''Physical Studies of Planets'' submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.<ref name=phd>{{cite thesis | last = Sagan | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sagan | title = Physical Studies of the Planets | degree = PhD | year = 1960 | publisher = University of Chicago | page = ii | quote = A thesis in four parts submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Department of Astronomy, University of Chicago, June, 1960|oclc=20678107|website=proquest.com|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/301918122}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=November 11, 1993 |title=Graduate students receive first Sagan teaching awards |journal=University of Chicago Chronicle |volume=13 |issue=6 |publisher=University of Chicago News Office |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/931111/sagan.shtml}}</ref><ref>[[#Head|Head 2006]], p. xxi</ref><ref>[[#Spangenburg & Moser|Spangenburg & Moser 2004]], p. 28</ref>\n\nHe used the summer months of his [[Postgraduate education|graduate studies]] to work with his [[Doctoral advisor|dissertation director]], [[planetary science|planetary scientist]] [[Gerard Kuiper]],<ref name=mathgene/> as well as physicist [[George Gamow]], and chemist [[Melvin Calvin]].

As a visiting scientist to NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he contributed to the first [[Mariner program|Mariner]] missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project.

Sagan later conceded in ''The Demon-Haunted World'' that the prediction did not turn out to be correct: \"it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4\u00b0\u20136\u00b0 C over the [[Persian Gulf]], but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared\".<ref>[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], p. 257</ref>\n\nIn his later years Sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroids/[[near-Earth object]]s (NEOs) that might impact the Earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them.<ref>[[#Head|Head 2006]], p. 86\u201387</ref> He argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to [[asteroid impact avoidance|alter the orbit of an asteroid]], including the employment of [[nuclear weapon design|nuclear detonation]]s, created a [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Deflection technology concerns|Deflection Dilemma]]: if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth exists, then one would also have the ability to divert a non-threatening object towards Earth, creating an immensely destructive weapon.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |last2=Ostro |first2=Steven J. |authorlink2=Steven J.

Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carl Sagan, an Astronomer Who Excelled at Popularizing Science, Is Dead at 62 |first=William |last=Dicke |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1109.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 1996 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Criticisms===\nWhile Sagan was widely adored by the general public, his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized.<ref>Davidson, p. 202</ref> Critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful, non-rigorous,  and self-aggrandizing,<ref>Davidson, p. 227</ref> and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status.<ref>Davidson, p. 341</ref>\n\nOne of Sagan's harshest critics, [[Harold Urey]], felt that Sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually.<ref name=\"Davidson, p. 203\">Davidson, p. 203</ref> Urey and Sagan were said to have different philosophies of science, according to Davidson.

This stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself, with the hope of avoiding such a [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|cataclysm]] and eventually becoming a [[spacefaring]] species. Sagan's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|human civilization]] in a [[nuclear holocaust]] was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of ''Cosmos'', called \"Who Speaks for Earth?\" Sagan had already resigned{{date?}} from the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]]'s UFO investigating [[Condon Committee]] and voluntarily surrendered his [[Security clearance#Top Secret|top secret clearance]] in protest over the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Druyan |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Druyan |date=November 2000 |title=A New Sense of the Sacred Carl Sagan's 'Cosmic Connection' |journal=[[American Humanist Association|The Humanist]] |volume=60 |issue=6 |publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=August 29, 2013 |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-78889720/a-new-sense-of-the-sacred-carl-sagan-s-cosmic-connection}}</ref> Following his marriage to his third wife ([[novelist]] Ann Druyan) in June 1981, Sagan became more politically active\u2014particularly in opposing escalation of the [[nuclear arms race]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].\n[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|The United States and [[Soviet Union]]/Russia nuclear stockpiles, in [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|total number of nuclear bombs/warheads in existence]] throughout the [[Cold War]] and post-Cold War era.]]\nIn March 1983, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]\u2014a multibillion-dollar project to develop a comprehensive [[missile defense|defense]] against attack by [[Nuclear weapons delivery#Ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]], which was quickly dubbed the \"Star Wars\" program.

For example: <blockquote>Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others\u2014for example [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Albert Einstein]]\u2014considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe.

I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists.

What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word 'spiritual' that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything\noutside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.<ref>Sagan, Carl; Druyan, Ann (1997).

The compilation ''Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium'', published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on abortion, and his widow Ann Druyan's account of his death as a skeptic, [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], and freethinker.\n\nSagan warned against humans' tendency towards [[anthropocentrism]]. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the [[Condon Committee]] (1966\u201368), led by physicist [[Edward Condon]], and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.\n\nSociologist [[Ron Westrum]] writes that \"The high point of Sagan's treatment of the UFO question was the [http://meetings.aaas.org/ AAAS' symposium] in 1969. A wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants, including not only proponents such as [[James E. McDonald|James McDonald]] and [[J.&nbsp;Allen Hynek]] but also skeptics like astronomers [[William Kenneth Hartmann|William Hartmann]] and [[Donald Howard Menzel|Donald Menzel]]. The roster of speakers was balanced, and it is to Sagan's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from Edward Condon.\"<ref name=westrum /> With physicist Thornton Page, Sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium; these were published in 1972 as ''UFO's: A Scientific Debate''. Some of Sagan's many books examine UFOs (as did one episode of ''Cosmos'') and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon.\n\nSagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his 1980 ''Cosmos'' series. In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, Sagan did think it plausible that Cold War concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and wrote that \"some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills&nbsp;... It's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available.\" He cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Earth either in the past or present.<ref>[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], pp. 81\u201396, 99\u2013104</ref>\n\n===Sagan's Paradox===\n\nSagan's contribution to the 1969 symposium was an attack on the belief that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrial beings: Applying several logical assumptions (see [[Drake equation]]), Sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million. He projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of, say, once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually. Not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings, but it would take all the material in one percent of the universe's stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out.\n\nTo argue that the earth was being chosen for regular visitations, Sagan said, one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique. And that assumption \"goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around. Because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common. And if we're not pretty common then there aren't going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors.\"\n\nThis argument, which some called \"Sagan's paradox,\" helped to establish a new school of thought: the belief that extraterrestrial life exists but has nothing to do with UFOs. The new belief had a salutary effect on UFO studies. It helped separate researchers who wanted to identify unidentified flying objects from those who wanted to identify their pilots. And it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with UFOs.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/DavidJacobsTheUFOControversyInAmerica/Time-Life%20-%20Mysteries%20of%20the%20Unknown%20-%20The%20UFO%20Phenomenon_djvu.txt David Jacobs \"The UFO Controversy In America\" (1987), p.122-124]</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:Carl-sagan-brooklyn.JPG|thumb|right|Stone dedicated to Carl Sagan in the Celebrity Path of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden]]\nAfter suffering from [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]] for two years, and receiving three [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplants]] from his sister Carol, Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62, at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, in the early morning of December 20, 1996.<ref>{{cite news |first=Norma |last=Quarles |title=Carl Sagan dies at 62 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/20/sagan/ |work=[[CNN]] |date=December 20, 1996 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |quote=''Sagan was a noted astronomer whose lifelong passion was searching for intelligent life in the cosmos.''}}</ref>\nBurial took place at Lakeview Cemetery in Ithaca, New York.<ref>{{Find a Grave|1347}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n[[File:NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal.jpeg|frame|right|NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]]\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Annual Award for Television Excellence\u20141981\u2014[[Ohio State University]]\u2014PBS series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''\n* Apollo Achievement Award\u2014[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]\n* [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]]\u2014National Aeronautics and Space Administration (1977)\n* [[Emmy]]\u2014Outstanding Individual Achievement\u20141981\u2014PBS series ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage''<ref name=\"cosmosemmy\" />\n* Emmy\u2014[[Primetime Emmy Award|Outstanding Informational Series]]\u20141981\u2014PBS series ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage''<ref name=\"cosmosemmy\" />\n* [[NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal|Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]]\u2014National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n* [[Helen Caldicott]] Leadership Award \u2013 Awarded by [[Women's Action for New Directions|Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament]]\n* [[Hugo Award]]\u20141981\u2014[[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]]\u2014''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage''\n* Hugo Award\u20141981\u2014[[Hugo Award for Best Related Work|Best Related Non-Fiction Book]]\u2014''Cosmos''\n* Hugo Award\u20141998\u2014Best Dramatic Presentation\u2014''Contact''\n* [[American Humanist Association#AHA's Humanists of the Year|Humanist of the Year]]\u20141981\u2014Awarded by the [[American Humanist Association]]<ref>{{cite web|title=From the AHA archives: Carl Sagan's 1981 Humanist of the year speech|url=http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-05-from-the-aha-archives-carl-sagans-1981-humanist-of-t|website=americanhumanist.org|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226010015/http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-05-from-the-aha-archives-carl-sagans-1981-humanist-of-t|archivedate=December 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[American Philosophical Society]]\u20141995\u2014Elected to membership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=sagan&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |title=American Philosophical Society Member History |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113140231/http://www.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=sagan&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* In Praise of Reason Award\u20141987\u2014[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry ]]<ref name=\"Pasadena 1987\">{{cite journal|last1=Shore|first1=Lys Ann|title=Controversies in Science and Fringe Science: From Animals and SETI to Quackery and SHC|journal=The Skeptical Inquirer|date=1987|volume=12|issue=1|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n* [[Isaac Asimov Awards|Isaac Asimov Award]]\u20141994\u2014[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]<ref name=\"Seattle 1994\">{{cite journal|last1=Karr|first1=Barry|authorlink=Barry Karr|title=Five Honored with CSICOP Awards|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1994|volume=18|issue=5|pages=461\u2013462}}</ref>\n* John F.

Asteroid [[2709&nbsp;Sagan]] is named in his honor, as is the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] for the search of habitable planets.\n\nSagan's son, Nick Sagan, wrote several episodes in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise.

The marker displays a quote from Sagan: \"Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you.\" Sagan's student [[Steve Squyres]] led the team that landed the rovers ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' successfully on Mars in 2004.\n\nOn November 9, 2001, on what would have been Sagan's 67th birthday, the [[Ames Research Center]] dedicated the site for the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. \"Carl was an incredible visionary, and now his legacy can be preserved and advanced by a 21st&nbsp;century research and education laboratory committed to enhancing our understanding of life in the universe and furthering the cause of space exploration for all time\", said NASA Administrator [[Daniel Goldin]]. Ann Druyan was at the Center as it opened its doors on October 22, 2006.\n\nSagan has at least three awards named in his honor:\n* The [[Carl Sagan Memorial Award]] presented jointly since 1997 by the American Astronomical Society and The Planetary Society,\n* The [[Carl Sagan Medal]] for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science presented since 1998 by the American Astronomical Society's [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (AAS/DPS) for outstanding communication by an active planetary scientist to the general public\u2014Carl Sagan was one of the original organizing committee members of the DPS, and\n* The [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] presented by the [[Council of Scientific Society Presidents]] (CSSP)\u2014Sagan was the first recipient of the CSSP award in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=47 |title=Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science |publisher=Council of Scientific Society Presidents |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726075012/http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=47 |archivedate=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAugust 2007 the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (IIG) awarded Sagan posthumously a Lifetime Achievement Award.

An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and [[Fidel Castro]] in July 1962, and construction of a number of [[missile launch facility|missile launch facilities]] started later that summer.\n\nThe [[United States elections, 1962|1962 United States elections]] were under way, and the White House had for months denied charges that it was ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles {{convert|90|miles|km}} from Florida. The missile preparations were confirmed when an Air Force [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy plane]] [[Aerial reconnaissance#Cold War|produced clear photographic evidence]] of [[SS-4 Sandal|medium-range (SS-4)]] and [[R-14 Chusovaya|intermediate-range (R-14) ballistic missile]] facilities. The US established a naval blockade on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba; Oval Office tapes during the crisis revealed that Kennedy had also put the blockade in place as an attempt to provoke Soviet-backed forces in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] as well.<ref name=ovalofficetapes1 /><ref name=johncon /><ref name=ovalofficetapes2 /> The US announced that they would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter a long period of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between US President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Khrushchev.{{When|date=May 2018}} Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to [[United Nations]] verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed that it would dismantle all US-built [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter MRBMs]], which had been deployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union; there has been debate on whether or not Italy was included in the agreement as well.\n\nWhen all offensive missiles and [[Ilyushin Il-28]] light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 21, 1962. The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between Washington and Moscow. As a result, the [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline]] was established. A series of agreements reduced US\u2013Soviet tensions for several years until both parties began to build their nuclear arsenal even further.\n\n==Earlier US actions==\nWith the end of [[World War II]] and the start of the [[Cold War]], the United States had grown concerned about the expansion of [[communism]]. A [[Latin American]] country openly allying with the Soviet Union was regarded by the US as unacceptable. It would, for example, defy the [[Monroe Doctrine]], a US policy limiting US involvement in European colonies and European affairs but holding that the [[Western Hemisphere]] was in the US [[sphere of influence]].\n\nThe Kennedy administration had been publicly embarrassed by the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in May 1961, which had been launched under President [[John F. Kennedy]] by [[CIA]]-trained forces of [[Cuban exile]]s. Afterward, former President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"<ref name=Absher>{{cite journal |title=Mind-Sets and Missiles: A First Hand Account of the Cuban Missile Crisis |first=Kenneth Michael |last=Absher |publisher=Strategic Studies Institute, United States Army War College |year=2009 |url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=935}}</ref>{{rp|10}} The half-hearted invasion left Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his advisers with the impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet adviser wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations... too intelligent and too weak.\"<ref name=Absher /> US covert operations against Cuba continued in 1961 with the unsuccessful [[Operation Mongoose]].<ref name=\"franklin\">{{cite book |title=Cuba and the United States: A Chronological History |first = Jane |last = Franklin |url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/missile.htm |year=1997 |publisher=Ocean Press |location=Melbourne|isbn=1-875284-92-3}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Khrushchev's impression of Kennedy's weaknesses was confirmed by the President's response during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], particularly to the building of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\" He also told his son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Kempe|first=Frederick|title=Berlin 1961|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group USA}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1962, [[US Army]] General [[Edward Lansdale]] described plans to overthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report (partially declassified 1989), addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.<ref name=\"franklin\"/> CIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the [[Special Activities Division]] were to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.<ref>{{cite book |title=Shadow Warrior: The CIA Hero of 100 Unknown Battles|last=Rodriguez |publisher=Simon & Schuster |date=October 1989 |isbn=978-0-671-66721-4 |others= John Weisman}}</ref> In February 1962, the US launched an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-76/pdf/STATUTE-76-Pg1446.pdf |title=Proclamation 3447 \u2013 Embargo on All Trade With Cuba |date=February 3, 1962 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}</ref> and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September. \"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" would occur in the first two weeks of October.<ref name=\"franklin\"/>\n\n==Balance of power==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--two paragraphs without citations-->\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"[[missile gap]]\" with the Soviets leading. In fact, the US led the Soviets by a wide margin that would only increase. In 1961, the Soviets had only four [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s ([[R-7 Semyorka]]). By October 1962, they may have had a few dozen, with some intelligence estimates as high as 75.<ref name=\"afmag\"/>\n\nThe US, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more. It also had eight {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|5}}- and {{sclass-|Ethan Allen|submarine|0}} [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, with the capability to launch 16 [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] missiles, each with a range of {{convert|2500|nmi|km}}.\n\nKhrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions. The Soviet Union had [[medium-range ballistic missile]]s in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were very unreliable and inaccurate. The US had a considerable advantage in total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery.\n\nThe US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power; but the Soviets had a 2\u20131 advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theater.<ref name=\"afmag\"/>\n\n==Soviet deployment of missiles in Cuba==\nIn May 1961, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, [[Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev]], who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alexeyev|first=Alexandr |title=Interview |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB400/docs/Interview%20with%20Alekseev.pdf|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}</ref> Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid [[first strike]]\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 [[ICBM]]s capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Allison 1999 92\">{{cite book|last=Allison|first=Graham and Philip Zelikow|title=Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|location=New York|isbn=0-321-01349-2|page=92}}</ref> The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.<ref name=\"Allison 1999 92\"/>\n\nTherefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles ([[MRBM]]s and [[IRBM]]s). The missiles could hit American allies and most of [[Alaska]] from Soviet territory but not the [[Contiguous United States]]. Graham Allison, the director of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]], points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil. In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options. Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Allison |first=Graham and Philip Zelikow|title=Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|location=New York|isbn=0-321-01349-2|pages=94\u201395}}</ref>\n\nA second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was because Khrushchev wanted to bring [[West Berlin]], controlled by the American, British and French within Communist [[East Germany]], into the Soviet orbit. The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of [[Berlin]] a grave threat to East Germany. Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin. If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Allison|first=Graham and Philip Zelikow|title=Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|location=New York|isbn=0-321-01349-2|page=105}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba.

Before this event, America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy USSR before they would have a chance to react. After the transmission of nuclear missiles, Khrushchev had finally established mutually assured destruction. [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutually assured destruction]] means that if America decided to launch a nuclear strike against the USSR, the latter would react by launching a nuclear strike against America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/cuban-missile-crisis-nikita-khrushchev|title=Cuban missile crisis: Nikita Khrushchev's Cuban gamble misfired {{!}} Paul Wingrove|last=Wingrove|first=Paul|date=2012-10-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the people in Cuba whose rights were taken away by the United States,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40952458|title=The Cuban missile crisis, 1962 : a National Security Archive documents reader|date=1998|publisher=New Press|others=Chang, Laurence., Kornbluh, Peter., National Security Archive (U.S.)|isbn=1565844742|edition=[Rev. ed.]|location=New York|oclc=40952458}}</ref> as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959.

Prior to this, there was no clear barrier to how the United States was willing to react, and with new president John F. Kennedy, it was unknown to the Soviet Union to what they can do to manipulate the United States. By placing missiles on Cuba, next to the doorstep of the United States, it would be clear to the extent of which the United States would react.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40952458|title=The Cuban missile crisis, 1962 : a National Security Archive documents reader|date=1998|publisher=New Press|others=Chang, Laurence., Kornbluh, Peter., National Security Archive (U.S.)|isbn=1565844742|edition=[Rev. ed.]|location=New York|oclc=40952458}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]]. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles deployment that would have made him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.<ref name=\"gwu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB393/ |title=The Soviet Cuban Missile Crisis: Castro, Mikoyan, Kennedy, Khruschev, and the Missiles of November |publisher=The National Security Archive |date=October 10, 2012}}</ref> Also, the deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40&nbsp;km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\nBy May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba.

TAC and the [[Military Air Transport Service]] had problems. The concentration of aircraft in Florida strained command and support echelons, which faced critical undermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of initial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced TAC to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call-up of 24 Reserve squadrons.<ref name=\"Kamps, Charles Tustin 2007, page 88\"/>\n\nOn October 25 at 1:45&nbsp;am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by stating that the US was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and when the assurances proved to be false, the deployment \"required the responses I have announced....

That report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. In response, Kennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of [[SACEUR]], which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union. During the day, the Soviets responded to the blockade by turning back 14 ships that were presumably carrying offensive weapons.<ref name=hpol/>\n\n===Stalemate===\nThe next morning, October 26, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead.\n\nAt this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no indication that they would back down and had made several comments to the contrary. The US had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union if it responded militarily, which was assumed.<ref name=GWUCubaAG>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/620119%20Meeting%20with%20the%20Attorney%20Gen..pdf|date=January 19, 1962 |title=Memorandum for the Director of Central Intelligence: Meeting with the Attorney General of the United States Concerning Cuba |author=Helms, Richard |publisher=[[George Washington University]], National Security Archive}}</ref>\n\n==Secret negotiations==\nAt 1:00&nbsp;pm EDT on October 26, [[John A.

You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will disappear.\" At 6:45&nbsp;pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a \"set up\" for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter.

Forty years later, McNamara said:\n\n{{quote|text= We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that\u2014the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did\u2014we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It was shot down on Friday.... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought \"Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack.\" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.<ref name=mcnamara group=note>McNamara mistakenly dates the shooting down of USAF Major [[Rudolf Anderson]]'s U-2 on October 26.</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=Robert McNamara |title=Interview included as special feature on [[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]| medium=DVD |publisher=Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment |year=2004 |origyear=1964}}</ref>}}\n\nEllsberg said that [[Robert F.

Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine. The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\nAs the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged, and Kennedy was slowly persuaded. The new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and instead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was initially hesitant, feeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but [[Llewellyn Thompson]] argued that it was still possible.<ref>Gibson, David R.

The President made several changes, had it typed, and sent it.\n\nAfter the EXCOMM meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the [[Oval Office]]. The group argued that the letter should be underscored with an oral message to Dobrynin that stated that if the missiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them. Rusk added one proviso that no part of the language of the deal would mention Turkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed \"voluntarily\" in the immediate aftermath. The President agreed, and the message was sent.\n\n[[File:EXCOMM meeting, Cuban Missile Crisis, 29 October 1962.jpg|left|thumb|October 29, 1962 [[EXCOMM]] meeting held in the White House Cabinet Room.

Scali asked why the two letters from Khrushchev were so different, and Fomin claimed it was because of \"poor communications.\" Scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was a \"stinking double cross.\" He went on to claim that an invasion was only hours away, and Fomin stated that a response to the US message was expected from Khrushchev shortly and urged Scali to tell the State Department that no treachery was intended. Scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. The two went their separate ways, and Scali immediately typed out a memo for the EXCOMM.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis/timeline_print.htm|title=Nuclear Files: Key Issues: Nuclear Weapons: Cold War: Cuban Missile Crisis: Timline|website=www.nuclearfiles.org|access-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWithin the US establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position. Military preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood: \"We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours.

In that broadcast at 9:00&nbsp;am EST, on October 28, Khrushchev stated that \"the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.\"<ref>The Fog of War: Lessons from the Life of Robert S.

Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. \"This is a pretty good play of his,\" Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March of the year, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. \"Most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it,\" Kennedy said. Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. \"We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood,\" Kennedy said, \"when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey.

The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations. Khrushchev invited [[Norman Cousins]], the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962.<ref>Stone, Oliver and Peter Kuznick, \"The Untold History of the United States\" (Gallery Books, 2012), page 313-14, ''citing'' Message from Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 30, 1962, in ''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961-1963'', vol. 11, (Washington, DC, US Government Printing Office, 1997), pages 309-317</ref>\n\nKennedy's response to Khrushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed to Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the US national security apparatus. The US and the USSR did shortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, known as the \"[[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]\".<ref>Stone, Oliver and Peter Kuznick, \"The Untold History of the United States\" (Gallery Books, 2012), page 313-14</ref>\n\nFurther after the crisis, the US and the Soviet Union created the [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline]], a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis.\n\nThe compromise embarrassed [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]] was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev. Khrushchev went to Kennedy as he thought that the crisis was getting out of hand, but the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.\n\nKhrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Politburo]]'s embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place.

An argument broke out among three officers aboard ''B-59'', including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Captain 2nd rank (US Navy Commander rank equivalent) [[Vasili Arkhipov]].

Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was \"between 1 in 3 and even,\" and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even [[Miami]].

To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of US intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's interests.<ref name=\"MatthewsBBC20121013\">{{cite web|last=Matthews|first=Joe|title=Cuban missile crisis: The other, secret one|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19930260|publisher=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Anastas Mikoyan]] was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of Cuba's defense. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev and the rest of the Soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.<ref name=\"MatthewsBBC20121013\" />\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe American popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis and both fictional and documentary forms.<ref>{{cite book|author=Priscilla Roberts|title=Cuban Missile Crisis: The Essential Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-WoO0V6rRMC&pg=PA267|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=267|isbn=9781610690669}}</ref> Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed America.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Jim Willis|title=100 Media Moments that Changed America|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=97\u201399}}</ref> Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two weeks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sheldon Stern|title=The Cuban Missile Crisis in American Memory: Myths versus Reality|year=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=viii}}</ref>\n\nHistorian William Cohn argued in a 1976 article that television programs are typically the main source used by the American public to know about and interpret the past.<ref>{{cite journal|first=William H.|last=Cohn|title=History for the masses: Television portrays the past|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|volume=10|issue=2|year=1976|pages=280\u201389}}</ref> According to Cold War historian Andrei Kozovoi, the Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history.

A ''cache hit'' occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a ''cache miss'' occurs when it cannot.  Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.\n\nTo be cost-effective and to enable efficient use of data, caches must be relatively small. Nevertheless, caches have proven themselves in many areas of computing, because typical [[Application software|computer applications]] access data with a high degree of [[locality of reference]]. Such access patterns exhibit temporal locality, where data is requested that has been recently requested already, and [[memory address|spatial]] locality, where data is requested that is stored physically close to data that has already been requested.\n\n== Motivation ==\nThere is an inherent trade-off between size and speed (given that a larger resource implies greater physical distances) but also a tradeoff between expensive, premium technologies (such as [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]]) vs cheaper, easily mass-produced commodities (such as [[DRAM]] or [[hard disk]]s).\n\nThe [[Data buffer|buffering]] provided by a cache benefits both [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]]:\n\n=== Latency ===\nA larger resource incurs a significant [[latency (engineering)|latency]] for access{{snd}} e.g. it can take hundreds of clock cycles for a modern 4&nbsp;GHz processor to reach [[DRAM]]. This is mitigated by reading in large chunks, in the hope that subsequent reads will be from nearby locations. Prediction or explicit [[CPU cache#prefetch|prefetching]] might also guess where future reads will come from and make requests ahead of time; if done correctly the latency is bypassed altogether.\n\n=== Throughput  ===\nThe use of a cache also allows for higher [[throughput]] from the underlying resource, by assembling multiple fine grain transfers into larger, more efficient requests. In the case of [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] circuits, this might be served by having a wider data bus. For example, consider a program accessing bytes in a 32-bit address space, but being served by a 128-bit off-chip data bus; individual uncached byte accesses would allow only 1/16th of the total [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to be used, and 80% of the data movement would be memory addresses instead of data itself. Reading larger chunks reduces the fraction of bandwidth required for transmitting address information.\n\n== {{Anchor|CACHE-HIT}}Operation ==\nHardware implements cache as a [[block (data storage)|block]] of memory for temporary storage of data likely to be used again. [[Central processing unit]]s (CPUs) and [[hard disk drive]]s (HDDs) frequently use a cache, as do [[web browser]]s and [[web server]]s.\n\nA cache is made up of a pool of entries. Each entry has associated ''data'', which is a copy of the same data in some ''backing store''. Each entry also has a ''tag'', which specifies the identity of the data in the backing store of which the entry is a copy.\n\nWhen the cache client (a CPU, web browser, [[operating system]]) needs to access data presumed to exist in the backing store, it first checks the cache. If an entry can be found with a tag matching that of the desired data, the data in the entry is used instead. This situation is known as a '''cache hit'''. For example, a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular [[URL]]. In this example, the URL is the tag, and the content of the web page is the data. The percentage of accesses that result in cache hits is known as the '''hit rate''' or '''hit ratio''' of the cache.\n\nThe alternative situation, when the cache is checked and found not to contain any entry with the desired tag, is known as a '''cache miss'''. This requires a more expensive access of data from the backing store. Once the requested data is retrieved, it is typically copied into the cache, ready for the next access.\n\nDuring a cache miss, some other previously existing cache entry is removed in order to make room for the newly retrieved data. The [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] used to select the entry to replace is known as the [[Cache algorithm|replacement policy]]. One popular replacement policy, \"least recently used\" (LRU), replaces the oldest entry, the entry that was accessed less recently than any other entry (see [[cache algorithm]]). More efficient caching algorithms compute the use-hit frequency against the size of the stored contents, as well as the [[Access time|latencies]] and throughputs for both the cache and the backing store. This works well for larger amounts of data, longer latencies, and slower throughputs, such as that experienced with hard drives and networks, but is not efficient for use within a CPU cache.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n=== {{Anchor|Dirty|WRITEPOLICIES|WRITE-BACK|WRITE-BEHIND|WRITE-THROUGH|WRITE-AROUND}}Writing policies ===\n[[File:Write-through with no-write-allocation.svg|thumb|right|A write-through cache with no-write allocation]]\n[[File:Write-back with write-allocation.svg|thumb|right|A write-back cache with write allocation]]\n\n{{Main article|Cache coherence}}\n\nWhen a system writes data to cache, it must at some point write that data to the backing store as well. The timing of this write is controlled by what is known as the ''write policy''.\nThere are two basic writing approaches:\n\n* ''Write-through'': write is done synchronously both to the cache and to the backing store.\n* ''Write-back'' (also called ''write-behind''): initially, writing is done only to the cache. The write to the backing store is postponed until the modified content is about to be replaced by another cache block.\n\nA write-back cache is more complex to implement, since it needs to track which of its locations have been written over, and mark them as ''dirty'' for later writing to the backing store. The data in these locations are written back to the backing store only when they are evicted from the cache, an effect referred to as a ''lazy write''. For this reason, a read miss in a write-back cache (which requires a block to be replaced by another) will often require two memory accesses to service: one to write the replaced data from the cache back to the store, and then one to retrieve the needed data.\n\nOther policies may also trigger data write-back. The client may make many changes to data in the cache, and then explicitly notify the cache to write back the data.\n\nSince no data is returned to the requester on write operations, a decision needs to be made on write misses, whether or not data would be loaded into the cache.\nThis is defined by these two approaches:\n\n* ''Write allocate'' (also called ''fetch on write''): data at the missed-write location is loaded to cache, followed by a write-hit operation. In this approach, write misses are similar to read misses.\n* ''No-write allocate'' (also called ''write-no-allocate'' or ''write around''): data at the missed-write location is not loaded to cache, and is written directly to the backing store. In this approach, data is loaded into the cache on read misses only.\n\nBoth write-through and write-back policies can use either of these write-miss policies, but usually they are paired in this way:<ref name=\"HennessyPatterson2011\">\n{{cite book\n|author1=John L.

Here, subsequent writes have no advantage, since they still need to be written directly to the backing store.\n\nEntities other than the cache may change the data in the backing store, in which case the copy in the cache may become out-of-date or ''stale''. Alternatively, when the client updates the data in the cache, copies of those data in other caches will become stale. Communication protocols between the cache managers which keep the data consistent are known as [[cache coherency|coherency protocols]].\n\n=={{anchor|HARDWARE}}Examples of hardware caches==\n=== CPU cache ===\n{{Main article|CPU cache}}\n\nSmall memories on or close to the [[CPU]] can operate faster than the much larger [[main memory]]. Most CPUs since the 1980s have used one or more caches, sometimes [[CPU cache#Multi-level caches|in cascaded levels]]; modern high-end [[Embedded computing|embedded]], [[Desktop computer|desktop]] and server [[microprocessor]]s may have as many as six types of cache (between levels and functions),.<ref>{{cite web|title=intel broad well core i7 with 128mb L4 cache|url=http://wccftech.com/intel-broadwell-core-i7-5775c-128mb-l4-cache-and-skylake-core-i7-6700k-flagship-processors-available-retail/}}Mentions L4 cache. Combined with separate I-Cache and TLB, this brings the total 'number of caches (levels+functions) to 6</ref> Examples of caches with a specific function are the [[D-cache]] and [[I-cache]] and the [[translation lookaside buffer]] for the [[Memory management unit|MMU]].\n\n=== {{Anchor|GPU}}GPU cache ===\nEarlier [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) often had limited read-only [[texture cache]]s, and introduced [[morton order]] [[swizzled texture]]s to improve 2D [[cache coherency]]. [[Cache miss]]es would drastically affect performance, e.g. if [[mipmapping]] was not used. Caching was important to leverage 32-bit (and wider) transfers for texture data that was often as little as 4&nbsp;bits per pixel, indexed in complex patterns by arbitrary [[UV coordinates]] and [[perspective transformation]]s in [[inverse texture mapping]].\n\nAs GPUs advanced (especially with [[GPGPU]] [[compute shader]]s) they have developed progressively larger and increasingly general caches, including [[instruction cache]]s for [[shader]]s, exhibiting increasingly common functionality with CPU caches.<ref name=\"ReferenceGCS7\">S. Mittal, \"[https://www.academia.edu/6940614/A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Managing_and_Leveraging_Caches_in_GPUs A Survey of Techniques for Managing and Leveraging Caches in GPUs]\", JCSC, 23(8), 2014.</ref> For example, [[GeForce 200 series|GT200]] architecture GPUs did not feature an L2 cache, while the [[Fermi (microarchitecture)|Fermi]] GPU has 768&nbsp;KB of last-level cache, the [[Kepler (microarchitecture)|Kepler]] GPU has 1536&nbsp;KB of last-level cache,<ref name=\"ReferenceGCS7\"/> and the [[Maxwell (microarchitecture)|Maxwell]] GPU has 2048&nbsp;KB of last-level cache. These caches have grown to handle [[synchronisation primitive]]s between threads and [[atomic operation]]s, and interface with a CPU-style [[Memory management unit|MMU]].\n\n=== DSPs ===\n[[Digital signal processor]]s have similarly generalised over the years. Earlier designs used [[scratchpad memory]] fed by [[Direct memory access|DMA]], but modern DSPs such as [[Qualcomm Hexagon]] often include a very similar set of caches to a CPU (e.g. [[Modified Harvard architecture]] with shared L2, split L1 I-cache and D-cache).<ref>{{cite web|title=qualcom Hexagon DSP SDK overview|url=https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/hexagon-dsp-sdk/dsp-processor}}</ref>\n\n=== Translation lookaside buffer ===\n{{Main article|Translation lookaside buffer}}\n\nA [[memory management unit]] (MMU) that fetches page table entries from main memory has a specialized cache, used for recording the results of [[virtual address]] to [[physical address]] translations. This specialized cache is called a [[translation lookaside buffer]] (TLB).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/su09/cse120/lectures/Lecture7.pdf\n | title = Lecture  7:  Memory  Management\n | work = CSE 120:  Principles  of  Operating  Systems\n | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2013-12-04\n | author = Frank  Uyeda | publisher = UC San Diego\n | format = PDF\n}}</ref>\n\n== Software caches ==\n\n=== Disk cache ===\n{{Main article|Page cache}}\n\nWhile CPU caches are generally managed entirely by hardware, a variety of software manages other caches. The [[page cache]] in main memory, which is an example of disk cache, is managed by the operating system [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]].\n\nWhile the [[disk buffer]], which is an integrated part of the hard disk drive, is sometimes misleadingly referred to as \"disk cache\", its main functions are write sequencing and read prefetching. Repeated cache hits are relatively rare, due to the small size of the buffer in comparison to the drive's capacity. However, high-end [[disk controller]]s often have their own on-board cache of the hard disk drive's [[Block (data storage)|data blocks]].\n\nFinally, a fast local hard disk drive can also cache information held on even slower data storage devices, such as remote servers ([[web cache]]) or local [[tape drive]]s or [[optical jukebox]]es; such a scheme is the main concept of [[hierarchical storage management]].  Also, fast flash-based [[solid-state drive]]s (SSDs) can be used as caches for slower rotational-media hard disk drives, working together as [[hybrid drive]]s or [[solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs).\n\n=== Web cache ===\n{{Main article|Web cache}}\n\n[[Web browser]]s and [[Proxy server|web proxy servers]] employ web caches to store previous responses from [[web server]]s, such as [[web page]]s and [[image]]s. Web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted across the network, as information previously stored in the cache can often be re-used. This reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server, and helps to improve [[responsiveness]] for users of the web.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_application/Caching | title=Web application caching | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2013-07-24 }}</ref>\n\nWeb browsers employ a built-in web cache, but some [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) or organizations also use a caching proxy server, which is a web cache that is shared among all users of that network.\n\nAnother form of cache is [[P2P caching]], where the files most sought for by [[peer-to-peer]] applications are stored in an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] cache to accelerate P2P transfers. Similarly, decentralised equivalents exist, which allow communities to perform the same task for P2P traffic, for example, Corelli.<ref>{{cite conference|author1=Gareth Tyson|author2=Andreas Mauthe|author3=Sebastian Kaune|author4=Mu Mu|author5=Thomas Plagemann|title=Corelli: A Dynamic Replication Service for Supporting Latency-Dependent Content in Community Networks|conference=MMCN'09|url=http://comp.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/2044/1/MMCN09.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618193018/http://comp.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/2044/1/MMCN09.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Memoization ===\n{{Main article|Memoization}}<!-- NOTE: this is *NOT* a typo for \"memorization\"! -->\n\nA cache can store data that is computed on demand rather than retrieved from a backing store.  [[Memoization]] is an [[Program optimization|optimization]] technique that stores the results of resource-consuming [[function call]]s within a lookup table, allowing subsequent calls to reuse the stored results and avoid repeated computation. It is related to the [[dynamic programming]] algorithm design methodology, which can also be thought of as a means of caching.\n\n=== Other caches ===\nThe BIND [[Domain Name System|DNS]] daemon caches a mapping of domain names to [[IP address]]es, as does a resolver library.\n\nWrite-through operation is common when operating over unreliable networks (like an Ethernet LAN), because of the enormous complexity of the [[cache coherency|coherency protocol]] required between multiple write-back caches when communication is unreliable. For instance, web page caches and [[client-side]] [[Network File System|network file system]] caches (like those in [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] or [[Server Message Block|SMB]]) are typically read-only or write-through specifically to keep the network protocol simple and reliable.\n\n[[Web search engine|Search engine]]s also frequently make [[web page]]s they have indexed available from their cache. For example, [[Google]] provides a \"Cached\" link next to each search result. This can prove useful when web pages from a [[web server]] are temporarily or permanently inaccessible.\n\nAnother type of caching is storing computed results that will likely be needed again, or<!-- yes, this really is memoization; it is not a typo --> [[memoization]]. For example, [[ccache]]<!-- nor is this a typo, \"ccache\" is C compiler cache --> is a program that caches the output of the compilation, in order to speed up later compilation runs.\n\n[[Database caching]] can substantially improve the throughput of [[database]] applications, for example in the processing of [[Database index|indexes]], [[Data dictionary|data dictionaries]], and frequently used subsets of data.\n\nA [[distributed cache]]<ref>{{cite journal\n| last        = Paul\n| first       = S\n|author2=Z Fei\n| date        = 1 February 2001\n| title       = Distributed caching with centralized control\n| journal     = Computer Communications\n| volume      = 24\n| issue       = 2\n| pages       = 256\u2013268\n| doi         = 10.1016/S0140-3664(00)00322-4\n}}<!--| accessdate  =18 November 2009--></ref> uses networked hosts to provide scalability, reliability and performance to the application.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last          = Khan\n| first         = Iqbal\n| title         = Distributed Caching On The Path To Scalability\n| url           = https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/dd942840.aspx\n| magazine      = MSDN\n| volume        = 24\n| issue         = 7\n| date          = July 2009\n}}</ref>  The hosts can be co-located or spread over different geographical regions.\n\n== Buffer vs. cache ==\nThe semantics of a \"buffer\" and a \"cache\" are not totally different; even so, there are fundamental differences in intent between the process of caching and the process of buffering.\n\nFundamentally, caching realizes a performance increase for transfers of data that is being repeatedly transferred. While a caching system may realize a performance increase upon the initial (typically write) transfer of a data item, this performance increase is due to buffering occurring within the caching system.\n\nWith read caches, a data item must have been fetched from its residing location at least once in order for subsequent reads of the data item to realize a performance increase by virtue of being able to be fetched from the cache's (faster) intermediate storage rather than the data's residing location. With write caches, a performance increase of writing a data item may be realized upon the first write of the data item by virtue of the data item immediately being stored in the cache's intermediate storage, deferring the transfer of the data item to its residing storage at a later stage or else occurring as a background process. Contrary to strict buffering, a caching process must adhere to a (potentially distributed) cache coherency protocol in order to maintain consistency between the cache's intermediate storage and the location where the data resides. Buffering, on the other hand,\n\n* reduces the number of transfers for otherwise novel data amongst communicating processes, which amortizes overhead involved for several small transfers over fewer, larger transfers,\n* provides an intermediary for communicating processes which are incapable of direct transfers amongst each other, or\n* ensures a minimum data size or representation required by at least one of the communicating processes involved in a transfer.\n\nWith typical caching implementations, a data item that is read or written for the first time is effectively being buffered; and in the case of a write, mostly realizing a performance increase for the application from where the write originated. Additionally, the portion of a caching protocol where individual writes are deferred to a batch of writes is a form of buffering. The portion of a caching protocol where individual reads are deferred to a batch of reads is also a form of buffering, although this form may negatively impact the performance of at least the initial reads (even though it may positively impact the performance of the sum of the individual reads). In practice, caching almost always involves some form of buffering, while strict buffering does not involve caching.\n\nA [[data buffer|buffer]] is a temporary memory location that is traditionally used because CPU [[instruction (computing)|instruction]]s cannot directly address data stored in peripheral devices. Thus, addressable memory is used as an intermediate stage. Additionally, such a buffer may be feasible when a large block of data is assembled or disassembled (as required by a storage device), or when data may be delivered in a different order than that in which it is produced. Also, a whole buffer of data is usually transferred sequentially (for example to hard disk), so buffering itself sometimes increases transfer performance or reduces the variation or jitter of the transfer's latency as opposed to caching where the intent is to reduce the latency. These benefits are present even if the buffered data are written to the [[Data buffer|buffer]] once and read from the buffer once.\n\nA cache also increases transfer performance. A part of the increase similarly comes from the possibility that multiple small transfers will combine into one large block. But the main performance-gain occurs because there is a good chance that the same data will be read from cache multiple times, or that written data will soon be read. A cache's sole purpose is to reduce accesses to the underlying slower storage. Cache is also usually an [[abstraction layer]] that is designed to be invisible from the perspective of neighboring layers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Cache prefetching]]\n* [[Cache algorithms]]\n* [[Cache coherence]]\n* [[Cache coloring]]\n* [[Cache hierarchy]]\n* [[Cache-oblivious algorithm]]\n* [[Cache stampede]]\n* [[Cache language model]]\n* [[Database cache]]\n* [[Dirty bit]]\n* [[Disk buffer]]\n* [[Cache manifest in HTML5]]\n* [[Five-minute rule]]\n* [[Materialized view]]\n* [[Pipeline burst cache]]\n* [[Temporary file]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf \"What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory\"] by [[Ulrich Drepper]]\n* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd129907.aspx \"Caching in the Distributed Environment\"]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computer architecture]]\n[[Category:Cache (computing)| ]]", "sha1": "hvf3jjvb7swdpkymf1ovyxwnoed7d2m"}}, {"title": "Columbus, Indiana", "ns": "0", "id": "6830", "revision": {"id": "865884246", "parentid": "865877995", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T20:15:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "WilliamJE", "id": "937448"}, "comment": "See also is for internal WP links not external links", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Columbus, Indiana\n|settlement_type          = City\n|nickname                 = \"Athens on the Prairie\"\n|motto                    = \"Unexpected.

Tipton built a log cabin on Mount Tipton, a small hill overlooking [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and the surrounding flat, heavily forested and swampy valley. It held wetlands of the river. The town was first known as Tiptonia, named in honor of Tipton. The town's name was changed to Columbus on March 20, 1821. General Tipton was upset by the name change and decided to leave the newly founded town.<ref>{{cite book|last=Distler|first=A.

When the road reached Columbus, Tipton constructed the first bypass road ever built; it detoured south around the west side of Columbus en route to [[Seymour, Indiana|Seymour]].\n\nJoseph McKinney was the first to plot the town of Columbus, but no date was recorded.\n\nLocal history books for years said that the land on which Columbus sits was donated by General Tipton. But in 2003, [http://www.historiccolumbusindiana.org Historic Columbus Indiana] acquired a deed showing that General Tipton sold the land.\n\nA ferry was established below the confluence of the [[Flatrock River|Flatrock]] and Driftwood rivers, which form the White River. A village of three or four log cabins developed around the ferry landing, and a store was added in 1821. Later that year, Bartholomew County was organized by an act of the [[Indiana General Assembly|State Legislature]] and named to honor the famous Hoosier militiaman, [[Joseph Bartholomew (General)|General Joseph Bartholomew]]. Columbus was incorporated on June 28, 1864.\n\nThe first railroad in Indiana was constructed to Columbus from [[Madison, Indiana]] in 1844. This eventually became the Madison branch of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The railroad fostered the growth of the community into one of the largest in Indiana, and three more railroads reached the city by 1850.\n\nColumbus is host to the oldest theater in Indiana, [[The Crump Theatre]], which was built in 1889 by John Crump. Today the building is included within the [[Columbus Historic District (Columbus, Indiana)|Columbus Historic District]]. Before it closed permanently in 2010, it was an all-ages venue with occasional musical performances. Columbus was host to the oldest continually operated bookstore in Indiana, Cummins Bookstore, which began operations in 1892. It closed in late 2007.\n\nThe [[Irwin Conference Center|Irwin Union Bank]] building was built in 1954. It was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]] in 2001 in recognition of its unique architecture. The building consists of a one-story bank structure adjacent to a three-story office annex. A portion of the office annex was built along with the banking hall in 1954. The remaining larger portion, designed by [[Roche-Dinkeloo|Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates]], was built in 1973. [[Eero Saarinen]] designed the bank building with its glazed hall to be set off against the blank background of its three-story brick annex. Two steel and glass vestibule connectors lead from the north side of this structure to the annex. The building was designed to distance the Irwin Union Bank from traditional banking architecture, which mostly echoed imposing, neoclassical style buildings of brick or stone. Tellers were behind iron bars and removed from their customers. Saarinen worked to develop a building that would welcome customers rather than intimidate them.\n\nColumbus has been home to many manufacturing companies, including Noblitt-Sparks Industries (which built radios under the Arvin brand in the 1930s)<ref>McMahon, Morgan E.

Other notable industries include architecture, a discipline for which Columbus is famous worldwide. The late [[J. Irwin Miller]] (then president and chairman of [[Cummins|Cummins Engine Company]]) launched the Cummins Foundation, a charitable program that helps subsidize a large number of architectural projects throughout the city by up-and-coming engineers and architects.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Columbus also was home to a number of pioneering car manufacturers, including [[Milton Reeves|Reeves]], which produced the unusual four-axle [[Octoauto]] and the twin rear-axle Sextoauto, both around 1911.<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

To summarize, every established national group used cultural productions to assert and strengthen a sense of national unity and destiny; less politically consolidated groups, especially those pursuing the goal of nationhood, used them in the same ways, though often with a note of determination that makes them easier to see from our contemporary point of reference.\n\nNatural admiration for excellence and justifiable pride in a predecessor's achievements is sometimes difficult to sort out from other intentions.  [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] was a great poet, the Societa Dantesca Italiana did great work in editing and publishing a usable and affordable text, but the ''Divine Comedy'' was certainly used by the newly unified Italian government (see [[History of Italy]]) to encourage a more homogeneous, Tuscan-influenced dialect for the whole peninsula (see [[Italian language]]).\n\n===Literature===\n:the [[Kalevala]]\n:[[Ossian]]\n:[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]\n:folklore collections\n:the [[Brothers Grimm]]\n\n===Visual Arts===\n:the [[Nazarene movement]]\n:[[Gothic revival]]\n:art history and nationalism\n\n===Music===\n:[[Richard Wagner]]\n\n===The Academy===\nThis relationship between ideology and serious work is particularly ambiguous in the academic fields of historical importance.  Much as 19th century science is often treated as the inventor of conceptions of evolution and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] which had serious negative political and social consequences, many 19th century historians pursued what they intended as reasonably objective research projects in the history of their own and other regions either to end by themselves using the results to support nationalistic goals or to see their work used that way by others. \n\nMore politically consolidated nations sponsored historical research projects which produced results of permanent value - such as the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' (\"Monuments of German History\") project.  The ''MGH'' is a vast series (it runs to hundreds of volumes and is still publishing) of edited primary source material essential for scholarly work on late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.  However, the term \"German\" in the title was interpreted in the broadest possible sense, and its initial royal patronage made the connection clear between a perceived '''unity''' of Germanness in history and 19th century Germanness.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Romantic nationalism]]\n\n{{Nationalism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cultural Production And Nationalism}}\n[[Category:Nationalism]]", "sha1": "55im5c7899lo4c0g8ova03567dmknc7"}}, {"title": "Reaction kinetics in uniform supersonic flow", "ns": "0", "id": "6839", "revision": {"id": "836236288", "parentid": "833021584", "timestamp": "2018-04-13T14:28:09Z", "contributor": {"ip": "182.55.96.239"}, "comment": "/* Kinetics */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Reaction kinetics in uniform supersonic flow''' ({{lang-fr|'''Cin\u00e9tique de R\u00e9action en Ecoulement Supersonique Uniforme'''}}, '''CRESU''' ) is an [[experiment]] investigating chemical reactions taking place at very low [[temperature]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sims|first1=Ian R.|last2=Smith|first2=Ian W.

As it expands, the nozzle collimates the gas into a uniform [[supersonic]] beam that is essentially collision free and has a temperature that, in the centre of mass frame, can be significantly below that of the reservoir gas. Each nozzle produces a characteristic temperature. This way, any temperature between room temperature and about 10K can be achieved.\n\n==Apparatus==\nThere are relatively few CRESU <ref>{{cite journal|title=Uniform Supersonic Chemical Reactors: 30 Years of Astrochemical History and Future Challenges|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201611240/full}}</ref> apparatuses in existence for the simple reason that the gas throughput and pumping requirements are huge, which makes them expensive to run. Two of the leading centres have been the [[University of Rennes]] (France) and the [[University of Birmingham]] (UK). A more recent development has been a pulsed version of the CRESU,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Speck|first1=Thomas|last2=Mostefaoui|first2=Toufik I.|last3=Travers|first3=Daniel|last4=Rowe|first4=Bertrand R.|title=Pulsed injection of ions into the CRESU experiment|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry|date=July 2001|volume=208|issue=1\u20133|pages=73\u201380|doi=10.1016/S1387-3806(01)00383-9|bibcode=2001IJMSp.208...73S}}</ref> which requires far less gas and therefore smaller pumps.\n\n==Kinetics==\nMost species have a negligible vapour pressure at such low temperatures and this means that they quickly condense on the sides of the apparatus. Essentially, the CRESU technique provides a \"wall-less flow tube,\" which allows the kinetics of gas phase reactions to be investigated at much lower temperatures than otherwise possible.\n\n[[Chemical kinetics]] experiments can then be carried out in a [[pump-probe]] fashion using a laser to initiate the reaction (for example by preparing one of the reagents by [[photolysis]] of a precursor), followed by observation of that same species (for example by [[laser-induced fluorescence]]) after a known time delay. The fluorescence signal is captured by a [[photomultiplier]] a known distance downstream of the de Laval nozzle. The time delay can be varied up to the maximum corresponding to the flow time over that known distance. By studying how quickly the reagent species disappears in the presence of differing concentrations of a (usually stable) co-reagent species the [[reaction rate constant]] at the low temperature of the CRESU flow can be determined.\n\nReactions studied by the CRESU technique typically have no significant activation energy barrier. In the case of neutral-neutral reactions (i.e., not involving any charged species, [[ions]]), these type of barrier-free reactions usually involve free radical species such as [[molecular oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>), the cyanide radical (CN) or the hydroxyl radical (OH). The energetic driving force for these reactions is typically an attractive long range intermolecular potential.\n\nCRESU experiments have been used to show deviations from [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius kinetics]] at low temperatures: as the temperature is reduced, the [[rate constant]] actually increases. They can explain why chemistry is so prevalent in the [[interstellar medium]], where many different polyatomic species have been detected (by [[radio astronomy]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cryochemistry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Chemistry experiments]]", "sha1": "cygapwf8ysw6e10gu2vpijpkosxcsqg"}}, {"title": "Cygwin", "ns": "0", "id": "6840", "revision": {"id": "864627364", "parentid": "862577196", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T13:04:02Z", "contributor": {"username": "Theo Mark", "id": "2448142"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Description */copy edit", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name = Cygwin\n| logo = Cygwin logo.svg\n| logo caption = \n| screenshot = Cygwin X11 rootless WinXP.png\n| caption = Running Cygwin, including [[Cygwin/X]], under [[Windows XP]]\n| collapsible = \n| author = [[Cygnus Solutions]]\n| developer = [[Cygnus Solutions]], [[Red Hat]], others\n| released = {{start date and age|1995}}\n| latest release version = 2.11.1-1<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2018-09/msg00002.html|title=Updated: Cygwin 2.11.1-1}}</ref>\n| latest release date = {{start date and age|2018|09|05}}\n| operating system = [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]]\n| genre = [[Compatibility layer]], [[C standard library]]\n| license = [[GNU Lesser General Public License#Version 3|GNU LGPLv3]]\n| website = {{URL|cygwin.com}}\n}}\n'''Cygwin''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u026a|\u0261|w|\u026a|n}} {{respell|SIG|win}}<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg00702.html | title = Re: How do you pronounce it? | author = Larry Hall | date = 2004-09-14 | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref>) is a [[Unix-like]] environment and [[command-line interface]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Cygwin provides native integration of Windows-based applications, data, and other system resources with applications, software tools, and data of the Unix-like environment. Thus it is possible to launch Windows applications from the Cygwin environment, as well as to use Cygwin tools and applications within the Windows operating context.\n\nCygwin consists of two parts: a [[dynamic-link library]] (DLL) as an [[Application programming interface|API]] compatibility layer in the form of a [[C standard library]] providing a substantial part of the [[POSIX]] API functionality, and an extensive collection of [[Programming tool|software tools]] and applications that provide a Unix-like [[look and feel]].\n\nCygwin was originally developed by [[Cygnus Solutions]], which was later acquired by [[Red Hat]]. It is [[free and open-source software]], released under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] version 3.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cygwin library now available under GNU Lesser General Public License|url=https://www.redhat.com/en/about/blog/cygwin-library-now-available-under-gnu-lesser-general-public-license|website=redhat.com}}</ref> Today it is maintained by employees of Red Hat, [[NetApp]] and many other volunteers.\n\n==Description==\nCygwin consists of a library that implements the [[POSIX]] system call [[application programming interface|API]] in terms of [[Win32]] system calls, a [[GNU]] development toolchain (including [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[GNU Debugger|GDB]]) to allow software development, and running of a large number of application programs equivalent to those on [[Unix]] systems. Programmers have ported many Unix, GNU, [[BSD]] and [[Linux]] programs and packages to Cygwin, including the [[X Window System]], [[K Desktop Environment 3]], [[GNOME]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/|title=Cygwin Ports|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref> [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], and [[TeX]]. Cygwin permits installing [[inetd]], [[syslogd]], [[Secure Shell|sshd]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], and other daemons as standard [[Windows service]]s, allowing Microsoft Windows systems to emulate Unix and Linux servers.\n\nCygwin programs are installed by running Cygwin's \"setup\" program, which downloads the necessary program and feature package files from repositories on the Internet. Setup can install, update, and remove programs and their source code packages. A complete installation will take in excess of 36&nbsp;GB of hard disk space, but usable configurations may require as little as 1 or 2&nbsp;GB.\n\nEfforts to reconcile concepts that differ between Unix and Windows systems include:\n* A Cygwin-specific version of the Unix [[Mount (computing)|<code>mount</code>]] command allows mounting Windows paths as \"filesystems\" in the Unix file space. Initial mount-points can be configured in <code>[[fstab|/etc/fstab]]</code>, which has a format very similar to Unix systems, except that Windows paths appear in place of devices. Filesystems can be mounted in binary mode (by default), or in text mode, which enables automatic [[Newline#Common_problems|conversion]] between [[Newline|LF]] and [[CRLF]] endings (which only affects programs that open files without explicitly specifying text or binary mode).\n* Cygwin 1.7 introduced comprehensive support for POSIX [[Locale (computer software)|locales]] and many [[character encoding]]s, whereby the [[UTF-8]] [[Unicode]] encoding became the default. Windows file-names and other identifiers, which are encoded as [[UTF-16]], are automatically converted to and from the selected character-encoding.\n* Windows [[drive letter]]s map to a special directory, so for example <code>C:</code> appears as <code>/cygdrive/c</code>. The <code>/cygdrive</code> prefix can be changed. Windows network paths of the form <code>\\\\HOST\\SHARE\\FILE</code> are mapped to <code>//HOST/SHARE/FILE</code>. Windows paths can also be used directly from Cygwin programs, but many programs do not support them correctly, hence this is discouraged.\n* Full-featured <code>[[/dev]]</code> and <code>[[/proc]]</code> file-systems are provided. <code>/proc/registry</code> provides direct filesystem access to the registry.\n* Cygwin supports POSIX [[symbolic link]]s, representing them as plain-text files with the system [[attrib]]ute set. Cygwin 1.5 represented them as [[Windows Explorer]] [[File shortcut|shortcuts]], but this has been changed for reasons of performance and POSIX correctness. Cygwin also recognises NTFS [[NTFS junction point|junction points]] and [[NTFS symbolic link|symbolic links]] and treats them as POSIX symbolic links, but it does not create them as their semantics are not fully POSIX-compliant.\n* The [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] API for handling [[access control list]]s (ACLs) is supported and maps to the Windows NT ACL system.\n* Special formats of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/group</code> are provided that include pointers to the Windows equivalent [[Security Identifier|SID]]s (in the [[Gecos field]]), allowing for mapping between Unix and Windows users and groups.\n* The [[Fork (computing)|fork]] system call for duplicating a process is fully implemented, but it does not map well to the Windows API. For example, the [[copy-on-write]] optimization strategy could not be used.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title      = Cygwin FAQ:  How is fork() implemented? \n| url        = https://www.cygwin.com/faq.html#faq.api.fork\n| accessdate = Oct 10, 2010\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n| title      = Highlights of Cygwin Functionality:  Process Creation \n| url        = http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/highlights.html#ov-hi-process\n| accessdate = Dec 24, 2014\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite mailing list\n| last       = Blake\n| first      = Eric\n| title      = Bash doesn't launch the applications directly\n| mailinglist = Cygwin project\n| date       = Jan 15, 2009\n| url        = http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-01/msg00461.html\n| accessdate = Oct 10, 2010\n}}\n</ref> As a result, Cygwin's fork is rather slow compared with Linux and others. (That overhead can often be avoided by replacing uses of the [[fork-exec|fork/exec]] technique with calls to the [[spawn (computing)|spawn]] functions declared in the Windows-specific [[process.h]] header).\n* The Cygwin DLL contains a console driver that emulates a Unix-style [[Terminal emulator|terminal]] within the [[Win32 console|Windows console]]. Cygwin's default user interface is the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell running in the Cygwin console.\n* The DLL also implements [[pseudo terminal]] (pty) devices. Cygwin ships with a number of [[terminal emulator]]s that are based on them, including [[mintty]], [[rxvt]]([[rxvt-unicode|-unicode]]), and [[xterm]]. These are more compliant with Unix terminal standards and user interface conventions than the Cygwin console, but are less suited for running Windows console programs.\n* Various utilities are provided for converting between Windows and Unix paths and file formats, for handling line ending (CRLF/LF) issues, for displaying the [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]]s that an executable is linked with, etc.\n* Apart from always being linked against the Cygwin DLL, Cygwin executables are normal Windows executables. This means that Cygwin programs have full access to the [[Windows API]] and other Windows libraries, which allows gradual porting of programs from one platform to the other. However, programmers need to be careful about mixing conflicting POSIX and Windows functions.\n\nThe version of [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] that comes with Cygwin has various extensions for creating Windows DLLs, specifying whether a program is a windowing or console-mode program, adding resources, etc. Support for compiling programs that do not require the POSIX compatibility layer provided by the Cygwin DLL used to be included in the default <code>gcc</code>, but {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} is provided by cross-compilers contributed by the [[MinGW#MinGW-w64|MinGW-w64]] project.\n\nCygwin is used heavily for porting many popular pieces of software to the Windows platform. It is used to compile [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[OpenOffice.org]], [[LibreOffice]], and even web server software like [[Lighttpd]] and [[Hiawatha (web server)|Hiawatha]].<ref>\n[http://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/download Windows package of Hiawatha Webserver compiled via Cygwin]</ref>\n\nRed Hat normally licenses the Cygwin library under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] version 3 with an exception to allow linking to any [[free and open-source software]] whose license conforms to the [[Open Source Definition]]<ref name=\"cyglicense\">{{cite web | url = http://cygwin.com/licensing.html | title = What are the licensing terms? | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcygwin.com%2Flicensing.html&date=2012-07-30 | archivedate=2012-07-30  |work = Cygwin}}\n</ref> (less strict than the Free Software Definition).

He thought it would be possible to retarget [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and produce a [[cross compiler]] generating executables that could run on Windows. This proved practical and a prototype was quickly developed.\n\nThe next step was to attempt to [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrap]] the compiler on a Windows system, requiring sufficient emulation of Unix to let the [[Autoconf|GNU configure]] [[shell script]] run. A [[Bourne shell]]-compatible command interpreter, such as [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], was needed and in turn a [[Fork (computing)|fork]] system call emulation and [[Standard streams|standard input/output]]. Windows includes similar functionality, so the Cygwin library just needed to provide a [[POSIX]]-compatible [[application programming interface]] (API) and properly translate calls and manage private versions of data, such as [[file descriptor]]s.\n\nInitially, Cygwin was called gnuwin32 (not to be confused with the current [[GnuWin32]] project). The name was changed to Cygwin32 to emphasize Cygnus' role in creating it. When [[Microsoft]] registered the trademark [[Win32]], the 32 was dropped to simply become Cygwin.\n\nBy 1996, other engineers had joined in, because it was clear that Cygwin would be a useful way to provide Cygnus' embedded tools hosted on Windows systems (the previous strategy had been to use [[DJGPP]]). It was especially attractive because it was possible to do a [[Canadian cross|three-way cross-compile]], for instance to use a hefty [[Sun Microsystems]] workstation to build, say, a Windows-x-[[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] cross-compiler, which was faster than using the PC at the time. In 1999, Cygnus offered Cygwin 1.0 as a commercial product of interest in its own right although subsequent versions have not been released, instead relying on continued open source releases.\n\nGeoffrey Noer was the project lead from 1996 to 1998. Christopher Faylor was the project lead from 1998 to mid-2014. Corinna Vinschen became co-lead since{{clarify|date=June 2012}} early 2004 when Faylor left Red Hat and has been lead since mid-2014, when Faylor withdrew from active participation in the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sourceware.org/ml/cygwin/2014-07/msg00392.html|title=Christopher Faylor \u2013 Withdrawing from the project|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\n\nCygwin's default package selection is fairly small, containing little more than the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell and the core file manipulation utilities expected of a Unix command line. Additional packages are available as optional installs from within Cygwin's package manager (\"setup-x86.exe\" \u2013 32bit & \"setup-x86_64.exe\" \u2013 64bit). These include (among many others):\n* Shells (i.e. command line interpreters): [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Debian Almquist shell|dash]], [[Friendly interactive shell|fish]], [[Korn shell|pdksh]], [[tcsh]], [[zsh]]\n* File and system utilities: [[coreutils]], [[findutils]], [[util-linux]]\n* Text utilities: [[grep]], [[sed]], [[diff]], [[patch (Unix)|patch]], [[awk]]\n* Terminals: [[mintty]], [[rxvt]], [[GNU Screen|screen]]\n* Editors: [[emacs]], [[Joe's Own Editor|joe]], [[mined (text editor)|mined]], [[nano (text editor)|nano]], [[Vim (text editor)|vim]]\n* Remote login: [[OpenSSH|ssh]], [[Remote Shell|rsh]], [[telnet]]\n* Remote file transfer/synchronization: [[ftp]], [[Secure copy|scp]], [[rsync]], [[Unison (file synchronizer)|unison]], [[rtorrent]]\n* Compression/archiving: [[tar (file format)|tar]], [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[lzma]], [[ZIP (file format)|zip]]\n* Text processing: [[TeX]], [[groff (software)|groff]], [[Ghostscript]]\n* Programming languages: [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Objective-C]], [[Fortran]], [[Gambas]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Tcl]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[CLISP]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[OCaml]], [[Prolog]]\n* Development tools: [[make (software)|make]], [[autotools]], [[flex lexical analyser|flex]], [[GNU bison|bison]], [[doxygen]]\n* Version control systems: [[Concurrent Versions System|cvs]], [[Subversion (software)|subversion]], [[Git (software)|git]], [[mercurial]]\n* Servers: [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[BIND]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Pure-FTPd]], [[OpenSSH]], [[telnetd]], [[exim]], [[UW IMAP]]\n* Clients: [[Mutt (e-mail client)|Mutt]] (email), [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] (web), [[Irssi]] (IRC), [[tin (newsreader)|tin]] (newsgroups)\n\nThe [[Cygwin/X]] project contributes an implementation of the [[X Window System]] that allows graphical Unix programs to display their user interfaces on the Windows desktop. This can be used with both local and remote programs. Cygwin ships with a fairly small number of X applications, for example:\n* Terminals: [[rxvt-unicode]], [[xterm]]\n* Editors: emacs-X11, [[Vim (text editor)|gvim]]\n* Text processors/viewers: [[LyX]], [[xpdf]], [[Device independent file format|xdvi]]\n\nIn addition to the low-level [[Xlib]]/[[XCB]] libraries for developing X applications, Cygwin also ships with various higher-level and cross-platform [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] frameworks, including [[GTK+]] and [[Qt (software)|Qt]].\n\nThe [[Cygwin Ports]] project provides many additional packages that are not available in the Cygwin distribution itself. Examples include [[GNOME]] and [[K Desktop Environment 3]] as well as the [[MySQL]] database and the [[PHP]] scripting language.\n\n==Alternative Windows/Unix integration tools==\nSeveral open-source and proprietary alternatives provide simultaneous access to both Windows and UNIX environments on the same hardware.\n\nToolsets like [[Windows Subsystem for Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX| Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX (SFU)]], [[UWIN]], [[MKS Toolkit]] for Enterprise Developers and [[Hamilton C shell]] also aim to provide a Unix-like user- and development-environment. They implement at least a shell and a set of the most popular utilities. Most include the familiar GNU and/or Unix development tools, including [[make (software)|make]], [[yacc]], [[lex (software)|lex]] and a [[cc (software)|cc]] command which acts a wrapper around a supported [[C (programming language)|C]] compiler. SFU also includes the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler.\n\n[[MinGW]] provides a native [[porting|software port]] of the GCC to Microsoft Windows, along with a set of freely-distributable import libraries and [[header files]] for the [[Windows API]]. MinGW allows developers to create native Microsoft Windows applications. In addition, a component of MinGW known as '''MSYS''' (''Minimal SYStem''), which derives from Cygwin version 1.3.3, provides a minimal Unix-like [[shell (computer science)|shell]] environment including [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] and a selection of [[POSIX]] tools sufficient to enable [[autoconf]] scripts to run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mingw.org/wiki/MSYS|title=MSYS|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nNumerous [[virtualization]] solutions provide [[x86 architecture|x86]] [[platform virtualization]] to run Windows and Unix-like operating systems simultaneously on the same hardware, but without the integration of the environments that Cygwin provides. Some, like [[VirtualBox]] and [[VMware Player]] run on Windows and Linux hosts and can run many other operating systems. [[Cooperative Linux]] (abbreviated ''coLinux'') runs a full, but modified Linux kernel like a driver under Windows, effectively making Windows and Linux two [[coroutines]], using [[cooperative multitasking]] to switch between them.\n\n[[Wine (software)|Winelib]], a part of the Wine project, is the inverse of Cygwin \u2013 it is a [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[compatibility layer]] for [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s on the x86 or [[x86-64]] architecture that can allow programs written for [[Microsoft Windows]] to run on Unix-like operating systems.

Natural features around the city include the narrow coastal plain of [[Vocha (plain of)|Vocha]], the [[Gulf of Corinth|Corinthian Gulf]], the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] cut by its [[Corinth Canal|canal]], the [[Saronic Gulf]], the [[Oneia Mountains]], and the monolithic rock of [[Acrocorinth]], where the medieval [[acropolis]] was built.\n\n== History ==\n{{Further|Ancient Corinth}}\nCorinth derives its name from [[Ancient Corinth]], a [[city-state]] of antiquity. The site was occupied from before 3000 BC. But historical sources about the city concerns the early 8th century BC, when Corinth began to develop as a commercial center. Between the 8th and 7th centuries, the Bacchiad family ruled Corinth. [[Cypselus]] overthrew the [[Bacchiad]] family, and between 657 and 550 BC, he and his son [[Periander]] ruled Corinth as the Tyrants. \n\nIn about 550 BC, an oligarchical government seized power. This government allied with [[Sparta]] within the [[Peloponnesian League]], and Corinth participated in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] and [[Peloponnesian War]] as an ally of Sparta. After Sparta's victory in the Peloponnesian war, the two allies fell out with one another, and Corinth pursued an independent policy in the various wars of the early 4th century BC. After the Macedonian conquest of Greece, the [[Acrocorinth]] was the seat of a Macedonian garrison until 243 BC, when the city was liberated and joined the [[Achaean League]].

The [[Corinth Refinery]] is one of the largest [[oil refining]] industrial complexes in [[Europe]]. Copper cables, petroleum products, leather, medical equipment, marble, gypsum, ceramic tiles, salt, mineral water and beverages, meat products, and gums are produced nearby. {{As of|2005}}, a period of [[deindustrialization]] has commenced as a large pipework complex, a textile factory and a meat packing facility diminished their operations.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Corinth Isthmus rail road bridge.jpg|thumb|The rail road bridge over the Isthmus of Corinth.]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nCorinth is a major road hub.

It is mainly a cargo exporting facility.\n\nIt is an artificial harbour (depth approximately {{convert|9|m|ft}}, protected by a concrete [[mole (architecture)|mole]] (length approximately 930 metres, width 100 metres, mole surface 93,000 m2). A new pier finished in the late 1980s doubled the capacity of the port. The reinforced mole protects anchored vessels from strong northern winds.\n\nWithin the port operates a [[customs]] office facility and a [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] post. Sea traffic is limited to trade in the export of local produce, mainly citrus fruits, grapes, marble, aggregates and some domestic imports. The port operates as a contingency facility for general cargo ships, [[bulk carrier]]s and [[RORO]]s, in case of [[strike action|strikes]] at [[Piraeus]] port.\n\n==== Ferries ====\nThere was formerly a [[ferry]] link to [[Catania]], [[Sicily]] and [[Genoa]]  in [[Italy]].\n[[File:Port of Corinth.jpg|thumb|left|800px|Panorama view of the port.]]\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Canal ===\n{{Main|Corinth Canal}}\n[[File:Corinth Canal by Frank van Mierlo.jpg|thumb|View of the Corinth Canal.]]\nThe [[Corinth Canal]], carrying ship traffic between the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], is about {{convert|4|km}} east of the city, cutting through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] that connects the Peloponnesian peninsula to the Greek mainland, thus effectively making the former an island. The builders dug the canal through the Isthmus at sea level; no locks are employed. It is {{convert|6.4|km}} in length and only {{convert|21.3|m}} wide at its base, making it impassable for most modern ships. It now has little economic importance.\n\nThe canal was mooted in classical times and an abortive effort was made to build it in the 1st century AD. Construction started in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was completed in 1893, but due to the canal's narrowness, navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslips from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic anticipated by its operators. It is now used mainly for tourist traffic.\n\n== Sport ==\nThe city's [[association football]] team is [[Korinthos F.C.]] (''\u03a0.\u0391.E. \u039a\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2''), established in 1999 after the merger of Pankorinthian Football Club (''\u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2'') and Corinth Football Club (''\u039a\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2'').

The Charge of the Goddess is recited during most rituals in which the Wiccan priest/priestess is expected to represent, and/or embody, the [[Goddess]] within the sacred circle, and is often spoken by the High Priest/Priestess after the ritual of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]].\n\nThe Charge is the promise of the Goddess (who is embodied by the high priestess) to all witches that she will teach and guide them. It has been called \"perhaps the most important single theological document in the neo-Pagan movement\".<ref>Shelley Rabinovich and James Lewis. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft  and Neo-Paganism'', p. 41. New York: Citadel Books, 2004</ref> It is used not only in [[Wicca]], but as part of the foundational documents of the [[Reclaiming (neopaganism)]] tradition of witchcraft co-founded by [[Starhawk]].\n\nSeveral versions of the Charge exist, though they all have the same basic premise, that of a set of instructions given by the Great Goddess to her worshippers. The best-known version is that compiled by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]].<ref name=\"Orpheus\">{{Cite news\n| issn = 1753-898X\n| issue = 30\n| pages = 14\u201318\n| last = Orpheus\n| first = Rodney\n| title = Gerald Gardner & Ordo Templi Orientis\n| work = Pentacle Magazine\n| year = 2009\n}}</ref> This version, titled \"Leviter Veslis\"or \"Lift Up the Veil\", includes material paraphrased from works by [[Aleister Crowley]], primarily from [[Liber AL]] ([[The Book of the Law]], particularly from Ch 1, spoken by Nuit, the Star Goddess), and from Liber LXV (The Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent) and from Crowley's essay \"The Law of Liberty\", thus linking modern Wicca to the cosmology and revelations of [[Thelema]]. It has been shown that Gerald Gardner's book collection which was acquired by [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] included a copy of Crowley's [[The Blue Equinox]]\" (1919) which includes all of the Crowley quotations transferred by Gardner to the Charge of the Goddess. [http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm]\n\nThere are also two versions written by [[Doreen Valiente]] in the mid-1950s, after her 1953 Wiccan initiation. The first was a poetic paraphrase which eliminated almost all the material derived from Leland and Crowley. The second was a prose version which is contained within the traditional [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] [[Book of Shadows]] and more closely resembles Gardner's \"Leviter Veslis\" version of 1949.\n\nSeveral different versions of a Wiccan ''[[Charge of the God]]'' have since been created to mirror and accompany the ''Charge of the Goddess''.\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:Isis Musei Capitolini MC744.jpg|thumb|The goddess [[Isis]], holding a [[sistrum]] and [[oinochoe]].]]\nThe opening paragraph names a collection of goddesses, some derived from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology]], others from [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] or [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian]] [[legend]]s, affirming a belief that these various figures represent a single [[Mother goddess|Great Mother]]:\n:''Listen to the words of the Great Mother; she who of old was also called among men [[Artemis]], [[`Ashtart|Astarte]], [[Athena|Athene]], [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]], [[Melusine]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Cerridwen]], [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Dana]], [[Arianrhod]], [[Isis]], [[Brigid|Bride]], and by many other names.''\n\nThis theme echoes the ancient Roman belief that the [[Goddess]] [[Isis]] was known by ten thousand names and also that the Goddess still worshipped today by Wiccans and other neopagans is known under many guises but is in fact one universal divinity.\n\nThe second paragraph is largely derived and paraphrased from the words that [[Aradia]], the messianic daughter of [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], speaks to her followers in [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s 1899 book ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' (London: David Nutt; various reprints). The third paragraph is largely written by Doreen Valiente,[http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm] with a significant content of phrases loosely  from ''The Book of the Law'' and ''The Book of the Heart Girt with the Serpent'' by Aleister Crowley.<ref name=\"Orpheus\" />\n\nThe charge affirms that ''all'' acts of love and pleasure are sacred to the Goddess e.g.\n\n<blockquote>\"Let my worship be within the heart that rejoices,\nfor behold, all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals.\n\nTherefore, let there be beauty and strength,\n\npower and compassion, honor and humility,\nmirth and reverence within you.\"</blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n=== Ancient precedents ===\nIn book eleven, chapter 47 of [[Apuleius]]'s ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', [[Isis]] delivers what Ceisiwr Serith calls \"essentially a charge of a goddess\".<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Serith\n  | first = Ceisiwr\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = The Sources of the Charge of the Goddess\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2010-08-14}}</ref> This is rather different from the modern version known in Wicca, though they have the same premise, that of the rules given by a great Mother Goddess to her faithful.\n\nThe Charge of the Goddess is also known under the title ''Leviter Veslis''.  This has been identified by the historian [[Ronald Hutton]], cited in an article by Roger Dearnsley \"The Influence of Aleister Crowley on ''Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical'', as a piece of medieval ecclesiastical Latin used to mean \"lifting the veil.\" <ref>[http://www.geocities.ws/nu_isis/leviter.html  Frater T.S. \"Levity's Vestments: A Study in Creative Plagiarism\"]</ref> However, Hutton's interpretation does not reflect the Latin grammar as it currently stands. It may represent Gardner's attempt to write ''Levetur Velis'', which has the literal meaning of \"Let the veil be lifted.\" This expression would, by coincidence or design, grammatically echo the famous ''fiat lux'' (''Gen. 1:3'') of the Latin Vulgate.<ref>''Biblia Sacra iuxta vulgatam versionem''. Robert Weber, Roger Gryson (eds.) (4 ed.). Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft. 1994.</ref>\n\n===Origins===\nThe earliest known Wiccan version is found in a document dating from the late 1940s, Gerald Gardner's ritual notebook titled ''Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical'' (formerly in the collection of Ripley's International, Toronto).The oldest identifiable source contained in this version is the final line, which is traceable to the 17th-century ''Centrum Naturae Concentratum'' of [[Ali Puli|Alipili]] (or Ali Puli).<ref name=\"serith1\" /> This version also draws extensively from Charles Godfrey Leland's ''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches'' (1899) and other modern sources,<ref name=\"serith1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm|first=Ceisiwr|last= Serith|title=The Sources of the Charge of the Goddess|accessdate =23 October 2007}}</ref> particularly from the works of Aleister Crowley.<ref name=\"Orpheus\" />\n\nIt is believed to have been compiled by Gerald Gardner<ref name=\"serith1\"/> or possibly another member of the [[New Forest coven]].<ref name=\"HeseltonCauldron\">{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |pages=300\u20131 |location=Milverton, Somerset |publisher=Capall Bann}}</ref> Gardner intended his version to be a theological statement justifying the Gardnerian sequence of initiations. Like the Charge found in [[Freemasonry]], where the charge is a set of instructions read to a candidate standing in a temple, the Charge of the Goddess was intended to be read immediately before an initiation.<ref name=\"James Lewis p. 41\"/>\n\nValiente felt that the influence of Crowley on the Charge was too obvious, and she did not want \"the Craft\" ( a common term for Wicca) associated with Crowley. Gardner invited her to rewrite the Charge. She proceeded to do so, her first version being into verse.<ref name=\"James Lewis p. 41\">Shelley Rabinovich and James Lewis. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism'', p. 41. New York: Citadel Books, 2004</ref>\n\nThe initial verse version by [[Doreen Valiente]] consisted of eight verses, the second of which was :\n\n:''Bow before My spirit bright''\n:''Aphrodite, Arianrhod''\n:''Lover of the Horn\u00e9d God''\n:''Queen of witchery and night''<ref>''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 61</ref>\n\nValiente was unhappy with this version, saying that \"people seemed to have some difficulty with this, because of the various goddess-names which they found hard to pronounce\",<ref>''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 62</ref> and so she rewrote it as a prose version, much of which differs from her initial version, and is more akin to Gardner's version. This prose version has since been modified and reproduced widely by other authors.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Aidan Kelly]]. ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book 1''.

For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games.<ref name=1897chron /> By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in [[spring training]]. \"I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it\", said Young, \"and there wasn't any use wasting them.\" Young once described his approach before a game:\n<blockquote>I never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible.

Granada Television had commissioned only 13 episodes, and some inside the company doubted the show would last beyond its planned production run.<ref>Little.

(1960) p. 8.</ref> The character was one of the few to have experienced life outside of Coronation Street. In some ways this predicts the growth of [[globalisation]], and the decline of similar communities. In an episode from 1961, Barlow declares: \"You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than [[Elsie Tanner]] and her boyfriends.\"<ref>{{cite video | people = Granada Television | title =Coronation Street 1961 | medium = Television serial drama  | publisher = Granada | location =Quay Street, Manchester | date =8 November 1961 }}</ref> Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, which makes him the longest-serving actor in ''Coronation Street'', and in British and global soap history.\n\nAt the centre of many early stories, there was [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, and her friends: timid [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]), and bespectacled [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]). The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the [[The snug|snug bar]] of the [[Rovers Return Inn|Rovers Return]], passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<ref>Tinker. p. 31.</ref> Headstrong Ena often clashed with [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Patricia Phoenix]]), whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which most of the time had little basis in reality.\n\nIn April 1961, [[Jed Stone]] ([[Kenneth Cope]]) made his first appearance and returned the following year in 1962. He left in 1963, but returned three years later in 1966. He left again and then returned 42 years later in 2008.\n\nIn March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No. 1 in the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|television ratings]] and remained there for the rest of the year.<ref name=\"littlepg10\"/> Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15&nbsp;million) tuned into ''Corrie'', and by 1964 the programme had over 20&nbsp;million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>Little (1995). p. 35.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |accessdate=29 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223181243/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |archivedate=23 February 2007  }}</ref>\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included a mystery poison-pen letter received by Elsie Tanner, the 1962 marriage of Ken Barlow and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]] ([[Anne Reid]]), [[Storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street)|Steve Tanner]] ([[Paul Maxwell (actor)|Paul Maxwell]]) and a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), Steve Tanner's murder in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.\n\nIn spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert C| last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=7 January 2007}}</ref> After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: \"The programme is doomed from the outset&nbsp;... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.\"<ref>Tinker. pp. 12\u201313.</ref> By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the ''1950s''. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including [[Lucille Hewitt]] ([[Jennifer Moss (actress)|Jennifer Moss]]) becoming addicted to drugs, [[Jerry Booth (Coronation Street)|Jerry Booth]] ([[Graham Haberfield]]) being in a storyline about homosexuality, [[Emily Nugent]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<ref>Little. (2000) p. 45.</ref>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nThe show's [[production team]] was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When [[Arthur Leslie]] died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers' landlord [[Jack Walker (Coronation Street)|Jack Walker]], died with him.<ref>Little. (2000) p.67.</ref> [[Anne Reid]] quit as Valerie Barlow, and was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer.<ref name=\"littlepg73\"/> Ratings reached a low of eight million in February 1973, when [[Pat Phoenix]] quit as [[Elsie Tanner]], [[Violet Carson]] (battleaxe [[Ena Sharples]]) was written out for most of the year due to illness, and [[Doris Speed]] (haughty landlady [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) took two months' leave due to bereavement.<ref name=\"littlepg86\">Little. (2000) p.86.</ref> The audience of ITV's other flagship soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' increased markedly at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.<ref name=\"littlepg86\"/> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) and [[Ivy Tilsley|Ivy Tyldesley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 (with Perrie's character being renamed to the better-known \"Tilsley\"), and characters such as [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]], [[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]), and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.<ref name = \"fsobxi\">Little. (2000) p.93.</ref><ref>Little. (2000) p.79.</ref>\n\nComic storylines had been popular in the series in the 1960s, but had become sparse during the early 1970s. These were re-introduced by new producer [[Bill Podmore]] who joined the series in 1976. He had worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.<ref>Little. (2000) p.107.</ref> [[Stan Ogden|Stan]] ([[Bernard Youens]]) and [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]) were often at the centre of overtly funny storylines, with other comic characters including [[Eddie Yeats]] ([[Geoffrey Hughes]]), [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]), and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[William Tarmey]]) all making their first appearances during the decade.\n\nIn 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned on a more regular basis as Ena.<ref>Little. (1995) p.131.</ref> ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] ([[Cheryl Murray]]) moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff Bet Lynch, [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]) and [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] ([[Betty Driver]]).\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] ([[Stephen Hancock]]) in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of [[Brian Tilsley]] ([[Christopher Quinten]]) and Gail Potter (also in 1979).\n\nFor eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, [[industrial action]] forced ''Coronation Street'' and the entire ITV network (apart from the [[Channel Islands]]) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special \"catch-up\" edition of ''Coronation Street''. This included storylines which would have taken place during the strike, and they were explained in the form of a narrative chat between Bet Lynch and popular character [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]). For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show ''[[3-2-1]]'' were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens with a regular scheduled time closer to the end of 1979.\n\n''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.<ref>Liddement. (2004)</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nBetween 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, [[William Roache]] ([[Ken Barlow]]) stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) in 1980, [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) in 1983, and both [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) and [[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]] ([[Albert Tatlock]]) in 1984.<ref>Little.

(2000) pp.153\u201359.</ref> While the press predicted the end of ''Corrie'', [[H. V. Kershaw]] declared that \"There are no stars in ''Coronation Street''.\"<ref>Tinker. p.62.</ref> Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast.<ref name=\"little172\">Little. (1995) p.172.</ref> [[Phyllis Pearce]] ([[Jill Summers]]) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock.<ref>Little. (1995) p.162.</ref><ref>Little. (1995) p.171.</ref> The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, [[Shirley Armitage]] (Lisa Lewis) became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.<ref name=\"little172\"/>\n\nKen Barlow married [[Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) on 27 July 1981.

(1995) pp.184, 189.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the arrival of [[Channel 4]], and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'', which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], unemployment, and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref name=\"littlepg165\">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Like ''Brookside'', ''EastEnders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.\n\nWhile ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''[[EastEnders]]'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref> The ''Coronation Street'' episode broadcast on 2 January 1985 attracted 21.40 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode in the shows history based on a single showing.<ref> {{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/britains-most-watched-tv-show-of-last-80-years-revealed-10639498 |work=Sky News |title=Britain's most watched TV show of last 80 years |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Subsequent episodes would achieve higher figures when the original broadcast and omnibus edition figures were combined. With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.<ref name=\"littlepg165\" /> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer [[David Liddiment]]. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved the show from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.<ref name=\"littlepg188\">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref> Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"littlepg188\"/>\n\nThe 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.<ref>Little. (1995) p.165.</ref> The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]). In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return. The episode that aired on 25 December 1987, attracted a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.65&nbsp;million - a figure helped by the fact that this episode heralded the departure of immensely-popular character [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]). Between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s ([[Barbara Knox]]) [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. This storyline gave the show its highest combined viewing figure in its history with 26.93&nbsp;million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Alan is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode. This rating is sometimes incorrectly credited to the 8 December 1989 tram death episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/tv-by-decade/tv-shows-1980s/1980s-television-introduction/ |work=Nostalgia Central |title=1980s Television |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Other stories included the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] ([[Warren Jackson]]) in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and [[Stan Ogden]]'s funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] (Lynsay King) in 1987, and [[Brian Tilsley]]'s murder in 1989.\n\nNew characters were introduced, such as [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), and the McDonald family; one of whom, [[Simon Gregson]], started on the show as [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] a week after his 15th birthday, and has been on the show ever since.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]], and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as \"''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks\" (''[[The Times]]''), and \"'Put colour in t'Street\" (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little.

The amount of [[slapstick]] and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comical characters such as [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]) and his water bed.<ref>Little. (1995) p.220.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s storylines included the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) wedding to [[Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) in 1992, [[Tommy Duckworth]] being sold by his father [[Terry Duckworth|Terry]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]) in 1993, [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) marriage to Moroccan [[Samir Rachid]] ([[Al Nedjari]]), and the rise of [[Tanya Pooley]] ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1993 and 1994.\n\nIn 1995, [[Julie Goodyear]] ([[Bet Lynch]]) left the show. She made brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day, he cut the characters of [[Derek Wilton]] ([[Peter Baldwin (actor)|Peter Baldwin]]), [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]] ([[Geoffrey Hinsliff]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]), [[Bill Webster]] ([[Peter Armitage]]), [[Billy Williams (Coronation Street)|Billy Williams]] ([[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]]) and [[Maureen Holdsworth]] ([[Sherrie Hewson]]).<ref name=\"littlepg235\">Little.

Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman.<ref name=\"little241\">Little.

Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''. In the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] wrote: \"Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company.\"<ref name=\"littlepg235\"/>\n\nOne of ''Coronation Street'''s best known storylines took place in March/April 1998, with [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man [[Jon Lindsay (Coronation Street)|Jon Lindsay]] ([[Owen Aaronovitch]]).

Tributes were paid by cast members, past and present.\n\nIn October 2016, David Platt attempted to get revenge on his wife Kylie's killer [[Clayton Hibbs]] by crashing his car into the prison van that killer Clayton was in. In a bid to protect him from himself, Gail and Nick lock him in the cellar of the Bistro. However he fakes his own death and manages to escape his makeshift prison cell. He runs to the garage, (where his car is being repaired) and drives off in it much to his family's horror. However, while driving the car, he sees his daughter Lily in the road and swerves the car and flips over in it. Gary Windass attempted to save Lily but they both ended up trapped under it. When the two are pulled out, the car suddenly catches fire and left [[Anna Windass]] with severely injured legs after catching fire due to it spreading.\n\nIn March 2017, [[Ken Barlow]] is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant in a storyline dubbed [[Who Attacked Ken?]]. The main suspects were Ken's children [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter]], [[Tracy Barlow]] and [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]], his grandchildren [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] and [[Adam Barlow]], local builder and soap villain [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] and Daniel's girlfriend Sinead Tinker. The attacker was revealed in May 2017 to be Daniel. Daniel was offered a place at [[Oxford University]]. However, Sinead falls pregnant with his child and he decides to stay in Weatherfield to look after them. When Ken learns of this, he persuades Sinead to get an abortion. When Sinead reveals to Daniel about the abortion, he breaks up with Sinead and attacks Ken that night. Daniel is not arrested as Ken tells the police that he tripped and no one pushed him.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{main article|List of Coronation Street characters|List of past Coronation Street characters|List of Coronation Street actors}}\n[[File:Coronation street cast photo 1960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|Cast of ''Coronation Street'', 1960]]\n\nSince 1960, ''Coronation Street'' has featured many characters whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]) and [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]] ([[Doris Speed]]) as central figures.<ref>Little. (1995) p.7.</ref> These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became [[archetypes]] of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battle-axe and self-proclaimed moral voice.<ref>Tinker. p.38.</ref> Elsie was the [[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart]], who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love.<ref>Tinker. p.57.</ref> Annie Walker, landlady of the [[Rovers Return Inn]], had [[delusions of grandeur]] and saw herself as better than other residents of ''Coronation Street''.<ref>Tinker. p.40.</ref>\n\n''Coronation Street'' became known for the portrayal of strong female characters,<ref>Geraghty, Christine. ''Women and Soap Opera'', Polity Press, London, 1991. ({{ISBN|978-0-7456-0568-5}})</ref> including original cast characters like Ena, Annie and Elsie, and [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]), who first appeared in 1964; who became household names during the 1960s.<ref>Little. (2000) p.5.</ref> Warren's programme was largely matriarchal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up.<ref>{{cite web |first = Will |last = Hadcroft |title = Daran Little interview |url = http://www.corrie.net/profiles/interviews/little.html |work = Corrie.net |accessdate =22 February 2007}}</ref> Consequently, the show has a long tradition of psychologically abused husbands, most famously [[Stan Ogden]] ([[Bernard Youens]]) and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]), husbands of Hilda and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]), respectively.\n\n[[File:Coronation street 50th anniversary 2010 cast photo.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3636364|Cast at the 50th Anniversary of ''Coronation Street'', 2010]]\nKen Barlow (William Roache) entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]] and the model [[Twiggy]] were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]), another character from the first episode, returned to ''Coronation Street'' after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow has been the show's only remaining original character. Emily Bishop ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) had appeared in the series since late-January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and was the show's longest-serving female character before she departed on 1 January 2016. Rita Tanner ([[Barbara Knox]]) appeared on the show for one episode in December 1964, before returning as a full time cast member in January 1972. She is currently the second longest serving original cast member on the show.\n\nStan and Hilda Ogden were introduced in 1964, with Hilda becoming one of the most famous British soap opera characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, she was voted fourth-most recognisable woman in Britain, after [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].<ref>Little. (1995) p.188.</ref> Hilda's best-known attributes were her [[pinny]], hair curlers, and the \"muriel\" in her [[living room]] with three \"flying\" duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden's departure on Christmas Day 1987, remains the highest-rated episode of ''Coronation Street'' ever, with nearly 27,000,000 viewers. Stan Ogden had been killed off in 1984 following the death of actor [[Bernard Youens]] after a long illness which had restricted his appearances towards the end.<ref>{{cite news |first = Dennis |last = Barker |title = Obituary: Leslie Duxbury |url = https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1635800,00.html |work = The Guardian |date = 7 November 2005 |accessdate =2 September 2006 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n[[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and went on to become one of the most famous ''Corrie'' characters.<ref>Little.

[[Phyllis Pearce]] ([[Jill Summers]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) and [[Sylvia Goodwin]] ([[Stephanie Cole]]) embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena, [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) has grown snobbish, like Annie, and a number of the programme's female characters, such as [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), mirror the vulnerability of Elsie and Bet. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]) and [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]), the bumbling retail manager like [[Leonard Swindley]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]), [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), [[Tommy Harris (Coronation Street)|Tommy Harris]] ([[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]) and [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]).<ref name=\"littlepg7\">Little. (1998) p.7.</ref>\n\nVillains are also common character types such as [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), [[Jenny Bradley]] ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]), [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]), [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]), [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]), [[Caz Hammond]] ([[Rhea Bailey]]), [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), [[Greg Kelly (Coronation Street)|Greg Kelly]] ([[Stephen Billington]]), [[Will Chatterton]] ([[Leon Ockenden]]), [[Nathan Curtis (Coronation Street)|Nathan Curtis]] ([[Christopher Harper (actor)|Christopher Harper]]), [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward), [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]), [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre), [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]), [[Maya Sharma]] ([[Sasha Behar]]), [[Kirsty Soames]] ([[Natalie Gumede]]) and [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]). The show's former archivist and scriptwriter [[Daran Little]] disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. \"Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others. were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it's because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied ''Coronation Street''.\"<ref name=\"littlepg7\">Little. (1998) p.7.</ref>\n\n== Storylines ==\n{{Main article|Storylines of Coronation Street}}\nOver the show's history, ''Coronation Street'' has highlighted a wide range of different social issues, including [[rape]], [[cancer]], [[HIV]], [[incest]], [[Compulsive hoarding|hoarding]], [[stillbirth]], [[murder]], [[suicide]], [[arson]], [[hit-and-run]], [[miscarriage]], [[adultery]], [[euthanasia]], [[homosexuality]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[epilepsy]], [[osteoporosis]], [[childhood cancer]], [[domestic violence]], [[post traumatic stress disorder]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[Problem gambling|gambling addiction]], widowers moving onto other relationships, [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome|ehlers\u2013danlos syndrome]], [[brain aneurysm]], [[drink driving]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[alzheimer's disease]], families terrorised by thugs, financial problems, [[Parental abuse by children|parental abuse]], [[identity theft]], [[Grief|bereavement]], [[terminal illness]], [[post-natal depression]], [[abortion]], [[perjury]], [[adoption]], [[premature birth]], [[foster care|fostering]], [[surrogacy]], [[prostitution]], [[sexual exploitation]], [[child grooming]] and [[revenge porn]].\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Broadcast format ===\nBetween 9 December 1960 and 3 March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday.<ref name=\"littlepg10\"/> During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15&nbsp;minutes later.<ref name = \"xvvlbv\">Kershaw. p.30.</ref> When the programme went fully networked on 6 March 1961, broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday.<ref name=\"littlepg10\">Little. (2000) p.10.</ref> The last regular episode to be shown live was broadcast on 3 February 1961.\n\nThe series was transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.\n\nDaran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969.<ref>Little. (2000) p.58.</ref> The ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969 and it is therefore possible that the first transmitted colour episode is number 928 shown on 17 November.\n\nIn October 1970 a technicians' dispute turned into a [[work-to-rule]] when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including ''Coronation Street''<ref>Richard Marson. \"Inside Updown&nbsp;\u2013 the story of \"Upstairs Downstairs\". Kaleidoscope publishing 2001. p.50.</ref> The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 8 February 1971.\n\nEpisode 5191, originally broadcast on 7 January 2002, was the first to be broadcast in [[16:9]] widescreen format. ''Coronation Street'' was the last British soap to make the switch to 16:9 (''[[Take the High Road]]'' remained in [[4:3]] until it finished in 2003).\n\nFrom 22 March 2010, ''Coronation Street'' was produced in 1080/50i for transmission on HDTV platforms on [[ITV HD]]. The first transmission in this format was episode 7351 on 31 May 2010 with a new set of titles and re-recorded theme tune. On 26 May 2010 ITV previewed the new HD titles on the ''Coronation Street'' website.

The son of the popular Roman general [[Germanicus]] and [[Augustus]]' granddaughter [[Agrippina the Elder]], Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the [[Roman Empire]], conventionally known as the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Germanicus' uncle and adoptive father, [[Tiberius]], succeeded Augustus as emperor of [[Rome]] in AD 14.\n\nAlthough he was born '''Gaius Caesar''', after [[Julius Caesar]], he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" (meaning \"little soldier's boot\", the diminutive form of ''[[Caligae|caliga]]'') from his father's soldiers during their campaign in [[Germania]]. When Germanicus died at [[Antioch]] in AD 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Untouched by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted an invitation in AD 31 to join the emperor on the island of [[Capri]], where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier. Following the death of Tiberius, Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in AD 37.\n\nThere are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, although he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane [[tyrant]]. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the [[principate]]. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] in Rome: the [[Aqua Claudia]] and the [[Anio Novus]]. During his reign, the empire annexed the [[Client state|client kingdom]] of [[Mauretania]] as a [[Roman Mauretania|province]].\n\nIn early AD 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Roman Senate|senators]], and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the [[Roman Republic]] was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, [[Claudius]], the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of his nephew [[Nero]] in AD 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the [[Julii Caesares]] in the male line.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}\n:''See [[Julio-Claudian family tree]].''\n[[File:Caligae from side.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[Caligae|caliga]]''.]]\n[[File:Cropped color calligula.jpg|thumb|A marble bust of Caligula restored to its original colours.

The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both the Senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators, who included [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 30)|Marcus Vinicius]] and [[Lucius Annius Vinicianus]], to put their plot into action quickly.\n[[File:CaligulaPallazzoMassimoRoma.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Caligula from Palazzo Massimo in Rome]]\nAccording to Josephus, Chaerea had political motivations for the assassination.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.6]].</ref> Suetonius sees the motive in Caligula calling Chaerea derogatory names.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].</ref> Caligula considered Chaerea effeminate because of a weak voice and for not being firm with tax collection.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.5]].</ref> Caligula would mock Chaerea with names like \"[[Priapus]]\" and \"[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]\".<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 41 AD (Suetonius gives the date as 24 January), Cassius Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula as he addressed an acting troupe of young men beneath the palace, during a series of games and dramatics being held for the Divine Augustus.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].</ref> Details recorded on the events vary somewhat from source to source, but they agree that Chaerea stabbed Caligula first, followed by a number of conspirators.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]].</ref> Suetonius records that Caligula's death resembled that of [[Julius Caesar]].

He was buried within the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]; in 410, during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]], the ashes in the tomb were scattered.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Historiography===\n[[File:Cor-aabr001903.jpg|upright|thumb|Fanciful renaissance depiction of Caligula]]\nThe history of Caligula's reign is extremely problematic as only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived \u2014 the works of [[Philo]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Philo's works, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' and ''Flaccus'', give some details on Caligula's early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in AD 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.19.</ref>\n\nAt one time, there were detailed contemporaneous histories on Caligula, but they are now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.1.</ref> Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Cluvius Rufus]] both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus was a friend of Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation.<ref>Tacitus, ''Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola'' X, ''Annals'' XIII.20.</ref> Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.13.</ref>\n\nCaligula's sister, [[Agrippina the Younger]], wrote an autobiography that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Lepidus]], who conspired against him.<ref name=\"dio-caligula-22\" /> The inheritance of [[Nero]], Agrippina's son and the future emperor, was seized by Caligula. [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus|Gaetulicus]], a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they are lost.\n\nThe bulk of what is known of Caligula comes from [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]]. Suetonius wrote his history on Caligula 80 years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 180 years after Caligula's death. Cassius Dio's work is invaluable because it alone gives a loose chronology of Caligula's reign.\n\nA handful of other sources add a limited perspective on Caligula. [[Josephus]] gives a detailed description of Caligula's assassination. [[Tacitus]] provides some information on Caligula's life under [[Tiberius]]. In a now lost portion of his ''Annals'', Tacitus gave a detailed history of Caligula. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' has a few brief references to Caligula.\n\nThere are few surviving sources on Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favourable light. The paucity of sources has resulted in significant gaps in modern knowledge of the reign of Caligula. Little is written on the first two years of Caligula's reign. Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of [[Mauretania]], Caligula's military actions in [[Britannia]], and his feud with the [[Roman Senate]].\n\n===Health===\nAll surviving sources, except [[Pliny the Elder]], characterize Caligula as insane. However, it is not known whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for his behavior, citing as possibilities [[encephalitis]], [[epilepsy]] or [[meningitis]].<ref name=sidwell/> The question of whether or not Caligula was insane (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.<ref name=sidwell>{{cite journal|last1=Sidwell|first1=Barbara|title=Gaius Caligula's Mental Illness|journal=Classical World|date=18 March 2010|volume=103|issue=2|pages=183\u2013206|doi=10.1353/clw.0.0165|pmid=20213971|issn=1558-9234}}</ref>\n\n[[Philo of Alexandria]], [[Josephus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] state that Caligula was insane, but describe this madness as a personality trait that came through experience.<ref name=\"josephus-antiquities-18-7-2\" /><ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' XIII.</ref><ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVIII.1; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.</ref> Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once he became emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVII\u2013XVIII; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.</ref> According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him to think he was a god.<ref name=\"josephus-antiquities-18-7-2\" /> [[Philo of Alexandria]] reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' II\u2013IV.</ref> [[Juvenal]] reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.\n\n[[Suetonius]] said that Caligula suffered from \"falling sickness\", or [[epilepsy]], when he was young.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Benediktson|first1=D.

It states that a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on the [[natural numbers]] is computable by a human being following an algorithm, ignoring resource limitations, if and only if it is computable by a [[Turing machine]]. The thesis is named after American mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] and the British mathematician [[Alan Turing]]. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term [[effectively calculable]] to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to [[formal system|formalize]] the notion of [[computability]]:\n\n* In 1933, Austrian-American mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]], with [[Jacques Herbrand]], created a formal definition of a class called [[\u03bc-recursive function|general recursive functions]]. The class of general recursive functions is the smallest class of functions (possibly with more than one argument) which includes all [[constant function]]s, projections, the [[successor function]], and which is closed under [[function composition]], [[recursion]], and [[\u03bc operator|minimization]].\n* In 1936, [[Alonzo Church]] created a method for defining functions called the [[Lambda calculus|\u03bb-calculus]]. Within \u03bb-calculus, he defined an encoding of the natural numbers called the [[Church numerals]]. A function on the natural numbers is called [[Lambda-recursive function|\u03bb-computable]] if the corresponding function on the Church numerals can be represented by a term of the \u03bb-calculus.\n* Also in 1936, before learning of Church's work, [[Alan Turing]] created a theoretical model for machines, now called Turing machines, that could carry out calculations from inputs by manipulating symbols on a tape. Given a suitable encoding of the natural numbers as sequences of symbols, a function on the natural numbers is called [[computable function|Turing computable]] if some Turing machine computes the corresponding function on encoded natural numbers.\n\nChurch<ref>Church 1934:90 footnote in Davis 1952</ref> and Turing<ref>Turing 1936\u20137 in Davis 1952:149</ref> proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is \u03bb-computable if and only if it is Turing computable if and only if it is ''general recursive''. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see [[Church\u2013Turing thesis#Success of the thesis|below]]).\n\nOn the other hand, the Church\u2013Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the ''informal'' notion of an effectively calculable function. Since, as an informal notion, the concept of effective calculability does not have a formal definition, the thesis, although it has near-universal acceptance, cannot be formally proven.\n\nSince its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe ([[physical Church-Turing thesis]]) and what can be efficiently computed ([[#complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church\u2013Turing thesis (complexity theory)]]). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[digital physics]]. The thesis also has implications for the [[philosophy of mind]] (see [[Church\u2013Turing thesis#Philosophical implications|below]]).\n\n==Statement in Church's and Turing's words==\n{{See also|Effectively calculable}}\n\n{{harvs|txt=yes|author-link=J. Barkley Rosser|first=J. B.|last=Rosser|date=1939}} addresses the notion of \"effective computability\" as follows: \"Clearly the existence of CC and RC (Church's and Rosser's proofs) presupposes a precise definition of 'effective'. '[[Effective method]]' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps\".<ref>{{harvnb|Rosser|1939}} in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=225}}.</ref> Thus the adverb-adjective \"effective\" is used in a sense of \"1a: producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect\", and \"capable of producing a result\".<ref>{{cite dictionary|entry=effective|dictionary=Merriam Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary|edition=9th}}</ref><ref>See also {{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/effective |entry=effective |dictionary=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |edition=11th |access-date=July 26, 2014|postscript=,}} which also gives these definitions for \"effective\" \u2013 the first [\"producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect\"] as the definition for sense \"1a\" of the word \"effective\", and the second [\"capable of producing a result\"] as part of the \"Synonym Discussion of EFFECTIVE\" there, (in the introductory part, where it summarizes the similarities between the meanings of the words \"effective\", \"effectual\", \"efficient\", and \"efficacious\").</ref>\n\nIn the following, the words \"effectively calculable\" will mean \"produced by any intuitively 'effective' means whatsoever\" and \"effectively computable\" will mean \"produced by a Turing-machine or equivalent mechanical device\". Turing's \"definitions\" given in a footnote in his 1939 Ph.D. thesis ''[[Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals]]'', supervised by Church, are virtually the same:\n<blockquote>{{sup|\u2020}} We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and let \"effectively calculable\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions.<ref name=Turing_1939_thesis_p8>{{cite thesis |first=A.M. |last=Turing |date=1939 |url=https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/jedwards/Turing%20Centennial%202012/Mudd%20Archive%20files/12285_AC100_Turing_1938.pdf |format=PDF |title=Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals |type=PhD |publisher=Princeton University |page=8 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe thesis can be stated as: ''Every effectively calculable function is a computable function''.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Gandy|1980|p=123}} states it this way: ''What is effectively calculable is computable.'' He calls this \"Church's Thesis\".</ref>\n\nTuring stated it this way:\n<blockquote>It was stated&nbsp;... that \"a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process\". We may take this literally, understanding that by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. The development&nbsp;... leads to&nbsp;... an identification of computability{{sup|\u2020}} with effective calculability. [{{sup|\u2020}} is the footnote quoted above.]<ref name=Turing_1939_thesis_p8/></blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Church\u2013Turing thesis}}\n\nOne of the important problems for logicians in the 1930s was [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Entscheidungsproblem]], which asked whether there was a mechanical procedure for separating mathematical truths from mathematical falsehoods. This quest required that the notion of \"algorithm\" or \"effective calculability\" be pinned down, at least well enough for the quest to begin.<ref>Davis's commentary before Church 1936 ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' in Davis 1965:88. Church uses the words \"effective calculability\" on page 100ff.</ref> But from the very outset [[Alonzo Church]]'s attempts began with a debate that continues to this day.<ref>In his review of ''Church's Thesis after 70 Years'' edited by Adam Olszewski et al. 2006, Peter Smith's criticism of a paper by Muraswski and Wolenski suggests 4 \"lines\" re the status of the Church\u2013Turing Thesis: (1) empirical hypothesis (2) axiom or theorem, (3) definition, (4) explication. But Smith opines that (4) is indistinguishable from (3), cf Smith (July 11, 2007) ''Church's Thesis after 70 Years'' at http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/CTT.pdf</ref> Was the notion of \"effective calculability\" to be (i) an \"axiom or axioms\" in an axiomatic system, (ii) merely a ''definition'' that \"identified\" two or more propositions, (iii) an ''empirical hypothesis'' to be verified by observation of natural events, or (iv) just ''a proposal'' for the sake of argument (i.e. a \"thesis\").\n\n=== Circa 1930\u20131952 ===\nIn the course of studying the problem, Church and his student [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] introduced the notion of [[Lambda calculus|\u03bb-definable functions]], and they were able to prove that several large classes of functions frequently encountered in number theory were \u03bb-definable.<ref>cf footnote 3 in {{harvnb|Church|1936a}} ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=89}}.</ref> The debate began when Church proposed to G\u00f6del that one should define the \"effectively computable\" functions as the \u03bb-definable functions. G\u00f6del, however, was not convinced and called the proposal \"thoroughly unsatisfactory\".<ref>Dawson 1997:99.{{Full citation needed|date=November 2017}}</ref> Rather, in correspondence with Church (c. 1934\u201335), G\u00f6del proposed ''axiomatizing'' the notion of \"effective calculability\"; indeed, in a 1935 letter to Kleene, Church reported that:\n\n{{quote|His [G\u00f6del's] only idea at the time was that it might be possible, in terms of effective calculability as an undefined notion, to state a set of axioms which would embody the generally accepted properties of this notion, and to do something on that basis.<ref name=\"sieg160\"/>}}\n\nBut G\u00f6del offered no further guidance. Eventually, he would suggest his recursion, modified by Herbrand's suggestion, that G\u00f6del had detailed in his 1934 lectures in Princeton NJ (Kleene and [[J. B. Rosser|Rosser]] transcribed the notes). But he did not think that the two ideas could be satisfactorily identified \"except heuristically\".<ref>Sieg 1997:160 quoting from the 1935 letter written by Church to Kleene, cf Footnote 3 in G\u00f6del 1934 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=44}}.</ref>\n\nNext, it was necessary to identify and prove the equivalence of two notions of effective calculability. Equipped with the \u03bb-calculus and \"general\" recursion, [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] with help of Church and [[J. Barkley Rosser]] produced proofs (1933, 1935) to show that the two calculi are equivalent. Church subsequently modified his methods to include use of Herbrand\u2013G\u00f6del recursion and then proved (1936) that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is unsolvable: there is no generalized algorithm that can determine whether a [[well formed formula]] has a \"normal form\".<ref>cf. Church 1936 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=105ff}}.</ref>\n\nMany years later in a letter to Davis (c. 1965), G\u00f6del said that \"he was, at the time of these [1934] lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions\".<ref>Davis's commentary before G\u00f6del 1934 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=40}}.</ref> By 1963\u201364 G\u00f6del would disavow Herbrand\u2013G\u00f6del recursion and the \u03bb-calculus in favor of the Turing machine as the definition of \"algorithm\" or \"mechanical procedure\" or \"formal system\".<ref>For a detailed discussion of G\u00f6del's adoption of Turing's machines as models of computation, see {{cite web |author=Shagrir |date= |url=http://moon.cc.huji.ac.il/oron-shagrir/papers/Goedel_on_Turing_on_Computability.pdf |format=PDF |title=Goedel on Turing on Computability |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217145831/http://moon.cc.huji.ac.il/oron-shagrir/papers/Goedel_on_Turing_on_Computability.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-17 }}{{date missing}}</ref>\n\n'''A hypothesis leading to a natural law?''': In late 1936 [[Alan Turing]]'s paper (also proving that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is unsolvable) was delivered orally, but had not yet appeared in print.<ref name=\"On Computable\">{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}.</ref> On the other hand, [[Emil Post]]'s 1936 paper had appeared and was certified independent of Turing's work.<ref>cf.

[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] (1952) adds to the list the functions \"''reckonable'' in the system S<sub>1</sub>\" of [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] 1936, and [[Emil Post]]'s (1943, 1946) \"''canonical'' [also called ''normal''] ''systems''\".<ref>Kleene 1952:320</ref> In the 1950s [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] and [[Martin Davis]] greatly simplified the one-tape Turing-machine model (see [[Post\u2013Turing machine]]). [[Marvin Minsky]] expanded the model to two or more tapes and greatly simplified the tapes into \"up-down counters\", which Melzak and [[Joachim Lambek|Lambek]] further evolved into what is now known as the [[counter machine]] model. In the late 1960s and early 1970s researchers expanded the counter machine model into the [[register machine]], a close cousin to the modern notion of the [[computer]]. Other models include [[combinatory logic]] and [[Markov algorithm]]s. Gurevich adds the [[pointer machine]] model of Kolmogorov and Uspensky (1953, 1958): \"...&nbsp;they just wanted to&nbsp;... convince themselves that there is no way to extend the notion of computable function.\"<ref>Gurevich 1988:2</ref>\n\nAll these contributions involve proofs that the models are computationally equivalent to the Turing machine; such models are said to be [[Turing complete]]. Because all these different attempts at formalizing the concept of \"effective calculability/computability\" have yielded equivalent results, it is now generally assumed that the Church\u2013Turing thesis is correct. In fact, G\u00f6del (1936) proposed something stronger than this; he observed that there was something \"absolute\" about the concept of \"reckonable in S<sub>1</sub>\":\n\n{{quote|It may also be shown that a function which is computable ['reckonable'] in one of the systems S<sub>i</sub>, or even in a system of transfinite type, is already computable [reckonable] in S<sub>1</sub>.

Modern mathematicians instead use the well-defined term ''Turing computable'' (or ''computable'' for short). Since the undefined terminology has faded from use, the question of how to define it is now less important.-->\n\n== Informal usage in proofs ==\n\nProofs in computability theory often invoke the Church\u2013Turing thesis in an informal way to establish the computability of functions while avoiding the (often very long) details which would be involved in a rigorous, formal proof.<ref>Horsten in {{harvcolnb|Olszewski|2006|p=256}}.</ref> To establish that a function is computable by Turing machine, it is usually considered sufficient to give an informal English description of how the function can be effectively computed, and then conclude \"by the Church\u2013Turing thesis\" that the function is Turing computable (equivalently, partial recursive).\n\nDirk van Dalen gives the following example for the sake of illustrating this informal use of the Church\u2013Turing thesis:<ref>{{harvcolnb|Gabbay|2001|p=284}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|1=EXAMPLE: Each infinite [[recursively enumerable|RE]] set contains an infinite [[recursive set]].\n\nProof: Let A be infinite RE. We list the elements of A effectively, n<sub>0</sub>, n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>, ...\n\nFrom this list we extract an increasing sublist: put m<sub>0</sub>=n<sub>0</sub>, after finitely many steps we find an n<sub>k</sub> such that n<sub>k</sub> > m<sub>0</sub>, put m<sub>1</sub>=n<sub>k</sub>. We repeat this procedure to find m<sub>2</sub> > m<sub>1</sub>, etc. this yields an effective listing of the subset B={m<sub>0</sub>,m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>,...} of A, with the property m<sub>i</sub> < m<sub>i+1</sub>.\n\n''Claim''. B is decidable. For, in order to test k in B we must check if k=m<sub>i</sub> for some i. Since the sequence of m<sub>i</sub>'s is increasing we have to produce at most k+1 elements of the list and compare them with k. If none of them is equal to k, then k not in B. Since this test is effective, B is decidable and, '''by Church's thesis''', recursive.}}\n\nIn order to make the above example completely rigorous, one would have to carefully construct a Turing machine, or \u03bb-function, or carefully invoke recursion axioms, or at best, cleverly invoke various theorems of computability theory. But because the computability theorist believes that Turing computability correctly captures what can be computed effectively, and because an effective procedure is spelled out in English for deciding the set B, the computability theorist accepts this as proof that the set is indeed recursive.\n\n== Variations ==\nThe success of the Church\u2013Turing thesis prompted variations of the thesis to be proposed. For example, the '''physical Church\u2013Turing thesis''' states: \"All physically computable functions are Turing-computable.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author-link=Gualtiero Piccinini |last=Piccinini |first=Gualtiero |date=January 2007 |url=http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/Computationalism_Church-Turing_Thesis_Church-Turing_Fallacy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Computationalism, the Church\u2013Turing Thesis, and the Church\u2013Turing Fallacy |doi=10.1007/s11229-005-0194-z |journal=Synthese |volume=154 |issue=1 |pages=97\u2013120 }}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\n{{anchor|complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis}}The Church\u2013Turing thesis says nothing about the efficiency with which one model of computation can simulate another.

It states:<ref name=kaye>{{cite book |first1=Phillip |last1=Kaye |first2=Raymond |last2=Laflamme |first3=Michele |last3=Mosca |title=An introduction to quantum computing |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2007 |isbn=0-19-857049-X |pages=5\u20136 }}</ref> \"A [[probabilistic Turing machine]] can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation.\" The word 'efficiently' here means up to [[polynomial-time reduction]]s. This thesis was originally called '''computational complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis''' by Ethan Bernstein and [[Umesh Vazirani]] (1997). The complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis, then, posits that all 'reasonable' models of computation yield the same class of problems that can be computed in polynomial time. Assuming the conjecture that probabilistic polynomial time ([[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]) equals deterministic polynomial time ([[P (complexity)|P]]), the word 'probabilistic' is optional in the complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis. A similar thesis, called the '''invariance thesis''', was introduced by Cees F. Slot and Peter van Emde Boas. It states: {{\"'}}Reasonable' machines can simulate each other within a polynomially bounded overhead in time and a constant-factor overhead in space.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=van Emde Boas |chapter=Machine Models and Simulations |title=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science A |publisher=Elsevier |date=1990 |page=5 }}</ref> The thesis originally appeared in a paper at [[STOC]]'84, which was the first paper to show that polynomial-time overhead and constant-space overhead could be ''simultaneously'' achieved for a simulation of a [[Random Access Machine]] on a Turing machine.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=C. |last1=Slot |first2=P. |last2=van Emde Boas |title=On tape versus core: an application of space efficient perfect hash functions to the invariance of space |conference=[[STOC]] |date=December 1984 }}</ref>\n\nIf [[BQP]] is shown to be a strict superset of [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]], it would invalidate the complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis. In other words, there would be efficient [[quantum algorithms]] that perform tasks that do not have efficient [[probabilistic algorithms]]. This would not however invalidate the original Church\u2013Turing thesis, since a quantum computer can always be simulated by a Turing machine, but it would invalidate the classical complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis for efficiency reasons. Consequently, the '''quantum complexity-theoretic Church\u2013Turing thesis''' states:<ref name=kaye/> \"A [[quantum Turing machine]] can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation.\"\n\nEugene Eberbach and Peter Wegner claim that the Church\u2013Turing thesis is sometimes interpreted too broadly,\nstating \"the broader assertion that algorithms precisely capture what can be computed is invalid\".<ref>{{harvnb|Eberbach|Wegner|2003}}.</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2017}} They claim that forms of computation not captured by the thesis are relevant today,\nterms which they call [[hypercomputation|super-Turing computation]].\n\n==Philosophical implications==\nPhilosophers have interpreted the Church\u2013Turing thesis as having implications for the [[philosophy of mind]].<ref>{{Cite SEP |last=Copeland |first=B.

When applied to physics, the thesis has several possible meanings:\n\n#The universe is equivalent to a Turing machine; thus, computing [[recursion (computer science)|non-recursive functions]] is physically impossible. This has been termed the strong Church\u2013Turing thesis, or [[Church\u2013Turing\u2013Deutsch principle]], and is a foundation of [[digital physics]].\n#The universe is not equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e., the laws of physics are not Turing-computable), but incomputable physical events are not \"harnessable\" for the construction of a [[hypercomputation|hypercomputer]]. For example, a universe in which physics involves random [[real numbers]], as opposed to [[computable number|computable real]]s, would fall into this category.\n#The universe is a [[hypercomputation|hypercomputer]], and it is possible to build physical devices to harness this property and calculate non-recursive functions. For example, it is an open question whether all [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] events are Turing-computable, although it is known that rigorous models such as quantum Turing machines are equivalent to deterministic Turing machines. (They are not necessarily efficiently equivalent; see above.) [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] and [[Roger Penrose]] have suggested that the human mind might be the result of some kind of quantum-mechanically enhanced, \"non-algorithmic\" computation.<ref>cf {{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Penrose |date=1990 |chapter=Algorithms and Turing machines <!--|section=The Church\u2013Turing Thesis--> |pages=47\u201349 |title=[[The Emperor's New Mind|The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |oclc=456785846 |isbn=0-19-851973-7 }}</ref><ref>Also the description of \"the non-algorithmic nature of mathematical insight\", {{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Penrose |date=1990 |chapter=Where lies the physics of mind? |pages=416\u2013418 |title=[[The Emperor's New Mind|The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |oclc=456785846 |isbn=0-19-851973-7 }}</ref>\n\nThere are many other technical possibilities which fall outside or between these three categories, but these serve to illustrate the range of the concept.\n\n== Non-computable functions ==\n{{One source section|date=November 2017}}\nOne can formally define functions that are not computable. A well-known example of such a function is the [[Busy Beaver]] function. This function takes an input ''n'' and returns the largest number of symbols that a [[Turing machine]] with ''n'' states can print before halting, when run with no input. Finding an upper bound on the busy beaver function is equivalent to solving the [[halting problem]], a problem known to be unsolvable by Turing machines. Since the busy beaver function cannot be computed by Turing machines, the Church\u2013Turing thesis states that this function cannot be effectively computed by any method.\n\nSeveral computational models allow for the computation of (Church-Turing) non-computable functions. These are known as\n[[hypercomputation|hypercomputers]].\nMark Burgin argues that [[super-recursive algorithm]]s such as inductive Turing machines disprove the Church\u2013Turing thesis.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burgin |first=Mark |date=2005 |title=Super-Recursive Algorithms |series=Monographs in Computer Science |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=0-387-95569-0 |oclc=990755791 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2017}} His argument relies on a definition of algorithm broader than the ordinary one, so that non-computable functions obtained from some inductive Turing machines are called computable. This interpretation of the Church\u2013Turing thesis differs from the interpretation commonly accepted in computability theory, discussed above. The argument that super-recursive algorithms are indeed algorithms in the sense of the Church\u2013Turing thesis has not found broad acceptance within the computability research community.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abstract machine]]\n*[[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Church's thesis in constructive mathematics]]\n*[[Church\u2013Turing\u2013Deutsch principle]], which states that every [[physical process]] can be simulated by a universal computing device\n*[[Computability logic]]\n*[[Computability theory (computation)|Computability theory]]\n*[[Decidability (logic)|Decidability]]\n*[[Hypercomputer]]\n*[[Model of computation]]\n*[[Oracle (computer science)]]\n*[[Super-recursive algorithm]]\n*[[Turing completeness]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-link=Jon Barwise |editor1-last=Barwise |editor1-first=Jon |editor2-link=H.

New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end. As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) and [[main memory]]. Multitasking automatically interrupts the running program, saving its state (partial results, memory contents and computer register contents) and loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it. This \"[[context switch]]\" may be initiated at fixed time intervals (pre-emptive multitasking), or the running program may be coded to signal to the supervisory software when it can be interrupted (cooperative multitasking). \n\nMultitasking does not require [[Parallel computing|parallel execution]] of multiple tasks at exactly the same time; instead, it allows more than one task to advance over a given period of time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Concurrency vs Parallelism, Concurrent Programming vs Parallel Programming |url=https://blogs.oracle.com/yuanlin/entry/concurrency_vs_parallelism_concurrent_programming |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref>  Even on [[multiprocessor]] computers, multitasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are CPUs.\n\nMultitasking is a common feature of computer operating systems.  It allows more efficient use of the computer hardware; where a program is waiting for some external event such as a user input or an [[input/output]] transfer with a peripheral to complete, the central processor can still be used with another program. In a [[time sharing]] system, multiple human operators use the same processor as if it was dedicated to their use, while behind the scenes the computer is serving many users by multitasking their individual programs. In [[multiprogramming]] systems, a task runs until it must wait for an external event or until the operating system's [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] forcibly swaps the running task out of the CPU. [[Real-time computing|Real-time]] systems such as those designed to control industrial robots, require timely processing; a single processor might be shared between calculations of machine movement, communications, and user interface.  <ref>Anthony Ralston, Edwin D. Reilly (ed),''Encyclopedia of Computer Science Third Edition'', Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, {{ISBN|0-442-27679-6}}, articles \"Multitasking\" and \"Multiprogramming\"  </ref>\n\nOften multitasking operating systems include measures to change the priority of individual tasks, so that important jobs receive more processor time than those considered less significant. Depending on the operating system, a task might be as large as an entire application program, or might be made up of smaller [[thread (computing)|threads]] that carry out portions of the overall program. \n\nA processor intended for use with multitasking operating systems may include special hardware to securely support multiple tasks, such as [[memory protection]], and [[protection ring]]s that ensure the supervisory software cannot be damaged or subverted by user-mode program errors.  \n\nThe term \"multitasking\" has become an international term, as the same word is used in many other languages such as German, Italian, Dutch, Danish and Norwegian.\n\n== Multiprogramming ==\nIn the early days of computing, [[CPU time]] was expensive, and [[peripheral]]s were very slow. When the computer ran a program that needed access to a peripheral, the central processing unit (CPU) would have to stop executing program instructions while the peripheral processed the data. This was usually very inefficient.\n\nThe first computer using a multiprogramming system was the British ''[[LEO (computer)#Applications and successors|Leo III]]'' owned by [[J. Lyons and Co.]] During [[batch processing]], several different programs were loaded in the computer memory, and the first one began to run. When the first program reached an instruction waiting for a peripheral, the context of this program was stored away, and the second program in memory was given a chance to run. The process continued until all programs finished running.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe use of multiprogramming was enhanced by the arrival of [[virtual memory]] and [[virtual machine]] technology, which enabled individual programs to make use of memory and operating system resources as if other concurrently running programs were, for all practical purposes, non-existent and invisible to them.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nMultiprogramming doesn't give any guarantee that a program will run in a timely manner. Indeed, the very first program may very well run for hours without needing access to a peripheral. As there were no users waiting at an interactive terminal, this was no problem: users handed in a deck of punched cards to an operator, and came back a few hours later for printed results. Multiprogramming greatly reduced wait times when multiple batches were being processed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== {{Anchor|COOP|Cooperative multitasking/time-sharing}}Cooperative multitasking ==\n{{Main|Cooperative multitasking}}\n\nEarly multitasking systems used applications that voluntarily ceded time to one another. This approach, which was eventually supported by many computer [[operating system]]s, is known today as cooperative multitasking. Although it is now rarely used in larger systems except for specific applications such as [[CICS]] or the [[JES2]] subsystem, cooperative multitasking was once the only scheduling scheme employed by [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Classic Mac OS]] to enable multiple applications to run simultaneously.  Cooperative multitasking is still used today on [[RISC OS]] systems.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.riscos.info/index.php/Preemptive_multitasking\n |title = Preemptive multitasking\n |date = 2009-11-03 |accessdate = 2014-07-27\n |website = riscos.info\n}}</ref>\n\nAs a cooperatively multitasked system relies on each process regularly giving up time to other processes on the system, one poorly designed program can consume all of the CPU time for itself, either by performing extensive calculations or by [[busy wait]]ing; both would cause the whole system to [[hang (computing)|hang]]. In a server environment, this is a hazard that makes the entire environment unacceptably fragile.\n\n== Preemptive multitasking ==\n{{Main|Preemption (computing)}}\n\nPreemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee to each process a regular \"slice\" of operating time. It also allows the system to deal rapidly with important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of one or another process.  Operating systems were developed to take advantage of these hardware capabilities and run multiple processes preemptively. Preemptive multitasking was implemented in [[TOPS-10|the PDP-6 Monitor]] and [[MULTICS]] in 1964, in [[OS/360 and successors#MFT|OS/360 MFT]] in 1967, and in [[Unix]] in 1969, and was available in [[PDP-8#Programming facilities|some operating systems]] for computers as small as DEC's PDP-8; it is a core feature of all [[Unix-like]] operating systems, such as [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] with its [[Comparison of BSD operating systems|derivatives]],<ref>{{Cite web\n | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/team/intro/unix/what.html\n | title = UNIX, Part One | work = The Digital Research Initiative\n | date = 2002-01-30 | accessdate = 2014-01-09\n | publisher = ibiblio.org\n}}</ref> as well as modern versions of Windows.\n\nAt any specific time, processes can be grouped into two categories: those that are waiting for input or output (called \"[[I/O bound]]\"), and those that are fully utilizing the CPU (\"[[CPU bound]]\"). In primitive systems, the software would often \"[[Polling (computer science)|poll]]\", or \"[[Busy waiting|busywait]]\" while waiting for requested input (such as disk, keyboard or network input). During this time, the system was not performing useful work. With the advent of interrupts and preemptive multitasking, I/O bound processes could be \"blocked\", or put on hold, pending the arrival of the necessary data, allowing other processes to utilize the CPU. As the arrival of the requested data would generate an interrupt, blocked processes could be guaranteed a timely return to execution.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe earliest preemptive multitasking OS available to home users was [[Sinclair QDOS]] on the [[Sinclair QL]], released in 1984, but very few people bought the machine. Commodore's powerful [[Amiga]], released the following year, was the first commercially successful home computer to use the technology, and its multimedia abilities make it a clear ancestor of contemporary multitasking personal computers. [[Microsoft]] made preemptive multitasking a core feature of their flagship operating system in the early 1990s when developing [[Windows NT 3.1]] and then [[Windows 95]]. It was later adopted on the Apple Macintosh by [[Mac OS X]] that, as a [[Unix-like]] operating system, uses preemptive multitasking for all native applications.\n\nA similar model is used in [[Windows 9x]] and the [[Windows NT|Windows NT family]], where native 32-bit applications are multitasked preemptively.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com:80/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F2005%2Fs1606%2F08s06%2F08s06.asp|magazine=[[Smart Computing]]|title=Windows 2000 &16-Bit Applications|volume=16|issue=6|pages=32\u201333|date=June 2006|author=Joseph Moran|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125104811/http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F2005%2Fs1606%2F08s06%2F08s06.asp|archive-date=January 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> 64-bit editions of Windows, both for the [[x86-64]] and [[Itanium]] architectures, no longer support legacy 16-bit applications, and thus provide preemptive multitasking for all supported applications.\n\n== Real time ==\nAnother reason for multitasking was in the design of [[real-time computing]] systems, where there are a number of possibly unrelated external activities needed to be controlled by a single processor system. In such systems a hierarchical interrupt system is coupled with process prioritization to ensure that key activities were given a greater share of available [[process time]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== Multithreading ==\nAs multitasking greatly improved the throughput of computers, programmers started to implement applications as sets of cooperating processes (e.&nbsp;g., one process gathering input data, one process processing input data, one process writing out results on disk). This, however, required some tools to allow processes to efficiently exchange data.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Thread (computer science)|Threads]] were born from the idea that the most efficient way for cooperating processes to exchange data would be to share their entire memory space. Thus, threads are effectively processes that run in the same memory context and share other resources with their [[parent process]]es, such as open files. Threads are described as ''lightweight processes'' because switching between threads does not involve changing the memory context.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4285.pdf\n | title = Linux Performance and Tuning Guidelines\n | date = April 25, 2008 | accessdate = March 1, 2015\n | author1 = Eduardo Ciliendo | author2 = Takechika Kunimasa\n | website = redbooks.ibm.com | publisher = [[IBM]]\n | format = PDF | page = 4\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.linfo.org/context_switch.html\n | title = Context Switch Definition\n | date = May 28, 2006 | accessdate = February 26, 2015\n | website = linfo.org\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.tldp.org/FAQ/Threads-FAQ/Types.html\n | title = What are threads (user/kernel)?\n | date = September 8, 1997 | accessdate = February 26, 2015\n | website = tldp.org\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile threads are scheduled preemptively, some operating systems provide a variant to threads, named ''[[Fiber (computer science)|fiber]]s'', that are scheduled cooperatively. On operating systems that do not provide fibers, an application may implement its own fibers using repeated calls to worker functions. Fibers are even more lightweight than threads, and somewhat easier to program with, although they tend to lose some or all of the benefits of threads on [[multiprocessing|machines with multiple processors]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nSome systems directly support [[Multithreading (computer hardware)|multithreading in hardware]].\n\n== Memory protection ==\n{{Main|Memory protection}}\n\nEssential to any multitasking system is to safely and effectively share access to system resources. Access to memory must be strictly managed to ensure that no process can inadvertently or deliberately read or write to memory locations outside the process's address space. This is done for the purpose of general system stability and data integrity, as well as data security.\n\nIn general, memory access management is a responsibility of the operating system kernel, in combination with hardware mechanisms that provide supporting functionalities, such as a [[memory management unit]] (MMU). If a process attempts to access a memory location outside its memory space, the MMU denies the request and signals the kernel to take appropriate actions; this usually results in forcibly terminating the offending process. Depending on the software and kernel design and the specific error in question, the user may receive an access violation error message such as \"segmentation fault\".\n\nIn a well designed and correctly implemented multitasking system, a given process can never directly access memory that belongs to another process. An exception to this rule is in the case of shared memory; for example, in the [[UNIX System V|System V]] inter-process communication mechanism the kernel allocates memory to be mutually shared by multiple processes. Such features are often used by database management software such as PostgreSQL.\n\nInadequate memory protection mechanisms, either due to flaws in their design or poor implementations, allow for security vulnerabilities that may be potentially exploited by malicious software.\n\n== Memory swapping ==\nUse of a [[Virtual memory|swap file]] or swap partition is a way for the operating system to provide more memory than is physically available by keeping portions of the primary memory in [[secondary storage]]. While multitasking and memory swapping are two completely unrelated techniques, they are very often used together, as swapping memory allows more tasks to be loaded at the same time.  Typically, a multitasking system allows another process to run when the running process hits a point where it has to wait for some portion of memory to be reloaded from secondary storage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kb.iu.edu/d/aagb|title=What is a swap file?|website=kb.iu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Programming ==\nProcesses that are entirely independent are not much trouble to program in a multitasking environment. Most of the complexity in multitasking systems comes from the need to share computer resources between tasks and to synchronize the operation of co-operating tasks.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nVarious [[concurrent computing]] techniques are used to avoid potential problems caused by multiple tasks attempting to access the same resource.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nBigger systems were sometimes built with a central processor(s) and some number of [[Channel I/O|I/O processors]], a kind of asymmetric [[multiprocessing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nOver the years, multitasking systems have been refined. Modern operating systems generally include detailed mechanisms for prioritizing processes, while [[symmetric multiprocessing]] has introduced new complexities and capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cis2.oc.ctc.edu/oc_apps/Westlund/xbook/xbook.php?unit=04&proc=page&numb=5|title=Operating Systems Architecture|website=cis2.oc.ctc.edu|access-date=2018-03-17}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Process state]]\n* [[Context switch|Task switching]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Operating System}}\n{{Parallel computing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Computer Multitasking}}\n[[Category:Concurrent computing]]\n[[Category:Operating system technology]]", "sha1": "paa05v5rykrwu2l1lmqu2f9uha9ezi3"}}, {"title": "Chiang Kai-shek", "ns": "0", "id": "6859", "revision": {"id": "866483809", "parentid": "866433830", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T16:32:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "Flyte35", "id": "3200868"}, "comment": "Undid revision 866413888 by [[Special:Contributions/CgHZZiMLo|CgHZZiMLo]] ([[User talk:CgHZZiMLo|talk]]) removing POV statements", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Chinese name|[[Jiang (surname)|Chiang]]}}\n{{stack begin}}\n{{Infobox president\n|honorific-prefix = [[Generalissimo]]\n|name = Chiang Kai-shek\n|native_name = {{nobold|\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63}}<br />{{nobold|\u8523\u4ecb\u77f3}}\n|native_name_lang = zh-hant\n| honorific-suffix        = {{small|[[Order of the Bath|GCB]] [[Order of Isabella the Catholic|gcYC]] [[Order of the Rajamitrabhorn|\u0e23.\u0e21.\u0e20]] [[Order of Sikatuna|GCS]] [[Philippine Legion of Honor|CCLH]] [[Legion of Merit|LOM]] [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|DSM]] }}\n|image = Jiang Jieshi2.jpg\n|caption = 1940 photo of Chiang Kai-shek in full military uniform.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> <!--Please do not add Chinese characters, the infobox is located above.-->31 October 1887 \u2013 5 April 1975), also [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as '''Chiang Chieh-shih''' or ''' Jiang Jieshi''' and known as '''Chiang Chungcheng''', was a politician and military leader who served as the [[President of the Republic of China|leader of the Republic of China]] between 1928 and 1975, first in [[mainland China]] until 1949 and then in exile in [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. He was recognized by much of the world as the head of the legitimate government of China until the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nChiang was an influential member of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party, as well as a close ally of [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s. Chiang became the [[Commandant]] of the Kuomintang's [[Whampoa Military Academy]] and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT following the [[Canton Coup]] in early 1926. Having neutralized the party's [[left wing]], Chiang then led Sun's long-postponed [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]], conquering or reaching accommodations with China's [[Warlord Era|many warlords]].<ref name=\"a\">{{Cite book |last = Zarrow |first = Peter Gue |year = 2005 |title = China in War and Revolution, 1895\u20131949 |pages = 230\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1928 to 1948, Chiang served as chairman of the [[Nationalist government|National Government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC). Chiang was [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], promoting [[traditional Chinese culture]] in the [[New Life Movement]]. Unable to maintain Sun's [[First United Front|good relations]] with the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), Chiang purged them in a [[Shanghai massacre|massacre at Shanghai]] and repressed uprisings at [[Guangzhou Uprising|Kwangtung]] and elsewhere.\n\nAt the onset of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which later became the Chinese theater of [[World War II]], [[Zhang Xueliang]] kidnapped Chiang and obliged him to establish a [[Second United Front]] with the CCP. After the defeat of the Japanese, the American-sponsored [[Marshall Mission]], an attempt to negotiate a coalition government, failed in 1946. The Chinese Civil War resumed, with the CCP led by [[Mao Zedong]] defeating the KMT and declaring the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. Chiang's government and army retreated to [[Taiwan]], where Chiang imposed [[martial law]] and persecuted critics in a period known as the \"[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]\". After evacuating to Taiwan, Chiang's government continued to declare its intention to retake mainland China. Chiang ruled Taiwan securely as [[President of the Republic of China]] and General of the Kuomintang until his death in 1975, just one year short of Mao's death.<ref>[[:s:Translation:Will of Chiang Kai-shek|Will of Chiang Kai-shek]] at Wikisource.</ref>\n\nLike Mao, Chiang is regarded as a controversial figure. Supporters credit him with playing a major part in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied victory of World War II]] and unifying the nation and a national figure of the Chinese resistance against Japan as well as his staunch anti-Soviet and anti-communist stance. Detractors and critics denounce him as a [[dictator]] at the front of an authoritarian [[autocracy]] who suppressed and purged opponents and critics and [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrarily incarcerated]] those he deemed as opposing to the Kuomintang among others.\n\n==Names==\nLike many other Chinese historical figures, Chiang used several names throughout his life. That inscribed in the [[Chinese kin|genealogical records of his family]] is Jiang Zhoutai ({{zh|t=\u8523\u5468\u6cf0|w=''Chiang Chou-t\u2018ai''|c=|s=}}). This so-called \"register name\" (\u8b5c\u540d) is the one under which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he got married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the register name in conversation with people outside of the family. The concept of a \"real\" or original name is not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world.\n\nIn honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their children. In the meantime, they used a \"milk name\" (\u4e73\u540d), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family, thus the actual name that Chiang received at birth was Jiang Ruiyuan ({{zh|t=\u8523\u745e\u5143|w=''Chiang Jui-yuan''}}).\n\nIn 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to [[Ningbo]] to be a student, and he chose a \"school name\" (\u5b78\u540d). This was actually the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as the person grew older, younger generations would have to use one of the [[courtesy name]]s instead). Colloquially, the school name is called \"big name\" (\u5927\u540d), whereas the \"milk name\" is known as the \"small name\" (\u5c0f\u540d). The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Zhiqing ({{zh|c=\u5fd7\u6e05|w=Chi-ch\u2018ing}}, which means \"purity of intentions\"). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as Jiang Zhiqing ([[Wade-Giles]]: Chiang Chi-ch\u2018ing). This is the name under which [[Sun Yat-sen]] knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in [[Guangzhou|Kwangtung]] in the 1910s.\n\nIn 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u8523\u4ecb\u77f3; [[Pinyin]]: {{Audio|Zh-Jiang_Jieshi.ogg|''Jiang Jieshi''}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: ''Voice of the Army'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u8ecd\u8072). ''Jieshi'' is the [[Pinyin]] romanization of this name, based on [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], but the most recognized romanized rendering is ''Kai-shek'' which is in [[Cantonese|Cantonese romanization]]. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as [[Guangdong]] province), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in [[Wade-Giles]].\n\n\"Kai-shek\"/\"Jieshi\" soon became Chiang's [[courtesy name]] (\u5b57). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the ''[[I Ching]]''; \"\u4ecb\u4e8e\u77f3\", \"[he who is] firm as a rock\", is the beginning of line 2 of [[I Ching hexagram 16|Hexagram 16, \"\u8c6b\"]].  Others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generation line, while the second character of his courtesy name ''shi'' (\u77f3\u2014meaning \"stone\") suggests the second character of his \"register name\" ''tai'' (\u6cf0\u2014the famous [[Mount Tai]] of China). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.\n\nSometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to [[Sun Yat-sen]], he changed his name from Jiang Zhiqing to Jiang Zhongzheng ({{zh|c=\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63|w=''Chiang Chung-cheng''}}). By adopting the name Chung-cheng (\"central uprightness\"), he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who was (and still is) known among Chinese as Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u2014meaning \"central mountain\"), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the legitimate heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. Not surprisingly, the Chinese Communists always rejected the use of this name and it is not well known in [[mainland China]]. However, it was readily accepted by members of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] and is the name under which Chiang Kai-shek is still commonly known in Taiwan. Often the name is shortened to \"Chung-cheng\" only (\"Zhongzheng\" in Pinyin). Many public places in Taiwan are named [[Chungcheng]] after Chiang. For many years passengers arriving at the [[Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the \"Chung Cheng International Airport\". Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang's memory in Taipei, known in English as [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]], was literally named \"Chung Cheng Memorial Hall\" in Chinese. In Singapore, [[Chung Cheng High School (Main)|Chung Cheng High School]] was named after him.\n\nHis name is also written in Taiwan as \"The Late President Lord Chiang\" (\u5148\u7e3d\u7d71\u3000\u8523\u516c), where the one-character-wide space known as [[nuo tai]] shows respect, but this practice has lost some popularity. However, he is still known as ''Lord Chiang'' (\u8523\u516c) (without the title or space), along with the name Chiang Chung-cheng, in Taiwan.\n{{anchor|Biography|History}}\n\n== Early life ==\nChiang was born in [[Xikou, Fenghua|Xikou]], a town in [[Fenghua]], [[Zhejiang]], about {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} west of central [[Ningbo]]. His family's [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]]\u2014a concept important in Chinese society\u2014was Heqiao ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|\u548c\u6a4b|\u93ae}}}}), a town in [[Yixing]], [[Jiangsu]], about {{convert|38|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} southwest of central [[Wuxi]] and {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the shores of [[Lake Tai]]. His father Jiang Zhaocong ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|\u8523|\u8087|\u8070}}}}) and mother Wang Caiyu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u738b|\u91c7|\u7389}}}}) were members of a prosperous family of salt merchants. Chiang lost his father when he was eight, and he wrote of his mother as the \"embodiment of [[Confucianism|Confucian virtues]]\".The young Chiang was inspired throughout his youth by the realisation that the reputation of an honored family rested upon his shoulders. He was a mischievous child, at only three years old he thrust a pair of chopsticks down his throat to see how far they would reach. They became stuck and were removed with great difficulty. Even at a young age he was interested in war, and directed mimic campaigns with a wooden sword and spear. As he grew older, Chiang became more aware of the issues that surrounded him and in his speech to the Kuomintang in 1945 said:\n\n{{quote|As you all know I was an orphan boy in a poor family. Deprived of any protection after the death of her husband, my mother was exposed to the most ruthless exploitation by neighbouring ruffians and the local gentry. The efforts she made in fighting against the intrigues of these family intruders certainly endowed her child, brought up in such environment, with an indomitable spirit to fight for justice. I felt throughout my childhood that mother and I were fighting a helpless lone war. We were alone in a desert, no available or possible assistance could we look forward to. But our determination was never shaken, nor hope abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tong|first1=Hollington K.|title=Chiang Kai-Shek|date=1953|publisher=China Publishing Company|page=5|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n==Education in Japan==\nChiang grew up at a time in which successive demands of the [[Western powers]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] since the [[First Opium War|Opium War]] had left China owing millions of [[tael]]s of silver. During his first visits to Japan to pursue a military career in 1906, he describes having strong nationalistic feelings with a desire among other things to, \"expel the Manchu Qing and to restore China\".<ref>http://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/media/pdf/books/978-88-6969-127-0/978-88-6969-127-0-ch-01.pdf</ref> He decided to pursue a military career. He began his military training at the [[Baoding Military Academy]] in 1906, the same year Japan left its bimetallic currency standard, devaluing its [[Japanese yen|yen]]. He left for [[Tokyo Shinbu Gakko]], a preparatory school for the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] intended for Chinese students, in 1907. There, he came under the influence of compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] and to set up a [[Han Chinese|Han]]-dominated Chinese republic. He befriended fellow Zhejiangese [[Chen Qimei]], and in 1908 Chen brought Chiang into the [[Tongmenghui]], an important revolutionary brotherhood of the era. Finishing his schooling, Chiang served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] from 1909 to 1911.\n\n==Return to China==\nAfter learning of the outbreak (October 1911) of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], Chiang returned to China in 1911, intending to fight as an artillery officer. He served in the revolutionary forces, leading a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor [[Chen Qimei]], as one of Chen's chief lieutenants. In early 1912 a dispute arose between Chen and [[Tao Chen-chang]], an influential member of the Revolutionary Alliance who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen.

During Chiang's time in Shanghai, the British-administered [[Shanghai International Settlement]] police watched him and charged him with various felonies. These charges never resulted in a trial, and Chiang was never jailed.<ref>Loh 1971, pp. 20, 133.</ref>\n\nChiang became a founding member of the KMT after the success (February 1912) of the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Revolution]]. After the takeover of the Republican government by [[Yuan Shikai]] and the failed [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided his time between exile in Japan and the havens of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city's underworld gangs, which were dominated by the notorious Green Gang and its leader Du Yuesheng. On 18 May 1916, agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei. Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] in Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen's political career reached its lowest point during this time when most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refused to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Taylor2009p25-26\">\n{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp= 25\u201326}}\n</ref>\n\n==Establishment of the Kuomintang==\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek-young.jpg|thumb|right|Chiang, early 1920s]]\n\nIn 1917, Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (now known as Guangzhou), and Chiang joined him in 1918.

Chiang later sent his eldest son, Ching-kuo, to study in Russia. After his father's split from the [[First United Front]] in 1927, Ching-kuo was forced to stay there, as a hostage, until 1937.

Chiang resigned from the office for one month in disagreement with Sun's extremely close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun's demand. The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the KMT and himself.\n\nThroughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist [[Tiandihui]] fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the Kuomintang.\n\n==Competition with Wang Jingwei==\n[[File:Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|right|Chiang (right) together with [[Wang Jingwei]] (left), 1926]]\n\n[[Sun Yat-sen]] died on 12 March 1925,<ref name=sundeath>{{Cite book |last=Eileen |first=Tamura |year=1998 |title=China: Understanding Its Past |page = 174}}</ref> creating a power vacuum in the [[Kuomintang]].

On 5 June 1926, he was named [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]<ref name=\"Taylor2009p57\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=57}}</ref> and, on July 27, he finally launched Sun's long-delayed [[Northern Expedition]], aimed at conquering the northern warlords and bringing China together under the KMT.\n\nThe NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was the returned Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take [[Wuhan]]; [[Bai Chongxi]]'s column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take [[Nanjing]] before pressing ahead to capture Beijing. However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare. Allied with a number of [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] and advised by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanjing in March (and briefly visited Shanghai, now under the control of his close ally Bai Chongxi), Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang's leftist elements, which he believed threatened his control of the KMT.\n\nNow with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang Jingwei's National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord ([[Li Zongren]] of [[Guangxi]]). Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing. In the [[Central Plains War]], Beijing was taken on June, 1928, from an alliance of the warlords [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]]. In December, the [[Manchuria]]n warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] pledged allegiance to Chiang's government, completing Chiang's nominal unification of China and ending the [[Warlord Era]].\n\nIn 1927, when he was setting up the Nationalist government in Nanjing, he was preoccupied with \"the elevation of our leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the rank of 'Father of our Chinese Republic'. Dr. Sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the Nationalist cause, and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position\". He asked [[Chen Guofu]] to purchase a photograph that had been taken in Japan around 1895 or 1898. It showed members of the Revive China Society with [[Yeung Kui-wan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u694a\u8862\u96f2}} or {{lang|zh-Hans|\u6768\u8862\u4e91}}, [[pinyin]] Y\u00e1ng Q\u00fay\u00fan) as President, in the place of honor, and Sun, as secretary, on the back row, along with members of the Japanese Chapter of the Revive China Society. When told that it was not for sale, Chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative. \"The party must have this picture and the negative at any price. They must be destroyed as soon as possible. It would be embarrassing to have our Father of the Chinese Republic shown in a subordinate position\".<ref>'\"Chiang Kai-Shek's Secret Past: The Memoir of His Second Wife, Ch'en Chieh-ju\" by Ch'en Chieh-ju and George Chan, ed. by Lloyd E.

In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun's brother-in-law: he had married [[Soong Mei-ling]], the younger sister of [[Soong Ching-ling]], Sun's widow, on 1 December 1927. Originally rebuffed in the early 1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong Mei-ling's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and promising to sincerely study the precepts of [[Christianity]]. He read the copy of the Bible that May-ling had given him twice before making up his mind to become a Christian, and three years after his marriage he was baptized in the Soong's [[Methodist]] church. Although some observers felt that he adopted Christianity as a political move, studies of his recently opened diaries suggest that his faith was strong and sincere and that he felt that Christianity reinforced Confucian moral teachings.<ref name=\"Taylor2009p91\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=91}}</ref>\n\nUpon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]].\n\n==Rising power==\nIn the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek was known as the \"Red General\".<ref name=\"Hannah Pakula 2009 346\"/> Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang.

On 10 October 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=84}}</ref> As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him \"[[Generalissimo]]\".<ref name=\"Taylor2009p57\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s plans, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was to rebuild China in three steps: [[Martial law|military rule]], political tutelage, and constitutional rule. The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China's fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be \"political tutelage\" in Sun Yat-sen's name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1937, a time period known as known as the [[Nanjing decade]], some aspects of foreign [[imperialism]], [[Concessions in China|concessions]] and privileges{{clarify|date=August 2018}} in China were moderated through diplomacy. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in [[narcotic]]s, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Not all of these projects were successfully completed. Efforts were made towards improving education standards, and in an effort to unify Chinese society, the [[New Life Movement]] was launched to encourage [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral values and personal discipline. ''[[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]]'' (\"national language\") was promoted as a [[Official language|standard tongue]], and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) were used to encourage a sense of [[Chinese nationalism]] in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central government.\n\nAny successes that the Nationalists did make, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The 1930 [[Central Plains War]] alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost {{formatnum:250000}} casualties on both sides. In 1931, [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under [[house arrest]], but he was released after national condemnation, after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in [[Guanzhou|Canton]]. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Kwangtung government and Chiang's Nationalist government. Chiang only won the campaign against Hu after a shift in allegiance by the warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]], who had previously supported Hu Hanmin.\n\nThroughout his rule, complete eradication of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] remained Chiang's dream. After assembling his forces in [[Kiangsi]], Chiang led his armies against the newly established [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]. With help from foreign military advisers, Chiang's [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|Fifth Campaign]] finally surrounded the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] in 1934. The Communists, tipped off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the [[Long March]], during which [[Mao Zedong]] rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Communist Party of China.\n\nChiang, as a nationalist and a Confucianist, was against the [[iconoclasm]] of the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Motivated by his sense of nationalism, he viewed some Western ideas as foreign, and he believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and literature that the May Fourth Movement promoted was not beneficial to China. He and Dr. Sun criticized the May Fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of China's youth.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc4UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA13 |title=The May Fourth Movement in Shanghai: The Making of a Social Movement in Modern China |author=Joseph T.

Once Chiang Kai-shek was done with his [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the capitalists.

He returned shortly afterwards, adopting the slogan \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\". However, this policy of avoiding a frontal war against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] was widely unpopular. In 1932, while Chiang was seeking first to defeat the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], Japan launched an [[January 28 Incident|advance]] on Shanghai and bombarded [[Nanjing]]. This disrupted Chiang's [[Chinese Civil War|offensives against the Communists]] for a time, although it was the northern factions of [[Hu Hanmin]]'s [[Guangzhou|Kwangtung]] government (notably the [[19th Route Army]]) that primarily led the offensive against the Japanese during this skirmish. Brought into the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist army]] immediately after the battle, the 19th Route Army's career under Chiang would be cut short after it was disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies.\n\nIn December 1936, Chiang flew to [[Xi'an]] to coordinate a major assault on the [[Red Army (China)|Red Army]] and the Communist Republic that had retreated into [[Yan'an]]. However, Chiang's allied commander [[Zhang Xueliang]], whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of [[Manchuria]] had been recently invaded by the Japanese, did not support the attack on the Communists. On December 12, Zhang and several other Nationalist generals headed by Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi kidnapped Chiang for two weeks in what is known as the [[Xi'an Incident]]. They forced Chiang into making a \"[[Second United Front]]\" with the Communists against Japan. After releasing Chiang and returning to Nanjing with him, Zhang was placed under house arrest and the generals who had assisted him were executed. Chiang's commitment to the Second United Front was nominal at best, and it was all but broken up in 1941.\n{{anchor|World War II|WWII|WW2}}\n\n===Second Sino-Japanese War===\n[[File:Liangyou 131 cover - Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|upright|After the breakout of the Second Sino-Japanese War, ''[[The Young Companion]]'' featured Chiang on its cover.]]\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in July 1937, and in August of that year Chiang sent {{formatnum:600000}} of his best-trained and equipped soldiers to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]]. With over 200,000 Chinese casualties, Chiang lost the political cream of his [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa]]-trained officers. Although Chiang lost militarily, the battle dispelled Japanese claims that it could conquer China in three months and demonstrated to the Western powers that the Chinese would continue the fight. By December, the capital city of Nanjing had fallen to the Japanese resulting in the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Chiang moved the government inland, first to [[Wuhan]] and later to [[Chongqing]].\n\nHaving lost most of China's economic and industrial centers, Chiang withdrew into the hinterlands, stretching the Japanese supply lines and bogging down Japanese soldiers in the vast Chinese interior. As part of a policy of protracted resistance, Chiang authorized the use of [[Scorched earth#Second Sino-Japanese War|scorched earth]] tactics, resulting in many civilian deaths. During the Nationalists' retreat from [[Zhengzhou]], the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist army]] in order to delay the Japanese advance, killing 500,000 people in the subsequent [[1938 Yellow River flood]].\n\nAfter heavy fighting, the Japanese occupied Wuhan in the fall of 1938 and the Nationalists retreated farther inland, to Chongqing. While en route to Chongqing, the Nationalist army intentionally started the [[1938 Changsha Fire|\"fire of Changsha\"]], as a part of the scorched earth policy. The fire destroyed much of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city. The Nationalists eventually blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them. Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT.<ref>Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

American troops and weapons soon bolstered KMT forces, allowing them to reclaim cities. The countryside, however, remained largely under Communist control.\n\nFor over a year after the Japanese surrender, rumors circulated throughout China that the Japanese had entered into a secret agreement with Chiang, in which the Japanese would assist the Nationalists in fighting the Communists in exchange for the protection of Japanese persons and property there. Many top nationalist generals, including Chiang, had studied and trained in Japan before the Nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920s, and maintained close personal friendships with top Japanese officers. The Japanese general in charge of all forces in China, General [[Yasuji Okamura]], had personally trained officers who later became generals in Chiang's staff. Reportedly, General Okamura, before surrendering command of all Japanese military forces in Nanjing, offered Chiang control of all 1.5&nbsp;million Japanese military and civilian support staff then present in China. Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer, but declined only in the knowledge that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture. Even so, armed Japanese troops remained in China well into 1947, with some noncommissioned officers finding their way into the Nationalist officer corps.<ref>Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. \"Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945\u20131949.\" ''The Journal of Asian Studies''.

Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.<ref>Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p. 291</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, the United States encouraged peace talks between Chiang and Communist leader Mao Zedong in Chongqing. Due to concerns about widespread and well-documented corruption in Chiang's government throughout his rule, the U.S. government limited aid to Chiang for much of the period of 1946 to 1948, in the midst of fighting against the [[People's Liberation Army]] led by [[Mao Zedong]].

The Nationalists initially had superiority in arms and men, but their lack of popularity, infiltration by Communist agents, low morale, and disorganization soon allowed the Communists to gain the upper hand in the civil war.\n\n==== Competition with Li Zongren ====\nA new [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] was promulgated in 1947, and Chiang was elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] as the first term [[President of the Republic of China]] on 20 May 1948. This marked the beginning of what was termed the \"democratic constitutional government\" period by the KMT political orthodoxy, but the Communists refused to recognize the new Constitution, and its government, as legitimate. Chiang resigned as President on 21 January 1949, as KMT forces suffered terrible losses and defections to the Communists. After Chiang's resignation the vice-president of the ROC, [[Li Zongren]], became China's acting president.\n\nShortly after Chiang's resignation the Communists halted their advances and attempted to negotiate the virtual surrender of the ROC. Li attempted to negotiate milder terms that would have ended the civil war, but without success. When it became clear that Li was unlikely to accept Mao's terms, the Communists issued an ultimatum in April 1949, warning that they would resume their attacks if Li did not agree within five days. Li refused.<ref>Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}}. p. 486</ref>\n\nLi's attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from Chiang's supporters, and were generally unsuccessful. Chiang especially antagonized Li by taking possession of (and moving to Taiwan) US$200&nbsp;million of gold and US dollars belonging to the central government that Li desperately needed to cover the government's soaring expenses. When the Communists captured the Nationalist capital of Nanjing in April 1949, Li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to [[Guangdong]], instead expressing his dissatisfaction with Chiang by retiring to Guangxi.<ref name=\"Gillin289\">Gillin, Donald G.

At Chiang's request Yan visited Li in order to convince Li not to withdraw from public life. Yan broke down in tears while talking of the loss of his home province of Shanxi to the Communists, and warned Li that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li went to Guangdong. Li agreed to return under the condition that Chiang surrender most of the gold and US dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government, and that Chiang stop overriding Li's authority. After Yan communicated these demands and Chiang agreed to comply with them, Li departed for Guangdong.<ref name=\"Gillin289\" />\n\nIn Guangdong, Li attempted to create a new government composed of both Chiang supporters and those opposed to Chiang. Li's first choice of premier was Chu Cheng, a veteran member of the Kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile due to his strong opposition to Chiang. After the Legislative Yuan rejected Chu, Li was obliged to choose Yan Xishan instead. By this time Yan was well known for his adaptability and Chiang welcomed his appointment.<ref name=\"Gillin289\" />\n\nConflict between Chiang and Li persisted. Although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of Li's return, Chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to Taiwan. Without being backed by gold or foreign currency, the money issued by Li and Yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless.<ref name=\"Gillin290\">Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911\u20131949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 290</ref>\n\nAlthough he did not hold a formal executive position in the government, Chiang continued to issue orders to the army, and many officers continued to obey Chiang rather than Li. The inability of Li to coordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong, hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller, and more easily defensible, area. The object of Li's strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side.<ref name=\"Gillin290\" />\n\n==== Final Communist advance ====\nChiang opposed Li's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang's other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang's intransigence Li began ousting Chiang's supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, creating the impression among Li's supporters that he was a \"stooge\" of Chiang, while those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Kwangsi and Canton, with the result that Communist forces occupied Canton in October 1949.<ref>Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911\u20131949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 291</ref>\n\nAfter Canton fell to the Communists, Chiang relocated the government to [[Chongqing|Chungking]], while Li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to New York for treatment of his chronic [[duodenum]] illness at the Hospital of [[Columbia University]]. Li visited the President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman]], and denounced Chiang as a dictator and an usurper. Li vowed that he would \"return to crush\" Chiang once he returned to China. Li remained in exile, and did not return to Taiwan.<ref>\"CHINA: Return of the Gimo\".  ''Time Magazine''. Monday, Mar. 13, 1950.

Chiang Kai-shek would never return to the mainland.\n\nChiang did not re-assume the presidency until 1 March 1950. On January 1952, Chiang commanded the [[Control Yuan]], now in Taiwan, to impeach Li in the \"Case of Li Zongren's Failure to carry out Duties due to Illegal Conduct\" (\u674e\u5b97\u4ec1\u9055\u6cd5\u5931\u8077\u6848).

The government's official line for these martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary, since the Communists and KMT were still in a state of war. Seeking to promote [[Chinese nationalism]], Chiang's government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression, even forbidding the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions.\n\nThe first decades after the Nationalists moved the seat of government to the province of Taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist Communism known as the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|\"White Terror\"]], during which about 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang. Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as \"bandit spies\" (\u532a\u8adc), meaning spies for Chinese Communists, and punished as such.\n\nUnder Chiang, the government recognized limited civil and economic freedoms, property rights (personal{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and intellectual) and other liberties. Despite these restrictions, free debate within the confines of the legislature was permitted. Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the National Assembly, [[Legislative Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]] members held their posts indefinitely. The Temporary Provisions also allowed Chiang to remain as president beyond the two-term limit in the Constitution. He was reelected by the National Assembly as president four times\u2014doing so in 1954, 1960, 1966, and 1972.\n\nBelieving that corruption and a lack of morals were key reasons that the KMT lost mainland China to the Communists, Chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the KMT accused of graft. Some major figures in the previous mainland Chinese government, such as [[H. H. Kung]] and [[T. V. Soong]], exiled themselves to the United States. Although politically authoritarian and, to some extent, dominated by government-owned industries, Chiang's new Taiwanese state also encouraged economic development, especially in the export sector. A popular sweeping Land Reform Act, as well as American foreign aid during the 1950s, laid the foundation for Taiwan's economic success, becoming one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].\n\nAfter Chiang's death, the next president, Chiang's son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and Chiang Ching-kuo's successor, [[Lee Teng-hui]] a native Taiwanese, would, in the 1980s and 1990s, increase native Taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of ROC control in Taiwan.\n\n====Relationship with Japan====\nIn 1971, the Australian Opposition Leader [[Gough Whitlam]], who [[Australian federal election, 1972|became Prime Minister in 1972]] and [[Whitlam Government#Duumvirate|swiftly relocated the Australian mission from Taipei to Beijing]], visited Japan. After meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Eisaku Sato]], Whitlam observed that the reason Japan at that time was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the Nationalist government was \"the presence of a treaty between the Japanese government and that of Chiang Kai-shek\". Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang. This relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of Japanese prisoners-of-war by the Nationalist government in the years immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members then in power.<ref name=\"Journal1\">Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. \"Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945\u20131948\".

There is speculation that a clash between Communist forces and a Japanese warship in 1978 was caused by Chinese anger after Prime Minister [[Takeo Fukuda]] attended Chiang's funeral. Historically, Japanese attempts to normalize their relationship with the People's Republic were met with accusations of ingratitude in Taiwan.<ref name=\"Journal1\" />\n\n====Relationship with the United States====\nChiang was suspicious that [[Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Operations|covert operatives of the United States]] plotted a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] against him. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the [[secret police]] ([[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]]), which he remained until 1965. Chiang was also suspicious of politicians who were overly friendly to the United States, and considered them his enemies. In 1953, seven days after surviving an assassination attempt, [[Wu Kuo-chen]] lost his position as governor of Taiwan Province to [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]. After fleeing to United States the same year, he became a vocal critic of Chiang's family and government.<ref name=\"Peter R.

He had suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[pneumonia]] in the foregoing months and died from [[renal failure]] aggravated with advanced cardiac malfunction on April 5.\n\nA month of mourning was declared. Chinese music composer [[Hwang Yau-tai]] wrote the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song]]. In mainland China, however, Chiang's death was met with little apparent mourning and Communist state-run newspapers gave the brief headline \"Chiang Kai-shek Has Died.\" Chiang's body was put in a copper coffin and temporarily interred at his favorite residence in [[Cihu Mausoleum|Cihu]], [[Daxi District|Daxi]], [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]]. When his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] died in 1988, he was entombed in a separate mausoleum in nearby [[Touliao Mausoleum|Touliao]] (\u982d\u5bee). The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua if and when it was possible. In 2004, [[Chiang Fang-liang]], the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo, asked that both father and son be buried at [[Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery]] in [[Xizhi]], [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City). Chiang's ultimate funeral ceremony became a political battle between the wishes of the state and the wishes of his family.\n\nChiang was succeeded as President by [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] [[Yen Chia-kan]] and as Kuomintang party ruler by his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], who retired Chiang Kai-shek's title of Director-General and instead assumed the position of Chairman.

For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious [[Northern Expedition]] against the [[Beiyang government|Beiyang Warlords]] in 1927, achieving [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese unification]], and who subsequently led China to ultimate victory against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1945. Some blamed him for not doing enough against the Japanese forces in the lead-up to, and during, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], preferring to withhold his armies for the fight against the Communists, or merely waiting and hoping that the United States would get involved. Some also see him as a champion of [[anti-Communism]], being a key figure during the formative years of the [[World Anti-Communist League]]. During the [[Cold War]], he was also seen as the leader who led [[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]] and the bulwark against a possible Communist invasion. However, Chiang presided over purges, political authoritarianism, and graft during his tenure in mainland China, and ruled throughout a period of imposed [[martial law]]. His governments were accused of being corrupt even before he even took power in 1928. He also allied with known criminals like [[Du Yuesheng]] for political and financial gains. Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing Taiwan were mostly to make the island a strong base from which to one day return to mainland China, and that Chiang had little regard for the long-term prosperity and well-being of the [[Taiwanese people]].\n\nToday, Chiang's popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying greater support among Kuomintang (KMT) supporters. He is generally unpopular among [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) voters and supporters who blame him for the thousands killed during the [[February 28 Incident]] and criticise his subsequent dictatorial rule.<ref name=\"veconomist\" >{{cite news|author=|title=Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s former homes are open to tourists|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21730036-visitors-china-and-taiwan-have-very-different-views-late-dictator-chiang-kai-sheks-former|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 October 2017}}</ref> In sharp contrast to his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and to [[Sun Yat-sen]], his memory is rarely invoked by current political parties, including the Kuomintang.  In contrast, his image has been rehabilitated in contemporary Mainland China.  Until recently portrayed as a villain who fought against the \"liberation\" of China by the Communists, since the 2000s, he has been portrayed by the media in a neutral or slightly positive light as a Chinese nationalist who tried to bring about national unification and resisted the Japanese invasion during World War II.  This shift is largely in response to current political landscape of Taiwan, in relation to Chiang's commitment to a unified China and his stance against Taiwanese separatism during his rule of the island, along with the recent d\u00e9tente between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chiang's KMT.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/03/assassinating-chiang-kai-shek-china-taiwan-japan-world-war-2/|title=Assassinating Chiang Kai-shek|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|date=3 September 2015|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=28 May 2017}}</ref> In contrast to efforts to remove his public monuments in Taiwan, his ancestral home in Fenghua, Zhejiang on the Mainland has become a commemorative museum and major tourist attraction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/8321/retake-the-mainland-chiang-kai-shek-bronze-marches-on-zhejiang-hometown|title='Retake the Mainland': Chiang Kai-shek bronze marches on Zhejiang hometown|last=Kilpatrick|first=Ryan|date=13 January 2015|website=That's Magazine|access-date=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the Communists.

He had a record of issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fenby |first=Jonathan |title=History of Modern China |page = 279}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, there has been an attempt to find a more moderate interpretation of Chiang. Chiang is now increasingly perceived as a man simply overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight simultaneously Communists, Japanese, and provincial warlords while having to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful nation have been noted by scholars such as [[Jonathan Fenby]] and [[Rana Mitter]]. Mitter has observed that, ironically, today's China is closer to Chiang's vision than to [[Mao Zedong]]'s. He argues that the Communists, since the 1980s, have essentially created the state envisioned by Chiang in the 1930s. Mitter concludes by writing that \"one can imagine Chiang Kai-shek's ghost wandering round China today nodding in approval, while Mao's ghost follows behind him, moaning at the destruction of his vision\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitter|first=Rana|title=Modern China|pages=73}}</ref> [[Liang Shuming]] opined that Chiang Kai-shek's \"greatest contribution was to make the CCP successful.

He told her that he acquired this disease after separating from his first wife and living with his concubine Yao Yecheng, as well as with many other women he consorted with. His doctor explained to her that Chiang had sex with her before completing his treatment for the disease. As a result, both Chiang and Ch'en Chieh-ju believed they had become sterile, which would explain why he had only one child, by his first wife; however, a purported miscarriage by Soong Mei-ling in August 1928 would, if it actually occurred, cast serious doubt on whether this was true.<ref name=\"The Generalissimo\" /><ref>''Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Past''. pp. 83\u201385.</ref>\n\n=== Family tree ===\n\nThe Xikou (Chikow) Chiangs were descended from Chiang Shih-chieh who during the 1600s (17th century) moved there from Fenghua district, whose ancestors in turn came to southeastern China's Zhejiang (Chekiang) province after moving out of Northern China in the 13th century AD.

The three Muslim governors, known as [[Xibei San Ma]] (lit. \"the three [[Ma clique|Mas]] of the [[Northwestern China|Northwest]]\"), controlled armies composed entirely of Muslims. Chiang called on the three and their suboordinates to wage war against the Soviet peoples, Tibetans, Communists, and the Japanese. Chiang continued to appoint Muslims as governors of the three provinces, including [[Ma Lin (warlord)|Ma Lin]] and [[Ma Fushou]]. Chiang's appointments, the first time that Muslims had been appointed as governors of Gansu, increased the prestige of Muslim officials in northwestern China. The armies raised by this \"Ma Clique\", most notably their Muslim cavalry, were incorporated into the KMT army. Chiang appointed a Muslim general, [[Bai Chongxi]], as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military.\n\nChiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at [[Whampoa Military Academy]] during the [[Kumul Rebellion]], in a [[Jihad]] against [[Jin Shuren]], [[Sheng Shicai]], and the Soviet Union during the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. Chiang designated Ma's Muslim army as the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] and gave his troops [[Kuomintang]] flags and uniforms. Chiang then supported Muslim General Ma Hushan against [[Sheng Shicai]] and the Soviet Union in the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]]. All Muslim generals commissioned by Chiang in the National Revolutionary Army swore allegiance to him. Several, like [[Ma Shaowu]] and Ma Hushan were loyal to Chiang and Kuomintang hardliners.\n\nThe [[Ili Rebellion]] and [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]] plagued relations with the Soviet Union during Chiang's rule and caused trouble with the Uyghurs. During the Ili Rebellion and Peitashan incident, Chiang deployed [[Hui people|Hui]] troops against [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] mobs in Turfan, and against Soviet Russian and Mongols at Peitashan.\n\nDuring Chiang's rule, attacks on foreigners by Kuomintang forces flared up in several incidents. One of these was the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] where a Muslim army loyal to the Kuomintang massacred 4,500 Uyghurs, and killed several British at the British consulate in Kashgar. The British were unable to retaliate.\n\n[[Hu Songshan]], a Muslim Imam, backed Chiang Kai-shek's regime and gave prayers for his government. ROC flags were saluted by Muslims in Ningxia during prayer along with exhortations to nationalism during Chiang's rule. Chiang sent Muslim students abroad to study at places like [[Al Azhar]] and Muslim schools throughout China taught loyalty to his regime.\n\nThe Yuehua, a Chinese Muslim publication, quoted the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] to justify submitting to Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of China, and as justification for Jihad in the war against Japan.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C |title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |author1=St\u00e9phane A.

Other Muslim sects, like the [[Xidaotang]] and Sufi brotherhoods like Jahriyya and Khuffiya were also supported by his regime. The Chinese Muslim Association, a pro-Kuomintang and anti-Communist organization, was set up by Muslims working in his regime. [[Salafism]] attempted to gain a foothold in China during his regime, but the Yihewani and Hanafi Sunni [[Gedimu]] denounced the Salafis as radicals, engaged in fights against them, and declared them heretics, forcing the Salafis to form a separate sect.<ref>{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uHjR3yeIWzUC&pg=PA127 |title = Muslim diversity: local Islam in global contexts |author = Leif O.

It is a fundamental specification for many common combustion engines.\n\nIn a piston engine, it is the ratio between the volume of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] and combustion chamber when the [[piston]] is at the [[bottom dead center|bottom of its stroke]], and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the [[top dead center|top of its stroke]].<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n  | title = Compression ratio\n  | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130313/compression-ratio\n  | accessdate =2009-07-21 }}\n</ref>\n\nFor example, a cylinder and its combustion chamber with the piston at the bottom of its stroke may contain 1000&nbsp;cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has moved up to the top of its stroke inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber has been reduced to 100&nbsp;cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.\n\nA high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of [[air-fuel mixture]] due to its higher [[thermal efficiency]]. This occurs because internal combustion engines are [[heat engine]]s, and higher efficiency is created because higher compression ratios permit the same combustion temperature to be reached with less fuel, while giving a longer expansion cycle, creating more mechanical power output and lowering the exhaust temperature.  It may be more helpful to think of it as an \"expansion ratio\", since more expansion reduces the temperature of the exhaust gases, and therefore the energy wasted to the atmosphere.  Diesel engines actually have a higher peak combustion temperature than petrol engines, but the greater expansion means they reject less heat in their cooler exhaust.\n\nHigher compression ratios will however make gasoline engines subject to [[engine knocking]] (also known as detonation) if lower octane-rated fuel is used. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to modify the ignition timing.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Diesel engines]] operate on the principle of compression ignition, so that a fuel which resists [[autoignition]] will cause late ignition, which will also lead to engine knock.\n\n==Formula==\nStatic compression ratio (<math>CR</math>) is calculated by the formula\n\n:<math>{CR} = \\frac { V_d + V_c } {V_c}</math>\n\nWhere:\n:\n:<math>V_d</math> = displacement volume. This is the volume inside the cylinder displaced by the piston from the beginning of the compression stroke to the end of the stroke.\n:<math>V_c</math> = clearance volume. This is the volume of the space in the cylinder left at the end of the compression stroke.\n\n<math>V_d</math> can be estimated by the [[Cylinder#Volume|cylinder volume]] formula\n\n:<math>V_d = \\tfrac{\\pi} {4} b^2 s</math>\n\nWhere:\n:<math>b</math> = [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Bore (engine)|bore]] (diameter)\n:<math>s</math> = [[piston]] [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] length\n\nBecause of the complex shape of <math>V_c</math> it is usually measured directly. This is often done by filling the cylinder with liquid and then measuring the volume of the used liquid.\n\n==Typical compression ratios==\n\n===Gasoline (petrol) engine===\nThe compression ratio in a [[gasoline]] (petrol)-powered engine will usually not be much higher than 10:1 due to potential [[engine knocking]] (detonation) and not lower than 6:1. Some production automotive engines built for high performance from 1955\u20131972, used [[Octane rating|high-octane]] [[Tetraethyllead|leaded gasoline]] or '5 star' to allow compression ratios as high as 13.0:1.\n\nA technique used to prevent the onset of knock is the high \"swirl\" engine that forces the intake charge to adopt a fast circular rotation in the cylinder during compression that provides quicker and more complete combustion. It is possible to manufacture gasoline engines with compression ratios of over 11:1 that can use 87 (MON + RON)/2 ([[octane rating]]) fuel with the addition of variable valve timing and knock sensors to delay ignition timing. Such engines may not produce their full rated power using 87 octane gasoline under all circumstances, due to the delayed ignition timing. [[Fuel Injection#Direct injection|Direct fuel injection]], which can inject fuel only at the time of fuel ignition (similar to a diesel engine), is another recent development which also allows for higher compression ratios on gasoline engines.\n\nThe compression ratio can be as high as 14:1 (2014 [[Ferrari 458 Speciale]]) in engines with a [[Engine knocking|'ping' or 'knock']] [[sensor]] and an [[electronic control unit]]. In 1981, Jaguar released a cylinder head that allowed up to 14:1 compression; but settled for 12.5:1 in production cars. The cylinder head design was known as the \"May Fireball\" head; it was developed by a Swiss engineer [[Michael May (racing driver)|Michael May]].\n\nIn 2012, [[Mazda]] released new petrol engines under the brand name [[SkyActiv]] with a 14:1 compression ratio (U.S. models have a 13:1 compression ratio to allow for 87 AKI octane), to be used in all Mazda vehicles by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=gSiteLife.Recommend(\"ExternalResource\",\"110429942\"); Tweet |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110422/NEWYORK/110429942 |title=2012 Mazda 3 gets 40-mpg SkyActiv engine option; diesel expected in 2014 |publisher=Autoweek |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2012-05-29}}</ref><ref>[http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20015698-48.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312043501/http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20015698-48.html|date=March 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=August 2010 |first=DAVE |last=VANDERWERP |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/mazda-engine-news-mazda-sky-gas-and-diesel-details-car-and-driver |title=Mazda Engine News: Mazda Sky Gas and Diesel Details |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=2012-05-29}}</ref>\n\n===Petrol/gasoline engine with pressure-charging===\nIn a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] or [[Supercharger|supercharged]] gasoline engine, the CR is customarily built at 10.5:1 or lower. This is due to the turbocharger/supercharger already having compressed the air before it enters the cylinders. Port fuel injected engines typically run lower boost than direct fuel injected engines because port [[fuel injection]] allows the air/fuel mixture to be heated together which leads to detonation. Conversely, directly injected engines can run higher boost because heated air will not detonate without a fuel being present. In this instance fuel is injected as late as 60 degrees before [[top dead center]] to avoid heating the mixture to the point of compression ignition.\n\n===Petrol/gasoline engine for racing===\nMotorcycle racing engines can use compression ratios as high as 14.7:1, and it is common to find motorcycles with compression ratios above 12.0:1 designed for 86 or 87 octane fuel. F1 engines come closer to 17:1, which is critical for maximizing volumetric/fuel efficiency at around 18,000 RPM.{{citation needed|reason=no source found for quoted compression ratio|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Ethanol and methanol engines===\n\nEthanol and methanol can take significantly higher compression ratios than gasoline. Racing engines burning [[methanol]] and [[ethanol fuel]] often incorporate a CR of 14.5-16:1.\n\n===Gas-fueled engine===\nThe CR may be higher in engines running exclusively on [[Autogas|LPG]] or [[compressed natural gas|CNG]], due to the higher octane rating of these fuels.\n\n===Diesel engine===\nThere is no spark plug in an auto-ignition [[diesel engine]]; the [[heat of compression]] raises the temperature of the air in the cylinder sufficiently to ignite the diesel when this is injected into the cylinder; after the compression stroke. The CR will customarily exceed 14:1 and ratios over 22:1 are common. The appropriate compression ratio depends on the design of the cylinder head. The figure is usually between 14:1 and 23:1 for direct injection engines, and between 18:1 and 23:1 for [[indirect injection]].And also in crdi injection.\n\n===Kerosene engine===\nA compression ratio of 6.5 or lower is desired for operation on [[kerosene]]. The [[petrol-paraffin engine]] version of the [[Ferguson TE20]] tractor had a compression ratio of 4.5:1 for operation on [[tractor vaporising oil]] with an [[octane rating]] between 55 and 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tractorbits.com/infofiles/TVO.asp |title=Tractor Vaporising Oil |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-04-18 |accessdate=2014-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012012756/http://tractorbits.com/infofiles/TVO.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Fault finding and diagnosis==\nMeasuring the compression [[pressure]] of an engine, with a [[pressure gauge]] connected to the [[spark plug]] opening, gives an indication of the engine's state and quality. There is, however, no formula to calculate compression ratio based on cylinder pressure.\n\nIf the nominal compression ratio of an engine is given, the pre-ignition cylinder pressure can be estimated using the following relationship:\n\n:<math>p = p_0 \\times \\text{CR}^\\gamma</math>\n\nwhere <math>p_0\\;</math> is the cylinder pressure at bottom dead center which is usually at 1 atm, <math>\\text{CR}</math> is the compression ratio, and <math>\\gamma\\;</math> is the [[specific heat ratio]] for the working fluid, which is about 1.4 for air, and 1.3 for methane-air mixture.\n\nFor example, if an engine running on gasoline has a compression ratio of 10:1, the cylinder pressure at top dead center is\n\n:<math> p_\\text{TDC} = 1 \\text{ bar} \\times 10^{1.4} = 25.1 \\text{ bar}</math>\n\nThis figure, however, will also depend on cam (i.e. valve) timing. Generally, cylinder pressure for common automotive designs should at least equal 10 [[bar (unit)|bar]], or, roughly estimated in [[pounds per square inch]] (psi) as between 15 and 20 times the compression ratio, or in this case between 150 psi and 200 psi, depending on cam timing. Purpose-built racing engines, stationary engines etc. will return figures outside this range.\n\nFactors including late intake valve closure (relatively speaking for camshaft profiles outside of typical production-car range, but not necessarily into the realm of competition engines) can produce a misleadingly low figure from this test. Excessive [[connecting rod]] clearance, combined with extremely high [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]] output (rare but not impossible) can sling enough oil to coat the cylinder walls with sufficient oil to facilitate reasonable [[piston ring]] sealing.  In engines with compromised ring seals, this can artificially give a misleadingly high compression figure.\n\nThis phenomenon can actually be used to some slight advantage. If a compression test does give a low figure, and it has been determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark plug orifice, in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top ring land, and thereby affect the mentioned seal. If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or, rarer still, cylinder-wall damage) issue.\n\nIf there is a significant (greater than 10%) difference between cylinders, that may be an indication that [[poppet valve|valves]] or [[cylinder head]] [[gasket]]s are leaking, [[piston]] rings are worn, or that the [[cylinder block|block]] is cracked.\n\nIf a problem is suspected, then a more comprehensive test using a [[leak-down tester]] can locate the leak.\n\n==Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) engines==\nBecause cylinder-bore diameter, piston-stroke length and combustion-chamber volume are almost always constant, the compression ratio for a given engine is almost always constant, until engine wear takes its toll.\n\nOne exception is the [[experiment]]al [[Saab Variable Compression engine]] (SVC). This engine, designed by [[Saab Automobile]], uses a technique that dynamically alters the volume of the combustion chamber (V<sub>c</sub>), which, via the above equation, changes the compression ratio (CR).\n\nThe [[Atkinson cycle]] engine was one of the first attempts at [[Variable compression ratio|variable compression]].  Since the compression ratio is the ratio between dynamic and static volumes of the combustion chamber, the Atkinson cycle's method of increasing the length of the power stroke compared to the intake stroke ultimately altered the compression ratio at different stages of the cycle.\n\nOn August 15, 2016 Nissan Motor Company announced a new variable compression engine that can choose an optimal compression ratio variably between 8:1 and 14:1. That lets the engine adjust moment by moment to torque demands, always maintaining top efficiency. Nissan says that the turbo-charged, 2-liter, four-cylinder VC-T engine averages 27 percent better fuel economy than the 3.5-liter V6 engine it replaces, with comparable power and torque.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/infiniti-vc-t-variable-compression-ratio-engine/44893/|title=Turbo power meets extreme efficiency: Infiniti unveils world's first production engine with variable compression ratios|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012075110/https://newatlas.com/infiniti-vc-t-variable-compression-ratio-engine/44893/|archive-date=2017-10-12|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref>\n\n==Dynamic compression ratio==\nThe calculated compression ratio, as given above, presumes that the cylinder is sealed at the bottom of the stroke, and that the volume compressed is the actual volume.\n\nHowever: intake valve closure (sealing the cylinder) always takes place after BDC, which may cause some of the intake charge to be compressed backwards out of the cylinder by the rising piston at very low speeds; only the percentage of the stroke after intake valve closure is compressed. Intake port tuning and scavenging may allow a greater mass of charge (at a higher than atmospheric pressure) to be trapped in the cylinder than the static volume would suggest ( This \"corrected\" compression ratio is commonly called the \"''dynamic compression ratio''\".\n\nThis ratio is higher with more conservative (i.e., earlier, soon after BDC) intake cam timing, and lower with more radical (i.e., later, long after BDC) intake cam timing, but always lower than the static or \"nominal\" compression ratio.\n\nThe actual position of the piston can be determined by trigonometry, using the stroke length and the [[connecting rod]] length (measured between centers). The absolute cylinder pressure is the result of an exponent of the dynamic compression ratio. This exponent is a polytropic value for the ratio of variable heats for air and similar gases at the temperatures present. This compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder. Under ideal (adiabatic) conditions, the exponent would be 1.4, but a lower value, generally between 1.2 and 1.3 is used, since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design, size and materials used, but provides useful results for purposes of comparison. For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the dynamic compression ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be (7.5)^1.3 \u00d7 atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 [[bar (unit)|bar]]. (\u00d7 14.7 psi at sea level = 201.8 psi. The pressure shown on a gauge would be the absolute pressure less atmospheric pressure, or 187.1 psi.)\n\nThe two corrections for dynamic compression ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions, but not in equal strength. An engine with high static compression ratio and late intake valve closure will have a DCR similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier intake valve closure.\n\nAdditionally, the cylinder pressure developed when an engine is running will be higher than that shown in a compression test for several reasons.\n\n*The much higher velocity of a piston when an engine is running versus cranking allows less time for pressure to bleed past the piston rings into the crankcase.\n*a running engine is coating the cylinder walls with much more oil than an engine that is being cranked at low RPM, which helps the seal.\n*the higher temperature of the cylinder will create higher pressures when running vs. a static test, even a test performed with the engine near [[operating temperature]].\n* A running engine does not stop taking air & fuel into the cylinder when the piston reaches BDC; The mixture that is rushing into the cylinder during the downstroke develops momentum and continues briefly after the vacuum ceases (in the same respect that rapidly opening a door will create a draft that continues after movement of the door ceases).  This is called scavenging.  Intake tuning, cylinder head design, valve timing and exhaust tuning determine how effectively an engine scavenges.\n\n==Compression ratio versus overall pressure ratio==\n[[File:Compression ratio versus pressure ratio.png|thumb|Compression ratio versus pressure ratio]]\n\nCompression ratio and [[overall pressure ratio]] are interrelated as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Compression ratio\n|| 2:1  || 3:1 || 5:1 || 10:1 || 15:1 || 20:1 || 25:1 || 35:1\n|-\n! Pressure ratio\n|| 2.64:1 || 4.66:1 ||9.52:1 || 25.12:1 || 44.31:1 || 66.29:1 || 90.60:1 || 145:1\n|}\n\nThe reason for this difference is that compression ratio is defined via the volume reduction:\n: <math>\\text{CR}=\\frac{V_1}{V_2}</math>,\nwhile pressure ratio is defined as the [[pressure]] increase:\n: <math>\\text{PR}=\\frac{P_2}{P_1}</math>.\nIn calculating the pressure ratio, we assume that an [[adiabatic compression]] is carried out (i.e. that no heat energy is supplied to the gas being compressed, and that any temperature rise is solely due to the compression). We also assume that air is a perfect gas. With these two assumptions, we can define the relationship between change of volume and change of pressure as follows:\n: <math>P_1 V_1^\\gamma = P_2 V_2^\\gamma \\Rightarrow\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1}= \\left( \\frac{V_1}{V_2} \\right)^\\gamma </math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[ratio of specific heats]] (air: approximately 1.4).\nThe values in the table above are derived using this formula. Note that in reality the ratio of specific heats changes with temperature and that significant deviations from adiabatic behavior will occur.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mean effective pressure]]\n* [[Overall pressure ratio]] - a closely related ratio for jet engines\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=YyQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA166&dq=1949+Popular+Science+%22Popular+Science%22+first+flat+top+ever+designed&hl=en&ei=32DGTNGkGcL9nAeD9JChAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true '' \"Here Comes High Compression Engines \" ''] 1949 highly detailed article in Popular Science with photos and cutaway drawings\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050311210702/http://www.fs.isy.liu.se/Lab/SVC/ Variable compression engine]\n*[http://victorylibrary.com/mopar/cam-tech.htm Cam Timing vs. Compression Ratio Analysis]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090907212047/http://s-86.com/s-cr.html Calculating Compression Ratio changes with engine modifications]\n\n{{Aircraft piston engine components}}\n{{Automotive engine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Compression Ratio}}\n[[Category:Piston engines]]\n[[Category:Engine technology]]\n[[Category:Engineering ratios]]", "sha1": "m4ck2fu822pg5izzm5etl9raty11nst"}}, {"title": "Chromosome walking", "ns": "0", "id": "6864", "redirect": {"title": "Primer walking"}, "revision": {"id": "391999381", "parentid": "94180554", "timestamp": "2010-10-21T09:45:30Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision from [[:nost:Chromosome walking]]: import old edit, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[primer walking]]", "sha1": "3t91h88isveflcpb0ikeh467zfpl4av"}}, {"title": "Concordat of Worms", "ns": "0", "id": "6865", "revision": {"id": "863672289", "parentid": "863672161", "timestamp": "2018-10-12T07:36:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jim1138", "id": "7695475"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/49.144.201.214|49.144.201.214]] ([[User talk:49.144.201.214|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Kaiser Heinrich V. besucht seinen Vater im Gef\u00e4ngnis.jpg|right|thumb|In 1122, [[Henry&nbsp;V, Holy Roman Emperor]] entered into an agreement with [[Pope Callixtus II]] known as the Concordat of Worms.]]\nThe '''Concordat of Worms''' ({{lang-la|Concordatum Wormatiense}}),<ref>Attestatio nominis [https://books.google.at/books?id=AEFDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR5&lpg=PR5&dq=concordatum+Wormatiense&source=bl&ots=kTuqJPCgjn#v=onepage&q=concordatum%20Wormatiense&f=false E.

Browne observes that the term ''[[concordat]]'' was not in use until [[Nicolas of Cusa]]'s ''De concordantia catholica''.<ref>{{harvp|Browne|1922}}</ref>}} was an agreement between [[Pope Callixtus&nbsp;II]] and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]] on September&nbsp;23, 1122, near the city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. It brought to an end the first phase of the power struggle between the [[Papacy]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and has been interpreted{{efn|De Mesquita's thesis is that \"the development of important institutions of the modern sovereign state are partially an endogenous product of strategic manoeuvring between the Catholic Church and European kings over political control within their domains\".<ref>{{harvp|de Mesquita|2000|p=93}}</ref>}} as containing within itself the germ of [[Sovereignty|nation-based sovereignty]] that would one day be confirmed in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648). In part this was an unforeseen result of strategic maneuvering between the Church and the European sovereigns over political control within their domains. The King was recognised as having the right to invest bishops with secular authority (\"by the lance\") in the territories they governed, but not with sacred authority (\"by ring and [[crozier|staff]]\"). The result was that bishops owed allegiance in worldly matters both to the pope and to the king, for they were obliged to affirm the right of the sovereign to call upon them for military support, under his oath of fealty. Previous Holy Roman Emperors had thought it their right, granted by God, to name Church officials within their territories (such as bishops) and to confirm the Papal election (and, at times of extraordinary urgency, actually name popes). In fact, the Emperors had been heavily relying on bishops for their secular administration, as they were not hereditary or quasi-hereditary nobility with family interests. A more immediate result of the Investiture struggle identified a proprietary right that adhered to sovereign territory, recognising the right of kings to income from the territory of a vacant diocese and a basis for justifiable taxation. These rights lay outside [[feudalism]], which defined authority in a hierarchy of personal relations, with only a loose relation to territory.<ref>{{harvp|de Mesquita|2000|p=95}}</ref> The pope emerged as a figure above and out of the direct control of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nFollowing efforts by Lamberto Scannabecchi (later [[Pope Honorius II]]) and the [[Diet of W\u00fcrzburg]] (1121) in 1122, Pope Callixtus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V entered into an agreement that effectively ended the [[Investiture Controversy]]. By the terms of the agreement, the election of bishops and abbots in Germany was to take place in the emperor's presence as judge between potentially disputing parties, [[simony|free of bribes]], thus retaining to the emperor a crucial role in choosing these great territorial magnates of the Empire. Beyond the borders of Germany, in [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]], the Emperor was to forward the symbols of authority within six months. Callixtus' reference to the feudal homage due the emperor on appointment is guarded: \"shall do unto thee for these what he rightfully should\" was the wording of the ''privilegium'' granted by Callixtus. The Emperor's right to a substantial imbursement on the election of a bishop or abbot was specifically denied.\n\nThe Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and [[crosier]], the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration. The two ended by granting one another peace.\n\nThe Concordat was confirmed by the [[First Council of the Lateran]] in 1123.\n\nThe Concordat of Worms was a part of the larger reforms put forth by many popes, most notably [[Pope Gregory VII]]. These included the reinforcement of [[Clerical celibacy|celibacy of the clergy]], end of [[simony]] and autonomy of the Church from secular leaders (lack of autonomy was known as [[lay investiture]]).\n\n==Inheritance and alienation==\nThe most prized and contested rights that attached to [[benefices]] were inheritance and security against confiscation. Benefices were lands granted by the Church to faithful lords. In exchange, the Church expected rent or other services, such as military protection. These lands would then be further divided between lesser lords and commoners. This was the nature of European [[feudalism]]. Inheritance was an important issue, since land could fall into the hands of those who did not have loyalty to the Church or the great lords. The usual grant was ''[[precaria|in precaria]]'', the granting of a [[life tenure]], whereby the tenant stayed on the land only at the pleasure of the lord. The tenant could be expelled from the land at any time. His tenancy was ''precarious''. Counts\u2019 benefices came to be inherited as counties were broken up and as counts assimilated their offices and ex-officio lands to their family property. In central Europe, kings and counts probably were willing to allow the inheritance of small parcels of land to the heirs of those who had offered military or other services in exchange for tenancy. This was contingent on the heirs being reasonably loyal and capable. Churches in Germany, as elsewhere, were willing to allow peasants to inherit their land. This was a source of profit to both churches and lords when the inheritors were charged a fee to inherit the land. Most bishops had a different attitude toward freemen and nobles. To these peasants, grants were made ''in precario'' or ''in beneficio'', usually for a specified and limited number of ''life tenures''. It was not impossible to recover land left to noble families for generations. But the longer the family held church land, the more difficult it was to oust them from the land. Some church officials came to view granting land to noble families amounted to outright alienation.<ref>Urkundenbuch mittelrhein. Terr., I. No. 168,;</ref><ref>Dip. Hein. II, no, 433</ref><ref>Reg. Hist. Westfaliae, no. 198</ref><ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1994|p=430}}</ref> By the twelfth century great churches in Germany, like those elsewhere were finding it difficult to hold out against the accumulation of lay custom and lay objections to temporary inheritance. The Bishop of Worms issued a statement in 1120 indicating the poor and unfree should be allowed to inherit tenancy without payment of fees. It appears to have been something novel.<ref name=\"Reynolds_431\">{{harvp|Reynolds|1994|p=431}}</ref> The growing masses of unfree and the marginal were needed for labour, and to bolster the military of both nobility and the church. By the time of Henry IV, bargaining by the peasants for the benefit of the group was the norm.<ref name=\"Reynolds_431\"/><ref>Dip. Hein. IV, no. 125</ref>\n\n==Gregorian Reform==\n[[Image:Gregory_VII.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Pope Gregory VII]] began reforms that led to the Concordat of Worms.]]\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of [[Ottonian dynasty]], when they came to the throne, believed they should have the power to appoint the pope. They also believed they should appoint minor church officials. The result was that, more often than not, bishops, abbots of monasteries, and even the pope were not independent, but resembled lackeys or sycophants of the crown of the Holy Roman Empire. This attitude was bolstered by the general conception that the Holy Roman Emperor and all other European Kings were chosen by God to be leaders.\n\nFor temporal secular reasons, the kings did nothing to dispel this attitude. It meant more power for them. A series of popes began to directly challenge this condition. The most vocal and strident was [[Pope Gregory VII]]. Reform took a century, but brought greater autonomy for the papacy and the Church in general.\n\nIn the period immediately after 1000, two figures appeared to lead Western Christendom, the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. Antagonism between the two dominated the next century. After the death of [[Pope Sylvester II]] in 1003, the papacy fell under the influence of the nobility in Latium, and then after 1046, under the influence of the German emperors. The reality for the west in the Middle Ages was not only the fact that government was split up into small particles but also the fact that vertical and horizontal powers were entangled. People in the Middle Ages did not always know to which of the many lords, the Church and the individual churches, the towns, princes, and kings, they were subordinate. This can be observed in the complexity even at the administrative and judicial level in the jurisdictional conflicts that fill mediaeval history.<ref name=\"LeGoff96\">{{harvp|Le Goff|1964|p=96}}</ref>\n\nThe Church endeavoured to become disengaged from the German control. An example of this secular politicisation is seen when [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]] supported [[Pope Benedict IX]], the most corrupt of any of the popes of the era. It took more than a century to end this manipulation, and was never complete. In the process, the whole Church emerged freed from the grip of all lay lords. This was known as the [[Gregorian Reform]], which takes its name from [[Pope Gregory VII]], (1073\u201385). It was merely the latest and most visible of reforms that tended to move the Church back to its roots. It was a question of restoring the autonomy and power of the priestly class in the face of increasing control by the warrior class.<ref name=\"LeGoff96\"/> The clergy was forced to renew and define itself. There was a battle against [[simony]]. The roadmap to celibacy was drawn, if not immediately enacted. Monarchs were excluded from selecting popes. This had been decreed by [[Pope Nicholas II]] in 1059. Afterwards, only cardinals could elect the pope. Gregorian Reform reiterated this notion. There was to be no more lay interference in the selection of clergy. The aim was to deprive emperors and their under-lords the right to nominate and invest bishops. The effect was to deprive lay kings power over the Church and increase both spiritual and temporal power in the Vatican and the bishops.<ref name=\"LeGoff96\"/>\n\nGregory VII appeared to have succeeded when the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] was humiliated at Canossa in 1077. There, Henry begged in the snow to be let back into the good graces of the Church, having been excommunicated the year before by Gregory. The penitent and humbled emperor did not remain in that state. Soon Henry IV took his revenge. He named his own pope [[Antipope Clement III]] in the old manner of the Holy Roman Emperors. [[Pope Urban II]], more prudent than Gregory sidestepped the issue using a Crusade to gather Christian Europe together under his authority. A compromise was reached in Worms in 1122, by which the emperor abandoned investiture \u201cby ring and staff\u201d to the pope, and promised to respect the freedom of elections and consecrations, but kept for himself the right to invest bishops with the temporalities of their sees \u201cby scepter\u201d.<ref name=\"LeGoff96\"/> Though the Emperor retained some power over imperial churches, his power was damaged irreparably because he lost the religious authority that previously belonged to the office of the king. In France, England, and the Christian state in Spain, the king could overcome rebellions of his magnates and establish the power of his royal demesne because he could rely on the Church, which, for several centuries, had given him a mystical authority. From time to time, rebellious and recalcitrant monarchs might run afoul of the Church. These could be excommunicated, and after an appropriate time and public penance, be received back into the communion and good graces of the Church.<ref name=\"Davis_256\">{{harvp|Davis|1966|p=256}}</ref>\n\n==Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor==\n[[Image:Canossa-three.jpg|left|thumb|Henry IV begging forgiveness of Pope Gregory VII at [[Canossa]], the castle of the Countess Matilda, 1077.]]\nIn 1075, Gregory VII condemned lay investiture in a document called [[Dictatus papae]]. The new doctrine was called [[libertas ecclesiae]] (\"freedom of the Church\"). Henry IV insisted on involvement in clerical appointment. The dispute revolved around the issue of investiture\u2014i.e., whether the Holy Roman Emperor had the right to name bishops as well as popes.<ref name=\"Dahmus_228_229\">{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref> Gregory VII excommunicated Henry IV in 1076, releasing all Henry's subjects from obedience to him. This led to a great political struggle, with many barons rising against Henry in open rebellion. Henry made his way to the Canossa where the Pope was staying in the castle of Countess Matilda. Henry claimed a wish to repent. The pope was suspicious of Henry\u2019s motives, and did not believe he was truly repentant. Henry did penance in the snow outside the castle for three days. Finally, Gregory gave him absolution. The rebellious nobles in Germany who were interested in deposing Henry IV never forgave Pope Gregory VII for what they viewed as treachery.\n\nHenry IV was excommunicated again in 1080, and would not show any indication of repentance. In turn, Henry called a council of bishops who proclaimed Gregory illegitimate. He remained excommunicate for twenty-six years until his death in 1106.<ref name=\"Davis_256\"/> It was the consequence of this lengthy episode that a whole generation grew up in Germany and Northern Italy in an atmosphere of war, doubt and scepticism. The papal backers had been busy propounding arguments to show that royal power was not of divine origin. They had been so successful that the [[moral authority]] of the Emperor had been undermined in the minds of many of his subjects. Serious divisions existed from this battle over the Investiture Controversy, which fractured large portions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Germany and Italy. Davis argues these rifts were so deep and lasting that neither Germany nor Italy were able to form a cohesive nation state until the 19th century. A similar situation arose from the French revolution, which caused fractures in France that still exist.<ref>{{harvp|Davis|1966|pp=256, 257}}</ref> The effect of Henry\u2019s excommunication, and his subsequent refusal to repent left a turbulence in central Europe that lasted throughout the Middle Ages. It may have been emblematic of certain German attitudes toward religion in general, and the perceived relevance of the German Emperor in the universal scheme of things.\n\nHenry IV became so filled with hubris over his position, that he renounced Gregory VII and named the bishop of Ravenna pope. Perhaps he was only following what had been thought to be the right of kings: to name the pope. Henry had invested the Ravenna bishop, and now he referred to the new pope, Clement III, [[Antipope Clement III]] as \"our pope\". Henry attacked Rome, and on the outskirts of the city gained thirteen cardinals who became loyal to his cause. On Palm Sunday, 1084, Henry IV solemnly enthroned Clement at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and on Easter Day, Clement returned the favour and crowned Henry IV as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Gregory VII was meanwhile still resisting a few hundred yards away from the basilica in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], then known as the house of [[Cencius]].<ref>{{harvp|Davis|1966|pp=252, 253}}</ref> Gregory appealed to the Normans for help, and [[Robert Guiscard]] responded, entering Rome on May 27, 1084 and rescuing him.<ref>But see {{harvp|Joranson|1948|pp=373\u2013375}}</ref>[[Image:Clement III - Antipope.jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary illustration of Henry IV (left) and Anti-pope Clement III (centre).]] In the process, Rome was pillaged and partially burned. Gregory VII died the next year on May 25, 1085 in exile. He felt all was lost. The last words he uttered were, \"I have loved justice and hated iniquity, and therefore I die in exile.\"<ref name=\"Davis_253_254\">{{harvp|Davis|1966|pp=253\u2013254}}</ref> Gregory VII must have felt he died in utter failure, and to many of his contemporaries it appeared Henry IV and Antipope Clement III had won. But the underlying current was that Henry had overreached, and his appointment of the antipope was beyond the pale. Upon the death of Gregory, the cardinals elected a new pope, [[Pope Victor III]]. He owed his elevation to the influence of the Normans. Antipope Clement III still occupied St. Peter\u2019s. When Victor III died, the cardinals elected [[Pope Urban II]] (1088\u201399). He was one of three men Gregory VII suggested as his successor. Urban II preached the First Crusade, which united Western Europe, and more importantly, reconciled the majority of bishops who had abandoned Gregory VII. In the end, Gregorian Reform won out over Henry IV.<ref name=\"Davis_253_254\"/> Preaching the Crusade had one important consequence. The pope was now viewed as the head of the Church. No longer would kings and emperors think themselves equals of the pope, or the head of the Church in their kingdom. This was the situation from 1122 until the [[Reformation]].<ref>{{harvp|Davis|1966|p=255}}</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, Henry IV died in a deep gloom, as had Gregory. It remained for his successor, Henry V to agree with Pope Callixtus II in 1122 to a compromise of the conflict over lay investitures known as the Concordat of Worms.<ref name=\"Dahmus_228_229\"/>\n\nThe reign of Henry IV showed the weakness of the German monarchy. The ruler was dependent upon the good will of the great men, the nobility of his land. These were technically royal officials and hereditary princes. He was also dependent on the resources of the churches. Henry IV alienated the Church of Rome and many of the magnates in his own kingdom. Many of these spent years in open or subversive rebellion. Henry failed to create a proper bureaucracy to replace his disobedient vassals. The magnates became increasingly independent, and the Church withdrew support. Henry IV spent the last years of his life desperately grasping to keep his throne. It was a greatly diminished kingdom.<ref name=\"Strayer_215_216\">{{harvp|Strayer|1959|pp=215\u2013216}}</ref>\n\n==Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor==\n[[Image:Flag Germany Emperors Banner.svg|thumb|left| The German Emperors flew this banner prior to 1300.]]\nThe reign of Henry IV ended with a diminished kingdom and waning power. Many of his underlords had been in constant or desultory revolt for years. Henry IV\u2019s insistence that [[Antipope Clement III]] was the real pope had initially been popular with some of the nobles, and even many of the bishops of Germany. But as years passed, this support was slowly withdrawn. The idea that the German king could and should name the pope was increasingly discredited and viewed as an anachronism from a by-gone era. The Empire of the Ottos was virtually lost because of Henry IV.\n\nHenry IV's son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], rebelled and became emperor after his father's abdication. Henry V realised swift action and a change in his father's policy was necessary. [[Pope Paschal II]] rebuked Henry V for appointing bishops in Germany. The king crossed the Alps with an army in 1111. The pope, who was weak and had few supporters was forced to suggest a compromise, the abortive '''Concordat of 1111'''. Its simple and radical solution<ref>\"Simple and radical\": [[Norman F. Cantor]], 1993. ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'' p.262.</ref> of the Investiture Controversy between the prerogatives of ''regnum'' and ''sacredoium'' proposed that German churchmen would surrender their lands and secular offices to the emperor and constitute a purely spiritual church. Henry gained greater control over the lands of his kingdom, especially those that had been in the hands of the church, but of contested title. He would not interfere with ecclesiastical affairs and churchmen would avoid secular services. The church would be given autonomy and to Henry V would be restored large parts of his empire that his father had lost. Henry V was crowned by Pope Paschal II as the legitimate Holy Roman Emperor. When the concessions of land were read in St. Peters, the crowd revolted in anger. Henry took the pope and cardinals hostage until the pope granted Henry V the right of investiture. Then he returned to Germany \u2013 crowned emperor and apparent victor over the papacy.<ref>{{harvp|Strayer|1959|p=215}}</ref>\n\nThe victory was as short-lived as that of his father, Henry IV over Gregory VII. The clergy urged Paschal to rescind his agreement, which he did in 1112. The quarrel followed the predictable course: Henry V rebelled and was excommunicated. Riots broke out in Germany, a new [[Antipope Gregory VIII]] was appointed by the German king, nobles loyal to Rome seceded from Henry. The civil war continued, just as under Henry IV. It dragged on for another ten years. Like his father before him, Henry V was faced with waning power. He had no choice but to give up investiture and the old right of naming the pope. The Concordat of Worms was the result. After the Concordat, the German kings never had the same control over the Church as had existed in the time of the Ottonian dynasty.<ref name=\"Strayer_215_216\"/>\n\nHenry V died without heirs in 1125, three years after the Concordat. He had designated his nephew, Frederick von Staufen duke of [[Swabia]], also known as [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia]] as his successor. Instead, churchmen elected [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]]. A long civil war erupted between the Staufen also known as [[Hohenstaufen]] supporters and the heirs of Lothar III. The result was the Hohenstaufen [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] 1152\u20131190 who came to power.<ref>{{harvp|Jordan|2003|p=146}}</ref>\n\n==Charter of Liberties==\n[[Image:La Tour Saint-Nicolas.jpg|thumb|right|The agreement reached at [[Bec Abbey]] in 1107 was essentially the same as the Concordat of Worms.]]\n\nThe Concordat of Worms was foreshadowed by the [[Charter of Liberties]] of [[Henry I of England]]. He was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]]. Through a series of political intrigues, Henry I gained the English throne in 1100. Henry had three problems:\n# Conflict with the Church and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] in particular.\n#The earls and barons of England did not accept Henry as their king.\n#The Anglo-Saxon populace did not accept him.\n\nHenry reconciled with the Church and Anselm. He married Edith, the daughter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]]. The Anglo-Saxon population was placated because they viewed Edith as one of their own. Henry signed and issued the [[Charter of Liberties]] in 1100 from the Norman Chapel in the Tower of London. This gave concessions to the earls and barons, as well as the Church. The investiture issue was still contentious, but a compromise at [[Bec Abbey]] in 1107 was essentially identical to the Concordat of Worms.<ref>{{harvp|Fawtier|1964|p=31}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|p=290}}</ref>\n\n==Concordat of London, 1107==\nThe Concordat of London in 1107 was a forerunner of the compromise that was taken up in the Concordat of Worms. In England, as in Germany, the conflict between Church and State was rife. A distinction was being made in the king's chancery between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates. Bowing to political reality, [[Henry I of England]] ceded his right to invest his bishops and abbots and reserved the custom of requiring them to come and do homage. The system of [[vassal]]age was not divided among great local lords in England as it was in France, for by right of the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] the king was in control.\n\n[[Henry I of England]] perceived a danger in placing monastic scholars in his chancery and turned increasingly to secular clerks, some of whom held minor positions in the Church. He often rewarded these men with the titles of bishop and abbot. Henry I expanded the system of [[scutage]] to reduce the monarchy's dependence on knights supplied from church lands. Unlike the situation in Germany, [[Henry I of England]] used the Investiture Controversy to strengthen the secular power of the king. It would continue to boil under the surface. The controversy would surface in the [[Thomas Becket]] affair under [[Henry II of England]], the [[Great Charter#The Charters 1217: the origins of the name Magna Carta|Great Charter of 1217]], the [[Statutes of Mortmain]] and the battles over [[Cestui que]] use of [[Henry VII of England]], and finally come to a head under [[Henry VIII of England]].\n\n==Result of the Concordat of Worms==\n[[Image:Wormser Dom Seitenansicht.jpg|right|thumb|The Cathedral of Worms was 10 years old when the Concordat was issued there in 1122.]]\n\nOf the three reforms Gregory VII and his predecessors and successor popes had attempted, they had been most successful in regard to celibacy of the clergy. Simony had been partially checked. Against lay investiture they won only a limited success, and one that seemed less impressive as the years passed. During the time following the Concordat of Worms, the Church gained in both stature and power.<ref>{{harvp|Thorndike|1956|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the terms of the compromise, the election of bishops and abbots was to follow proper procedure, that is, the canons of the cathedral were to elect the bishop. The monks were to choose the abbot, and only ecclesiastical superiors were to invest the candidate with ring and staff (the traditional insignia of the episcopal office). This was a minimum that the church had demanded (who had far fewer problems with a mere nomination by a layman if the layman did not actually hand over ring and staff). To make up for this and symbolise the ''worldly'' authority of the bishop which the pope had always recognised to derive from the Emperor, another symbol, the scepter, was invented, which would be handed over by the king (or his legate). The rest is an actual compromise: In ''Germany'', the Emperor (or his legate) would have the right to be present at elections to resolve any disputes between candidates (\"yet without violence\"). What this meant, in effect, was that the king would have the bishop he wanted (though over time, the territorial princes would get some \"representation\" within the chapters, making it less easy to ignore them). The bishop-elect would then by invested by the Emperor (or representative) with the scepter and, sometime afterwards, by his ecclesial superior with ring and staff. As [[William of Champeaux]] assured Henry V, he had nothing to lose by surrendering the right of investiture. The king retained substantially what he already possessed\u2014the power to fill bishoprics with men of his choice. Nevertheless, Gregory VII\u2019s dramatisation of the issue produced a significant improvement in the character of men raised to the episcopacy. Kings no longer interfered so frequently in their election, and when they did, they generally nominated more worthy candidates for the office.<ref>{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|p=229}}</ref>\n\nThis takes only Germany into account, though. As for Burgundy and Italy, elections were to be held without interference by the Emperor, and consecration and investiture by the ecclesial superior would, here, precede the investiture with the scepter which was to follow some time afterwards. Thus, by the Pope accepting the German bishops to be nominated with a large amount of secular influence, his right was recognized to freely choose the bishops in the other parts of the Empire, especially in Imperial Italy at the very doors of the Papal States. To see in the Concordat of Worms mere face-saving of the Church is thus not correct.\n\nThe writing in the document was ambiguous, skirted some issues and avoided others all together. This has caused some scholars to conclude that the settlement turned its back on Gregory VII and Urban II's genuine hopes for reform. The emperor's influence in episcopal was preserved, and he could decide disputed elections. If the compromise was a rebuke to the most radical vision of the liberty of the Church, on at least one point its implication was firm and unmistakable: The king, even an emperor, was a layman, and his power at least morally limited (hence, [[totalitarianism]] was unacceptable). According to the opinion of W. Jordan, the [[divine right of kings]] was dealt a blow from which it never completely recovered,<ref>{{harvp|Jordan|2003|p=99}}</ref> yet it should be noted that unfettered authority and [[Caesaropapism]] was not something the later Mediaevals and Early Moderns understood by the phrase \"by the grace of God\" (which many of them ardently defended). If anything, a blow was dealt to subconsciously remaining pre-Christian Germanic feelings of \"royal hail\".\n\n[[Image:Fa\u00e7ade du Palais des Papes.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Avignon Papacy]] occurring several centuries after the Concordat, and indicated that there was continued interference in the papacy by kings.]]\n\nThere exists a misconception concerning the power of the pope in the Middle Ages. Tradition affords him more power and authority than he actually possessed. It is likely the pope in modern ages is much more powerful than those in mediaeval times. The most powerful of all mediaeval popes was [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]. His pronouncements on doctrinal matters and the judgments of his court were considered definitive and final. Opposing the mediaeval pope was the primary and unyielding authority of the state. The struggle over investiture between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] had dramatised the clash between church and state. The Concordat of Worms had eased the situation for a generation. But in the end, it solved nothing. Practically speaking, the king retained a decisive voice in the selection of the hierarchy. All kings supported [[King John of England]]\u2019s defiance of [[Pope Innocent III]] ninety years after the Concordat of Worms in the matter concerning [[Stephen Langton]]. In theory, the pope named his bishops and cardinals. In reality, more often than not, Rome consecrated the clergy once it was notified by the kings who the incumbent would be. Recalcitrance by Rome would lead to problems in the kingdom. For the most part it was a [[no-win situation]] for Rome. In this, the Concordat of Worms changed little. The growth of canon law in the [[Ecclesiastical Courts]] was based on the underlying Roman law and increased the strength of the Roman Pontiff.<ref>{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|p=320}}</ref>\n\nThe English Church was left more or less in the power of the English monarchy. This was the result of the [[Charter of Liberties]], 1100, and the agreement at [[Le Bec-Hellouin|Bec]] in 1107. The effect of the Concordat of Worms was different. It ended a civil war that had been going on for more than fifty years. There was no going back to the situation that had preceded it. The political and social structure of Germany had forever been altered. The new generation of cardinals regarded German investiture with contempt and as an embarrassing vestige of the past. They were willing to make concessions with Henry V and his successors in order to get along. The belief after the Concordat was that investiture and the era of theocratic kingship was a discredited doctrine. The German kings had a different view of the matter. Henry V and his successors still believed they had the right and ability to name bishops. In practice, this was true, but only in the territories held by their families. Their domain in the religious sphere had been greatly diminished.<ref>{{harvp|Cantor|1969|p=301}}</ref>\n\nThe catastrophic political consequences of the struggle between pope and emperor also led to a cultural disaster. Germany lost intellectual leadership in western Europe. In 1050, German monasteries were great centres of learning and art and German schools of theology and canon law were unsurpassed and probably unmatched anywhere in Europe. The long civil war over investiture sapped the energy of both German churchmen and intellectuals. They fell behind advances in philosophy, law, literature and art taking place in France and Italy. In many ways, Germany never caught up during the rest of the Middle Ages.<ref>{{harvp|Cantor|1969|p=303}}</ref> Universities were established in France, Italy and England by the early 13th century. Notable are [[University of Bologna]], 1088, [[University of Paris]], 1150, [[Oxford University]], 1167 and [[University of Cambridge]], 1207. The first German university, the [[Heidelberg University]] was not established until 1386. It was immediately steeped in mediaeval [[nominalism]] and early [[Protestantism]].\n\nKings continued to attempt to control either the direct leadership of the church, or indirectly through political means for centuries. This is seen most clearly in the [[Avignon Papacy]] when the popes moved from Rome to Avignon. The conflict in Germany and northern Italy arguably left the culture ripe for various Protestant sects, such as the [[Catharism|Cathars]], the [[Waldensians]] and ultimately [[Jan Hus]] and [[Martin Luther]].\n\n{{Wikisource|Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages/Book IV/Concordat of Worms|Concordat of Worms}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Charter of Liberties]]\n*[[List of medieval universities]]\n*[[Statutes of Mortmain]]\n*[[Quia Emptores]]\n*[[Cestui que]]\n*[[First Council of the Lateran]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Browne |first=P.&nbsp;W. |year=1922 |title=The Pactum Callixtinum: an innovation in Papal diplomacy |journal=The Catholic Historical Review |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=180\u2013190 |jstor=25011853 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cantor |first=Norman F. |year=1969 |title=Medieval History, The Life and Death of a Civilization |publisher=Macmilllan |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Dahmus |first=Joseph |year=1969 |title=The Middle Ages, A Popular History |publisher=Doubleday and Company |location=Garden City, NY |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Davis |first=R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C. |year=1966 |title=A History of Medieval Europe, From Constantine to Saint Louis |publisher=Longmans |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Fawtier |first=Robert |year=1964 |title=The Capetian Kings of France |location=London |publisher= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Joranson |first=Einar |year=1948 |title=The inception of the career of the Normans in Italy - legend and history |journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=353\u2013396 |jstor=2848427 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/2848427}}\n*{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=William Chester |year=2003 |title=Europe in the High Middle Ages |series=Penguin History of Europe |publisher=Viking |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Le Goff |first=Jacques |year=1964 |title=Medieval Civilization 400\u20131500 |publisher= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last=de Mesquita |first=Bruce Bueno |year=2000 |title=Popes, kings, and endogenous institutions: the Concordat of Worms and the origins of sovereignty |journal=International Studies Review |volume=2 |issue=2: Continuity and Change in the Westphalian Order |pages=93\u2013118 |jstor=3186429 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Susan |year=1994 |title=Fiefs and Vassals, The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Strayer |first=Joseph R. |year=1959 |title=The Middle Ages, 395\u20131500 |edition=4th |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Stroll |first=Mary |year=2004 |title=Calixtus II (1119\u20131124): A Pope Born to Rule |publisher=Brill |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Thorndike |first=Lynn |year=1956 |title=The History of Medieval Europe |edition=3rd |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n===Primary sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Bettenson, Henry, and Chris Maunder, eds.

Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct.\n\n==Examples==\n\nA model context-free language is <math>L = \\{a^nb^n:n\\geq1\\}</math>, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are {{mvar|a}}'s, and the entire second halves of which are {{mvar|b}}'s. {{mvar|L}} is generated by the grammar <math>S\\to aSb ~|~ ab</math>.\nThis language is not [[regular language|regular]].\nIt is accepted by the [[pushdown automaton#Formal definition|pushdown automaton]] <math>M=(\\{q_0,q_1,q_f\\}, \\{a,b\\}, \\{a,z\\}, \\delta, q_0, z, \\{q_f\\})</math> where <math>\\delta</math> is defined as follows:<ref group=note>meaning of <math>\\delta</math>'s arguments and results: <math>\\delta(\\mathrm{state}_1, \\mathrm{read}, \\mathrm{pop}) = (\\mathrm{state}_2, \\mathrm{push})</math></ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\delta(q_0, a, z) &= (q_0, az) \\\\\n\\delta(q_0, a, a) &= (q_0, aa) \\\\\n\\delta(q_0, b, a) &= (q_1, \\varepsilon) \\\\\n\\delta(q_1, b, a) &= (q_1, \\varepsilon) \\\\\n\\delta(q_1, \\varepsilon, z) &= (q_f, \\varepsilon)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nUnambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are [[Inherently ambiguous language|inherently ambiguous]] CFLs.

This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset <math>\\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n > 0\\}</math> which is the intersection of these two languages.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=100|loc=Theorem 4.7}}\n\n===Dyck language===\n\nThe [[Dyck language|language of all properly matched parentheses]] is generated by the grammar <math>S\\to SS ~|~ (S) ~|~ \\varepsilon</math>.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Context-free parsing===\n{{main|Parsing}}\n\nThe context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton.\n\nDetermining an instance of the [[membership problem]]; i.e. given a string <math>w</math>, determine whether <math>w \\in L(G)</math> where <math>L</math> is the language generated by a given grammar <math>G</math>; is also known as ''recognition''.

does not usually affect performance in learning and memory tasks, although caffeine may occasionally have facilitatory or inhibitory effects on memory and learning. Caffeine facilitates learning in tasks in which information is presented passively; in tasks in which material is learned intentionally, caffeine has no effect. Caffeine facilitates performance in tasks involving working memory to a limited extent, but hinders performance in tasks that heavily depend on this, and caffeine appears to improve memory performance under suboptimal alertness. Most studies, however, found improvements in reaction time. The ingestion of caffeine does not seem to affect long-term memory.&nbsp;...  Its indirect action on arousal, mood and concentration contributes in large part to its cognitive enhancing properties. }}</ref> The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance.<ref name=\"effects\" /> The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after about three or four hours.<ref name = \"Poleszak 2015\"/>\n\nCaffeine can delay or prevent [[sleep]] and improves task performance during sleep deprivation.<ref name=\"pmid21531247\">{{Cite book | first1 = Jan | last1 = Snel | first2 = Monicque M. | last2= Lorist | title = Effects of caffeine on sleep and cognition | journal = Progress in Brain Research | volume = 190 | pages = 105\u201317 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21531247 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-53817-8.00006-2 | isbn = 978-0-444-53817-8 }}</ref> Shift workers who use caffeine make fewer mistakes due to drowsiness.<ref name=\"pmid20464765\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ker | first1 = K | last2 = Edwards | first2 = PJ | last3= Felix | first3 = LM | last4 = Blackhall | first4 = K | last5 = Roberts | first5 = I | title = Caffeine for the prevention of injuries and errors in shift workers | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD008508 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20464765 | pmc = 4160007 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008508 | editor1-last = Ker | editor1-first = Katharine }}</ref>\n\nA [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] from 2014 found that concurrent caffeine and [[L-theanine|{{smallcaps all|L}}-theanine]] use has synergistic psychoactive effects that promote alertness, attention, and [[Task switching (psychology)|task switching]];<ref name=\"caffeine and theanine\" /> these effects are most pronounced during the first hour post-dose.<ref name=\"caffeine and theanine\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Camfield DA, Stough C, Farrimond J, Scholey AB | title = Acute effects of tea constituents L-theanine, caffeine, and epigallocatechin gallate on cognitive function and mood: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 507\u201322 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24946991 | doi = 10.1111/nure.12120 }}</ref>\n\n====Physical====\nCaffeine is a proven [[ergogenic aid]] in humans.<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" /> Caffeine improves athletic performance in [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] (especially [[endurance sports]]) and [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] conditions.<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pesta DH, Angadi SS, Burtscher M, Roberts CK | title = The effects of caffeine, nicotine, ethanol, and tetrahydrocannabinol on exercise performance | journal = Nutrition & Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 71 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24330705 | pmc = 3878772 | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-10-71 | quote = Caffeine-induced increases in performance have been observed in aerobic as well as anaerobic sports (for reviews, see [26,30,31]). Trained athletes seem to benefit from a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg [32], however, even lower doses of caffeine (1.0\u20132.0 mg/kg) may improve performance [33]. Some groups found significantly improved time trial performance [34] or maximal cycling power [35], most likely related to a greater reliance on fat metabolism and decreased neuromuscular fatigue, respectively. Theophylline, a metabolite of caffeine, seems to be even more effective in doing so [36]. The effect of caffeine on fat oxidation, however, may only be significant during lower exercise intensities and may be blocked at higher intensities [37].&nbsp;... For both caffeine-na\u00efve as well as caffeine-habituated subjects, moderate to high doses of caffeine are ergogenic during prolonged moderate intensity exercise [61].&nbsp;... In summary, caffeine, even at physiological doses (3\u20136 mg/kg), as well as coffee are proven ergogenic aids and as such \u2013 in most exercise situations, especially in endurance-type events \u2013 clearly work-enhancing [26]. It most likely has a peripheral effect targeting skeletal muscle metabolism as well as a central effect targeting the brain to enhance performance, especially during endurance events (see Table 1). Also for anaerobic tasks, the effect of caffeine on the CNS might be most relevant.&nbsp;... Muendel et al. [93] found a 17% improvement in time to exhaustion after nicotine patch application compared to a placebo without affecting cardiovascular and respiratory parameters or substrate metabolism. In this sense, nicotine seems to exert similar effects as caffeine by delaying the development of central fatigue as impaired central drive is an important factor contributing to fatigue during exercise.&nbsp;... The physiological effects of the above mentioned substances are well established. However, the ergogenic effect of some of the discussed drugs may be questioned and one has to consider the cohort tested for every specific substance. However, only caffeine has enough strength of evidence to be considered an ergogenic aid. }}</ref> Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5&nbsp;mg/kg<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" />) can improve sprint performance,<ref name=\"pmid21058748\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishop D | title = Dietary supplements and team-sport performance | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 995\u20131017 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21058748 | doi = 10.2165/11536870-000000000-00000 }}</ref> cycling and running time trial performance,<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" /> endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of [[muscle fatigue]] and [[central fatigue]]),<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" /><ref name=\"pmid21411838\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Conger SA, Warren GL, Hardy MA, Millard-Stafford ML | title = Does caffeine added to carbohydrate provide additional ergogenic benefit for endurance? | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 71\u201384 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21411838 | doi = 10.1123/ijsnem.21.1.71 }}</ref><ref name=\"Ergogenics\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liddle DG, Connor DJ | title = Nutritional supplements and ergogenic AIDS | journal = Primary Care | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 487\u2013505 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23668655 | doi = 10.1016/j.pop.2013.02.009 | quote = Amphetamines and caffeine are stimulants that increase alertness, improve focus, decrease reaction time, and delay fatigue, allowing for an increased intensity and duration of training&nbsp;...<br />Physiologic and performance effects<br />{{\u2022}}Amphetamines increase dopamine/norepinephrine release and inhibit their reuptake, leading to central nervous system (CNS) stimulation<br />{{\u2022}}Amphetamines seem to enhance athletic performance in anaerobic conditions 39 40<br />{{\u2022}}Improved reaction time<br />{{\u2022}}Increased muscle strength and delayed muscle fatigue<br />{{\u2022}}Increased acceleration<br />{{\u2022}}Increased alertness and attention to task }}</ref> and cycling power output.<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" /> Caffeine increases [[basal metabolic rate]] in adults.<ref name=\"pmid7369170\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Acheson KJ, Zahorska-Markiewicz B, Pittet P, Anantharaman K, J\u00e9quier E | title = Caffeine and coffee: their influence on metabolic rate and substrate utilization in normal weight and obese individuals | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 989\u201397 | date = May 1980 | pmid = 7369170 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/33.5.989 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7369170 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid2912010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dulloo AG, Geissler CA, Horton T, Collins A, Miller DS | title = Normal caffeine consumption: influence on thermogenesis and daily energy expenditure in lean and postobese human volunteers | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 44\u201350 | date = January 1989 | pmid = 2912010 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/49.1.44 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2912010 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid7486839\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koot P, Deurenberg P | title = Comparison of changes in energy expenditure and body temperatures after caffeine consumption | journal = Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 135\u201342 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7486839 | doi = 10.1159/000177854 }}</ref>\n\nCaffeine improves muscular strength and power,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grgic J, Trexler ET, Lazinica B, Pedisic Z | title = Effects of caffeine intake on muscle strength and power: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | volume = 15 | pages = 11 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29527137 | pmc = 5839013 | doi = 10.1186/s12970-018-0216-0 }}</ref> and may enhance muscular endurance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren GL, Park ND, Maresca RD, McKibans KI, Millard-Stafford ML | title = Effect of caffeine ingestion on muscular strength and endurance: a meta-analysis | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 1375\u201387 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20019636 | doi = 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181cabbd8 }}</ref> Caffeine also enhances performance on anaerobic tests.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grgic J | title = Caffeine ingestion enhances Wingate performance: a meta-analysis | journal = European Journal of Sport Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 219\u2013225 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29087785 | doi = 10.1080/17461391.2017.1394371 }}</ref> Caffeine consumption before constant load exercise is associated with reduced perceived exertion.

(2007) as 'nucleus accumbens shell,' where both studies show that caffeine does not modify the extracellular levels of dopamine. Therefore, the results of both experimental groups are basically the same and point to differential effects of caffeine in different striatal subcompartments. In fact, analyzing the effects of the intrastriatal perfusion of an A1 receptor antagonist in several other striatal compartments showed striking differences compared with the shell of the nucleus accumbens. Thus, A1 receptor blockade significantly increased the extracellular concentration of dopamine, but not glutamate, in the core of the nucleus accumbens and in the caudate\u2013putamen and the effect was more pronounced in the most medial compartments (Boryczet al. 2007). In summary, a subregional difference in the A1 receptor-mediated control of glutamate and dopamine release exists in the striatum&nbsp;... A2A receptors play a crucial role in the sleep-promoting effects of adenosine and the arousal-enhancing effects of caffeine (Huang et al. 2007; Ferr\u00e9 et al. 2007a). Those A2A receptors are localized in the ventrolateral pre-optic area of the hypothalamus and their stimulation promotes sleep by inducing GABA release in the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, thereby inhibiting the histaminergic arousal system&nbsp;... chronic caffeine exposure counteracts both motor activation and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens induced by caffeine or an A1 receptor antagonist&nbsp;... An additional factor that might play a significant role in caffeine tolerance is the significant increase in plasma and extracellular concentrations of adenosine with chronic caffeine exposure&nbsp;... The existence of an A1 receptor-mediated glutamate-independent modulation of dopamine release suggested the presence of functional A1 receptors in striatal dopaminergic terminals.&nbsp;... In the SSM, adenosine acts pre- and post-synaptically through multiple mechanisms, which depend on heteromerization of A1 and A2A receptors among themselves and with D1 and D2 receptors, respectively.

longest-lived [[List of notable artificial intelligence projects|artificial intelligence project]],{{fact|date=October 2018}} attempting to assemble a comprehensive [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] and [[knowledge base]] that spans the basic concepts and \"rules of thumb\" about how the world works (think [[common sense knowledge]] but focusing more on things that rarely get written down or said, in contrast with facts one might find somewhere on the internet or retrieve via Google or Wikipedia), with the goal of enabling [[artificial intelligence|AI]] applications to perform human-like reasoning and be less \"brittle\" when confronted with novel situations that were not preconceived.\n\n[[Douglas Lenat]] began the project in July, 1984 at [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation|MCC]], where he was Principal Scientist 1984-1994, and then, since January 1995, has been under active development by the Cycorp company, where he is the CEO.\n\n==Overview==\nThe need for a massive symbolic artificial intelligence project of this kind was born in the early 1980s out of a large number of experiences early AI researchers had, in the previous 25 years, wherein their AI programs would generate encouraging early results but then fail to \"scale up\"\u2014fail to cope with novel situations and problems outside the narrow area they were conceived and engineered to cope with. [[Douglas Lenat]] and [[Alan Kay]] publicized this need,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lenat|first=Douglas B.|last2=Brown|first2=John Seely|date=1984-08-01|title=Why am and eurisko appear to work|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437028490016X|journal=Artificial Intelligence|volume=23|issue=3|pages=269\u2013294|doi=10.1016/0004-3702(84)90016-X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lenat|first=Douglas B.|last2=Borning|first2=Alan|last3=McDonald|first3=David|last4=Taylor|first4=Craig|last5=Weyer|first5=Steven|date=1983|title=Knoesphere: Building Expert Systems with Encyclopedic Knowledge|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1623373.1623410|journal=Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 1|series=IJCAI'83|location=San Francisco, CA, USA|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.|pages=167\u2013169}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> and organized a meeting at Stanford in 1983 to consider the problem; the back-of-the-envelope calculations by them and colleagues including [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Allen Newell]], [[Edward Feigenbaum]], and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] indicated that that effort would require between 1000 and 3000 person-years of effort, hence not fit into the standard academic project model.  Fortuitously, events within a year of that meeting enabled that Manhattan-Project-sized effort to get underway.\n\nThe project was started in July,1984 as the flagship project of the 400-person [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]], a research consortium started by two dozen large United States based corporations \"to counter a then ominous Japanese effort in AI, the so-called \"[[Fifth generation computer|fifth-generation]]\" project.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|title=The World in a Box\n|publisher=Scientific American\n|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-world-in-a-box/\n|accessdate=2017-06-08\n}}</ref>   The US Government reacted to the Fifth Generation threat by passing the [[National Cooperative Research and Production Act|National Cooperative Research Act]] of 1984, which for the first time allowed US companies to \"collude\" on long-term high-risk high-payoff research, and [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation|MCC]] and [[SEMATECH|Sematech]] sprang up to take advantage of that ten-year opportunity.

So, by 1989,<ref name=\":2\" /> CycL had expanded in expressive power to [[Higher-order logic|Higher Order Logic]] (HOL).\n** [[Triplestore]] representations  (which are akin to the [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|Frame -and-slot]] representation languages of the 1970s from which RLL sprang) are widespread today in AI. It may be useful to cite a few examples that stress or break that type of representation, typical of the examples that forced the Cyc project to move from a triplestore representation to a much more expressive one during the period 1984-1989:<ref name=\":2\" /> English sentences including negations (\"Fred does not own a dog\"), nested quantifiers (\"Every American has a mother\" means for-all x there-exists y... but \"Every American has a President\" means there-exists y such that for-all x...), nested modals such as \"The United States believes that Germany wants NATO to avoid pursuing...\" and it's even awkward to represent, in a [[Triplestore]], relationships of arity higher than 2, such as \"Los Angeles is between San Diego and San Francisco along US101.\"\n* The ontology of Cyc terms grew to about 100,000 during the first decade of the project, to 1994, and as of 2017 contains about 1,500,000 terms.  The ontology includes: \n** 416,000 collections (types, sorts, [[natural kind]]<nowiki/>s, which includes both types of things such as Fish and types of actions such as Fishing) \n** a little over a million individuals representing \n*** 42,500 [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]<nowiki/>s (relations, attributes, fields, properties, functions),\n*** about a million generally well known entities such as TheUnitedStatesOfAmerica, BarackObama, TheSigningOfTheUSDeclarationOfIndependence, etc.\n*** An arbitrarily large number of additional terms are also ''implicitly'' present in the Cyc ontology, in the sense that there are term-denoting functions such as CalendarYearFn (when given the argument 2016, it denotes the calendar year 2016), GovernmentFn (when given the argument France it denotes the government of France), Meter (when given the argument 2016, it denotes a distance of 2.016 kilometers), and nestings and compositions of such function-denoting terms.\n* The Cyc knowledge base of general common-sense rules and assertions involving those ontological terms was largely created by hand axiom-writing; it grew to about 1 million in 1994, and as of 2017 is about 24.5 million and has taken well over 1,000 person-years of effort to construct.\n** It is important to understand that the Cyc ontological engineers strive to keep those numbers as ''small'' as possible, not inflate them, so long as the ''deductive closure'' of the knowledge base isn't reduced.  Suppose Cyc is told about one billion individual people, animals, etc.  Then it could be told 10<sup>18</sup> facts of the form \"Mickey Mouse is not the same individual as Bullwinkle the Moose\".  But instead of that, one could tell Cyc 10,000 [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean Taxonomy]] rules followed by just 10<sup>8</sup>   rules of the form \"No mouse is a moose\".  And even more compactly, Cyc could instead just be given those 10,000 [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean Taxonomy]] rules followed by just one rule of the form \"For any two Linnaean taxons, if neither is explicitly known to be a supertaxon of the other, then they are disjoint\".  Those 10,001 assertions have the same deductive closure as the earlier-mentioned 10<sup>18</sup> facts.\n* The Cyc inference engine design separates the epistemological problem (what content should be in the Cyc KB) from the heuristic problem (how Cyc could efficiently infer arguments hundreds of steps deep, in a sea of tens of millions of axioms).  To do the former, the CycL language and well-understood logical inference might suffice,but for the latter Cyc used a community-of-agents architecture, where specialized reasoning modules, each with its own data structure and algorithm, \"raised their hand\" if they could efficiently make progress on any of the currently open sub-problems.  At the end of the first decade, 1994, there were 20 such heuristic level (HL) modules;<ref name=\":3\" /> as of 2017 there are over 1,050 HL modules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/krr2015/home/schedule|title=Schedule - Knowledge Representation and Reasoning:  Integrating Symbolic and Neural Approaches|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref>\n** Some of these HL modules are very general, such as a module that caches the [[Kleene star|Kleene Star]] ([[transitive closure]]) of all the commonly-used [[transitive relation]]<nowiki/>s in Cyc's ontology.\n** Some are domain-specific, such as a chemical equation-balancer.  These can be and often are an \"escape\" to (pointer to) some externally available program or webservice or online database, such as a module to quickly \"compute\" the current population of a city by knowing where/how to look that up.\n\n[[CycL]] has a publicly released specification<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/cycl/syntax/|title=Cycl Syntax \u2013 Cycorp|website=www.cyc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref>  and dozens of HL modules were described in,<ref name=\":3\" /> but the actual Cyc inference engine code, and the full list of 1000+ HL modules, is Cycorp-proprietary.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web \n |last=Lenat \n |first=Douglas \n |authorlink=Douglas Lenat \n |title=Hal's Legacy: 2001's Computer as Dream and Reality.

Access to Cyc is through paid licenses, but ''bona fide'' AI research groups are given research-only no-cost licenses (cf. [[ResearchCyc]]); there are currently over 600 such groups worldwide with such licenses.\n\nTypical pieces of knowledge represented in the Cyc knowledge base are \"Every tree is a plant\" and \"Plants die eventually\". When asked whether trees die, the inference engine can draw the obvious conclusion and answer the question correctly.\n\nMost of Cyc's knowledge, outside math and games, is only true by default.  For example,  Cyc knows that ''as a default'' parents love their children, when you're made happy you smile, taking your first step is a big accomplishment, when someone you love has a big accomplishment that makes you happy, and only adults have children.  When asked whether a picture captioned \"Someone watching his daughter take her first step\" contains a smiling adult person, Cyc can logically infer that the answer is ''Yes'', and \"show its work\" by presenting the step by step logical argument using those five pieces of knowledge from its KB.  These are formulated in the language [[CycL]], which is based on [[predicate calculus]] and has a [[syntax]] similar to that of the [[Lisp programming language]].\n\nIn 2008, Cyc resources were mapped to many [[Wikipedia]] articles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/2150/Medelyan_Legg_Wikiai08.pdf?sequence=1|title=Integrating Cyc and Wikipedia: Folksonomy meets rigorously defined common-sense|accessdate=2013-05-10}}</ref> potentially easing connecting with other open datasets like [[DBpedia]] and [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]].\n\nMuch of the current work Cyc continues to be [[knowledge engineering]], representing facts about the world by hand, and implementing efficient inference mechanisms on that knowledge. Increasingly, however, work at Cycorp involves giving the Cyc system the ability to communicate with end users in [[natural language]], and to assist with the ongoing knowledge formation process via [[machine learning]] and [[natural language understanding]].  Another large effort at Cycorp is building a suite of Cyc-powered [[Ontology engineering|ontological engineering]] tools to lower the bar to entry for individuals to contribute to, edit, browse, and query Cyc.\n\nLike many companies, Cycorp has ambitions to use Cyc's natural language processing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/documentation/natural-language-processing-in-cyc|title=Cyc's Natural Language}}</ref> to parse the entire internet to extract structured data;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/cyc/cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/is|title=Cyc R&D|accessdate=2009-02-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220080550/http://cyc.com/cyc/cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/is|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}</ref> unlike all others, it is able to call on the Cyc system itself to act as an [[inductive bias]] and as an adjudicator of [[ambiguity]], [[metaphor]], and [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]].\n\n==Knowledge base==\n\nThe concept names in Cyc are CycL ''constants''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Constants start with an optional \"#$\" and are case-sensitive. There are constants for:\n* Individual items known as ''individuals'', such as #$BillClinton or #$France.\n* ''Collections'', such as #$Tree-ThePlant (containing all trees) or #$EquivalenceRelation (containing all [[equivalence relation]]s). A member of a collection is called an ''instance'' of that collection.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* ''Functions'', which produce new terms from given ones. For example, #$FruitFn, when provided with an argument describing a type (or collection) of plants, will return the collection of its fruits. By convention, function constants start with an upper-case letter and end with the string \"Fn\".\n* ''Truth functions'', which can apply to one or more other concepts and return either true or false. For example, #$siblings is the sibling relationship, true if the two arguments are siblings. By convention, truth function constants start with a lower-case letter.  Truth functions may be broken down into logical connectives (such as #$and, #$or, #$not, #$implies), quantifiers (#$forAll, #$thereExists, etc.) and [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s.\n\nTwo important binary predicates are #$isa and #$genls. The first one describes that one item is an [[Instance (computer science)|instance]] of some collection, the second one that one collection is a subcollection of another one. Facts about concepts are asserted using certain CycL ''sentences''. Predicates are written before their arguments, in parentheses:\n  (#$isa #$BillClinton #$UnitedStatesPresident)\n\"Bill Clinton belongs to the collection of U.S. presidents\" and\n  (#$genls #$Tree-ThePlant #$Plant)\n\"All trees are plants\".\n  (#$capitalCity #$France #$Paris)\n\"Paris is the capital of France.\"\n\nSentences can also contain variables, strings starting with \"?\". These sentences are called \"rules\". One important rule asserted about the #$isa predicate reads\n (#$implies\n    (#$and\n      (#$isa ?OBJ ?SUBSET)\n      (#$genls ?SUBSET ?SUPERSET))\n    (#$isa ?OBJ ?SUPERSET))\nwith the interpretation \"if OBJ is an instance of the collection [[subset|SUBSET]] and SUBSET is a subcollection of [[superset|SUPERSET]], then OBJ is an instance of the collection SUPERSET\". Another typical example is\n  (#$relationAllExists #$biologicalMother #$ChordataPhylum #$FemaleAnimal)\nwhich means that for every instance of the collection #$ChordataPhylum (i.e. for every [[chordate]]), there exists a female animal (instance of #$FemaleAnimal), which is its mother (described by the predicate #$biologicalMother).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe [[knowledge base]] is divided into ''microtheories'' (Mt), collections of concepts and facts typically pertaining to one particular realm of knowledge. Unlike the knowledge base as a whole, each microtheory must be free from ''monotonic'' contradictions. Each microtheory is a first-class object in the Cyc ontology; it has a name that is a regular constant; microtheory constants contain the string \"Mt\" by convention. An example is #$MathMt, the microtheory containing mathematical knowledge. The microtheories can inherit from each other and are organized in a hierarchy:\none specialization of #$MathMt is #$GeometryGMt, the microtheory about geometry.\n\n==Inference engine==\nAn [[inference engine]] is a computer program that tries to derive answers from a knowledge base.\nThe Cyc inference engine performs general [[logical deduction]] (including [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], [[universal quantification]] and [[existential quantification]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/documentation/overview-cyc-inferencing|title=cyc Inference engine|accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref>  It also performs [[inductive reasoning]], statistical machine learning and symbolic machine learning, and [[abductive reasoning]] (but of course sparingly and using the existing KB as a filter and guide).\n\n==Releases==\n\n=== OpenCyc ===\nThe first version of OpenCyc was released in spring 2002 and contained only 6,000 concepts and 60,000 facts.  The knowledge base was released under the [[Apache License]]. [[Cycorp]] stated its intention to release OpenCyc under parallel, unrestricted licences to meet the needs of its users. The [[CycL]] and SubL interpreter (the program that allows users to browse and edit the database as well as to draw inferences) was released free of charge, but only as a binary, without source code. It was made available for [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. The open source Texai<ref>[http://www.texai.org The open source Texai project]</ref> project released the [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]-compatible content extracted from OpenCyc.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=176781 Texai SourceForge project files]</ref>  A version of OpenCyc, 4.0, was released in June 2012. OpenCyc 4.0 included much of the Cyc ontology at that time, containing hundreds of thousands of terms, along with millions of assertions relating the terms to each other; however, these are mainly taxonomic assertions, not the complex rules available in Cyc. The OpenCyc 4.0 knowledge base contained 239,000 concepts and 2,093,000 facts.\n\nThe main point of releasing OpenCyc was to help AI researchers understand what was ''missing'' from what they now call [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and [[Knowledge Graph|knowledge graph]]<nowiki/>s.  It's useful and important to have properly taxonomized concepts like person, night, sleep, lying down, waking, happy, etc., but what's ''missing'' from the OpenCyc content about those terms, but present in the Cyc KB content, are the various rules of thumb that most of us share about those terms: that (as a default, in the ModernWesternHumanCultureMt) each person sleeps at night, sleeps lying down, can be woken up, is not happy about being woken up, ''and so on.''  That point does not require continually-updated releases of OpenCyc, so, as of 2017, OpenCyc is no longer available.\n\n===ResearchCyc===\nIn July 2006, Cycorp released the [[executable]] of ResearchCyc 1.0, a version of Cyc aimed at the research community, at no charge. (ResearchCyc was in beta stage of development during all of 2004; a beta version was released in February 2005.) In addition to the taxonomic information contained in OpenCyc, ResearchCyc includes significantly more semantic knowledge (i.e., additional facts and rules of thumb) involving the concepts in its knowledge base; it also includes a large lexicon, [[English language|English]] parsing and generation tools, and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based interfaces for knowledge editing and querying. In addition it contains a system for [[Ontology-based data integration]].  As of 2017, regular releases of ResearchCyc continue to appear, and are licensed to over 600 research groups around the world at no cost for noncommercial research purposes.\n\n==Applications==\n\nThere have been over 100 successful applications of Cyc;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/enterprise-solutions/success-stories/|title=Success Stories \u2013 Cycorp|website=www.cyc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref> listed here are a few mutually dissimilar instances:\n\n===Pharmaceutical Term Thesaurus Manager/Integrator===\nFor over a decade, Glaxo has used Cyc to semi-automatically integrate all the large (hundreds of thousands of terms) thesauri of pharmaceutical-industry terms that reflect differing usage across companies, countries, years, and sub-industries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/21/news/mn-12881|title=Birth of a Thinking Machine|last=HILTZIK|first=MICHAEL A.|date=2001-06-21|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>  This ontology integration task requires domain knowledge, shallow semantic knowledge, but also arbitrarily deep common sense knowledge and reasoning.  Pharma vocabulary varies across countries, (sub-) industries, companies, departments, and decades of time.  E.g., what\u2019s a'' gel pak''?  What\u2019s the \u201cstreet name\u201d for ''ranitidine hydrochloride''?  Each of these ''n ''controlled vocabularies is an ontology with approximately 300k terms.  Glaxo researchers need to issue a query ''in their current vocabulary'', have it translated into a neutral \u201ctrue meaning\u201d, and then have that transformed in the opposite direction to find potential matches against documents each of which was written to comply with a particular known vocabulary.  They had been using a large staff to do that manually.  Cyc is used as the universal interlingua capable of representing the union of all the terms\u2019 \u201ctrue meanings\u201d, and capable of representing the 300k transformations between each of those controlled vocabularies and Cyc, thereby converting an ''n2'' problem into a linear one without introducing the usual sort of \u201ctelephone game\u201d attenuation of meaning.  Furthermore, creating each of those 300k mappings for each thesaurus is done in a largely automated fashion, by Cyc.\n\n===Terrorism Knowledge Base===\nThe comprehensive [[Terrorism]] Knowledge Base is an application of Cyc in development that will try to ultimately contain all relevant knowledge about \"terrorist\" groups, their members, leaders, ideology, founders, sponsors, affiliations, facilities, locations, finances, capabilities, intentions, behaviors, tactics, and full descriptions of specific terrorist events. The knowledge is stored as statements in mathematical logic, suitable for computer understanding and reasoning.<ref>{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.70.9247|title=The Comprehensive Terrorism Knowledge Base in Cyc |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\n===Cyclopedia===\nCyclopedia is being developed; it superimposes Cyc keywords on pages taken from Wikipedia pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.dbpedia.org/OpenCyc|title=DBpedia and (Open-)Cyc|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011073622/http://wiki.dbpedia.org/OpenCyc|archive-date=2007-10-11|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cycfoundation.org/cyclopedia.jpg Cyclopedia Sampleshowing cyc highlighted cyc concept for family] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709211734/http://www.cycfoundation.org/cyclopedia.jpg |date=2010-07-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Cleveland Clinic Foundation===\nThe [[Cleveland Clinic]] has used Cyc to develop a [[natural language query]] interface of biomedical information, spanning decades of information on cardiothoracic surgeries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/ClevelandClinic/|title=Case Study: A Semantic Web Content Repository for Clinical Research|website=www.w3.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> A query is parsed into a set of [[CycL]] (higher-order logic) fragments with open variables (e.g., \"this question is talking about a person who developed an endocarditis infection\", \"this question is talking about a subset of Cleveland Clinic patients who underwent surgery there in 2009\", etc.); then various constraints are applied (medical domain knowledge, common sense, discourse pragmatics, syntax) to see how those fragments could possibly fit together into one semantically meaningful formal query; significantly, in most cases, there is exactly ''one and only one'' such way of incorporating and integrating those fragments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lenat|first=Douglas|last2=Witbrock|first2=Michael|last3=Baxter|first3=David|last4=Blackstone|first4=Eugene|last5=Deaton|first5=Chris|last6=Schneider|first6=Dave|last7=Scott|first7=Jerry|last8=Shepard|first8=Blake|date=2010-07-28|title=Harnessing Cyc to Answer Clinical Researchers' Ad Hoc Queries|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/2299|journal=AI Magazine|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|issn=0738-4602}}</ref>  Integrating the fragments involves (i) deciding which open variables in which fragments actually represent the same variable, and (ii) for all the final variables, decide what order and scope of quantification that variable should have, and what type (universal or existential).  That logical (CycL) query is then converted into a SPARQL query that is passed to the CCF SemanticDB that is its [[data lake]].\n\n===MathCraft===\nOne Cyc application aims to help students doing math at a 6th grade level, helping them much more deeply understand that subject matter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lenat|first=Douglas B.|last2=Durlach|first2=Paula J.|date=2014-09-01|title=Reinforcing Math Knowledge by Immersing Students in a Simulated Learning-By-Teaching Experience|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-014-0016-x|journal=International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=216\u2013250|doi=10.1007/s40593-014-0016-x|issn=1560-4292}}</ref>  It is based on the experience that we often have ''thought'' we understood something, but only ''really'' understood it after we had to explain or teach it to someone else.  Unlike almost all other educational software, where the computer plays the role of the teacher, this application of Cyc, called MathCraft,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathcraft.ai|title=Mathcraft by Cycorp|website=www.mathcraft.ai|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref> has Cyc play the role of a fellow student who is always slightly more confused than you, the user, are, about the subject.  The user's role is to observe the Cyc avatar and give it advice, correct its errors, mentor it, get it to see what it's doing wrong, etc.  As the user gives good advice, Cyc allows the avatar to make fewer mistakes of that type, hence, from the user's point of view, it seems as though the user has just successfully taught it something.  This is a variation of [[Learning by teaching|Learning by Teaching]].\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe Cyc project has been described as \"one of the most controversial endeavors of the artificial intelligence history\".<ref>{{harvnb|Bertino|Piero|Zarri|2001|p=275}}</ref> [[Catherine Havasi]], CEO of Luminoso, says that Cyc is the predecessor project to IBM's Watson.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/guide-to-common-sense-reasoning-whos-doing-it-and-why-it-matters/|title=Who\u2019s Doing Common-Sense Reasoning And Why It Matters|last=Havasi|first=Catherine|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}</ref>   Machine-learning scientist [[Pedro Domingos]] refers to the project as a \"catastrophic failure\" for several reasons, including the unending amount of data required to produce any viable results and the inability for Cyc to evolve on its own.<ref>{{cite book |first=Pedro |last=Domingos |title=The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World |isbn=978-0465065707|year=2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Robin Hanson]], a professor of economics at George Mason University, gives a more balanced analysis: \"''Of course the CYC project is open to criticism on its many particular choices.  People have complained about its logic-like and language-like representations, about its selection of prototypical cases to build from (e.g., encyclopedia articles), about its focus on answering over acting,  about how often it rebuilds vs. maintaining legacy systems, and about being private vs. publishing everything. But any large project like this would produce such disputes, and it is not obvious any of its choices have been seriously wrong.  They had to start somewhere, and in my opinion they have now collected a knowledge base with a truly spectacular size, scope, and integration. Other architectures may well work better, but if knowing lots is anywhere near as important as Lenat thinks, I\u2019d expect serious AI attempts to import CYC\u2019s knowledge, translating it into a new representation.  No other source has anywhere near CYC\u2019s size, scope, and integration''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/i-heart-cyc.html|title=Overcoming Bias : I Heart CYC|website=www.overcomingbias.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\nA similar sentiment was expressed by [[Marvin Minsky]]: \"Unfortunately, the strategies most popular among AI researchers in the 1980s have come to a dead end,\" said Minsky. So-called \u201cexpert systems,\u201d which emulated human expertise within tightly defined subject areas like law and medicine, could match users\u2019 queries to relevant diagnoses, papers and abstracts, yet they could not learn concepts that most children know by the time they are 3 years old.  \u201cFor each different kind of problem,\u201d said Minsky, \u201cthe construction of expert systems had to start all over again, because they didn\u2019t accumulate common-sense knowledge.\u201d  Only one researcher has committed himself to the colossal task of building a comprehensive common-sense reasoning system, according to Minsky. Douglas Lenat, through his Cyc project, has directed the line-by-line entry of more than 1 million rules into a commonsense knowledge base.\"<ref name=\"Baard\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2003/05/ai-founder-blasts-modern-research/|title=AI Founder Blasts Modern Research|last=Baard|first=Mark|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Gary Marcus]], a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and the cofounder of an AI company called Geometric Intelligence, says \"it represents an approach that is very different from all the deep-learning stuff that has been in the news.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600984/an-ai-with-30-years-worth-of-knowledge-finally-goes-to-work/|title=An AI that spent 30 years learning some common sense is ready for work|last=Knight|first=Will|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}</ref>  This is consistent with Doug Lenat's position that \"Sometimes the ''veneer'' of intelligence is not enough\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cognitiveworld.com/article/sometimes-veneer-intelligence-not-enough|title=Sometimes the Veneer of Intelligence is Not Enough {{!}} CogWorld|website=cognitiveworld.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\nStephen Wolfram writes \"''In the early days of the field of artificial intelligence, there were plenty of discussions of \u201cknowledge representation\u201d, with approaches based variously on the grammar of natural language, the structure of predicate logic or the formalism of databases.

He won the [[South American Footballer of the Year]] award in 1987 and 1993, and in 1999, he was also named one of the top 100 players of the 20th century by [[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]].

He played a major role during the golden era of Colombian football in the 1990s, representing his national side in three [[FIFA World Cup]]s and five [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] tournaments.\n\nAfter spending most of his career playing club football in South America and Europe, towards the end of his career Valderrama played in [[Major League Soccer]], joining the league in its first season. One of the most recognisable players in the league at the time of its inception, he helped popularise the league during the second half of the 1990s. To this day, he is an icon and is considered one of the most decorated players to ever play in MLS; in 2005, he was named to the [[MLS All-Time Best XI]].<ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2012/m=4/news=colombian-flavour-the-rise-mls-1614638.html|title=Colombian flavour on the rise in MLS|publisher=FIFA.com|date=15 April 2012|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mlssoccer1\">[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/03/08/colombians-mls-stability-status-influence-recent-shift Colombians in MLS: Stability, status influence recent shift | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/mls-colombia-colombians-portland-timbers-diego-chara Why are so many Colombians keen to play in MLS? | Football | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2010/10/19/2172421/colombia-makes-an-impact-on-major-league-soccer Colombia Makes An Impact On Major League Soccer - Goal.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1614638.html</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Colombia and Europe===\nBorn in [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]], Valderrama began his career at [[Uni\u00f3n Magdalena]] of the Colombian First Division in 1981. He also later played for [[Millonarios]] in 1984. He joined [[Deportivo Cali]] in 1985, where he played most of his Colombian football. In 1988, he moved to the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] side [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault SC|Montpellier]]. He struggled to adapt to the less technical and the faster, more physical, and tactical brand of football being played in Europe, losing his place in the squad. However, his passing ability later saw him become the club's main creative force, and he played a decisive role as his side won the [[French Cup]] in 1990. In 1991, he remained in Europe and joined Spanish side [[Real Valladolid]] for a season. He then returned to Colombia in 1992 and went on to play for [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], and subsequently [[Atl\u00e9tico Junior]] in 1993, with whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===MLS career===\n[[File:Carlos Valderrama 1998.jpg|thumb|left|Valderrama at a [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] fan meet in 1998]]\nValderrama began his [[Major League Soccer]] career with the US side [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] in the league's inaugural year of 1996, and won its ever first [[Supporters' Shield]] and [[Major League Soccer MVP Award|Most Valuable Player award]], finishing the season with 4 goals and 17 assists. He remained with the club for the 1997 season, and also spent a spell on loan back at Deportivo Cali in Colombia, before moving to another MLS side, [[Miami Fusion]], in 1998, where he also remained for two seasons.

In his first major international tournament, he helped Colombia to a third-place finish at the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina, as his team's captain, where he was named the tournament's best player; during the tournament he scored the opening goal in Colombia's 2\u20130 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] on 1 July, their first match of the group stage.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\nSome of Valderrama's most impressive international performances came during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy, during which he served as Colombia's captain. He helped his team to a 2\u20130 win against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]] in Colombia's opening match of the group stage, scoring the second goal of the match with a strike from 20 yards. Colombia lost their second match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], however,\nneeding at least a draw against the eventual champions [[German national football team|West Germany]] in their final group match in order to advance to the next round of the competition. In the decisive game, German striker [[Pierre Littbarski]] scored what appeared to be the winning goal in the 88th minute of the game; however, within the last minute of injury time, Valderrama beat several opposing players and made a crucial left-footed pass to [[Freddy Rincon]], who subsequently equalised, sealing a place for Colombia in the second round of the tournament with a 1\u20131 draw.

His impact in the final tournament at the advancing age of 37, however, was less decisive, and, despite defeating [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], Colombia once again suffered a first round exit, following a 2\u20130 defeat against [[England national football team|England]], which was Valderrama's final international appearance.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n==Playing style==\nAlthough Valderrama is often defined as a 'classic [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]] [[playmaker]]', due to his creativity and offensive contribution, in reality he was not a classic playmaker in the traditional sense.

His control, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability and footwork were similar to those of smaller players, which for a player of Valderrama's size and physical build was fairly uncommon, and he frequently stood out throughout his career for his ability to use his strength, balance, composure, and flamboyant technique to shield the ball from opponents when put under pressure, and retain possession in difficult situations, which made him extremely popular with the fans. Valderrama's mix of physical strength, two-footed ability, unpredictability and flair enabled him to produce key and incisive performances against top tier teams, while his world class vision and exceptional passing and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability with his right foot made him one of the best [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers of his time; his height, physique and elevation also made him effective in the air, and he was also an accurate [[Direct free kick|free kick]] taker and striker of the ball, despite not being a particularly prolific goalscorer.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"Colombia aren't creative enough\"/><ref name=\"Boots and a bouffant\"/><ref name=\"Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness\"/><ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\"/><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlos-valderrama_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Valderrama, Carlos|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Matteo Dotto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=87394/index.html Valderrama: an artist's short spell in Montpellier - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"The Global Art of Soccer\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=2167928/index.html The day Colombia rocked the Monumental - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpLicqLvOA 1996 Valderrama vs West MLS All star - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube2\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7vf5So3_k MLS LEGENDS | Carlos \"El Pibe\" Valderrama - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube3\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7A5smuVFs8 Carlos VALDERRAMA keep and pass compilation - christinayan - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/|title=Informe Especial del *Pibe* Valderrama|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col4.asp|title=El m\u00e1s querido, el inolvidable...|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite his natural talent and ability as a footballer, Valderrama earned a reputation for having a \"languid\" playing style, as well as lacking notable pace, being unfit, and for having a poor defensive work-rate on the pitch, in particular after succumbing to the physical effects of ageing in his later career in the MLS. In his first season in France, he also initially struggled to adapt to the faster-paced, more physical and tactically rigorous European brand of football, which saw him play in an unfamiliar position, and gave him less space and time on the ball to dictate attacking passing moves; he was criticised at times for his lack of match fitness and his low defensive contribution, which initially limited his appearances with the club, although he later successfully became a key creative player in his team's starting line-up due to his discipline, skill, and his precise and efficient passing.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=dios/><ref name=\"Diez veces gracias\"/><ref name=\"I'd do it all again\"/> Despite these claims, earlier in his career, however, Valderrama demonstrated substantial pace, stamina, and defensive competence.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref name=\"prestigio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2008/07/21/C-115-no-tengo-miedo-a-perder-el-prestigio.php|title=\"No tengo miedo a perder el prestigio\"|publisher=El Gr\u00e1fico|language=Spanish|author1=Diego Borinsky|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nFormer French defender [[Laurent Blanc]], who played with Valderrama in Montpellier, voiced one of the most accurate descriptions for Valderrama, \"In the fast and furious European game he wasn't always at his ease.

Carter, ''Cecilia Beaux'', Rizzoli, New York, 2005, p. 11, {{ISBN|0-8478-2708-9}}</ref> He returned when Cecilia was two, but left four years later after his business failed. As she confessed later, \"We didn't love Papa very much, he was so foreign.  We thought him ''peculiar''.\" Her father did have a natural aptitude for drawing and the sisters were charmed by his whimsical sketches of animals. Later, Beaux would discover that her French heritage would serve her well during her pilgrimage and training in France.<ref>Carter, p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File:Cecilia Beaux self-portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Self-portrait]] by Beaux, 1894]]\n\nIn Philadelphia, Beaux's aunt Emily married mining engineer William Foster Biddle, whom Beaux would later describe as \"after my grandmother, the strongest and most beneficent influence in my life.\" For fifty years, he cared for his nieces-in-law with consistent attention and occasional financial support.<ref>Carter, p. 18</ref> Her grandmother, on the other hand, provided day-to-day supervision and kindly discipline. Whether with housework, handiwork, or academics, Grandma Leavitt offered a pragmatic framework, stressing that \"everything undertaken must be completed, conquered.\" The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years were particularly challenging, but the extended family survived despite little emotional or financial support from Beaux's father.<ref>Carter, p. 19</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Beaux began to spend some time in the household of \"Willie\" and Emily, both proficient musicians. Beaux learned to play the piano but preferred singing. The musical atmosphere later proved an advantage for her artistic ambitions. Beaux recalled, \"They understood perfectly the spirit and necessities of an artist's life.\"<ref>Carter, p. 20</ref> In her early teens, she had her first major exposure to art during visits with Willie to the nearby [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], one of America's foremost art schools and museums. Though fascinated by the narrative elements of some of the pictures, particularly the Biblical themes of the massive paintings of [[Benjamin West]], at this point Beaux had no aspirations of becoming an artist.<ref>Carter, p. 25</ref>\n\nHer childhood was a sheltered though generally happy one. As a teen she already manifested the traits, as she described, of \"both a realist and a perfectionist, pursued by an uncompromising passion for carrying through.\"<ref>Carter, p. 29</ref> She attended the Misses Lyman School and was just an average student, though she did well in French and Natural History. However, she was unable to afford the extra fee for art lessons.<ref>Carter, p. 31</ref> At age 16, Beaux began art lessons with a relative, [[Catherine A. Janvier|Catherine Ann Drinker]], an accomplished artist who had her own studio and a growing clientele. Drinker became Beaux's role model, and she continued lessons with Drinker for a year. She then studied for two years with the painter Francis Adolf Van der Wielen, who offered lessons in perspective and drawing from casts during the time that the new [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] was under construction. Given the bias of the [[Victorian age]], female students were denied direct study in anatomy and could not attend drawing classes with live models (who were often prostitutes) until a decade later.<ref>Carter, p. 37</ref>\n\n[[File:New England Woman Cecilia Beaux.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''New England Woman''. Portrait of Mrs. Jedidiah H. Richards (Beaux's cousin Julia Leavitt), 1895. [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]]]]\n\nAt 18, Beaux was appointed as a drawing teacher at Miss Sanford's School, taking over Drinker's post. She also gave private art lessons and produced decorative art and small portraits. Her own studies were mostly self-directed. Beaux received her first introduction to [[lithography]] doing copy work for Philadelphia printer Thomas Sinclair and she published her first work in ''St. Nicholas'' magazine in December 1873.<ref>Carter, p. 45</ref> Beaux demonstrated accuracy and patience as a scientific illustrator, creating drawings of fossils for [[Edward Drinker Cope]], for a multi-volume report sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey. However, she did not find technical illustration suitable for a career (the extreme exactitude required gave her pains in the \"solar plexus\"). At this stage, she did not yet consider herself an artist.<ref>Beaux, pp. 77-80</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 48-49</ref>\n\nBeaux began attending the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1876, then under the dynamic influence of [[Thomas Eakins]], whose great work ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' had \"horrified Philadelphia Exhibition-goers as a gory spectacle\" at the [[Centennial Exhibition]] of 1876.<ref>Carter, p. 54</ref> She steered clear of the controversial Eakins, though she much admired his work. His progressive teaching philosophy, focused on anatomy and live study (and allowed the female students to partake in segregated studios), eventually led to his firing as director of the Academy. She did not ally herself with Eakins' ardent student supporters, and later wrote, \"A curious instinct of self-preservation kept me outside the magic circle.\"<ref>Carter, p. 59</ref> Instead, she attended costume and portrait painting classes for three years taught by the ailing director [[Christian Schussele]].<ref>Carter, p. 55</ref> Beaux won the [[Mary Smith Prize]] at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] exhibitions in 1885, 1887, 1891, and 1892.<ref name=\"Penn Academy\">{{cite book|author=Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|title=Catalogue of the Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqtNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA10|year=1914|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving the Academy, the 24-year-old Beaux decided to try her hand at [[porcelain painting]] and she enrolled in a course at the National Art Training School. She was well suited to the precise work but later wrote, \"this was the lowest depth I ever reached in commercial art, and although it was a period when youth and romance were in their first attendance on me, I remember it with gloom and record it with shame.\"<ref>Carter, p. 63</ref> She studied privately with [[William Sartain]], a friend of Eakins and a New York artist invited to Philadelphia to teach a group of art students, starting in 1881. Though Beaux admired Eakins more and thought his painting skill superior to Sartain's, she preferred the latter's gentle teaching style which promoted no particular aesthetic approach.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 65\">Carter, p. 65</ref> Unlike Eakins, however, Sartain believed in [[phrenology]] and Beaux adopted a lifelong belief that physical characteristics correlated with behaviors and traits.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 65\"/>\n\nBeaux attended Sartain's classes for two years, then rented her own studio and shared it with a group of women artists who hired a live model and continued without an instructor. After the group disbanded, Beaux set in earnest to prove her artistic abilities. She painted a large canvas in 1884, ''Les Derniers Jours d'Enfance'', a portrait of her sister and nephew whose composition and style revealed a debt to [[James McNeill Whistler]] and whose subject matter was akin to [[Mary Cassatt]]'s mother-and-child paintings.<ref>Carter, p. 67</ref> It was awarded a prize for the best painting by a female artist at the Academy, and further exhibited in Philadelphia and New York.  Following that seminal painting, she painted over 50 portraits in the next three years with the zeal of a committed professional artist. Her invitation to serve as a juror on the hanging committee of the Academy confirmed her acceptance amongst her peers.<ref>Carter, p. 69</ref> In the mid-1880s, she was receiving commissions from notable Philadelphians and earning $500 per portrait, comparable to what Eakins commanded.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 70\">Carter, p. 70</ref> When her friend Margaret Bush-Brown insisted that ''Les Derniers'' was good enough to be exhibited at the famed [[Paris Salon]], Beaux relented and sent the painting abroad in the care of her friend, who managed to get the painting into the exhibition.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 70\"/>\n\n[[File:Clemenceau Beaux 1920.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Georges Clemenceau]] by Cecilia Beaux (1920)]]\n\n===Paris===\nAt 32, despite her clear success in Philadelphia, Beaux decided that she still needed to advance her skills. She left for [[Paris]] with cousin May Whitlock, forsaking several suitors and overcoming the objections of her family. There she trained at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]],<ref>[http://nmwa.org/explore/artist-profiles/cecilia-beaux nmwa.org]</ref> the largest art school in Paris, and at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], receiving weekly critiques from established masters like [[Tony Robert-Fleury]] and [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]].<ref>Carter, p. 77</ref> She wrote, \"Fleury is much less benign than Bouguereau and don't temper his severities\u2026he hinted of possibilities before me and as he rose said the nicest thing of all, 'we will do all we can to help you'\u2026I want these men\u2026to know me and recognize that I can do something.\"<ref>Carter, p. 82</ref> Though advised regularly of Beaux's progress abroad and to \"not be worried about any indiscretions of ours\", her Aunt Eliza repeatedly reminded her niece to avoid the temptations of Paris, \"Remember you are first of all a Christian \u2013 then a woman and last of all an Artist.\"<ref>Carter, p. 84</ref>\n\nWhen Beaux arrived in Paris, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], a group of artists who had begun their own series of independent exhibitions from the official Salon in 1874, were beginning to lose their solidarity. Also known as the \"Independents\" or \"Intransigents\", the group which at times included [[Degas]], [[Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Caillebotte]], [[Pissarro]], [[Renoir]], and [[Berthe Morisot]], had been receiving the wrath of the critics for several years. Their art, though varying in style and technique, was the antithesis of the type of Academic art in which Beaux was trained and of which her teacher William-Adolphe Bouguereau was a leading master. In the summer of 1888, with classes in summer recess, Beaux worked in the fishing village of [[Concarneau]] with the American painters [[T. Alexander Harrison|Alexander Harrison]] and Charles Lazar. She tried applying the plein-air painting techniques used by the Impressionists to her own landscapes and portraiture, with little success.<ref>Carter, p. 87</ref> Unlike her predecessor [[Mary Cassatt]], who had arrived near the beginning of the Impressionist movement 15 years earlier and who had absorbed it, Beaux's artistic temperament, precise and true to observation, would not align with Impressionism and she remained a realist painter for the rest of her career, even as [[C\u00e9zanne]], [[Matisse]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Picasso]] were beginning to take art into new directions.<ref>Carter, p. 91</ref> Beaux mostly admired classic artists like [[Titian]] and [[Rembrandt]]. Her European training did influence her palette, however, and she adopted more white and paler coloration in her oil painting, particularly in depicting female subjects, an approach favored by Sargent as well.<ref name=\"Columbus Museum of Art p.44\">{{citation |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=Norma J. |title=The American Collections |publisher=[[Columbus Museum of Art]] |year=1988 |isbn=0-8109-1811-0 |page=44}}.</ref>\n\n===Return to Philadelphia===\n[[File:SarahAlliboneLeavitt.jpg|thumb|230px|''Sita and Sarita (Jeune Fille au Chat)''. Portrait of Sarah Allibone Leavitt, 1893&ndash;1894. Collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nBack in America in 1889, Beaux proceeded to paint portraits in the [[grand manner]], taking as her subjects members of her sister's family as well as the elite of Philadelphia. In making her decision to devote herself to art, she also thought it was best not to marry, and in choosing male company she selected men who would not threaten to sidetrack her career.<ref>Carter, p. 105</ref> She resumed life with her family, and they supported her fully, acknowledging her chosen path and demanding of her little in the way of household responsibilities, \"I was never once asked to do an errand in town, some bit of shopping\u2026so well did they understand.\"<ref>Carter, p. 106</ref> She developed a structured, professional routine, arriving promptly at her studio, and expected the same from her models.\n\nThe five years that followed were highly productive, resulting in over forty portraits.<ref>Carter, p. 107</ref> In 1890 she exhibited at the Paris Exposition, obtained in 1893 the gold medal of the [[Philadelphia Art Club]], and also the Dodge prize at the New York [[National Academy of Design]].<ref>Carter, p. 108</ref>  She exhibited her work at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Palace of Fine Arts]] and [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|The Woman's Building]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, Illinois.<ref name=\"Nichols\">{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=K.

Leavitt's wife Sarah (Allibone) Leavitt in white, with a small black cat perched on her shoulder, both gazing out mysteriously. The mesmerizing effect prompted one critic to point out \"the witch-like weirdness of the black kitten\" and for many years, the painting solicited questions by the press. But the result was not pre-planned, as Beaux's sister later explained, \"Please make no mystery about it\u2014it was only an idea to put the black kitten on her cousin's shoulder. Nothing deeper.\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 114\">Carter, p. 114</ref> Beaux donated ''Sita and Sarita'' to the [[Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg]],<ref>Tappert, p. 32</ref> but only after making a copy for herself.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = National Gallery of Art | accessdate = August 19, 2018 | title= ''Sita and Sarita'' c. 1921 | url = https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.166425.html}}</ref> Another highly regarded portrait from that period is ''New England Woman'' (1895), a nearly all-white oil painting which was purchased by the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].\n\nIn 1895 Beaux became the first woman to have a regular teaching position at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she instructed in portrait drawing and painting for the next twenty years.<ref>Goodyear, p. 12</ref> That rare type of achievement by a woman prompted one local newspaper to state, \"It is a legitimate source of pride to Philadelphia that one of its most cherished institutions has made this innovation.\" She was a popular instructor.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 114\"/> In 1896, Beaux returned to France to see a group of her paintings presented at the Salon. Influential French critic M. Henri Rochefort commented, \"I am compelled to admit, not without some chagrin, that not one of our female artists\u2026is strong enough to compete with the lady who has given us this year the portrait of Dr. Grier.  Composition, flesh, texture, sound drawing\u2014everything is there without affectation, and without seeking for effect.\"<ref>Carter, p. 120</ref>\n\nCecelia Beaux considered herself a \"[[New Woman]]\", a 19th-century women who explored educational and career opportunities that had generally been denied to women. In the late 19th century [[Charles Dana Gibson]] depicted the \"New Woman\" in his painting, ''The Reason Dinner was Late'', which is \"a sympathetic portrayal of artistic aspiration on the part of young women\" as she paints a visiting policeman.<ref>Nancy Mowall Mathews.

All three aunts had died and she needed an emotional break from Philadelphia and New York. She managed to find new subjects for portraiture, working in the mornings and enjoying a leisurely life the rest of the time. She carefully regulated her energy and her activities to maintain a productive output, and considered that a key to her success. On why so few women succeeded in art as she did, she stated, \"Strength is the stumbling block. They (women) are sometimes unable to stand the hard work of it day in and day out.  They become tired and cannot reenergize themselves.\"<ref>Carter, p. 149</ref>\n\nWhile Beaux stuck to her portraits of the elite, American art was advancing into urban and social subject matter, led by artists such as [[Robert Henri]] who espoused a totally different aesthetic, \"Work with great speed..Have your energies alert, up and active. Do it all in one sitting if you can.  In one minute if you can.  There is no use delaying\u2026Stop studying water pitchers and bananas and paint everyday life.\" He advised his students, among them [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Rockwell Kent]], to live with the common man and paint the common man, in total opposition to Cecilia Beaux's artistic methods and subjects.<ref>Carter, p. 153</ref> The clash of Henri and [[William Merritt Chase]] (representing Beaux and the traditional art establishment) resulted in 1907 in the independent exhibition by the urban realists known as \"The Eight\" or the [[Ashcan School]]. Beaux and her art friends defended the old order, and many thought (and hoped) the new movement to be a passing fad, but it turned out to be a revolutionary turn in American art.\n\n[[File:William Henry Howell (painting, 1911).jpg|thumb|200px|Painting of [[William Henry Howell]] (1919)]]\n\nIn 1910, her beloved Uncle Willie died. Though devastated by the loss, at fifty-five years of age, Beaux remained highly productive. In the next five years she painted almost 25 percent of her lifetime output and received a steady stream of honors.<ref>Carter, p. 162</ref> She had a major exhibition of 35 paintings at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., in 1912. Despite her continuing production and accolades, however, Beaux was working against the current of tastes and trends in art. The famed \"Armory Show\" of 1913 in New York City was a landmark presentation of 1,200 paintings showcasing [[Modernism]]. Beaux believed that the public, initially of mixed opinion about the \"new\" art, would ultimately reject it and return its favor to the Pre-Impressionists.\n\nBeaux was crippled after breaking her hip while walking in Paris in 1924.  With her health impaired, her work output dwindled for the remainder of her life.<ref name=\"Columbus Museum of Art p.44\" /> That same year Beaux was asked to produce a self-portrait for the Medici collection in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/index.cfm/fuseaction/Items.ViewImageDetails/ItemID/3552 Self Portrait, Cecilia Beaux, installation at the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy, Smithsonian Archives of American Art]</ref> In 1930 she published an [[autobiography]], ''Background with Figures''.<ref name=\"Columbus Museum of Art p.44\" /> Her later life was filled with honors. In 1930 she was elected a member of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]]; in 1933 came membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], which two years later organized the first major retrospective of her work. Also in 1933 [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] honored Beaux as \"the American woman who had made the greatest contribution to the culture of the world\".<ref>Tappert, p. 5</ref> In 1942 The National Institute of Arts and Letters awarded her a gold medal for lifetime achievement.\n\n===Death and critical regard===\n[[File:Landscape with Farm Building Cecilia Beaux.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|''Landscape with Farm Building'', 1888]]\nCecilia Beaux died at the age of 87 on September 17, 1942, in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].<ref name=Kuiper/> She was buried in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]].

Her strong technique, her perceptive reading of her subjects, and her ability to flatter without falsifying, were traits similar to his.\n[[File:Cecilia Beaux - Man with the Cat (Henry Sturgis Drinker) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''Man with the Cat (Henry Sturgis Drinker)'', 1898]]\n\"The critics are very enthusiastic.

She constantly struggled for perfection, \"A perfect technique in anything,\" she stated in an interview, \"means that there has been no break in continuity between the conception and the act of performance.\" She summed up her driving work ethic, \"I can say this: When I attempt anything, I have a passionate determination to overcome every obstacle\u2026And I do my own work with a refusal to accept defeat that might almost be called painful.\"<ref>Carter, p. 173</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Grafly, Dorothy. \"Cecilia Beaux\" in Edward T.

The company began an engineering partnership with [[Mitsubishi Motors]], and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America.  By the late 1970s, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy. It was saved by $1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the US government. New CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] was credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1985, [[Diamond-Star Motors]] was created, further expanding the Chrysler-Mitsubishi relationship.\n\nIn 1987, Chrysler acquired [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella.\n\nIn 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker [[Daimler-Benz|Daimler-Benz AG]] to form DaimlerChrysler; the merger proved contentious with investors. As a result, Chrysler was sold to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007.\n\nLike the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was impacted by the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010]]. The company remained in business through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization]] on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]]. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the [[United Auto Workers]] pension fund, [[Fiat S.p.A.]], and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period. On January 1, 2014, Fiat S.p.A announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A.<ref name=\"autonews.com\"/> In May 2014, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, NV]] was established by merging Fiat S.p.A. into the company.

When consumer tastes shifted to smaller cars in the early 1970s, particularly after the [[1973 oil crisis]], Chrysler could not meet the demand. Additional burdens came from increased US import competition, and tougher government regulation of car safety, fuel economy, and emissions. As the smallest of the Big 3 US automakers, Chrysler lacked the financial resources to meet all of these challenges. In 1978, [[Lee Iacocca]] was brought in to turn the company around, and in 1979 Iacocca sought US government help.

Its first plant was the [[Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]]. When the M2A1 was unexpectedly declared obsolete in August of the same year, plans were altered (though not without considerable difficulty) to produce the [[M3 Lee#Development|M3 Grant]] instead, primarily for the British as part of the United States under the counter support for Great Britain against Nazi Germany (the U.S. not yet being formally in the war), with the balance of the revised order going to the U.S. Army as the ''Lee''. After December 1941 and the United State's entry into the war against the Axis powers, the Tank division rapidly expanded, with new facilities such as the [[Packard Proving Grounds|Tank Arsenal Proving Ground]] at (then) [[Utica, Michigan]]. It also quickly widened the range of products it was developing and producing, including the [[M4 Sherman#U.S. design prototype|M4 Sherman tank]] and the [[Chrysler A57 multibank]] tank engine.\n\n{{see also|General Dynamics Land Systems}}\n\n==Special programs==\nDuring World War II, essentially all of Chrysler's facilities were devoted to building military vehicles (the [[Jeep]] brand came later, after Chrysler acquired [[American Motors Corporation]]).<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_djEK2wqmAIC&pg=PA192&dq=Multi-auto+Tank+Engine+Designed+and+Developed+by+Central+Engineering |page=192 |title=The Birth of Chrysler Corporation and Its Engineering Legacy |first=Carl |last=Breer |first2=Anthony J. |last2=Yanik |year=1992 |publisher= SAE International |isbn=978-1-56091-524-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> They were also designing V12 and V16 hemi-engines producing {{convert|2500|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for airplanes, but they did not make it into production as [[jet engine|jets]] were developed and were seen as the future for air travel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/hemi/chrysler-hemi.html |title=The Original Chrysler Hemi Engine |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>  During the 1950s [[Cold War]] period, Chrysler made [[Chrysler air raid siren|air raid sirens]] powered by its Hemi V-8 engines.\n\n===Radar antennas===\nWhen the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] was established in 1941 to develop [[microwave radar]]s, one of the first projects resulted in the [[SCR-584]], the most widely recognized radar system of the war era. This system included a [[parabolic antenna]] six feet in diameter that was mechanically aimed in a helical pattern (round and round as well as up and down).\n\nOne of Chrysler's most significant contributions to the war effort was not in the field of vehicles but in the radar field. For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army's [[Signal Corps Laboratories]] turned to Chrysler's Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. To keep weight down, 6,000 equally spaced holes were drilled in the face (this had no effect on the radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler's research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans used in the systems.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stout |first=Wesley W. |title=The Great Detective |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Colton |first=Roger B. |title=Radar in the United States Army |publisher=Proceedings of the I.R.E. |volume=33 |pages=740\u2013753 |year=1947 |url=http://cecom.army.mil/historian/docdisp.php?fname=RadarintheUSArmy_byRogerColton.pdf&dirname=Radar |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625022825/http://cecom.army.mil/historian/docdisp.php?fname=RadarintheUSArmy_byRogerColton.pdf&dirname=Radar |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Aircraft===\n* [[Chrysler VZ-6]]\n\n===Missiles===\nIn April 1950, the U.S. Army established the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at [[Redstone Arsenal]], adjacent to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. To form OGMC, over 1,000 civilian and military personnel were transferred from [[Fort Bliss, Texas]]. Included was a group of German scientists and engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]]; this group had been brought to America under [[Project Paperclip]]. OGMC designed the Army's first [[short-range ballistic missile]], the [[PGM-11 Redstone]], based on the WWII German [[V-2]] missile. Chrysler established the Missile Division to serve as the Redstone prime contractor, setting up an engineering operation in Huntsville and for production obtaining use from the U.S. Navy of a large plant in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]]. The Redstone was in active service from 1958 to 1964; it was also the first missile to test-launch a live [[nuclear weapon]], first detonated in a 1958 test in the South Pacific.<ref>Bullard, John W.; \"History Of The Redstone Missile System,\" Historical Monograph Project Number: AMC 23 M. Historical Division, Army Missile Command</ref>\n\nWorking together, the Missile Division and von Braun's team greatly increased the capability of the Redstone, resulting in the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]], a [[medium-range ballistic missile]]. In May 1959, a Jupiter missile launched two small monkeys into space in a [[nose cone]]; this was America's first successful flight and recovery of live space payloads. Responsibility for deploying Jupiter missiles was transferred from the Army to the Air Force; armed with [[nuclear warheads]], they were first deployed in [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]] during the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Chrysler SM-78/PGM-19 Jupiter |publisher=National Museum of the U.S. Air Force |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=534 |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094736/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=534 |archivedate=April 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Space boosters===\nIn July 1959, [[NASA]] chose the [[Redstone missile]] as the basis for the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]] to be used for suborbital test flights of the [[Project Mercury]] spacecraft. Three unmanned MRLV launch attempts were made between November 1960 and March 1961, two of which were successful. The MRLV successfully launched the chimpanzee [[Ham the Chimp|Ham]], and astronauts [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Gus Grissom]] on three suborbital flights in January, May and July 1961, respectively.\n\nAmerica's more ambitious manned space travel plans included the design of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn series]] of heavy-lift launch vehicles by a team headed by [[Wernher von Braun]]. Chrysler's Huntsville operation, then designated the Space Division, became [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]'s prime contractor for the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] versions. The design was based on a cluster of Redstone and [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] fuel tanks, and Chrysler built it for the [[Apollo program]] in the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in East New Orleans, one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world.

Archaeologist Leslie Wallace notes that \"Because no [[Prehistoric Britain#Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)|LPRIA]] settlements or significant domestic refuse have been found in London, despite extensive archaeological excavation, arguments for a purely Roman foundation of London are now common and uncontroversial.\"<ref name=\"Wallace\">{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Leslie|title=Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04757-0|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbMkBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=pre-roman+london#v=onepage&q=pre-roman%20london&f=false|accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt its height, the Roman city had a population of approximately 45,000\u201360,000 inhabitants. Londinium was an ethnically diverse city, with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, [[continental Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34809804 DNA study finds London was ethnically diverse from start], [[BBC]], 23 November 2015</ref> The Romans built the [[London Wall]] some time between 190 and 225 AD. The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though Londinium did not extend further west than [[Ludgate]] or the [[River Fleet|Fleet]], and the mid-estuary Thames was undredged and wider than it is today thus, the City's shoreline was north of its present position. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as 50 AD, near to today's [[London Bridge]].\n\n=== Decline ===\nBy the time the London Wall was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in 410 AD the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] (\"London market\"), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===\n\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}\nDuring the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]\n\n[[Bede]] records that in 604 AD [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[S\u00e6berht of Essex|S\u00e6berht]].

The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] (\"London Fort\", a [[borough]]).

While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.<ref>''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&nbsp;33\u201335</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.\n\nAs the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the \"old settlement\"). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the \"old market-place\"), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|right|Map of London in about 1300]]\n[[File:DeathWatTyler.jpg|thumb|right|A pivotal event during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], 1381: their leader [[Wat Tyler]] is stabbed by [[William Walworth]], Lord Mayor]]\n{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}\nFollowing the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners.

Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority.

A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].\n\nIn 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].\n\n[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodcut map of London|\"Woodcut\" map of London]], dating from the 1560s]]\n[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Great Fire of London]], which destroyed nearly 80% of the City]]\n[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|right|The 1666 Great Fire as depicted in a 17th-century painting: it depicts Old London Bridge, churches, houses, and the Tower of London as seen from a boat near Tower Wharf]]\n\nThe City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nBy the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].\n\nIn 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].\n\n=== Growth of London ===\n\nThe 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].\n\nExpansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\nAn attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]\n\nThe City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].\n\nThere was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].\n\nThe City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]]  ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the \"[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]\" has been maintained to control entry points to the City.\n\nThe 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] (\"the Gherkin\"'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (\"the Cheesegrater\"), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (\"the Walkie-Talkie\"), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.\n\nThe main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.\n\n''For a history of the etymology behind the City's streets see: [[Street names of the City of London]]''\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:Guildhall, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 139.JPG|thumb|[[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is the ceremonial and administrative centre of the City.]]\n[[File:London MMB \u00bb2K9 Mansion House.jpg|thumb|[[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] is the official residence of the Lord Mayor.]]\n[[File:Lord Mayor of London - John Stuttard - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Stuttard]], Lord Mayor of the City of London 2006\u20132007, during the Lord Mayor's Show of 2006.]]\n{{Contradicts other|date=August 2013|1=City of London Corporation}}\n{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}\nThe City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]]. Historically its system of government was not unusual, but it was not reformed by the [[Municipal Reform Act 1835]] and little changed by later reforms.\n\nIt is administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (''not the same as the more recent [[Mayor of London]]''), which is responsible for a number of functions and has interests in land beyond the City's boundaries. Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The Court of Aldermen represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].\n\nThe City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]]. Senior members of the Livery Companies are known as [[Liveryman|Liverymen]] and form the Common Hall, which chooses the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs and certain other officers.\n\n=== Wards ===\n{{Main|Wards of the City of London}}\nThe City is made up of [[:Category:Wards of the City of London|25 wards]].

The review was conducted by senior officers of the Corporation and senior judges of the [[Old Bailey]];<ref>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm Corporation of London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041508/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm |date=14 January 2010 }} Ward Boundary Review (2010)</ref> the wards are reviewed by this process to avoid [[malapportionment]]. The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.\n\nEach ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.\n\nCensus data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population. Being subject to renaming and definition at any time, these census 'wards' are notable in that four of the eight wards accounted for 67% of the 'square mile' and held 86% of the population, and these were in fact similar to and named after four City of London wards:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"max-width:50em;\"\n|+ Extract of census 'wards' where approximate to underlying legal wards<ref name=ons>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|title=Detect browser settings|first=Neighbourhood Statistics \u2013 Neil|last=Sillitoe|date=14 April 2008|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.\n\nThe City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{cn|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]]. In 2009, the business vote was about 24,000, greatly exceeding residential voters.<ref name=tribune>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2009/02/12/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers/|title=Labour runs in City of London poll against 'get-rich' bankers|date=12 February 2009|author=Ren\u00e9 Lavanchy|work=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]|accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref> As the City of London Corporation has not been affected by other municipal legislation over the period of time since then, its electoral practice has become increasingly anomalous. Uniquely for city or borough elections, its elections remain independent-dominated.\n\nThe business or \"[[non-residential vote]]\" was abolished in other UK local council elections by the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]], but was preserved in the City of London. The principal reason given by successive UK governments for retaining this mechanism for giving businesses representation, is that the City is \"primarily a place for doing business\".<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=City of London (Ward Elections) Bill (By Order) \u2013 Second Reading|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990224/debtext/90224-48.htm |date=24 February 1999 |column_start=482 |column_end=485}}</ref> About 330,000 non-residents constitute the day-time population and use most of its services, far outnumbering residents, who number around 7,000 (2011).

Under the new system, the number of non-resident voters has doubled from 16,000 to 32,000. Previously disenfranchised firms (and other organisations) are entitled to nominate voters, in addition to those already represented, and all such bodies are now required to choose their voters in a representative fashion. Bodies employing fewer than ten people may appoint one voter; those employing ten to 50 people one voter for every five employees; those employing more than 50 people ten voters and one additional voter for each 50 employees beyond the first 50. The Act also removed other anomalies which had been unchanged since the 1850s.\n\n=== The Temple ===\n[[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] (which neighbour each other) are two of the few remaining [[Liberty (division)|liberties]], an old name for a geographic division.

However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement\u2014the [[River Fleet]]\u2014along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other \"City bars\" which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.\n[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]\n\nMost of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's \"[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers or streams]]\", today underground as a [[storm drain]].\n\nThe boundary of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}</ref>\n\n[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]].

However the arms were in use some months before Tyler's death, and the tradition that Walworth's dagger is depicted may date from the late 17th century.<ref name=bening /><ref name=sgiles>{{cite book |last=Scott-Giles |first=C Wilfrid |authorlink=Wilfrid Scott-Giles |title=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition |year=1953 |publisher=[[J.

Of the [[Districts of England|326 English districts]], it is the second smallest [[List of English districts by population|by population]], after the [[Isles of Scilly]], and the smallest [[List of English districts by area|by area]]. It is also [[List of cities in the United Kingdom#England|the smallest English]] [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] by population (and in Britain, only two cities in Wales are smaller), and the [[List of smallest cities in the United Kingdom|smallest in the UK by area]].\n\nThe elevation of the City ranges from sea level at the Thames to {{convert|21.6|m|ft}} at the junction of High Holborn and Chancery Lane.<ref>[[Ordnance Survey]] data</ref> Two small but notable hills are within the historic core, [[Ludgate Hill]] to the west and [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] to the east. Between them ran the [[Walbrook]], one of the many [[Subterranean rivers of London|\"lost\" rivers or streams of London]] (another is the [[River Fleet|Fleet]]).\n\n=== Boundary ===\n[[File:City of London map 01.svg|thumb|right|Borders of the City of London, showing surrounding [[London borough]]s and the pre-1994 boundary (where changed) in red. The area covered by the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple]] is marked.]]\n[http://www.mapping.cityoflondon.gov.uk/geocortex/mapping/?viewer=compass Official boundary map, with wards.]\n\nBeginning in the west, where the City borders Westminster, the boundary crosses the [[Victoria Embankment]] from the Thames, passes to the west of [[Middle Temple]], then turns for a short distance along [[Strand, London|Strand]] and then north up [[Chancery Lane]], where it borders Camden. It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.\n\nThe boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn. A more substantial monument marks the boundary at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] on Fleet Street.\n\nIn some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the boundaries, notably to the north and east, into the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the \"Square Mile\". Since the 1990s the eastern fringe, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites compared to within the City.\n\n=== Gardens and public art ===\n{{See also|List of public art in the City of London}}\n[[File:Finsbury Circus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Finsbury Circus]], the largest public open space, seen from [[Tower 42]]]]\nThe City has no sizeable parks within its boundary, but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces, many of them maintained by the Corporation. These range from formal gardens such as the one in [[Finsbury Circus]], containing a [[bowling green]] and [[bandstand]], to churchyards such as [[St Olave Hart Street]], to water features and artwork in courtyards and pedestrianised lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk |title=Gardens of the City of London |publisher=Gardens of the City of London |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nGardens include:\n* Barber-Surgeon's Hall Garden, [[London Wall]]\n* Cleary Garden, [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |title=The History of the Bay Trust, Fred Cleary \u2013 Founder |publisher=baytrust.org.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109223713/http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |archivedate=9 January 2014  }}</ref>\n* [[Finsbury Circus]], Blomfield Street/London Wall/[[Moorgate]]\n* [[Jubilee Garden]], [[Houndsditch]]\n* Portsoken Street Garden, Portsoken Street/Goodman's Yard\n* [[Postman's Park]], [[Little Britain, London|Little Britain]]\n* Seething Lane Garden, Seething Lane\n* [[St Dunstan-in-the-East]], St Dunstan's Hill\n* [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], Aldermanbury\n* St Olave Hart Street churchyard, Seething Lane\n* St Paul's churchyard, [[St Paul's Cathedral]]\n* West Smithfield Garden, [[West Smithfield]]\n* Whittington Gardens, College Street\n\nThere are a number of private gardens and open spaces, often within courtyards of the larger commercial developments.

Now St. James Park provides the nearest official readings.\n\nThe City has an [[Maritime Climate|oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] \"Cfb\") modified by the [[Urban Heat Island]] in the centre of London. This generally causes higher night-time minima than outlying areas.

These helmets do not feature either [[St Edward's Crown]] or the [[Brunswick Star]], which are used on most other police helmets in [[England and Wales]].\n\nThe City's position as the United Kingdom's financial centre and a critical part of the country's economy, contributing about 2.5% of the UK's [[gross national product]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |title=Key facts |publisher=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023000216/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |archivedate=23 October 2011 |df= }}</ref> has resulted in it becoming a target for political violence. The [[Provisional IRA]] exploded several [[bomb]]s in the early 1990s, including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].\n\nThe area is also spoken of as a possible target for [[al-Qaeda]].

Although growth has continued in both locations, and there have been relocations in both directions, the Corporation has come to realise that its planning policies may have been causing financial firms to choose Canary Wharf as a location.\n\n=== Headquarters ===\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|[[Paternoster Square]], since 2004 the home of the [[London Stock Exchange]]]]\nMany major global companies have their headquarters in the City, including [[Aviva]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Aviva}}</ref> [[BT Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|title=Contact BT|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=BT Group}}</ref> [[Lloyds Banking Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310191913/http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2009|title=Company Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Lloyds Banking Group}}</ref> [[Old Mutual]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|title=Investor Relations Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Old Mutual}}</ref> [[Prudential plc|Prudential]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106183040/http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 January 2006|title=Contact|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Prudential}}</ref> [[Schroders plc|Schroders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|title=Contact us|accessdate=3 November 2016|publisher=Schroders}}</ref> [[Standard Chartered Bank|Standard Chartered]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|title=Contact Us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Standard Chartered}}</ref> and [[Unilever PLC|Unilever]].<ref>[http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx Unilever registered offices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830072007/http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx |date=30 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nA number of the world's largest law firms are headquartered in the City, including four of the \"[[Magic Circle (law firms)|Magic Circle]]\" law firms ([[Allen & Overy]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter & May]]), as well as other firms such as [[DLA Piper]], [[Eversheds Sutherland]], [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] and [[Hogan Lovells]].\n\n=== Other sectors ===\n[[File:Barbican Centre City of London.jpg|thumb|right|Barbican Centre]]\nWhilst the financial sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate, the economy is not limited to that sector. The legal profession has a strong presence, especially in the west and north (i.e., towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the \"night-time\" economy does feature in the [[Bishopsgate]] area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.\n\n=== Retail and residential ===\nThe trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.<ref>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512135507/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm |date=12 May 2010 }} Core Strategy</ref> Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. Recent residential developments include \"the Heron\", a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.\n\nSince the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n=== Historical buildings ===\nFire, bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment has meant that the City, despite its history, has relatively few intact notable historic structures. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (\"the Monument\"), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].\n\nThe [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\n[[File:Royal Exchange Panorama.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.25|The Bank of England (left) and the Royal Exchange (centre) are two of the many significant buildings in the City of London.]]\n\n=== Skyscrapers and tall buildings ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}\n\n[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|The City skyline in February 2016, including [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (left), the [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (centre) and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (right)]]\n\n;Completed\n\nA growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector.

In humans, the visible portion - the glans - is at the front junction of the [[labia minora]] (inner lips), above the opening of the [[urethra]]. Unlike the [[penis]], the male [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] (equivalent) to the clitoris, it usually does not contain the [[distal]] portion (or opening) of the urethra and is therefore not used for urination. The clitoris also usually lacks a [[reproductive]] function. While few animals urinate through the clitoris or use it reproductively, the [[spotted hyena]], which has an especially large clitoris, urinates, mates, and gives birth via the organ. Some other mammals, such as [[lemur]]s and [[spider monkey]]s, also have a large clitoris.<ref name=\"Goodman_Roughgarden_Wingfield\" />\n\nThe clitoris is the human female's most sensitive [[erogenous zone]] and generally the primary [[anatomical]] source of human female [[Human sexuality|sexual]] pleasure.<ref name=\"Rodgers_O'Connell_Greenberg_Weiten_Carroll\"/> In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the [[embryo]] called the [[genital tubercle]]. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on the presence or absence of the protein [[testis determining factor|tdf]], which is codified by a single gene on the [[Y chromosome]]. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have about 8,000 [[Sensory nerve|sensory]] [[Nerve|nerve endings]].<ref name=\"Carroll_Di Marino\"/>\n\n[[Sexology|Sexological]], medical, and psychological debate have focused on the clitoris,<ref name=\"Moore_Blechner\"_Shrage\"/> and it has been subject to [[social constructionist]] analyses and studies.<ref name=\"Moore_Wade\"_Labuski\"/> Such discussions range from anatomical accuracy, [[gender inequality]], [[female genital mutilation]], and [[orgasm]]ic factors and their physiological explanation for the [[G-spot]].<ref name=\"Shrage_Schwartz_Wood_Blechner\"/> Although, in humans, the only known purpose of the clitoris is to provide sexual pleasure, whether the clitoris is [[vestigiality|vestigial]], an [[adaptation]], or serves a reproductive function has been debated.<ref name=\"Rodgers_O'Connell_Kilchevsky\"/> Social perceptions of the clitoris include the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding [[Genital modification and mutilation|genital modification]] such as [[Clitoral enlargement methods|clitoris enlargement]], [[clitoris piercing]] and [[clitoridectomy]].<ref name=\"Ogletree_Chalker_Momoh\"/> Genital modification may be for [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], medical or cultural reasons.<ref name=\"Ogletree_Chalker_Momoh\"/>\n\nKnowledge of the clitoris is significantly impacted by cultural perceptions of the organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate [[social stigma]]s associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and [[vulva]] in general are visually unappealing, that female [[masturbation]] is [[taboo]], or that men should be expected to master and control women's orgasms.<ref name=\"Ogletree_Wade_Waskul\"/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Etymology==\n<!-- NOTE: Though the \"Society and culture\" section partially deals with terms for the clitoris, it seems that the information there and therefore these two sections are better kept separate, considering that the terms in the latter section are thoroughly intertwined with historical beliefs about the clitoris's structure.

The Latin [[genitive]] is ''clitoridis'', as in \"[[clitoral glans|glans clitoridis]]\". In medical and sexological literature, the clitoris is sometimes referred to as \"the female penis\" or [[pseudo-penis]],<ref name=\"Puppo\"/> and the term ''clitoris'' is commonly used to refer to the glans alone;<ref name=\"O'Connell\" /> partially because of this, there have been various terms for the organ that have [[#Society and culture|historically confused its anatomy]].<!-- NOTE: Linking to a section within the same article is allowed; see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking#Section links.-->\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Stages in the development of the external sexual organs in the female (from Gray1119).png|thumb|[[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|Stages in the development of the clitoris]]]]\nIn mammals, [[sexual differentiation]] is determined by the [[sperm]] that carries either an [[X chromosome|X]] or a [[Y chromosome|Y]] (male) chromosome.<ref name=\"Llord\" /> The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene ([[SRY]]) that encodes a [[transcription factor]] for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of [[testosterone]] and [[Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone]] for the [[embryo]]'s development into a male.<ref name=\"Merz_Sch\u00fcnke\" /><ref name=\"Hake\"/> This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception.<ref name=\"Merz_Sch\u00fcnke\" /> Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week,<ref name=\"Merz\"/> while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.<ref name=\"Sch\u00fcnke\" />\n\nThe clitoris develops from a [[Primordial phallus|phallic]] outgrowth in the embryo called the [[genital tubercle]]. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during [[development of the reproductive system]] depending on exposure to [[androgen]]s (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] (different versions of the same structure).<ref name=\"Sloane_Merz_Sch\u00fcnke\"/>\n\nIf exposed to testosterone, the genital tubercle elongates to form the penis.

The urogenital sinus persists as [[Vulval vestibule|the vestibule]] of the [[vagina]], the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia.<ref name=\"Sloane_Merz_Sch\u00fcnke\"/> A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is [[clitoromegaly]].<ref name=\"Copcu_Kaufman\"/>\n===Gross anatomy and histology {{anchor|frenulum clitoridis}} ===\n====General====\n[[File:Slide6REAL.JPG|thumb|Clitoris; deep dissection]]\nThe clitoris contains external and internal components. It consists of the [[clitoral glans|glans]], the body (which is composed of two [[Erectile tissue|erectile]] structures known as the [[Corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpora cavernosa]]), and two [[Crus of clitoris|crura]] (\"legs\"). It has a [[clitoral hood|hood]] formed by the [[labia minora]] (inner lips). It also has [[Bulb of vestibule|vestibular or clitoral bulbs]]. The frenulum of clitoris is a [[frenulum]] on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora.<ref name=\"Sloane_O'Connell_Crooks_Ginger\" /> The clitoral body may be referred to as the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft. The shaft supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.<ref name=\"Sloane_Crooks_Angier_Jones\"/>\n\nResearch indicates that clitoral tissue extends into the vagina's anterior wall.<ref name=\"O'Connell 2006_Kilchevsky_Di Marino\"/> \u015eenayl\u0131 et al. said that the [[Histology|histological]] evaluation of the clitoris, \"especially of the corpora cavernosa, is incomplete because for many years the clitoris was considered a rudimentary and nonfunctional organ.\" They added that Baskin and colleagues examined the clitoris's [[Virilization|masculinization]] after dissection and, using imaging software after [[Masson's trichrome stain|Masson chrome staining]], put the serial dissected specimens together; this revealed that the nerves of the clitoris surround the whole clitoral body (corpus).<ref name=\"\u015eenayl\u0131\" />\n\nThe clitoris, vestibular bulbs, labia minora, and urethra involve two histologically distinct types of vascular tissue (tissue related to [[blood vessel]]s), the first of which is [[trabecula]]ted, erectile tissue innervated by the [[cavernous nerves]]. The trabeculated tissue has a [[Spongy tissue|spongy appearance]]; along with blood, it fills the large, dilated vascular spaces of the clitoris and the bulbs. Beneath the [[epithelium]] of the vascular areas is [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]].<ref name=\"Ginger\" /> As indicated by Yang et al.'s research, it may also be that the urethral lumen (the inner open space or cavity of the urethra), which is surrounded by spongy tissue, has tissue that \"is grossly distinct from the vascular tissue of the clitoris and bulbs, and on macroscopic observation, is paler than the dark tissue\" of the clitoris and bulbs.<ref name=\"Yang\" /> The second type of vascular tissue is non-erectile, which may consist of blood vessels that are dispersed within a fibrous matrix and have only a minimal amount of smooth muscle.<ref name=\"Ginger\" />\n\n====Glans and body====\n[[File:Clit.jpg|thumb|An exposed clitoral glans]]\nHighly [[Nerve|innervated]], the glans exists at the tip of the clitoral body as a [[Fiber|fibro]]-vascular cap,<ref name=\"Ginger\" /> and is usually the size and shape of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller.

Although the clitoral body becomes engorged with blood upon [[sexual arousal]], [[Clitoral erection|erecting the clitoral glans]], some sources describe the clitoral glans and labia minora as composed of non-erectile tissue; this is especially the case for the glans.<ref name=\"O'Connell\" /><ref name=\"Ginger\" /> They state that the clitoral glans and labia minora have blood vessels that are dispersed within a fibrous matrix and have only a minimal amount of smooth muscle,<ref name=\"Ginger\"/> or that the clitoral glans is \"a midline, densely neural, non-erectile structure\".<ref name=\"O'Connell\" /> \n\nOther descriptions of the glans assert that it is composed of erectile tissue and that erectile tissue is present within the labia minora.<ref name=\"Yang_Wilkinson_Farage\"/>  The glans may be noted as having glanular vascular spaces that are not as prominent as those in the clitoral body, with the spaces being separated more by smooth muscle than in the body and crura.<ref name=\"Yang\" /> [[Adipose tissue]] is absent in the labia minora, but the organ may be described as being made up of [[dense connective tissue]], erectile tissue and [[Elastin|elastic]] fibers.<ref name=\"Yang_Wilkinson_Farage\"/>\n[[File:Figure 28 02 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Structures of the vulva, including external and internal parts of the clitoris]]\n\nThe clitoral body forms a [[Furcula|wishbone]]-shaped structure containing the corpora cavernosa&nbsp;\u2013 a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the clitoris during clitoral erection.

When engorged with blood, they cuff the vaginal opening and cause the vulva to expand outward.<ref name=\"Ginger\" /> Although a number of texts state that they surround the vaginal opening, Ginger et al. state that this does not appear to be the case and tunica albuginea does not envelop the erectile tissue of the bulbs.<ref name=\"Ginger\" /> In Yang et al.'s assessment of the bulbs' anatomy, they conclude that the bulbs \"arch over the distal urethra, outlining what might be appropriately called the 'bulbar urethra' in women.\"<ref name=\"Yang\" />\n\n===Homology===\nThe clitoris and penis are generally the same anatomical structure, although the [[distal]] portion (or opening) of the urethra is absent in the clitoris of humans and most other animals. The idea that males have clitorises was suggested in 1987 by researcher<!-- NOTE: \"Some sources call her a sexologist, anatomist, psychologist, or medical researcher. So \"researcher\" is used to avoid any inaccuracy. --> Josephine Lowndes Sevely, who theorized that the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|male corpora cavernosa]] (a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the penis during penile [[erection]]) are the true counterpart of the clitoris. She argued that \"the male clitoris\" is directly beneath the rim of the [[glans penis]], where the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum of prepuce of the penis]] (a fold of the prepuce) is located, and proposed that this area be called the \"Lownde's crown.\" Her theory and proposal, though acknowledged in anatomical literature, did not materialize in anatomy books.<ref name=\"Frayser_Drenth\"/> Modern anatomical texts show that the clitoris displays a hood that is the equivalent of the penis's [[foreskin]], which covers the glans. It also has a shaft that is attached to the glans. The male corpora cavernosa are homologous to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis (the female cavernosa), the [[bulb of penis]] (also known as the bulb of the corpus spongiosum penis) is homologous to the vestibular bulbs beneath the labia minora, and the [[scrotum]] is homologous to the labia minora and labia majora.<ref name=\"Chapple_Schuenke_Saladin\" />\n\nUpon anatomical study, the penis can be described as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra.<ref name=\"Chapple_Schuenke_Saladin\" /> With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the [[human penis]] (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body.<ref name=\"Carroll_Di Marino\"/> These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis.

Although [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory that clitoral orgasms are a prepubertal or adolescent phenomenon and that vaginal (or [[G-spot]]) orgasms are something that only physically mature females experience had been criticized before, Kinsey was the first researcher to harshly criticize the theory.<ref name=\"Koedt\"/><ref name=\"Tavris_Irvine\"/> Through his observations of female masturbation and interviews with thousands of women,<ref name=\"Archer_Andersen_Williams\"/> Kinsey found that most of the women he observed and surveyed could not have vaginal orgasms,<ref name=\"Pomeroy_Irvine_Williams\"/> a finding that was also supported by his knowledge of sex organ anatomy.<ref name=\"Pomeroy 1982 p8\" /> Scholar Janice M. Irvine stated that he \"criticized Freud and other theorists for projecting male constructs of sexuality onto women\" and \"viewed the clitoris as the main center of sexual response\". He considered the vagina to be \"relatively unimportant\" for sexual satisfaction, relaying that \"few women inserted fingers or objects into their vaginas when they masturbated\". Believing that vaginal orgasms are \"a physiological impossibility\" because the vagina has insufficient nerve endings for sexual pleasure or climax, he \"concluded that satisfaction from penile penetration [is] mainly psychological or perhaps the result of referred sensation\".<ref name=\"Irvine 2005 pp37\u201338\" />\n\n[[Masters and Johnson]]'s research, as well as [[Shere Hite]]'s, generally supported Kinsey's findings about the female orgasm.<ref name=\"Pomeroy_Archer_Hite_Irvine_Williams\" /> Masters and Johnson were the first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. They observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms have the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On that basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms,<ref name=\"Archer_Williams_Rosenthal\" /> reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.<ref name=\"Lloyd p53\" /> The research came at the time of the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], which inspired feminists to reject the distinction made between clitoral and vaginal orgasms.<ref name=\"Koedt\" /><ref name=\"Fahs 2011 pp38-45\" /> Feminist [[Anne Koedt]] argued that because men \"have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina\" and not the clitoral area, this is why women's biology had not been properly analyzed. \"Today, with extensive knowledge of anatomy, with [C. Lombard Kelly], Kinsey, and Masters and Johnson, to mention just a few sources, there is no ignorance on the subject [of the female orgasm],\" she stated in her 1970 article ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]].''

In 2008, they published the first complete 3D [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]] of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina. On the basis of their findings, they argued that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot, because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible. In their 2009 published study, the \"coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall\". Buisson and Fold\u00e8s suggested \"that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction\".<ref name=\"Buisson_Acton_Carroll\"/><ref name=\"Pappas\" />\n\nResearcher Vincenzo Puppo, who, while agreeing that the clitoris is the center of female sexual pleasure and believing that there is no anatomical evidence of the vaginal orgasm, disagrees with O'Connell and other researchers' terminological and anatomical descriptions of the clitoris (such as referring to the vestibular bulbs as the \"clitoral bulbs\") and states that \"the inner clitoris\" does not exist because the penis cannot come in contact with the congregation of multiple nerves/veins situated until the angle of the clitoris, detailed by [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt|Kobelt]], or with the roots of the clitoris, which do not have sensory receptors or erogenous sensitivity, during vaginal intercourse.<ref name=\"Puppo\" /> Puppo's belief contrasts the general belief among researchers that vaginal orgasms are the result of clitoral stimulation; they reaffirm that clitoral tissue extends, or is at least stimulated by its bulbs, even in the area most commonly reported to be the G-spot.<ref name=\"Cavendish_Kilchevsky_Carroll\"/>\n\nThe G-spot being analogous to the base of the male penis has additionally been theorized, with sentiment from researcher Amichai Kilchevsky that because female fetal development is the \"default\" state in the absence of substantial exposure to male hormones and therefore the penis is essentially a clitoris enlarged by such hormones, there is no evolutionary reason why females would have an entity in addition to the clitoris that can produce orgasms.<ref name=\"Alexander/MSNBC 2012\" /> The general difficulty of achieving orgasms vaginally, which is a predicament that is likely due to nature easing the process of child bearing by drastically reducing the number of vaginal nerve endings,<ref name=\"Balon_Weiten_Rosenthal\"/> challenge arguments that vaginal orgasms help encourage sexual intercourse in order to facilitate reproduction.<ref name=\"Kilchevsky\"/><ref name=\"Lloyd\" /> Supporting a distinct G-spot, however, is a study by [[Rutgers University]], published in 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; the scans indicated that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall&nbsp;\u2013 where the G-spot is reported to be&nbsp;\u2013 when several women stimulated themselves in a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance]] (fMRI) machine.<ref name=\"Pappas\"/><ref name=\"Komisaruk_Lehmiller\"/> Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings, stated that he feels that \"the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing\" and that it is \"a region, it's a convergence of many different structures\".<ref name=\"Kilchevsky\" />\n\n===Vestigiality, adaptionist and reproductive views===\nWhether the clitoris is [[vestigiality|vestigial]], an [[adaptation]], or serves a [[Sexual reproduction|reproductive]] function has also been debated.<ref name=\"Angier_Gould_Lloyd_Miller\"/><ref name=\"Chivers\" /> [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] stated that [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], [[Meredith Small]] and [[Sarah Blaffer Hrdy]] \"have viewed the clitoral orgasm as a legitimate adaptation in its own right, with major implications for female sexual behavior and sexual evolution\".<ref name=\"Miller\" /> Like [[Lynn Margulis]] and [[Natalie Angier]], Miller believes, \"The human clitoris shows no apparent signs of having evolved directly through male [[mate choice]]. It is not especially large, brightly colored, specifically shaped or selectively displayed during courtship.\" He contrasts this with other female species such as [[spider monkey]]s and [[spotted hyena]]s that have clitorises as long as their male counterparts. He said the human clitoris \"could have evolved to be much more conspicuous if males had preferred sexual partners with larger brighter clitorises\" and that \"its inconspicuous design combined with its exquisite sensitivity suggests that the clitoris is important not as an object of male mate choice, but as a mechanism of female choice.\"<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nWhile Miller stated that male scientists such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Donald Symons]] \"have viewed the female clitoral orgasm as an evolutionary side-effect of the male capacity for penile orgasm\" and that they \"suggested that clitoral orgasm cannot be an adaptation because it is too hard to achieve\",<ref name=\"Miller\" /> Gould acknowledged that \"most female orgasms emanate from a clitoral, rather than vaginal (or some other), site\" and that his nonadaptive belief \"has been widely misunderstood as a denial of either the adaptive value of female orgasm in general, or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance in some broader sense\". He said that although he accepts that \"clitoral orgasm plays a pleasurable and central role in female sexuality and its joys,\" \"[a]ll these favorable attributes, however, emerge just as clearly and just as easily, whether the clitoral site of orgasm arose as a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] or an adaptation\". He added that the \"male biologists who fretted over [the adaptionist questions] simply assumed that a deeply vaginal site, nearer the region of fertilization, would offer greater selective benefit\" due to their [[Darwinism|Darwinian]], ''[[summum bonum]]'' beliefs about enhanced reproductive success.<ref name=\"Gould\" />\n\nSimilar to Gould's beliefs about adaptionist views and that \"females grow nipples as adaptations for suckling, and males grow smaller unused nipples as a spandrel based upon the value of single development channels\",<ref name=\"Gould\" /> [[Elisabeth Lloyd]] suggested that there is little evidence to support an adaptionist account of female orgasm.<ref name=\"Lloyd\" /><ref name=\"Chivers\" /> [[Meredith Chivers|Meredith L. Chivers]] stated that \"Lloyd views female orgasm as an [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]] leftover; women have orgasms because the urogenital neurophysiology for orgasm is so strongly selected for in males that this developmental blueprint gets expressed in females without affecting fitness\" and this is similar to \"males hav[ing] nipples that serve no fitness-related function.\"<ref name=\"Chivers\" />\n\nAt the 2002 conference for Canadian [[Society for Women in Philosophy|Society of Women in Philosophy]], [[Nancy Tuana]] argued that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction; she stated that it has been ignored because of \"a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear.\" She reasoned that this fear causes ignorance, which veils female sexuality.<ref name=\"Cairney\" /> O'Connell stated, \"It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive.\" She reiterated that the vestibular bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the location of female sexual function and orgasm.<ref name=\"O'Connell\" /><ref name=\"Yang\" />\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Modification===\n{{main article|Genital modification and mutilation|Female genital mutilation|Clitoromegaly}}\n[[File:Clitoromegaly2.jpg|thumb|upright|An enlarged clitoris due to clitoromegaly]]\nModifications to the clitoris can be intentional or unintentional.

In another method, 50&nbsp;percent of the ventral clitoris is removed through the level base of the clitoral shaft, and it is reported that good sensation and clitoral function are observed in follow up\"; additionally, it has \"been reported that the complications are from the same as those in the older procedures for this method\".<ref name=\"\u015eenayl\u0131\" />\n\nWith regard to females who have the condition [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], the largest group requiring surgical genital correction, researcher Atilla \u015eenayl\u0131 stated, \"The main expectations for the operations are to create a normal female anatomy, with minimal complications and improvement of life quality.\" \u015eenayl\u0131 added that \"[c]osmesis, structural integrity, and coital capacity of the vagina, and absence of pain during sexual activity are the parameters to be judged by the surgeon.\"  ([[Cosmesis]] usually refers to the surgical correction of a disfiguring defect.) He stated that although \"expectations can be standardized within these few parameters, operative techniques have not yet become homogeneous. Investigators have preferred different operations for different ages of patients\".<ref name=\"\u015eenayl\u0131\" />\n\nGender assessment and surgical treatment are the two main steps in intersex operations. \"The first treatments for clitoromegaly were simply resection of the clitoris. Later, it was understood that the clitoris glans and sensory input are important to facilitate orgasm,\" stated Atilla. The clitoral glans's epithelium \"has high cutaneous sensitivity, which is important in sexual responses\" and it is because of this that \"recession clitoroplasty was later devised as an alternative, but reduction clitoroplasty is the method currently performed.\"<ref name=\"\u015eenayl\u0131\"/>\n\nWhat is often referred to as \"[[clitoris piercing|clit piercing]]\" is the more common (and significantly less complicated) [[clitoral hood piercing]]. Since clitoral piercing is difficult and very painful, piercing of the clitoral hood is more common than piercing the clitoral shaft, owing to the small percentage of people who are anatomically suited for it.<ref name=\"Morris_Pitts-Taylor\"/> Clitoral hood piercings are usually channeled in the form of vertical piercings, and, to a lesser extent, horizontal piercings. The triangle piercing is a very deep horizontal hood piercing, and is done behind the clitoris as opposed to in front of it. For styles such as the [[Isabella piercing|Isabella]], which pass through the clitoral shaft but are placed deep at the base, they provide unique stimulation and still require the proper genital build; the Isabella starts between the clitoral glans and the urethra, exiting at the top of the clitoral hood; this piercing is highly risky with regard to damage that may occur because of intersecting nerves.<ref name=\"Morris_Pitts-Taylor\"/>\n\n===Sexual disorders===\n[[Persistent genital arousal disorder]] (PGAD) results in a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire.<ref name=\"Porst_Lehmiller\"/> Clitoral [[priapism]], also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD.<ref name=\"Porst_Lehmiller\"/> With PGAD, arousal lasts for an unusually extended period of time (ranging from hours to days);<ref name=\"Gordon\"/> it can also be associated with [[morphometrics|morphometric]] and vascular modifications of the clitoris.<ref name=\"Battaglia\"/>\n\nDrugs may cause or affect clitoral priapism. The drug [[trazodone]] is known to cause male priapism as a side effect, but there is only one documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy.<ref name=\"Schatzberg\"/> Additionally, [[nefazodone]] is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case,<ref name=\"Schatzberg\"/> and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of [[antipsychotic]]s or [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).<ref name=\"Goldmeier_Collins\"/>\n\nBecause PGAD is relatively rare and, as its own concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder.<ref name=\"Porst_Lehmiller\"/> In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with [[Artery|arterial]] branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.<ref name=\"Boston\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Ancient Greek\u201316th century knowledge and vernacular===\n<!-- NOTE: No History subheading was created, because it is unnecessary/non-beneficial to artificially separate the historical content from the Society and culture section; it's all society and culture. -->\n\nWith regard to historical and modern perceptions of the clitoris and associated sexual stimulation, for more than 2,500 years there were scholars who considered the clitoris and the penis equivalent in all respects except their arrangement.<ref name=\"Chalker\"/> The clitoris was, however, subject to \"discovery\" and \"rediscovery\" through empirical documentation by male scholars, due to it being frequently omitted from, or misrepresented, in historical and contemporary anatomical texts.<ref name=\"Harvey_O'Connell_Ginger\" /> The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], and Greek and Roman generations up to and throughout the [[Renaissance]], were aware that male and female sex organs are anatomically similar,<ref name=\"Chalker 2002 p77\" /><ref name=\"Raab\" /> but prominent anatomists, notably [[Galen]] (129&nbsp;\u2013 c. 200 AD) and [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]] (1514\u20131564), regarded the vagina as the structural equivalent of the penis, except for being inverted; Vesalius argued against the existence of the clitoris in normal women, and his anatomical model described how the penis corresponds with the vagina, without a role for the clitoris.<ref name=\"Angier_O'Connell\"/>\n\nAncient Greek and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]] additionally designated penetration as \"male-defined\" sexuality. The term ''[[Tribadism|tribas]]'', or ''tribade'', was used to refer to a woman or intersex individual who actively penetrated another person (male or female) through use of the clitoris or a [[dildo]]. As any sexual act was believed to require that one of the partners be \"[[Phallus|phallic]]\" and that therefore sexual activity between women was impossible without this feature, mythology popularly associated lesbians with either having enlarged clitorises or as incapable of enjoying sexual activity without the substitution of a phallus.<ref name=\"Swancutt_Halberstam\"/><ref name=\"Norton\"/>\n\n[[File:De re anatomica libri 15 V00044 00000004.tif|thumb|''De re anatomica'']]\nIn 1545, [[Charles Estienne]] was the first writer to identify the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded that it had a urinary function.<ref name=\"O'Connell\" /> Following this study, [[Realdo Colombo]] (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the [[University of Padua]], Italy, published a book called ''De re anatomica'' in 1559, in which he describes the \"seat of woman's delight\".<ref name=\"Pitts-Taylor_Di Marino\"/> In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, \"Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.\", in reference to the mythological [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], goddess of erotic love.<ref name=\"Harvey\"/><ref name=\"Neil\"/> Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, [[Gabriele Falloppio]] (discoverer of the [[fallopian tube]]), who claimed that he was the first to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, \"Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it&nbsp;... and do not say a word about it&nbsp;... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students.\" This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, \"It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women.\" He concluded, \"I think that such a structure appears in [[hermaphrodite]]s who otherwise have well formed genitals, as [[Paul of Aegina]] describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which [[Avicenna]] called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus.\"<ref name=\"O'Connell_Di Marino\"/>\n\nThe average anatomist had difficulty challenging Galen's or Vesalius's research; Galen was the most famous physician of the Greek era and his works were considered the standard of medical understanding up to and throughout the Renaissance (i.e. for almost two thousand years),<ref name=\"Raab\" /><ref name=\"Angier_O'Connell\"/> and various terms being used to describe the clitoris seemed to have further confused the issue of its structure. In addition to Avicenna's naming it the ''albaratha'' or ''virga'' (\"rod\") and Colombo's calling it sweetness of Venus, [[Hippocrates]] used the term ''columella'' (\"little pillar'\"), and [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Albucasis]], an Arabic medical authority, named it ''tentigo'' (\"tension\"). The names indicated that each description of the structures was about the body and glans of the clitoris, but usually the glans.<ref name=\"O'Connell\" /> It was additionally known to the Romans, who named it (vulgar slang) ''[[landica]]''.<ref name=\"Adams\" /> However, [[Albertus Magnus]], one of the most prolific writers of the Middle Ages, felt that it was important to highlight \"homologies between male and female structures and function\" by adding \"a psychology of sexual arousal\" that [[Aristotle]] had not used to detail the clitoris.

Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope and size of the human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. \"It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary,\" she said. \"Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible.\" The project is called ''Cliteracy'' and it includes a \"clit rodeo\", which is an interactive, [[Mechanical bull|climb-on model]] of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. \"It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown.

The [[Mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The current mayor is [[Rahm Emanuel]]. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. As well as the mayor, Chicago's clerk and treasurer are also elected citywide. The [[Chicago City Council|City Council]] is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each [[wards of the United States|ward]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Council, Your Ward & Alderman|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> The council takes official action through the passage of [[local ordinance|ordinances]] and resolutions and approves the city budget.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago Government|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/chicagogovt.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chicago Police Department]] provides law enforcement and the [[Chicago Fire Department]] provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the city and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the [[Cook County Circuit Court]] of the State of Illinois court system, or in the [[Northern District of Illinois]], in the federal system. In the state court, the public prosecutor is the Illinois [[State's Attorney]]; in the Federal court it is the United States [[District Attorney|Attorney]].\n\n===Politics===\n{{Main|Political history of Chicago}}\nDuring much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, [[anarchism|anarchist]] and labor organizations.<ref>Schneirov 1998, pp 173\u2013174</ref> For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been \"[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]\" in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding.\n\nChicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but it is split between eight of Illinois' 19 [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. All eight of the city's representatives are Democrats; a Republican has only represented a significant portion of the city twice since 1973, for one term each\u2013[[Robert P. Hanrahan]] from 1973 to 1975, and [[Michael Patrick Flanagan]] from 1995 to 1997.\n\n[[Machine politics]] persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.<ref>Montejano 1998, pp 33\u201334</ref> During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal \"independent\" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]] (in office 1983\u20131987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor, [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley. On May 16, 2011, [[Rahm Emanuel]] was sworn in as the 55th mayor of Chicago. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.\n\nFormerly a state legislator representing Chicago and later a US Senator, the city is home of former United States President [[Barack Obama]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]]. The Obamas' residence is located near the University of Chicago in [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] on the city's south side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/07/27/with-michelle-obama-in-town-speculation-about-future-for-their-home/|title=With Michelle Obama In Town, Speculation About Future For Their Home|first=Derrick|last=Blakley|date=|work=cbslocal.com}}</ref>\n\n===Crime===\n{{Main|Crime in Chicago|Timeline of organized crime in Chicago}}\n[[File:Chicago Police SUV.jpg|thumb|[[Chicago Police Department]] SUV, 2011]]\nChicago had a murder rate of 18.5 per 100,000 residents in 2012, ranking 16th among US cities with 100,000 people or more.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fenton|first1=Justin|title=Baltimore ranked 6th in murder rate in 2012|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-06-03/news/bal-baltimore-ranked-6th-in-murder-rate-in-2012-20130603_1_murder-rate-top-10-cities-per-capita-murders|accessdate=October 1, 2014|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 3, 2013}}</ref> This was higher than in New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest cities in the United States, which have lower murder rates and lower total homicides.

It was originally released in 1996.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[Image:Cyrix 6x86 arch.svg|250px|thumb|A simplistic block diagram of the Cyrix 6x86 [[microarchitecture]] ]]\n\nThe 6x86 is [[superscalar]] and [[superpipelined]] and performs [[register renaming]], [[speculative execution]], [[out-of-order execution]], and [[data dependency]] removal.<ref name=M1DataSheet>{{cite web |url=http://datasheets.chipdb.org/Cyrix/M1/6x86/M1-1.PDF |title=Cyrix M1 datasheet}}</ref> However, it continued to use native x86 execution and ordinary [[microcode]] only, like [[Centaur Technology|Centaur]]'s [[Winchip]], unlike competitors [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] which introduced the method of ''dynamic'' translation to [[micro-operation]]s with [[Pentium Pro]] and [[AMD K5|K5]]. The 6x86 is [[CPU socket|socket]]-compatible with the Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)#P54C|P54C]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]], and was offered in six performance levels: PR 90+, PR 120+, PR 133+, PR 150+, PR 166+ and PR 200+. These performance levels do not map to the clock speed of the chip itself (for example, a PR 133+ ran at 110&nbsp;MHz, a PR 166+ ran at 133&nbsp;MHz, etc.).\n\nWith regard to internal caches, it has a 16-[[Kibibyte|KB]] primary [[CPU cache|cache]] and a fully associative 256-byte instruction line cache is included alongside the primary cache, which functions as the primary instruction cache.<ref name=M1DataSheet />\n\nThe 6x86 and 6x86L weren't completely compatible with the Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] instruction set and is not multi-processor capable. For this reason, the chip identified itself as a [[Intel 80486|80486]] and disabled the [[CPUID]] instruction by default. CPUID support could be enabled by first enabling extended CCR registers then setting bit 7 in CCR4. The lack of full P5 Pentium compatibility caused problems with some applications because programmers had begun to use P5 Pentium-specific instructions. Some companies released patches for their products to make them function on the 6x86. \n\nCompatibility with the Pentium was improved in the 6x86MX, by adding a [[Time Stamp Counter]] to support the P5 Pentium's RDTSC instruction.<ref name=6x86MXDataSheet>{{cite web |url=http://datasheets.chipdb.org/IBM/x86/6x86MX/mx_full.pdf |title=IBM 6x86MX datasheet}}</ref> Support for the Pentium Pro's CMOVcc instructions were also added.<ref name=6x86MXDataSheet />\n\n==Performance==\nSimilarly to [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] with their [[AMD K5|K5]] and early [[AMD K6|K6]] processors, Cyrix used a [[PR rating]] (Performance Rating) to relate their performance to the Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] (pre-[[P55C (microprocessor)|P55C]]), as the 6x86's higher per-clock performance relative to a P5 Pentium could be quantified against a higher-clocked Pentium part. For example, a 133&nbsp;MHz 6x86 will match or outperform a P5 Pentium at 166&nbsp;MHz, and as a result Cyrix could market the 133&nbsp;MHz chip as being a P5 Pentium 166's equal. However, the PR rating was not an entirely truthful representation of the 6x86's performance.\n\nWhile the 6x86's integer performance was significantly higher than P5 Pentium's, its floating point performance was more mediocre\u2014between 2 and 4 times the performance of the 486 FPU per clock cycle (depending on the operation and precision). The [[Floating point unit|FPU]] in the 6x86 was largely the same circuitry that was developed for Cyrix's earlier high performance 8087/80287/80387-compatible coprocessors, which was very fast for its time\u2014the Cyrix FPU was much faster than the 80387, and even the 80486 FPU. However, it was still considerably slower than the new and completely redesigned P5 Pentium and [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium Pro]]-[[Pentium III]] FPUs.\n\nDuring the 6x86's development, the majority of applications ([[office software]] as well as games) performed almost entirely integer operations. The designers foresaw that future applications would most likely maintain this instruction focus. So, to optimize the chip's performance for what they believed to be the most likely application of the CPU, the integer execution resources received most of the transistor budget. This would later prove to be a strategic mistake, as the popularity of the P5 Pentium caused many [[software developer]]s to hand-optimize code in [[X86 assembly language|assembly language]], to take advantage of the P5 Pentium's tightly pipelined and lower latency FPU. For example, the highly anticipated [[first person shooter]] ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' used highly optimized assembly code designed almost entirely around the P5 Pentium's FPU. As a result, the P5 Pentium significantly outperformed other CPUs in the game. \n\nTherefore, despite being very fast clock by clock, the 6x86 and MII were forced to compete at the low-end of the market as AMD K6 and Intel [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium II]] were always ahead on clock speed. The 6x86's and MII's old generation \"486 class\" floating point unit combined with an integer section that was at best on-par with the newer P6 and K6 chips meant that Cyrix could no longer compete in performance.\n\n==Models==\n\n===6x86===\n[[File:Cyrix 6x86-P166.jpg|thumb|Cyrix 6x86 133MHz]]\nThe ''6x86'' (codename M1) was released by [[Cyrix]] in 1996. The first generation of 6x86 had heat problems. This was primarily caused by their higher heat output than other x86 CPUs of the day and, as such, computer builders sometimes did not equip them with adequate cooling. The CPUs topped out at around 25&nbsp;[[Watt|W]] heat output (like the [[AMD K6]]), whereas the P5 Pentium produced around 15&nbsp;W of [[waste heat]] at its peak. However, both numbers would be a fraction of the heat generated by many high performance processors, some years later.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nImage:Cyrix_6x86_early_die.jpg|Early Cyrix 6x86 (M1) die shot\n</gallery>\n\n===6x86L===\n[[File:KL IBM 6x86L Cyrix.jpg|thumb|Cyrix 6x86L 133MHz sold under IBM label.]]\n\nThe '''6x86L''' (codename M1L) was later released by [[Cyrix]] to address heat issues; the ''L'' standing for ''low-power''. Improved manufacturing technologies permitted usage of a lower Vcore. Just like the Pentium MMX the 6x86L required a split powerplane voltage regulator with separate voltages for I/O and CPU core. \n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nImage:Cyrix_6x86_die.JPG|Cyrix 6x86L (M1L) die shot\n</gallery>\n\n===6x86MX / MII===\n[[File:IBM PR300.jpg|thumb|IBM 6x86MX PR300 processor]]\n[[File:Cyrix IBM CPU 6x86MX PR200 bottom.jpg|thumb|View of the [[socket 7]] 321-pin connectors of an IBM 6x86MX PR200 CPU.]]\n\nAnother release of the 6x86, the '''6x86MX''', added [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] compatibility along with the [[Extended MMX|EMMI]] instruction set, improved compatibility with the Pentium and Pentium Pro by adding a [[Time Stamp Counter]] and CMOVcc instructions respectively, and quadrupled the primary cache size to 64&nbsp;KB. The 256-byte instruction line cache can be turned into a [[Scratchpad_memory|scratchpad cache]] to provide support for multimedia operations.<ref name=6x86MXDataSheet /> Later revisions of this chip were renamed  '''MII''', to better compete with the Pentium II processor. Unfortunately, 6x86MX / '''MII''' was late to market, and couldn't scale well in clock speed with the manufacturing processes used at the time.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nImage:KL Cyrix_6x86MX.jpg|Cyrix 6x86MX 150 MHz\nImage:KL IBM 6x86MX.jpg|IBM 6x86MX 133MHz\nImage:KL Cyrix MII-333.jpg|Cyrix MII 250MHz\nImage:Cyrix_6x86MX_die.JPG|Cyrix 6x86MX (M2) die shot\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Gwennap, Linley (25 October 1993). \"Cyrix Describes Pentium Competitor\" ''[[Microprocessor Report]]''.\n*Gwennap, Linley (5 December 1994). \"Cyrix M1 Design Tapes Out\".

The latest edition, and the first published after the death of Ranganathan, was the seventh (Ranganathan 1987). Being a mathematician and a close student of an inspiring teacher W.C.B. Sayers (1881-1960) in the School of Librarianship, University College London, Ranganathan was most attracted to classification studies. In his later work, he perceived many similarities between classification and mathematics (Ranganathan 1939b). At the same time, practical classification by the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) did not satisfy his orderly mind. That being a \"mark and park system\" without any professed theory, he could assign more than one class number to a document, especially those dealing with compound and complex subjects. For example, \"Anatomy of flowering plants\" could either be given the class number of \"Plant anatomy\" or \"Botany of flowering plants\". It was a problematic option by default for all such compound subjects. In his view, this defeated the purpose of classification itself. Besides this, Ranganathan also found only a nominal representation of Indian subjects in the scheme. WASPish (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant) bias in Dewey's system, as it is in other western systems, is well-known, even today (Comaromi and Satija 1985). Indeed all KO systems are cultural and temporal in their making (Judge 1983); we shall return to this principal cultural bias in the conclusion (Section 5.3).\n\n: First, Ranganathan realized that the aftermath of World War I, 1914-1919, had brought in the emergence of specialized, micro, and interdisciplinary subjects, which the existing classifications failed to cope with. He diagnosed that DDC, because of its enumerative nature and 17th century roots, was a classification suited to the nineteenth century linear, mono-dimensional kind of literature (cf., Ranganathan 1961, 81-83). An enumerative classification by default is not able to assign coextensive class numbers to most compound and complex subjects except to some by coincidence (Parrochia and Neuville 2013, 14).\n\n: Knowing the malady, the remedy could not have been far away. The problem occupied his mind relentlessly. In 1924, Ranganathan happened to visit Selfridge's department store in London, and accidentally stumbled on a demonstration of a Meccano toy kit. The salesman was making different toys from the same kit by permutation and combination of the blocks, strips, nuts, and bolts. That triggered his mind to adopt a similar technique to design different class numbers from the same subject concepts to suit individual documents (Indian Statistical Institute 2012) [2]. This idea later brought a paradigm shift in classification theory, practice, and research. He visualized that all knowledge is composed of some basic and discrete concepts (call these building blocks of the universe of knowledge), which could be combined to construct class numbers to specifically suit a document, instead of assigning it a predetermined ready-made sort of pigeonhole class number. Connecting symbols in the form of punctuation marks served as his nuts and bolts to string together discrete concepts. Sayers at once commended the idea of the new technique, but warned him of the labour and patience required for the huge task ahead (Maltby 1975, 191).\n\n: Back home in 1925, as the first trained librarian of Madras University, he developed and applied his scheme to that library, and gained long and first-hand experience of its applications and problems, including comments from the library's users. As already stated, CC was first published in 1933.\n\n: The second edition (Ranganathan 1939a), was important as it clearly laid down the theory and methods of CC as already published in his magnum opus, the Prolegomena to library classification (Ranganathan 1937). The third edition of CC (Ranganathan 1950) came out when Ranganathan had moved to Delhi University and was in the second phase of his writing career. In Delhi, he attracted a band of young and faithful follower librarians and organized them into a formal group named Library Research Circle; they considerably advanced research in classification, and applied his KO systems and methods in their libraries (Parthasarthy 1952). Colon Classification was widely adopted in Delhi libraries. This led him to delve into his classification theory at a somewhat more abstract level with his colleagues, disciples and students. New advances were published in conference volumes and serials of the Indian Library Association of which he was the president (1944-1953).\n\n: After long experience and a constant quest to generalize the various facets, in 1952 he came out with his famous, although debatable, theory of \"five and only five fundamental categories\" in the universe of knowledge. In the earlier editions, the facets were named variously in different main classes, e.g., problem facet, institution facet, substance facet, etc. (Ranganathan 1939, 1.85-1.151). In the fourth edition (Ranganathan 1952) these were highly generalized by an intuitive process of abstraction, and named as personality, matter, energy, space, and time, famously known as PMEST [3]. It was a masterstroke in generalizing myriads of facets to a few seminal categories [4]. Five is considered as the least number of categories for any bibliographic classification postulated so far. The fifth edition (Ranganathan 1957a) was proposed as two volumes of basic and depth versions, but only the basic version was published. Later Ranganathan realized the non-viability of publishing depth schedules in book form (Indian Statistical Institute 2012).\n\n: By the time the sixth edition was published (Ranganathan 1960), CC had reached its pinnacle of glory, exemplified by the International Study Conference on Classification Study and Information Retrieval, held at Dorking, England in 1957, which exclusively discussed his theories with wide approval. The Classification Research Group (CRG, London, formed in 1952) declared its manifesto of faceted classification as the basis of all future information retrieval systems. Ranganathan's philosophy and method of facet analysis achieved wide acceptance, though only a few believed the doctrine of five fundamental categories. The term facet was used differently by different scholars and classification schemes, and it still continues so.\n\n: The sixth edition, later issued with amendments (Ranganathan 1963), remains the most popular, used and stable edition. It is the one taught in all Indian library schools. The seventh edition (Ranganathan 1987), which was published posthumously and edited by his long time research assistant, Professor M.A. Gopinath (1940-2013), was considered by many to be confused and inconsistent in structure and notation. On the whole, this edition has been discarded by the Indian library profession (Satija 1990). Nevertheless, it brought many metamorphic changes to aspects such as basic subjects, categories, common isolates, and notation, though to no avail.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.essessreference.com/servlet/esGetBiblio?bno=000374 ''Colon Classification'' (6th Edition)] by Dr. S.R.

The term is used mostly in connection with [[Population and housing censuses by country|national population and housing censuses]]; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The [[United Nations]] defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.<ref>United Nations (2008).

The modern census is essential to [[international comparisons]] of any kind of statistics, and censuses collect data on many attributes of a population, not just how many people there are. Censuses typically began as the only method of collecting national demographic data, and are now part of a larger system of different surveys. Although population estimates remain an important function of a census, including exactly the geographic distribution of the population, statistics can be produced about combinations of attributes e.g. education by age and sex in different regions. Current administrative data systems allow for other approaches to enumeration with the same level of detail but raise concerns about privacy and the possibility of biasing estimates.<ref name=\"theforgottenfamily.wordpress.org\">{{cite web|url=https://theforgottenfamily.wordpress.com/2017/01/19/history-and-development-of-the-census-in-england-and-wales/ |title=History and Development of the Census in England and Wales |website=theforgottenfamily.wordpress.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}</ref>\n\nA census can be contrasted with [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] in which information is obtained only from a subset of a population; typically main population estimates are updated by such [[intercensal estimate]]s. Modern census data are commonly used for research, business [[marketing]], and planning, and as a baseline for designing sample surveys by providing a sampling frame such as an address register. Census counts are necessary to adjust samples to be representative of a population by weighting them as is common in [[opinion poll]]ing. Similarly, [[stratified sampling|stratification]] requires knowledge of the relative sizes of different population strata which can be derived from census enumerations. In some countries, the census provides the official counts used to apportion the number of elected representatives to regions (sometimes controversially \u2013 e.g., ''[[Utah v. Evans]]''). In many cases, a carefully chosen random sample can provide more accurate information than attempts to get a population census.<ref>Salant, Priscilla, and Don A. Dillman. \"How to Conduct your own Survey: Leading professional give you proven techniques for getting reliable results.\" (1995).</ref>\n\n==Sampling==\nA census is often construed as the opposite of a sample as its intent is to count everyone in a population rather than a fraction. However, population censuses rely on a [[sampling frame]] to count the population. This is the only way to be sure that everyone has been included as otherwise those not responding would not be followed up on and individuals could be missed. The fundamental premise of a census is that the population is not known and a new estimate is to be made by the analysis of primary data. \nThe use of a sampling frame is counterintuitive as it suggests that the population size is already known. However, a census is also used to collect attribute data on the individuals in the nation. This process of sampling marks the difference between historical census, which was a house to house process or the product of an imperial decree, and the modern statistical project.\nThe sampling frame used by census is almost always an address register. Thus it is not known if there is anyone resident or how many people there are in each household. Depending on the mode of enumeration, a form is sent to the householder, an enumerator calls, or administrative records for the dwelling are accessed. As a preliminary to the dispatch of forms, census workers will check any address problems on the ground.\nWhile it may seem straightforward to use the postal service file for this purpose, this can be out of date and some dwellings may contain a number of independent households. A particular problem is what are termed 'communal establishments' which category includes student residences, religious orders, homes for the elderly, people in prisons etc. As these are not easily enumerated by a single householder, they are often treated differently and visited by special teams of census workers to ensure they are classified appropriately.\n\n==Residence definitions==\nIndividuals are normally counted within households and information is typically collected about the household structure and the housing. For this reason international documents refer to censuses of population and housing. Normally the census response is made by a household, indicating details of individuals resident there.\nAn important aspect of census enumerations is determining which individuals can be counted from which cannot be counted. Broadly, three definitions can be used: ''de facto'' residence; ''de jure'' residence; and, permanent residence. This is important to consider individuals who have multiple or temporary addresses. Every person should be identified uniquely as resident in one place but where they happen to be on [[Census Day]], their [[Home range|''de facto'' residence]], may not be the best place to count them. Where an individual uses services may be more useful and this is at their usual, or ''de jure'', residence. An individual may be represented at a permanent address, perhaps a family home for students or long term migrants.\nIt is necessary to have a precise definition of residence to decide whether visitors to a country should be included in the population count. This is becoming more important as students travel abroad for education for a period of several years. Other groups causing problems of enumeration are new born babies, refugees, people away on holiday, people moving home around census day, and people without a fixed address.\nPeople having second homes because of working in another part of the country or retaining a holiday cottage are difficult to fix at a particular address sometimes causing double counting or houses being mistakenly identified as vacant. Another problem is where people use a different address at different times e.g. students living at their place of education in term time but returning to a family home during vacations or children whose parents have separated who effectively have two family homes. Census enumeration has always been based on finding people where they live as there is no systematic alternative - any list you could use to find people is derived from census activities in the first place. Recent UN guidelines provide recommendation on enumerating such complex households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/emerging_forms_families_households.html |title=Measurement of emerging forms of families and households |publisher=UNECE |accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==Enumeration strategies==\nHistorical censuses used crude enumeration assuming absolute accuracy. Modern approaches take into account the problems of [[overcount]] and [[undercount]], and the coherence of census enumerations with other official sources of data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb20/KnowledgebaseArticle10408.aspx |title=Census Quality Evaluation: considerations from an international perspective |publisher=Unstats.un.org |accessdate=2012-02-19}}</ref> This reflects a realist approach to measurement, acknowledging that under any definition of residence there is a true value of the population but this can never be measured with complete accuracy. An important aspect of the census process is to evaluate the quality of the data.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Breiman | first1 = Leo | year = 1994 | title = The 1991 Census Adjustment: Undercount or Bad Data? | url = | journal = [[Statistical Science]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 458\u2013475 }}</ref>\n\nMany countries use a post-enumeration survey to adjust the raw census counts.<ref>World Population and Housing Census Programme (2010) [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/handbooks/Manual_PESen.pdf Post Enumeration Surveys: Operational guidelines], United Nations Secretariat, Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division, Tech Report</ref> This works in a similar manner to [[capture-recapture]] estimation for animal populations. In census circles this method is called dual system enumeration (DSE). A sample of households are visited by interviewers who record the details of the household as at census day. These data are then matched to census records and the number of people missed can be estimated by considering the number missed in the census or survey but counted in the other. This way counts can be adjusted for non-response varying between different [[demographic]] groups. An explanation using a fishing analogy can be found in \"Trout, Catfish and Roach...\"<ref>Benton, P. [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/census-coverage-survey/trout--catfish-and-roach.pdf Trout, Catfish and Roach: The beginner\u2019s guide to census population estimates], [[Office for National Statistics]], UK</ref> which won an award from the [[Royal Statistical Society]] for excellence in [[official statistics]] in 2011.\n[[File:Enumerator.jpg|thumb|Enumerator conducting a survey using a mobile phone-based questionnaire in rural [[Zimbabwe]].]]\nTriple system enumeration has been proposed as an improvement as it would allow evaluation of the statistical dependence of pairs of sources. However, as the matching process is the most difficult aspect of census estimation this has never been implemented for a national enumeration. It would also be difficult to identify three different sources that were sufficiently different to make the triple system effort worthwhile. The DSE approach has another weakness in that it assumes there is no person counted twice (over count). In ''de facto'' residence definitions this would not be a problem but in ''de jure'' definitions individuals risk being recorded on more than one form leading to double counting. A particular problem here are students who often have a term time and family address.\n\nSeveral countries have used a system which is known as short form/long form.<ref>[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/what-is-a-census/other-methods-of-census-taking/index.html Other methods of census taking], [[Office for National Statistics]], UK</ref> This is a [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] strategy which randomly chooses a proportion of people to send a more detailed questionnaire to (the long form). Everyone receives the short form questions. Thereby more data are collected but not imposing a burden on the whole population. This also reduces the burden on the statistical office. Indeed, in the UK all residents were required to fill in the whole form but only a 10% sample were coded and analysed in detail, until 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/census-2001/about-census-2001/introduction/index.html |title=Introduction to Census 2001 |publisher=Ons.gov.uk |date=2001-04-29 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref> New technology means that all data are now scanned and processed.

This allows a simulated census to be conducted by linking several different administrative databases at an agreed time. Data can be matched and an overall enumeration established accounting for where the different sources are discrepant. A validation survey is still conducted in a similar way to the post enumeration survey employed in a traditional census.\nOther countries which have a population register use this as a basis for all the census statistics needed by users. This is most common among Nordic countries but requires a large number of different registers to be combined including population, housing, employment and education. These registers are then combined and brought up to the standard of a statistical register by comparing the data in different sources and ensuring the quality is sufficient for official statistics to be produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/Register_based_statistics_in_Nordic_countries.pdf |title=Register-based statistics in the Nordic countries |format=PDF|website=Unece.org |year=2007 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>\nA recent innovation is the French instigation of a rolling census programme with different regions enumerated each year such that the whole country is completely enumerated every 5 to 10 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.hk/wsc/STS017-P5-S.pdf|title=The French Rolling Census: a decade of experience|last=Durr|first=Jean-Michel and Fran\u00e7ois Clanch\u00e9|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In Europe, in connection with the 2010 census round, a large number of countries adopted alternative census methodologies, often based on the combination of data from registers, surveys and other sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/censuses/2010+Population+Census+Round |title=2010 Population Census Round - Confluence |publisher=.unece.org |accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\nCensuses have evolved in their use of technology with the latest censuses, the 2010 round, using many new types of computing. In Brazil, handheld devices were used by enumerators to locate residences on the ground. In many countries, census returns could be made via the Internet as well as in paper form. DSE is facilitated by computer matching techniques which can be automated, such as [[propensity score matching]]. In the UK, all census formats are scanned and stored electronically before being destroyed, replacing the need for physical archives. The record linking to perform an administrative census would not be possible without large databases being stored on computer systems.\n\nNew technology is not without problems in its introduction. The US census had intended to use the handheld computers but cost escalated and this was abandoned, with the contract being sold to Brazil. Online response is a good idea but one of the functions of census is to make sure everyone is counted accurately. A system which allowed people to enter their address without verification would be open to abuse. Therefore, households have to be verified on the ground, typically by an enumerator visit or post out. Paper forms are still necessary for those without access to Internet connections. It is also possible that the hidden nature of an administrative census means that users are not engaged with the importance of contributing their data to official statistics.\n\nAlternatively, population estimations may be carried out remotely with [[GIS]] and [[remote sensing]] technologies.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=\n |year=2016\n |title=Population Estimation Using a 3D City Model: A Multi-Scale Country-Wide Study in the Netherlands\n |journal=PLOS ONE\n |volume=11 | issue = 6  |pages= e0156808\n |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0156808\n |last1=Biljecki\n |first1=F.\n |last2=Arroyo Ohori\n |first2=K.\n |last3=Ledoux\n |first3=H.\n |last4=Peters\n |first4=R.\n |last5=Stoter\n |first5=J.\n |pmid=27254151\n |pmc=4890761\n}}</ref>\n\n==Census and development==\nAccording to UNFPA, \u201cThe information generated by a population and housing census \u2013 numbers of people, their distribution, their living conditions and other key data \u2013 is critical for development.\u201d <ref name=\"unfpa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/census |title=Census &#124; UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund |website=UNFPA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-20}}</ref> This is because this type of data is essential for policymakers so that they know where to invest. Unfortunately, many countries have outdated or inaccurate data about their populations and therefore, without accurate data are unable to address the needs of their population.\n\nUNFPA stated that,<ref name=\"unfpa.org\"/>\n\n\u201cThe unique advantage of the census is that it represents the entire statistical universe, down to the smallest geographical units, of a country or region. Planners need this information for all kinds of development work, including: assessing demographic trends; analysing socio-economic conditions;<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.45.3 | issue=45 | title=Excavations and Watching Brief at the Corner of Wade Street and Little Anne Street, St Jude's, Bristol, 2014 | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Corcos | first1 = Nick }}</ref> designing evidence-based poverty-reduction strategies; monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of policies; and tracking progress toward national and internationally agreed development goals.\u201d\n\nIn addition to making policymakers aware about population issues, it is also an important tool for identifying forms of social, demographic or economic exclusions, such as inequalities relating to race, ethics and religion as well as disadvantaged groups such as those with disabilities and the poor.\n\nAn accurate census can empower local communities by providing them with the necessary information to participate in local decision-making and ensuring they are represented.\n\n==Uses of census data==\nIn the nineteenth century, the first censuses collected paper enumerations that had to be collated by hand so the statistical uses were very basic. The government owned the data and were able to publish statistics themselves on the state of the nation.<ref>Kathrin Levitan (auth.), ''A Cultural History of the British Census: Envisioning the Multitude in the Nineteenth Century'', 978-1-349-29824-2, 978-0-230-33760-2 \tPalgrave Macmillan US \t2011.</ref> Uses were to measure changes in the population and apportion representation. Population estimates could be compared to those of other countries.\n\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century, censuses were recording households and some indications of their employment. In some countries, census archives are released for public examination after many decades, allowing genealogists to track the ancestry of interested people. Archives provide a substantial historical record which may challenge established notions of tradition. It is also possible to understand the societal history through job titles and arrangements for the destitute and sick.\n\nThere are a lot of politics that surround the census in many countries. In Canada in 2010 for example, the government under the leadership of Stephen Harper abolished the mandatory long-form census. The decision to cut the long-form census was a response to protests from some Canadians who resented the personal questions.<ref name=\"Ditchburn\">{{cite web |author1=Jennifer Ditchburn|title=Tories scrap mandatory long-form census|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tories-scrap-mandatory-long-form-census/article4323276/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=September 23, 2017|date=June 29, 2010}}</ref> The long-form census was reinstated by the Justin Trudeau government in 2016.\n\n===Census data and research===\nAs governments assumed responsibility for schooling and welfare, large government [[research]] departments made extensive use of census data. Actuarial estimates could be made to project populations and plan for provision in local government and regions. It was also possible for central government to allocate funding on the basis of census data.\nEven into the mid twentieth century, census data was only directly accessible to large government departments. However, computers meant that tabulations could be used directly by university [[research]]ers, large businesses and local government offices. They could use the detail of the data to answer new questions and add to local and specialist knowledge.\n\nNow, census data are published in a wide variety of formats to be accessible to business, all levels of governance, media, students and teachers, charities and any citizen who is interested; researchers in particular have an interest in the role of ''Census Field Officers''  (CFO) and their assistants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morphy|first1=Frances|title=Agency, Contingency and Census Process: Observations of the 2006 Indigenous Enumeration Strategy in Remote Aboriginal Australia|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ydj3AQAAQBAJ&pg=PR11&lpg=PR11&ved=0ahUKEwjR8f65tf7NAhWDGpQKHZxtDy0Q6AEINjAE&q=researcher%20census%20field%20officer|publisher=ANU E Press, 2007|accessdate=19 July 2016|quote=One researcher spent time observing... the training of Census  Field Officers (CFO)  and their assistants....}}</ref>  Data can be represented visually or analysed in complex statistical models, to show the difference between certain areas, or to understand the association between different personal characteristics. Census data offer a unique insight into small areas and small demographic groups which sample data would be unable to capture with precision.\n\n==Privacy==\nAlthough the census provides a useful way of obtaining statistical information about a population, such information can sometimes lead to abuses, political or otherwise, made possible by the linking of individuals' identities to anonymous census data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/census/ |title=The Census and Privacy |website=EPIC.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-20}}</ref> This consideration is particularly important when individuals' census responses are made available in [[Microdata (statistics)|microdata]] form, but even aggregate-level data can result in privacy breaches when dealing with small areas and/or rare subpopulations.\n\nFor instance, when reporting data from a large city, it might be appropriate to give the average income for black males aged between 50 and 60. However, doing this for a town that only has two black males in this age group would be a breach of privacy because either of those persons, knowing his own income and the reported average, could determine the other man's income.\n\nTypically, census data are processed to obscure such individual information. Some agencies do this by intentionally introducing small statistical errors to prevent the identification of individuals in marginal populations;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3110129.NSF/f61552cc746715bcca256eb000015277/2878e9589dd56b53ca257153007fe1f5!OpenDocument |title=Managing Confidentiality and Learning about SEIFA |publisher=Abs.gov.au |date=2006-04-18 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref> others swap variables for similar respondents. Whatever measures have been taken to reduce the privacy risk in census data, new technology in the form of better electronic analysis of data poses increasing challenges to the protection of sensitive individual information. This is known as [[Statistical Disclosure Control|statistical disclosure control]].\n\nAnother possibility is to present survey results by means of statistical models in the form of a multivariate distribution mixture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jos.nu/Articles/abstract.asp?article=264673 |title=Statistical Model of the 2001 Czech Census for Interactive Presentation |vauthors=Grim J, Hora J, Somol P, Bo\u010dek P, Pudil, P |year=2010 |work=Journal of Official Statistics, vol. 26, no. 4 |pages=673\u2013694 }}</ref> The statistical information in the form of [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional distributions]] ([[histogram]]s) can be derived interactively from the estimated [[Mixture distribution|mixture model]] without any further access to the original database. As the final product does not contain any protected microdata, the  model based interactive software can be distributed without any confidentiality concerns.\n\nAnother method is simply to release no data at all, except very large scale data directly to the central government. Different release strategies between government have led to an international project ([[IPUMS]]) to co-ordinate access to microdata and corresponding metadata. Such projects also promote standardising metadata by projects such as [[SDMX]] so that best use can be made of the minimal data available.\n\n==Historical censuses==\n\n===Egypt===\n[[Census in Egypt|Censuses in Egypt]] first appear in the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and develops in the [[New Kingdom]]<ref>D.

The club shares the 38,402 seater [[Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi|Marc'Antonio Bentegodi]] stadium with its cross-town rivals [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe team was founded in 1929 by a small number of football fans from the small borough of [[Chievo]], a Verona neighbourhood. Initially the club was not officially affiliated to the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC), but nonetheless played several amateur tournament and friendly matches under the denomination \"O.N.D. Chievo\", a title imposed by the [[Kingdom of Italy|fascist regime]]. The club's formal debut in an official league was on 8 November 1931. The team colours at the time were blue and white. Chievo disbanded in 1936, however, due to economic woes but returned to play in 1948 after World War II, being registered in the regional league of \"Seconda Divisione\" (Second Division). In 1957, the team moved to the \"Carlantonio Bottagisio\" parish field, where they played until 1986. In 1959, after the restructuring of the football leagues, Chievo was admitted to play the \"Seconda Categoria\" (Second Category), a regional league placed next-to-last in the Italian football pyramid. That year, Chievo changed its name to \"Cardi Chievo\", after a new sponsor, and was quickly promoted to the \"Prima Categoria\", from which it experienced its first-ever relegation in 1962.\n\n===Series of promotions===\nIn 1964, Luigi Campedelli, a businessman and owner of the Paluani company, was named new Chievo chairman. Under Campedelli's presidency, Chievo climbed through the entire Italian football pyramid, reaching the [[Serie D]] after the 1974\u201375 season. Under the name \"Paluani Chievo\", the team was promoted to [[Serie C]]2 in 1986. As a consequence of promotion, Chievo was forced to move to the [[Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi]], the main venue in Verona; another promotion, to Serie C1, followed in 1989. In 1990, the team changed its name to its current one, \"A.C. ChievoVerona.\"\n\nIn 1992, President Luigi Campedelli, who had returned at the helm of the club two years before, died of a heart attack, and his son [[Luca Campedelli]], aged just 23, became the new and youngest chairman of an Italian professional football club. Campedelli promoted [[Giovanni Sartori (footballer)|Giovanni Sartori]] to director of football and named [[Alberto Malesani]] as the new head coach. Under Malesani, the team astonishingly won the Serie C1 and was promoted to [[Serie B]], where city rival [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]] was playing at the time. In 1997, after Malesani signed for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed the new head coach. The following season, with [[Domenico Caso]] as the coach, saw the first dismissal of a coach during the presidency of Luca Campedelli, with Caso being fired and replaced with [[Lorenzo Balestro]]. It was during these years that the nickname ''\"mussi volanti\"'' (\"flying donkeys\") was born. It originated from supporters of their crosstown rivals [[Hellas Verona|Hellas]], who would mock long-suffering Chievo supporters that Chievo will only be promoted if \"donkeys could fly\" (equivalent of the English language [[falsism]] \"if pigs could fly\", denoting an impossible dream).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2009/04/23/1225402/calcio-debate-the-fairytale-story-of-the-flying-donkeys-of|title=Calcio Debate: The Fairytale Story Of The Flying Donkeys Of Verona \u2013 Goal.com|date=23 April 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2000\u201301 Serie B|2000\u201301]], [[Luigi Delneri]] was signed as coach and led Chievo, by virtue of its third-place finish in Serie B, to promotion to [[Serie A]], the first time in team history that it had reached the top tier of Italian football.\n\n===Mussi Volanti (2001\u20132007)===\nIn its [[2001\u201302 Serie A|2001\u201302]], Chievo's Serie A debut season, the team was most critics' choice for an instant return to Serie B. However, they became the surprise team in the league, playing often spectacular and entertaining football and even leading the league for six consecutive weeks. The club finally ended the season with a highly respectable fifth-place finish, qualifying the team to play in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Chievo's impressive performance inspired a 2002 book about soccer economics titled \"Fenomeno Chievo. Economia, costume, societ\u00e0\" by Marco Vitale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fenomeno_Chievo.html?id=o0jLOwAACAAJ|title=Fenomeno Chievo: economia, costume, societ\u00e0 : una squadra di qurtiere contro il calcio miliardario|first1=Marco|last1=Vitale|first2=Gian Paolo|last2=Ormezzano|date=14 May 2018|publisher=Libri Scheiwiller|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2002\u201303 Serie A|2002\u201303]], Chievo debuted at the European level but were eliminated in the first round by [[Red Star Belgrade]]. The team finished the Serie A season in seventh place, again proving itself one of the better Serie A teams. The [[2003\u201304 Serie A|2003\u201304 season]], the last with Delneri at the helm, saw Chievo finish ninth.\n\nThe [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]] is remembered as one of the toughest ever in Chievo's history. [[Mario Beretta]], a Serie A novice from [[Ternana Calcio|Ternana]], was named the coach but, after a strong start that brought Chievo to third behind [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], the team slowly lost position in the league table. With three matches remaining in the season, Chievo was third-from-last, a position which would see it relegated to Serie B. As a last resort, Beretta was fired and [[Maurizio D'Angelo]], a former Chievo player, was appointed temporarily to replace him as coach. Morale improved, and two wins and a draw from the final three matches proved just enough to keep Chievo in Serie A.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2005\u201306]], [[Giuseppe Pillon]] of [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993|Treviso FBC]] was appointed as new coach. The team experienced a return to the successful Delneri era, both in style of play and results, which resulted in Chievo ending the season in seventh and gaining a berth in the UEFA Cup. However, because of the [[2006 Serie A scandal|football scandal]] involving several top-class teams, all of which finished higher than Chievo in the 2005\u201306 season, the Flying Donkeys were awarded a place in the next [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] preliminary phase.\n\nOn 14 July 2006, the verdict in the scandal was made public. Juventus, Milan and Fiorentina, who had all originally qualified for the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|2006\u201307 Champions League]], and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], who had originally qualified for the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup]], were all banned from [[UEFA]] competition for the 2006\u201307 season, although Milan were allowed to enter the Champions League after their appeal to the FIGC. Chievo took up a place in the third qualifying stage of the competition along with Milan and faced Bulgarian side [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]]. Chievo lost the first leg 2\u20130 in [[Sofia]] and managed a 2\u20132 home draw on the second leg and were eliminated by a 4\u20132 aggregate score with Levski advancing to the Champions League group stage. As a Champions League third round qualifying loser, Chievo was given a place in the UEFA Cup final qualifying round. On 25 August 2006, they were drawn to face Portuguese side [[S.C. Braga|Braga]]. The first leg, played on 14 September in [[Braga]], ended in a 2\u20130 win for the Portuguese. The return match, played on 28 September in Verona, although won by Chievo 2\u20131, resulted in a 3\u20132 aggregate loss and the club's elimination from the competition.\n\nOn 16 October 2006, following a 1\u20130 defeat against [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], head coach Giuseppe Pillon was fired, and replaced by Luigi Delneri, one of the original symbols of the ''miracle Chievo'', who had led the club to the Serie A in 2002.\n\nOn 27 May 2007, the last match day of the 2006\u201307 Serie A season, Chievo was one of five teams in danger of falling into the last undecided relegation spot. Needing only a draw against [[Calcio Catania|Catania]], a direct competitor in the relegation battle, Chievo lost 2\u20130 playing on a neutral field in [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]]. Wins by [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], [[A.C. Siena|Siena]] and [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] condemned Chievo to Serie B for the 2007\u201308 season after six seasons in the top flight.\n\nEven as a relatively-successful Serie A team the club, which averages only 9,000 to 10,000 fans<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiapostcards.com/A11-12.htm|title=Statistiche Spettatori Serie A 2011-2012 Attendance Statistics of Serie A (1st Div) 2011-2012 Fiorentina,Inter,Inter,Lazio,Milan,|website=www.stadiapostcards.com}}</ref> and is kept afloat mainly by money from television rights, does not have the same number of fan supporters as Hellas, the oldest team in Verona. The difference between the clubs supporters' number is highlighted during local derby games played in season 2001\u201302 at the clubs' shared stadium when, for Chievo's \"home\" fixtures, the Chievo fans were located in \"away\" end of the stadium (the area of the stadium Chievo's supporters by years claim as \"theirs\", in fact the main supporters faction's name is \"North Side\", the side of the stadium usually assigned to away teams' supporters), while the most of the rest of the stadium seats was assigned to Hellas supporters.\n\n===A year with the ''Cadetti'' (2007\u201308)===\nChievo bounced back quickly from the disappointment of their relegation on the last matchday of 2006\u201307, going in search of an immediate promotion back to the top flight. After the expected departure of several top-quality players including [[Franco Semioli]], [[Salvatore Lanna]], [[Matteo Brighi]], [[Paolo Sammarco]] and [[Erjon Bogdani]], the manager Delneri also parted ways with the club. [[Giuseppe Iachini]] replaced him and the captain, [[Lorenzo D'Anna]], gave way to [[Sergio Pellissier]] at the end of the transfer window. A new squad was constructed, most notably including the arrivals of midfielders [[Maurizio Ciaramitaro]] and [[Simone Bentivoglio]], defender [[C\u00e9sar de Luca|C\u00e9sar]] and forward [[Antimo Iunco]]. This new incarnation of the ''gialloblu'' were crowned winter champions (along with Bologna), en route to a 41st matchday promotion after a 1\u20131 draw at [[U.S. Grosseto F.C.|Grosseto]] left them four points clear of third-place [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] with one match remaining. In addition to winning promotion, they were conferred with the Ali della Vittoria trophy on the final matchday of the season, their first league title of any kind in 14 years.\n\n===Back in Serie A (2008\u2013)===\nIn their first season back to the top flight, Chievo immediately struggled in the league resulting in the dismissal of Iachini in November and his replacement with former Parma boss [[Domenico Di Carlo]].<ref name=\"dicarlo_chievo\">{{cite news|publisher=AC Chievo Verona |url=http://www.chievoverona.it/societa/notizia.aspx?P=0&tipo=N&ID=8136 |title=LA SQUADRA AFFIDATA A DOMENICO DI CARLO.

Highlight matches included a 3\u20130 defeat of Lazio (who then won the [[2008\u201309 Coppa Italia]] title) at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], and a thrilling 3\u20133 draw away to Juventus in which captain and longtime Chievo striker Sergio Pellissier scored a late equaliser to complete his first career hat-trick. A series of hard-fought draws against top clubs [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] in the final stretch of the season solidified ''Ceo'''s position outside the drop zone and Serie A status was finally confirmed on matchday 37 with a home draw against Bologna.

This allows multiple processes to share a single [[CPU]], and is an essential feature of a [[multitasking operating system]].\n\nThe precise meaning of the phrase \u201ccontext switch\u201d varies significantly in usage.  In a multitasking context, it refers to the process of storing the system state for one task, so that task can be paused and another task resumed.    A context switch can also occur as the result of an [[interrupt]], such as when a task needs to access [[disk storage]], freeing up CPU time for other tasks.  Some operating systems also require a context switch to move between [[User space|user mode and kernel mode]] tasks.  The process of context switching can have a negative impact on system performance, although the size of this effect depends on the nature of the switch being performed. \n\n== Cost ==\nContext switches are usually computationally intensive, and much of the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches. Switching from one process to another requires a certain amount of time for doing the administration{{snd}} saving and loading registers and memory maps, updating various tables and lists, etc. What is actually involved in a context switch varies between these senses and between processors and operating systems. For example, in the [[Linux kernel]], context switching involves switching registers, stack pointer, and [[program counter]], but is independent of [[address space]] switching, though in a process switch an address space switch also happens.<ref>''IA-64 Linux Kernel: Design and Implementation'', [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=29961&seqNum=7 4.7 Switching Address Spaces]</ref><ref>''Operating Systems'', 5.6 The Context Switch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=orZ0CLxEMXEC&pg=PA118 p. 118]</ref> Further still, analogous context switching happens between [[user thread]]s, notably [[green thread]]s, and is often very light-weight, saving and restoring minimal context. In extreme cases, such as switching between goroutines in [[Go (programming language)|Go]], a context switch is equivalent to a [[coroutine]] yield, which is only marginally more expensive than a [[subroutine]] call.\n\n== When to switch? ==\nThere are three potential triggers for a context switch:\n\n=== Multitasking ===\nMost commonly, within some [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] scheme, one process must be switched out of the CPU so another process can run.\nThis context switch can be triggered by the process making itself unrunnable, such as by waiting for an [[Input/output|I/O]] or [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] operation to complete. On a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] system, the scheduler may also switch out processes which are still runnable. To prevent other processes from being starved of CPU time, preemptive schedulers often configure a timer interrupt to fire when a process exceeds its [[time slice]]. This interrupt ensures that the scheduler will gain control to perform a context switch.\n\n=== Interrupt handling ===\nModern architectures are [[interrupt]] driven. This means that if the CPU requests data from a disk, for example, it does not need to [[busy-wait]] until the read is over; it can issue the request and continue with some other execution. When the read is over, the CPU can be ''interrupted'' and presented with the read. For interrupts, a program called an ''[[interrupt handler]]'' is installed, and it is the interrupt handler that handles the interrupt from the disk.\n\nWhen an interrupt occurs, the hardware automatically switches a part of the context (at least enough to allow the handler to return to the interrupted code).  The handler may save additional context, depending on details of the particular hardware and software designs.  Often only a minimal part of the context is changed in order to minimize the amount of time spent handling the interrupt.\nThe [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] does not spawn or schedule a special process to handle interrupts, but instead the handler executes in the (often partial) context established at the beginning of interrupt handling. Once interrupt servicing is complete, the context in effect before the interrupt occurred is restored so that the interrupted process can resume execution in its proper state.\n\n=== User and kernel mode switching ===\nWhen a transition between [[user mode]] and [[kernel mode]] is required in an operating system, a context switch is not necessary; a mode transition is ''not'' by itself a context switch.  However, depending on the operating system, a context switch may also take place at this time.\n\n== Steps ==\nIn a switch, the state of process currently executing must be saved somehow, so that when it is rescheduled, this state can be restored.\n\nThe process state includes all the registers that the process may be using, especially the [[program counter]], plus any other operating system specific data that may be necessary. This is usually stored in a data structure called a '''[[process control block]]''' (PCB) or '''switchframe'''.\n\nThe PCB might be stored on a per-process [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] in kernel memory (as opposed to the user-mode [[call stack]]), or there may be some specific operating system defined data structure for this information. A [[handle (computing)|handle]] to the PCB is added to a queue of processes that are ready to run, often called the '''ready queue'''.\n\nSince the operating system has effectively suspended the execution of one process, it can then switch context by choosing a process from the ready queue and restoring its PCB. In doing so, the program counter from the PCB is loaded, and thus execution can continue in the chosen process. Process and thread priority can influence which process is chosen from the ready queue (i.e., it may be a [[priority queue]]).\n\n== {{Anchor|LATENCY}}Performance ==\nContext switching itself has a cost in performance, due to running the [[scheduling (computing)|task scheduler]],  [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] flushes, and indirectly due to sharing the [[CPU cache]] between multiple tasks.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chuanpeng Li |author2=Chen Ding |author3=Kai Shen |title=Quantifying The Cost of Context Switch |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/expcs07/papers/2-li.pdf }}</ref> Switching between threads of a single process can be faster than between two separate processes, because threads share the same [[virtual memory]] maps, so a TLB flush is not necessary.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ulrich Drepper |date={{date|2014-10-09}} |title=Memory part 3: Virtual Memory |publisher=[[LWN.net]] |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/253361/ }}</ref>\n\n=== Hardware vs. software ===\nContext switching can be performed primarily by software or hardware. Some processors, like the [[Intel 80386]] and its successors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/context_switch.html |title=Context Switch definition |publisher=Linfo.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> have hardware support for context switches, by making use of a special data segment designated the [[task state segment]] or TSS.

And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamete of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism. The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the \"organic harmony\" of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute [[Buddhahood]].<ref>[[Geshe Gelsang Kyatos]], ''Clear Light of Bliss''.</ref>\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed cakra and nadi as \"central to their [[soteriology|soteriological]] process\".<ref name=samuel38/> The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called ''yantra yoga'' or '''phrul 'khor''. \n\nThe Chakras in the Tibetan practice are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated buddha counterpart.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rory Mackenzie|title=New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an Understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or99AgAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-13262-1|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref><ref name=\"Olson2009p78\">{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=Historical Dictionary of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwTnQcFjCQsC&pg=PA78 |year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6317-0|page=78}}</ref>\n\nChakras, according to the [[Bon]] tradition, ennable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the [[six realms]] of woe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dahlby|first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|page=84}}<!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--></ref>\n\nThe [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|tsa lung]] practice embodied in the [[Trul khor]] lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana.

Throughout its cycle it enters various [[dantian]] (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined.<ref>Yang Erzeng, Philip Clart. The Story of Han Xiangzi: the alchemical adventures of a Taoist immortal</ref> These dantian play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of dantian varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known, but there is usually a dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows.<ref>[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.13</ref> The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms essence, or j\u012bng, into q\u00ec.

W. Leadbeater]] in his book ''The Chakras''. Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular [[Johann Georg Gichtel]], a disciple of [[Jakob B\u00f6hme]], and his book ''Theosophia Practica (1696)'', in which Gichtel directly refers to inner ''force centres'', a concept reminiscent of the chakras.<ref>[http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304194144/http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html|date=4 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Hesychasm===\n\nA completely separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church is [[Hesychasm]], a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras.<ref>Mircea Eliade. Yoga, Immortality and Freedom</ref> Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.\n\n===New Age===\n{{Main article|New Age}}\n[[File:Nervous plexi.jpg|thumb|Chakra positions in relation to nervous plexi, from a 1927 textbook]]\nIn ''[[Anatomy of the Spirit]]'' (1996), [[Caroline Myss]] describes the function of chakras as follows: \"Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myss.com/library/chakras/ |title=Myss Library &#124; Chakras |publisher=Myss.com |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>  The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the top of the head. [[New Age]] practices often associate each chakra with a certain colour. In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of [[consciousness]], a [[classical element]], and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualised as lotuses or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.\n\nThe chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered [[Wiktionary:locus|loci]] of life [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] or [[prana]] (which New Age belief equates with ''[[shakti]]'', ''[[qi]]'' in Chinese, ''ki ''in Japanese, ''koach-ha-guf''<ref>Helena Blavatsky (1892). Theosophical Glossary. Krotona.</ref> in Hebrew, ''bios ''in Greek, and [[aether (classical element)|''aether'']]'' ''in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Rudolf Steiner]] considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving.

Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.\n\nCloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps<ref>{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author= Peter J. Russel |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education}}</ref>\n# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA\n# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence\n# [[transfection]] \u2013 inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells\n# screening/selection \u2013 selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA\n\nAlthough these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected;  these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.\n\nInitially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].\n\n== Cell cloning ==\n\n===Cloning unicellular organisms===\n[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]\nCloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.\n\nA useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).<ref name=\"CloningRings\">{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63\u201366|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}</ref> In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.\n\n=== Cloning stem cells ===\n{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}\n[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called \"research cloning\" or \"therapeutic cloning.\" The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called \"reproductive cloning\"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\nTherapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.<ref name=\"Halim\">{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}</ref> In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus.

This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.<ref name=\"Latham\">{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K.

The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.<ref name=Latham /> The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.<ref name=Latham /> This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.<ref name=Latham /> This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.<ref name=Latham />\n\nSCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.<ref name=Latham /> However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |authors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64\u20136 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}</ref> As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive.

The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.\n\n== Organism cloning ==\n{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}\n'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used.

Parts of an individual plant may become detached by [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]]. Some vascular plants e.g. [[dandelion]] and certain [[viviparity|viviparous]] grasses also form [[seed]]s asexually, termed [[apomixis]], resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.\n\n=== Parthenogenesis ===\nClonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes,<ref>Castagnone-Sereno P, et al.

In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female.

This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.<ref name=HumanGenomeInfo>{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}</ref> If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.\n\nArtificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nTwo commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]].

While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well.  Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.\n\nAdvocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml#organsQ |title=Cloning Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Genome Program |date=2009-05-11 |archivedate=2013-05-02}}</ref> to avoid the need for [[immunosuppressive drugs]],<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/> and to stave off the effects of aging.<ref name=EndingAging>de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ''bucardo'' ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.\n\nIn 2002, geneticists at the [[Australian Museum]] announced that they had replicated DNA of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using [[polymerase chain reaction]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/05/28/aust.thylacines/|title=Cloning to revive extinct species|first=Grant|last=Holloway|publisher=CNN.com|date=2002-05-28}}</ref> However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the ([[ethanol]]) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nIn 2003, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells.

An early fictional depiction of cloning is [[Bokanovsky's Process]] which features in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1931 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]''. The process is applied to fertilized human [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] ''[[in vitro]]'', causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original.<ref>Huxley, Aldous; \"Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited\"; p. 19; HarperPerennial, 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bhelkar|first1=Ratnakar D.|title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality|date=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Dist|isbn=9788126910366|page=58|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bvt_NyXYGb0C&lpg=PA58&pg=PA58|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1953 story ''UN-Man'', which describes a technology called \"exogenesis\", and [[Gordon Rattray Taylor]]'s book ''[[The Biological Time Bomb]]'', which popularised the term \"cloning\" in 1963.<ref name=\"stableford\">{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M.|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780415974608|pages=91\u201392|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&lpg=PA92&pg=PA91|language=en|chapter=Clone}}</ref>\n\nCloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005), to comedies such as [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/|title=Sleeper (1973)|author=planktonrules|date=17 December 1973|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in [[artificial womb]]s. In the long-running British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fourth Doctor]] and his companion [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples (\"[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]\", 1977) and then \u2014 in an apparent [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' \u2014 shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus.

This linkage motif contrasts with that for \u03b1(1\u21924)-glycosidic bonds present in [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]. Cellulose is a straight chain polymer: unlike starch, no coiling or branching occurs, and the molecule adopts an extended and rather stiff rod-like conformation, aided by the equatorial conformation of the glucose residues. The multiple [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl groups]] on the glucose from one chain form [[hydrogen bond]]s with oxygen atoms on the same or on a neighbor chain, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming ''microfibrils'' with high [[tensile strength]].

Yale University Press. 1997.</ref>]]\nIn history, a '''colony''' is a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] under the immediate complete political control of a [[Sovereign state|state]], distinct from the home territory of the sovereign. For [[colonies in antiquity]], [[city-state]]s would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception.\n\nThe '''metropolitan state''' is the state that rules the colony. In [[Ancient Greece]], the city that founded a colony was known as the [[metropolis]]. \"Mother country\" is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony. There is a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].\n\nUnlike a [[puppet state]] or [[satellite state]], a colony has no independent international representation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.\n\nThe term ''informal colony'' is used by some historians to refer to a country under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of another state, although this term is often contentious.\n\n==Definitions==\nThe word \"colony\" comes from the Latin word ''col\u014dnia''. This in turn derives from the word ''[[Colonus (person)|col\u014dnus]]'', which means colonist but also implies a [[farmer]]. [[Cologne]] is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology. Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] include cities from [[Belgrade]] to [[York]]. A tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a Roman colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.<ref>{{cite book|author=James S.

So colonies are not independently self-controlled, but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function.\n\nRoman colonies first appeared when the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] conquered neighbouring [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic peoples]]. These were small farming settlements that appeared when the Romans had subdued an enemy in war. A colony could take many forms, as a trade outpost or a military base in enemy territory.

In other words, a column is a [[compression member]].

A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called [[pier (architecture)|piers]]. For the purpose of [[wind engineering|wind]] or [[earthquake engineering]], columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other [[compression member]]s are often termed \"columns\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s or [[arch]]es on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \"column\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \"engaged\", that is to say form part of a wall.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Doric (left three), Ionic (middle three) and Corinthian (right two) columns.]]\nAll significant [[Iron Age]] civilizations of the [[Near East]] and [[Mediterranean]] made some use of columns. In [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] as early as 2600 BC the architect [[Imhotep]] made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds; in later Egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common. Egyptian columns are famously present in the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]] of Karnak (ca. 1224 BC), where 134 columns are lined up in 16 rows, with some columns reaching heights of 24 metres.\n[[File:Persepolis Colonne flandin.jpg|thumb|left|Plan, front view and side view of a typical [[Persepolis]] column, of [[Iran|Persia (Iran)]]]]\nSome of the most elaborate columns in the ancient world were those of the [[Persia]]ns, especially the massive stone columns erected in [[Persepolis]]. They included double-bull structures in their [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]. [[Apadana|The Hall of Hundred Columns]] at Persepolis, measuring 70&nbsp;\u00d7 70 metres, was built by the [[Achaemenid]] king [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius I]] (524\u2013486 BC). Many of the ancient [[Persian column]]s are standing, some being more than 30 metres tall.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe [[Minoans]] used whole tree-trunks, usually turned upside down in order to prevent re-growth, stood on a base set in the stylobate (floor base) and topped by a simple round capital. These were then painted as in the most famous Minoan palace of [[Knossos]]. The Minoans employed columns to create large open-plan spaces, light-wells and as a focal point for religious rituals. These traditions were continued by the later [[Mycenaean civilization]], particularly in the megaron or hall at the heart of their palaces. The importance of columns and their reference to palaces and therefore authority is evidenced in their use in heraldic motifs such as the famous lion-gate of [[Mycenae]] where two lions stand each side of a column. Being made of wood these early columns have not survived, but their stone bases have and through these we may see their use and arrangement in these palace buildings.\n\nThe Egyptians, Persians and other civilizations mostly used columns for the practical purpose of holding up the roof inside a building, preferring outside walls to be decorated with [[relief]]s or painting, but the Ancient Greeks, followed by the Romans, loved to use them on the outside as well, and the extensive use of columns on the interior and exterior of buildings is one of the most characteristic features of classical architecture, in buildings like the [[Parthenon]].  The Greeks developed the [[#Classical orders|classical orders]] of architecture, which are most easily distinguished by the form of the column and its various elements.  Their [[Doric order|Doric]], Ionic, and Corinthian orders were expanded by the Romans to include the Tuscan and Composite orders (see below).\n\nColumns, or at least large structural exterior ones, became much less significant in the architecture of the [[Middle Ages]]. The classical forms were abandoned in both [[Byzantine architecture]] and the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] of Europe in favour of more flexible forms, with capitals often using various types of foliage decoration, and in the West scenes with figures carved in [[relief]]. [[Renaissance architecture]] was keen to revive the classical vocabulary and styles, and the informed use and variation of the classical orders remained fundamental to the training of architects throughout [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Rococo]] and [[Neo-classical architecture]].\n\n==Structure==\nEarly columns were constructed of stone, some out of a single piece of stone.  Monolithic columns are among the heaviest stones used in [[architecture]].  Other stone columns are created out of multiple sections of stone, mortared or dry-fit together.  In many classical sites, sectioned columns were carved with a centre hole or depression so that they could be pegged together, using stone or metal pins.  The design of most classical columns incorporates [[entasis]] (the inclusion of a slight outward curve in the sides) plus a reduction in diameter along the height of the column, so that the top is as little as 83% of the bottom diameter.  This reduction mimics the parallax effects which the eye expects to see, and tends to make columns look taller and straighter than they are while entasis adds to that effect.\n\n===Nomenclature===\nMost classical columns arise from a basis, or base, that rests on the [[stylobate]], or [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], except for those of the [[Doric order]], which usually rest directly on the stylobate.  The basis may consist of several elements, beginning with a wide, square slab known as a [[plinth]].  The simplest bases consist of the plinth alone, sometimes separated from the column by a convex circular cushion known as a [[molding (decorative)#types|torus]].  More elaborate bases include two toruses, separated by a concave section or channel known as a scotia or trochilus.  Scotiae could also occur in pairs, separated by a convex section called an [[astragal]], or bead, narrower than a torus.  Sometimes these sections were accompanied by still narrower convex sections, known as annulets or fillets.<ref name=\"Clarke\">[[Hewson Clarke]] and [[John Dougall (writer)|John Dougall]], ''The Cabinet of Arts'', T. Kinnersley, London (1817), pp. 271, 272.</ref><ref name=\"Architectural Glossary\">\"Architectural Glossary\", in ''The Universal Decorator'', Francis Benjamin Thompson, Ed., vol. III (1859).</ref>\n\nAt the top of the shaft is a [[capital (architecture)|capital]], upon which the roof or other architectural elements rest.  In the case of Doric columns, the capital usually consists of a round, tapering cushion, or echinus, supporting a square slab, known as an abax or abacus. [[Ionic order|Ionic capitals]] feature a pair of volutes, or scrolls, while [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]] are decorated with reliefs in the form of acanthus leaves.  Either type of capital could be accompanied by the same moldings as the base.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/><ref name=\"Architectural Glossary\"/>  In the case of free-standing columns, the decorative elements atop the shaft are known as a [[finial]].\n\nModern columns may be constructed out of steel, poured or precast concrete, or brick, left bare or clad in an architectural covering, or veneer.  Used to support an arch, an impost, or pier, is the topmost member of a column. The bottom-most part of the arch, called the springing, rests on the impost.\n\n===Equilibrium, instability, and loads===\n{{Main|Buckling#columns}}\n{{Mechanical_failure_modes}}\n[[File:ColumnEffectiveLength.png|thumb|220px|Table showing values of K for structural columns of various end conditions (adapted from Manual of Steel Construction, 8th&nbsp;edition, American Institute of Steel Construction, Table C1.8.1)]]\nAs the axial load on a perfectly straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability. The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a lateral force, applied between the two ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the lateral force is removed. If the column load is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and a small lateral force will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the lateral force is removed. The load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or [[buckling]] load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.\n\nFor an axially loaded straight column with any end support conditions, the equation of static equilibrium, in the form of a differential equation, can be solved for the deflected shape and critical load of the column. With hinged, fixed or free end support conditions the deflected shape in neutral equilibrium of an initially straight column with uniform cross section throughout its length always follows a partial or composite sinusoidal curve shape, and the critical load is given by\n\n<math>f_{cr}\\equiv\\frac{\\pi^2\\textit{E}I_{min}}{{L}^2}\\qquad (1)</math>\n\nwhere ''E'' = [[elastic modulus]] of the material, ''I<sub>min</sub>'' =  the minimal moment of inertia of the cross section, and ''L'' = actual length of the column between its two end supports. A variant of (1) is given by\n\n<math>f_{cr}\\equiv\\frac{\\pi^{2}E_T}{(\\frac{KL}{r})^{2}}\\qquad (2)</math>\n\nwhere ''r'' = [[radius]] of gyration of [column]cross-section which is equal to the square root of (I/A), ''K'' =  ratio of the longest half [[sine]] wave to the actual column length, ''E''<sub>''t''</sub> =  tangent modulus at the stress ''F''<sub>cr</sub>, and ''KL'' =  effective length (length of an equivalent hinged-hinged column). From Equation&nbsp;(2) it can be noted that the buckling strength of a column is inversely proportional to the square of its length.\n\nWhen the critical stress, ''F''<sub>cr</sub> (''F''<sub>cr</sub> =''P''<sub>cr</sub>/''A'', where ''A''&nbsp;= cross-sectional area of the column), is greater than the proportional limit of the material, the column is experiencing inelastic buckling. Since at this stress the slope of the material's stress-strain curve, ''E''<sub>''t''</sub> (called the [[tangent modulus]]),  is smaller than that below the proportional limit, the critical load at inelastic buckling is reduced. More complex formulas and procedures apply for such cases, but in its simplest form the critical buckling load formula is given as Equation&nbsp;(3),\n\n<math>f_{cr}\\equiv{F_y}-\\frac{F^{2}_{y}}{4\\pi^{2}E}\\left(\\frac{KL}{r^2}\\right)\\qquad (3)</math>\n\nA column with a cross section that lacks symmetry may suffer torsional buckling (sudden twisting) before, or in combination with, lateral buckling. The presence of the twisting deformations renders both theoretical analyses and practical designs rather complex.\n\nEccentricity of the load, or imperfections such as initial crookedness, decreases column strength. If the axial load on the column is not concentric, that is, its line of action is not precisely coincident with the centroidal axis of the column, the column is characterized as eccentrically loaded. The eccentricity of the load, or an initial curvature, subjects the column to immediate bending. The increased stresses due to the combined axial-plus-flexural stresses result in a reduced load-carrying ability.\n\nColumn elements are considered to be massive if their smallest side dimension is equal to or more than 400&nbsp;mm. Massive columns have the ability to increase in carrying strength over long time periods (even during periods of heavy load). Taking into account the fact, that possible structural loads may increase over time as well (and also the threat of progressive failure), massive columns have an advantage compared to non-massive ones.\n\n===Extensions===\nWhen a column is too long to be built or transported in one piece, it has to be extended or spliced at the construction site. A [[reinforced concrete column]] is extended by having the steel reinforcing bars protrude a few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level. A steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide a few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower column section. A timber column is usually extended by the use of a steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting timber sections.\n\n===Foundations===\nA column that carries the load down to a foundation must have means to transfer the load without overstressing the foundation material. Reinforced concrete and masonry columns are generally built directly on top of concrete foundations. When seated on a concrete foundation, a steel column must have a base plate to spread the load over a larger area, and thereby reduce the bearing pressure. The base plate is a thick, rectangular steel plate usually welded to the bottom end of the column.\n\n==Classical orders==\n{{main|Classical order}}\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] author [[Vitruvius]], relying on the writings (now lost) of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] authors, tells us that the ancient [[Hellenic civilization|Greeks]] believed that their Doric order developed from techniques for building in wood. The earlier smoothed tree-trunk was replaced by a stone cylinder.\n\n===Doric order===\n{{main|Doric order}}\n\nThe [[Doric order]] is the oldest and simplest of the classical orders. It is composed of a vertical [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] that is wider at the bottom.  It generally has neither a base nor a detailed [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]. It is instead often topped with an inverted [[frustum]] of a shallow cone or a cylindrical band of carvings.  It is often referred to as the masculine order because it is represented in the bottom level of the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Parthenon]], and was therefore considered to be able to hold more weight. The height-to-thickness ratio is about 8:1. The shaft of a Doric Column is almost always [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]].\n\nThe Greek Doric, developed in the western Dorian region of Greece, is the heaviest and most massive of the orders. It rises from the [[stylobate]] without any base; it is from four to six times as tall as its diameter; it has twenty broad flutes; the capital consists simply of a banded necking swelling out into a smooth echinus, which carries a flat square abacus; the Doric entablature is also the heaviest, being about one-fourth the height column. The Greek Doric order was not used after c. 100 B.C. until its \u201crediscovery\u201d in the mid-eighteenth century.\n\n===Tuscan order===\n{{main|Tuscan order}}\n\nThe [[Tuscan order]], also known as Roman Doric, is also a simple design, the base and capital both being series of cylindrical disks of alternating diameter. The shaft is almost never fluted. The proportions vary, but are generally similar to Doric columns. Height to width ratio is about 7:1.\n\n===Ionic order===\n{{main|Ionic order}}\nThe [[Ionic order|Ionic]] column is considerably more complex than the Doric or Tuscan.  It usually has a base and the shaft is often fluted (it has grooves carved up its length). The capital features a [[volute]], an ornament shaped like a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]], at the four corners. The height-to-thickness ratio is around 9:1. Due to the more refined proportions and scroll capitals, the Ionic column is sometimes associated with academic buildings. Ionic style columns were used on the second level of the Colosseum.\n\n===Corinthian order===\n{{main|Corinthian order}}\n\nThe Corinthian order is named for the Greek [[city-state]] of [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], to which it was connected in the period.  However, according to the architectural historian [[Vitruvius]], the column was created by the sculptor [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], probably an [[Athens|Athenian]], who drew [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] leaves growing around a votive basket. In fact, the oldest known Corinthian capital was found in [[Bassae]], dated at 427 BC. It is sometimes called the feminine order because it is on the top level of the Colosseum and holding up the least weight, and also has the slenderest ratio of thickness to height. Height to width ratio is about 10:1.\n\n===Composite order===\nThe [[Composite order]] draws its name from the capital being a composite of the Ionic and Corinthian capitals. The acanthus of the Corinthian column already has a scroll-like element, so the distinction is sometimes subtle. Generally the Composite is similar to the Corinthian in proportion and employment, often in the upper tiers of [[colonnade]]s. Height to width ratio is about 11:1 or 12:1.\n\n===Solomonic===\nA [[Solomonic column]], sometimes called \"[[barley sugar]]\",  begins on a base and ends in a capital, which may be of any order, but the shaft twists in a tight spiral, producing a dramatic, serpentine effect of movement.  Solomonic columns were developed in the ancient world, but remained rare there. A famous marble set, probably 2nd century, was brought to [[St Peter's, Rome]] by [[Constantine I]], and placed round the saint's shrine, and was thus familiar throughout the Middle Ages, by which time they were thought to have been removed from the [[Temple of Jerusalem]].<ref>J. Ward-Perkins, \"The shrine of St. Peter's and its twelve spiral columns\" ''Journal of Roman Studies'' '''42''' (1952) p 21ff.</ref>  The style was used in bronze by [[Bernini]] for his spectacular [[St. Peter's baldachin]], actually a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] (which displaced Constantine's columns), and thereafter became very popular with [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] church architects, above all in [[Latin America]], where they were very often used, especially on a small scale, as they are easy to produce in wood by [[Woodturning|turning on a lathe]] (hence also the style's popularity for [[Spindle (furniture)|spindles]] on furniture and stairs).\n\n==Pillar tombs==\n[[Pillar tomb]]s are monumental graves, which typically feature a single, prominent pillar or column, often made of stone. A number of world cultures incorporated pillars into tomb structures. In the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] colony of [[Lycia]] in [[Anatolia]], one of these edifices is located at the tomb of [[Xanthos]]. In the town of [[Hannassa]] in southern [[Somalia]], ruins of houses with archways and [[courtyard]]s have also been found along with other pillar tombs, including a rare octagonal tomb.<ref name=\"Arotssc\">{{cite journal|last1=Sanseverino|first1=Hilary Costa|title=Archaeological Remains on the Southern Somali Coast|journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|date=1983|volume=18|issue=1|pages=151\u2013164|doi=10.1080/00672708309511319|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00672708309511319#.VGJ0To938jg|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Great Hypostyle Hall.jpg|Great Hypostyle Hall, Karnak, Egypt'\nFile:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|Columns found at the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo in Delphi]]\nFile:Carpark Cinema Undercroft Albany II.jpg|Modern column grid in a car park or parking garage\nFile:Solomonic columns at St Peters Vatican (cropped).jpg|At right, two of the Solomonic columns brought to Rome by Constantine, in their present-day location on a pier in [[St Peter's, Rome|St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome.

When she was six, Laura had a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been punctured in her breast, although no wound was found.\n\nTwelve years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter from his friend, General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to bring his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, to visit the two, but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.\n\nLaura, saddened by the loss of a potential friend, longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognize the other from the \"dream\" they both had when they were young.\n\nCarmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, past, or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.\n\nCarmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself, despite questioning by Laura. Her secrecy is not the only mysterious thing about Carmilla; she never joins the household in its prayers, she sleeps much of the day, and she seems to sleepwalk outside at night.\n\nMeanwhile, young women and girls in the nearby towns have begun dying from an unknown malady. When the funeral procession of one such victim passes by the two girls, Laura joins in the funeral hymn. Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura, complaining that the hymn hurts her ears.\n\nWhen a shipment of restored [[heirloom]] paintings arrives, Laura finds a portrait of her ancestor, Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck. Carmilla suggests that she might be descended from the Karnsteins even though the family died out centuries before.\n\nDuring Carmilla's stay, Laura has nightmares of a large cat-like beast entering her room. The beast springs onto the bed and Laura feels something like two needles, an inch or two apart, darting deep into her breast. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. In another nightmare, Laura hears a voice say, \"Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin,\" and a sudden light reveals Carmilla standing at the foot of her bed, her nightdress drenched in blood. Laura's health declines, and her father has a doctor examine her. He finds a small blue spot, an inch or two below her collar, where the creature in her dream bit her, and speaks privately with her father, only asking that Laura never be unattended.\n\nHer father then sets out with Laura, in a carriage, for the ruined village of Karnstein, three miles distant. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses to follow once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla awakes. En route to Karnstein, Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story:\n\nAt a costume ball, Spielsdorf and his niece Bertha had met a beautiful young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother. Bertha was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance.\n\n[[Image:Fitzgerald, funeral from Carmilla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Funeral'', illustration by Michael Fitzgerald for ''Carmilla'' in ''The Dark Blue'' (January 1872)]]\n\nBertha fell mysteriously ill, suffering the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially-ordered priestly doctor, the General realized that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. He hid with a sword and waited until a large black creature of undefined shape crawled onto his niece's bed and spread itself onto her throat. He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the creature, which had then taken the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died before the morning dawned.\n\nUpon arriving at Karnstein, the General asks a woodman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodman says the tomb was relocated long ago by the hero, a Moravian nobleman, who vanquished the vampires that haunted the region.\n\nWhile the General and Laura are alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other, and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla disarms the General and disappears. The General explains that Carmilla is also Millarca, both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.\n\nThe party is joined by Baron Vordenburg, the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died and became one of the undead. Using his forefather's notes, he locates Mircalla's hidden tomb. An Imperial Commission exhumes the body of  Mircalla/Millarca/Carmilla. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, its heart beating, its eyes open. A stake is driven through its heart, and it gives a corresponding shriek; then the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.\n\nAfterward, Laura's father takes his daughter on a year-long tour through Italy to regain her health and recover from the trauma, which she never fully does.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Dom Augustin Calmet.jpeg|thumb|right|<center>[[Dom Calmet]].]]\nAs with ''[[Dracula]]'', critics have looked for the sources used in the writing of ''Carmilla''. One source used was from a dissertation on magic, vampires and the apparitions of spirits written by [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Dom Augustin Calmet]] entitled ''[[Trait\u00e9 sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, %26c. | Trait\u00e9 sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenants de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c.]]'' (1751). This is evidenced by a report analyzed by Calmet, from a priest who learned information of a town being tormented by a vampiric entity three years earlier. Having traveled to the town to investigate and collecting information of the various inhabitants there, the priest learned that a vampire had tormented many of the inhabitants at night by coming from the nearby cemetery and would haunt many of the residents on their beds. An unknown Hungarian traveler came to the town during this period and helped the town by setting a trap at the cemetery and decapitating the vampire that resided there, curing the town of their torment. This story was retold by LeFanu and adapted into the thirteenth chapter of Carmilla <ref>{{cite book|last1=LeFanu|first1=J.

Hall's account provides much of the Styrian background and, in particular, a model for both Carmilla and Laura in the figure of [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall|Jane Anne Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gibson, Matthew |url=http://www.jslefanu.com/gibson.html |title=Jane Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall: A Possible Inspiration for Le Fanu's ''Carmilla'' |journal=Le Fanu Studies |date=November 2007 |issn=1932-9598 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304171734/http://www.jslefanu.com/gibson.html |archivedate=2009-03-04 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Gibson, Matthew |date=2006|title=Dracula and the Eastern Question: British and French Vampire Narratives of the Nineteenth-century Near East|isbn=1-4039-9477-3 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nCarmilla, the title character, is the original prototype for a legion of female and [[lesbian vampire]]s. Though Le Fanu portrays his vampire's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the circumspection that one would expect for his time, it is evident that [[lesbian]] attraction is the main dynamic between Carmilla and the narrator of the story:<ref>{{cite book|author=Keesey, Pam |date=1993|title=Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Vampire Stories|publisher= Cleis|isbn= 0-939416-78-6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7342924/Female_Sexuality_as_Vampiric_in_Le_Fanu_s_Carmilla|title=Female Sexuality as Vampiric in Le Fanu\u2019s Carmilla|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardour of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet overpowering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips travelled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, \"You are mine, you ''shall'' be mine, and you and I are one for ever.\" (''Carmilla'', Chapter 4).}}\n\nWhen compared to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had [[nocturnal]] habits, but was not confined to the darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in ''Dracula''. She did, however, sleep in a coffin.

Stoker's posthumously published [[short story]] \"[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]\" (1914), known as the deleted first chapter to ''Dracula'', shows a more obvious and intact debt to ''Carmilla'':\n* In the narrative, an Englishman finds himself in Germany midway upon his journey from England to the castle of Dracula; stumbles upon a tomb of a female vampire whose inscription reads: Countess Dolingen of Gratz / in Styria / sought and found death / 1801. \n* Both stories are told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]]. ''Dracula'' expands on the idea of a first person account by creating a series of journal entries and logs of different persons and creating a plausible background story for their having been compiled. \n* Both authors indulge the air of mystery, though Stoker takes it further than Le Fanu by allowing the characters to solve the enigma of the vampire along with the reader.\n* The descriptions of the title character in ''Carmilla'' and of Lucy in ''Dracula'' are similar, and have become archetypes for the appearance of the waif-like victims and seducers in vampire stories as being rosy-cheeked, slender, languid, and with large eyes, full lips, and soft voices.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Additionally, both women [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]].\n*Stoker's Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]] is a direct parallel to Le Fanu's vampire expert Baron Vordenburg: both characters used to investigate and catalyse actions in opposition to the vampire, and symbolically represent knowledge of the unknown and stability of mind in the onslaught of chaos and death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Le Fanu, J.S.|author=Sullivan, Jack (Editor)|work=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural|page= 260}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Books===\n(alphabetical by author's last name)\n* In the Japanese [[light novel]] series ''[[High School DxD]]'', written by [[Ichiei Ishibumi]] and illustrated by [[Miyama-Zero]], the vampires are depicted as having a society divided among two major factions: The Tepes and the Carmilla.

This collection contains five tales, one of which is ''Carmilla''. Actually the film draws its central character, Allan Gray, from Le Fanu's Dr. Hesselius; and the scene in which Gray is buried alive is drawn from \"The Room in the Dragon Volant\".\n* [[French people|French]] director [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Blood and Roses|Et mourir de plaisir]]'' (literally ''And to die of pleasure'', but actually shown in the UK and US as ''Blood and Roses'', 1960) is based on ''Carmilla'' and is considered one of the greatest of the vampire genre. The Vadim film thoroughly explores the lesbian implications behind Carmilla's selection of victims, and boasts cinematography by [[Claude Renoir]]. The film's lesbian eroticism was however significantly cut for its US release. [[Mel Ferrer]] stars in the film.\n* A more-or-less faithful adaptation starring [[Christopher Lee]] was produced in Italy in 1963 under the title ''[[La cripta e l'incubo]]'' (''Crypt of the Vampire'' in English). The character of Laura is played by Adriana Ambesi, who fears herself possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor.\n* The British [[Hammer Film Productions]] also produced a fairly faithful adaptation of ''Carmilla'' titled ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970) with [[Ingrid Pitt]] in the lead role, [[Madeline Smith]] as her victim/lover, and Hammer's regular [[Peter Cushing]]. It is the first installment of the [[Karnstein Trilogy]].\n* ''[[The Blood Spattered Bride]]'' (''La Novia Ensangrentada'') is a 1972 Spanish [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Vicente Aranda]], is based on the text. The film has reached cult status for its mix of horror, vampirism and seduction with lesbian overtones.\n* ''Carmilla'' (1980) is a black-and-white made-for-television adaptation from Poland, starring singer [[Izabela Trojanowska]] in the title role and Monika Stefanowicz as Laura.\n* The 2000 Japanese anime film ''[[Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust]]'' features Carmilla \"the Bloody Countess\" as its primary antagonist. Having been slain by Dracula for her vain and gluttonous tyranny, Carmilla's ghost attempts to use the blood of a virgin to bring about her own resurrection. She was voiced by [[Julia Fletcher]] in English and Beverly Maeda in Japanese.\n* In the direct-to-video movie, ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'' (2005), Carmilla Karnstein is mentioned as [[Count Dracula]]'s bride, who had been incinerated by sunlight years ago. Dracula hoped to revive her by sacrificing [[Vicki Vale]]'s soul, but the ritual was stopped by the [[Batman]].\n* The book is directly referenced several times in the 2011 film, ''[[The Moth Diaries (film)|The Moth Diaries]]'', the film version of [[Rachel Klein (novelist)|Rachel Klein's]] novel. There are conspicuous similarities between the characters in \"Carmilla\" and those in the film, and the book figures into the film's plot. \n* Carmilla is featured as the main antagonist in the movie ''[[Lesbian Vampire Killers]]'' (2009), a comedy starring [[Paul McGann]] and [[James Corden]], with [[Silvia Colloca]] as Carmilla.\n* ''[[The Unwanted]]'' (2014) from writer/director Brent Wood relocates the story to the contemporary southern United States. \n* ''The Curse of Styria'' (2014), alternately titled ''Angels of Darkness'' is an adaptation of the novel set in late 1980s with [[Julia Pietrucha]] as Carmilla and [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Lara.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1764614/ |author=IMDB |title= Styria (2014) |website=IMDB}}</ref>\n* In 2017 ''[[The Carmilla Movie]]'', based on the 2015 web series Carmilla, was released.

Standard surgical procedures are followed in these cases. This includes evaluation and biopsy. Other factors that will affect the technique selected are age, other existing medical conditions, and obesity. Other considerations are the probability of extended hospital care and the development of infection at the surgical site.<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!--pp 1340-42  -->\nThe surgery proceeds with the use of general anesthesia, and prior to the vulvectomy/clitoridectomy an inguinal lymphyadenectomy is first done. The extent of the surgical site extends one to two centimeters beyond the boundaries of malignancy. Superficial lymph nodes may also need to be removed. If the malignancy is present in muscular tissue in the region, it is also removed. In some cases, the surgeon is able to preserve the clitoris though the malignancy may be extensive. The cancerous tissue is removed and the incision is closed.<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!--pp 1340-42  -->\n\nPost operative care may employ the use of suction drainage to allow the deeper tissues to heal toward the surface. Follow up after surgery includes the stripping of the drainage device to prevent blockage. A typical hospital stay can be up to two weeks. The site of the surgery is left unbandaged to allow for frequent examination.<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!--pp 1340-42  -->\nComplications can be the development of lymphedema though not removing the saphenous vein during the surgery will help prevent this. In some instances, foot elevation, diuretic medication and compression stockings can reduce the build up of fluid.<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!--pp 1340-42  -->\n\nIn a clitoridectomy for intersex infants, the clitoris is often reduced instead of removed. The surgeon cuts the shaft of the elongated phallus and sews the glans and preserved nerves back onto the stump.

Since the band reunited, Seymour has again designed their album covers.<ref name=denton />\n\nThe majority of the covers for the band's singles were not designed by Seymour.

1954) was a French novelist nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1948. Her best known work, the novella ''[[Gigi]]'' (1944), was the basis for the [[Gigi (1958 film)|film]] and [[Lerner and Loewe]] [[Gigi (musical)|stage production]] of the same name. She was also a [[Mime artist|mime]], an actress, and a journalist.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Family and background===\nSidonie-Gabrielle Colette was born on January 28, 1873, to war hero and tax collector Jules-Joseph Colette and his wife Ad\u00e8le Eug\u00e9nie Sidonie (\"Sido\"), ''n\u00e9e'' Landoy, in the village of [[Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye]] in the ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Yonne]], [[Burgundy]]. The family was initially well off, but by the time she was of school age poor financial management had substantially reduced her father's income and she attended a public school from the ages of 6 to 17.{{sfn |Tilburg |2008 |p=78}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouve |1999 |p=79}}\n\n===Early years, 1893\u20131912===\nIn 1893 she married [[Henry Gauthier-Villars]] (1859\u20131931) or \"Willy\", his [[nom-de-plume]],<ref name=\"Book Tells Story of Colette's France\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/book-tells-story-of-colettes-france-7264395?src=nl/wkEye/20140103 |title=Book Tells Story of Colette's France |publisher=WWD |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |author=Koski, Lorna}}</ref> a well-known author and publisher, and her first four novels \u2013 the four [[Claudine (book series)|Claudine stories,]] [[Claudine at School|''Claudine \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole'']] (1900), ''Claudine \u00e0 Paris'' (1901), ''Claudine en m\u00e9nage'' (1902), and ''Claudine s'en va'' (1903) \u2013 appeared under his name. They chart the coming of age of their heroine, Claudine, from an unconventional fifteen-year-old in a Burgundian village to the literary salons of turn-of-the-century Paris. (The four are published in English as ''Claudine at School'', ''Claudine in Paris'', ''Claudine Married'', and ''Claudine and Annie''). The story they tell is semi-autobiographical, but not entirely \u2013 most strikingly, Claudine, unlike Colette, is motherless.{{sfn |Southworth |2004 |pp=111\u2013112}}{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=78}}\n\nWilly, fourteen years older than his wife and one of the most notorious [[libertine]]s in Paris, introduced Colette into avant-garde intellectual and artistic circles while engaging in sexual affairs and encouraging her own [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] alliances. It was he who chose the titillating subject-matter of the Claudine novels, \"the secondary myth of [[Sappho]]... the girls' school or convent ruled by a seductive female teacher\" (Ladimer, p.&nbsp;53). Colette later said that she would never have become a writer if it had not been for Willy.{{sfn |Ladimer |1999 |pp=51\u201353}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouve |1994 |p=79}} Nevertheless, when Colette wished to have her name associated with her work as it became widely known, Willy resisted and \"locked her in her room until she produced enough pages to suit him.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.autostraddle.com/8-fascinating-facts-about-bisexual-legend-colette-that-you-should-know-before-keira-knightlys-biopic-426889/ |title=8 Fascinating Facts About Bisexual Legend Colette That You Should Know Before Keira Knightly's Biopic |date=24 July 2018 |work=Autostraddle |access-date=31 July 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nColette and Willy separated in 1906, although it was not until 1910 that the divorce became final. She had no access to the sizable earnings of the Claudine books \u2013 the copyright belonged to Willy \u2013 and until 1912 she followed a stage career in music halls across France, sometimes playing Claudine in sketches from her own novels, earning barely enough to survive and often hungry and unwell. This period of her life is recalled in ''La Vagabonde'' (1910), which deals with women's independence in a male society, a theme to which she would regularly return in future works. During these years she embarked on a series of relationships with other women, notably with [[Mathilde de Morny|Mathilde de Morny, Marquise de Belbeuf]] (\"Missy\"), with whom she sometimes shared the stage. On January 3, 1907, an onstage kiss between Missy and Colette in a pantomime entitled ''R\u00eave d'\u00c9gypte'' caused a near-riot, and as a result they were no longer able to live together openly, although their relationship continued for another five years.{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}{{sfn |Rodriguez |2002 |p=131}}{{sfn |Benstock |1986 |pp=48\u201349}}\n\nIn 1912 she married [[Henry de Jouvenel]], the editor of ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]''. A daughter, [[Colette de Jouvenel]], nicknamed ''Bel-Gazou'', was born in 1913. During the war she devoted herself to journalism, but marriage allowed her to devote her time to writing.{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouves |1994 |p=80}}{{sfn |Cottrell |1991 |p=262}}\n\n===Writing career, 1920\u20131954===\n[[File:Jacques Humbert - Colette.jpg|thumb|Colette, painted c. 1896 by [[Jacques Humbert]]]]\n\nIn 1920 Colette published ''[[Ch\u00e9ri (novel)|Ch\u00e9ri]]'', portraying love between an older woman and a much younger man. Ch\u00e9ri is the lover of L\u00e9a, a wealthy [[courtesan]]; L\u00e9a is devastated when Ch\u00e9ri marries a girl his own age, and delighted when he returns to her, but after one final night together she sends him away again.{{sfn |Jouves |1987 |p=109\u2013111}}\n\nThe marriage to Jouvenel ended in divorce in 1924, partly due to Jouvenel's infidelities and partly to Colette's own affair with her sixteen-year-old stepson, [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]. In 1925 she met Maurice Goudeket, who became her final husband (the couple stayed together until her death).{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouves |1994 |p=80}}\n\nAlthough she was already an established writer (''The Vagabond'' had received three votes for the prestigious ''Prix Goncourt''), the decades of the 1920s and 1930s were Colette's most productive and innovative period.{{sfn|Ladimer|1999|p=57}} Set mostly in Burgundy or Paris during the ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]'', her work treated married life and sexuality. It was frequently quasi-autobiographical: ''[[Ch\u00e9ri (novel)|Ch\u00e9ri]]'' (1920) and ''Le Bl\u00e9 en herbe'' (1923) both deal with love between an aging woman and a very young man, a situation reflecting her relationship with Bertrand de Jouvenel and even Goudeket, who was sixteen years her junior.{{sfn|Portuges|Jouves|1994|p=80}}{{sfn|Flower|2013|p=145}} ''La Naissance du Jour'' (1928) is her explicit criticism of the conventional lives of women, expressed in a meditation on age and the renunciation of love through the character of her mother, Sido.{{sfn |Ladimer |1999 |p=57\u201358}}\n\nBy this period Colette was frequently acclaimed as France's greatest woman writer. \"It... has no plot, and yet tells of three lives all that should be known\", wrote [[Janet Flanner]] of ''Sido''. \"Once again, and at greater length than usual, she has been hailed for her genius, humanities and perfect prose by those literary journals which years ago... lifted nothing at all in her direction except the finger of scorn.\"{{sfn |Flanner |1972 |p=70}}\n\n===Last years, 1940\u20131954===\nColette was 67 years old at the [[fall of France]], and remained in Paris, in her apartment in the [[Palais Royal]]. Her husband Maurice Goudeket, who was Jewish, was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in December 1941, and although he was released after a few months through the intervention of the French wife of the German ambassador, Colette lived through the rest of the war years with the anxiety of a possible second arrest.{{sfn|Portuges|Jouve|1994|pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn|Rosbottom|2014|p=unpaginated}} During the [[German occupation of France|Occupation]] she produced two volumes of memoirs, ''Journal \u00e0 rebours'' (1941) and ''De ma fen\u00eatre'' (1942 \u2013 the two issued in English in 1975 as ''Looking Backwards'').{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}} She was nominated by [[Claude Farr\u00e8re]] for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1948.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=24 September 2018 |title=Sidonie Gabrielle Colette in the Nomination Database |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show_people.php&id=1883 |website=The official website of the Nobel Prize - NobelPrize.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944 she published what became perhaps her most famous work, ''[[Gigi]]'', telling the story of sixteen-year-old Gilberte (\"Gigi\") Alvar. Born into a family of [[Demimonde|demimondaines]], Gigi is being trained as a courtesan to captivate a wealthy lover, but breaks with tradition by marrying him instead.{{sfn |Snodgrass |2015b |p=unpaginated}} In 1949 it was made into a French film starring [[Dani\u00e8le Delorme]] and [[Gaby Morlay]], then in 1951 adapted for the stage with the then-unknown [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the title role, picked by Colette personally; the 1958 Hollywood musical, starring [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Louis Jourdan]], with a screenplay by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and a score by Lerner and [[Frederick Loewe]], won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nIn the postwar years, she became a famous public figure, crippled by arthritis and cared for by Goudeket, who supervised the preparation of her ''\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes'' (1948\u20131950). She continued to write during those years, bringing out ''L'Etoile vesper'' (1944) and ''Le Fanal bleu'' (1949), in which she reflected on the problems of a writer whose inspiration is primarily autobiographical.\n\n==Death==\nOn her death on August 3, 1954, she was refused a religious funeral by the [[Catholic Church]] on account of her [[divorce]]s, but given a [[state funeral]], the first French woman of letters to be granted the honor, and interred in [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] cemetery.{{sfn |Portuges |Jouve |1994 |pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn |Rosbottom |2014 |p=unpaginated}}{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}<ref>Wilson, Scott.
