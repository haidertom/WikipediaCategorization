The senior associate justice is also tasked with carrying out the chief justices's duties when he is unable to, or if that office is vacant.<ref>{{USC|28|3}}</ref>Historically, associate justices were styled \"Mr. Justice\" in court opinions and other writings. The title was shortened to \"Justice\" in 1980, a year before [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] became the first female justice.<ref name=\"Biskupic\">{{cite book |first = Joan |last = Biskupic |title = Sandra Day O'Connor: How the First Woman on the Supreme Court Became Its Most Influential Justice |location = New York |publisher = HarperCollins |year = 2005 |page = 101 }}</ref>\n\n== Current associate justices ==\n\nThere are eight associate justices on the Supreme Court.

After retirement, they keep their title, and by custom may also keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, and employ law clerks. The names of retired associate justices continue to appear alongside those of the active justices in the bound volumes of Supreme Court decisions. Federal statute ({{USCode|28|294}}) provides that retired Supreme Court justices may serve\u2014if designated and assigned by the chief justice\u2014on panels of the U.S. courts of appeals, or on the U.S. district courts. Retired justices are not, however, authorized to take part in the consideration or decision of any cases before the Supreme Court (unlike other retired federal judges who may be permitted do so in their former courts); neither are they known or designated as a \"senior judge\". When, after his retirement, [[William O. Douglas]] attempted to take a more active role than was customary, maintaining that it was his prerogative to do so because of his senior status, he was rebuffed by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] and admonished by the whole Court.<ref>{{cite book| author1-link=Bob Woodward| last1=Woodward| first1=Robert| author2-link=Scott Armstrong (journalist)| last2=Armstrong| first2=Scott|title=[[The Brethren (book)|The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court]]| date=1979| pages=480\u2013488, 526| isbn=978-0-7432-7402-9| publisher=Simon & Schuster| location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThere are four living retired associate justices at the present time: [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], retired January 31, 2006; [[David Souter]], retired June 29, 2009; [[John Paul Stevens]], retired June 29, 2010; and [[Anthony Kennedy]], retired July 31, 2018.

In collaboration with [[Frederick Loewe]], and later [[Burton Lane]], he created some of the world's most popular and enduring works of [[musical theatre]] both for the stage and on film. He won three [[Tony Award]]s and three [[Academy Awards]], among other honors.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in [[New York City]], he was the son of Edith Adelson Lerner and Joseph Jay Lerner, whose brother, Samuel Alexander Lerner, was founder and owner of the [[Lerner Stores]], a chain of dress shops. One of Lerner's cousins was the radio comedian and television game show panelist [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]]. Lerner was educated at [[Bedales School]] in England, [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, (where he wrote \"The Choate Marching Song\") and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He attended both [[Camp Androscoggin]] and [[Camp Greylock]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DC1E3AF937A25755C0A964958260 \"The Executive Life; And No One Mentions The Many Mosquitoes\"]''[[The New York Times]]'', June 14, 1992</ref> At both Choate and Harvard, Lerner was a classmate of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s; at Choate they had worked together on the yearbook staff.<ref name=tcm>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=112326&apid=8980  \"Alan Jay Lerner: Biography\"] [[Turner Classic Movies]], accessed August 1, 2009</ref>  Like [[Cole Porter]] at [[Yale]] and [[Richard Rodgers]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], his career in musical theater began with his collegiate contributions, in Lerner's case to the annual Harvard [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]] musicals.<ref>Green, p.238</ref> During the summers of 1936 and 1937, Lerner studied music composition at [[Juilliard]]. While attending Harvard, he lost his sight in his left eye due to an accident in the boxing ring. In 1957, Lerner and [[Leonard Bernstein]], another of Lerner's college classmates, collaborated on \"Lonely Men of Harvard,\" a tongue-in-cheek salute to their alma mater.\n\n==Career==\nDue to his injury, Lerner could not serve in [[World War II]]. Instead he wrote [[radio]] scripts, including ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'', until he was introduced to [[Austria]]n composer [[Frederick Loewe]], who needed a partner, in 1942 at the [[Lamb's Club]]. While at the Lamb's, he also met [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he would also collaborate.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Viertel| first1=Jack| title=Encores! artistic director Jack Viertel explains how the Lerner and Lowe musical Paint Your Wagon is a fascinating anomaly from the songwriting team best known for My Fair Lady and Camelot| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/how-a-wrong-turn-at-the-lambs-club-introduced-lerner-to-loewe-and-an-anomaly-explained-com-343920| journal=[[Playbill]]| accessdate=December 16, 2016| date=March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLerner and Loewe's first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Conners's farce ''The Patsy'' called ''Life of the Party'' for a [[Detroit]] [[Stock company (acting)|stock company]]. The lyrics were mostly written by Earle Crooker, but he had left the project, with the score needing vast improvement. It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for ''[[What's Up? (musical)|What's Up?]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1943. It ran for 63 performances and was followed two years later by ''[[The Day Before Spring]]''.<ref>Green, p. 239</ref>\n\nTheir first hit was ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' (1947), a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]]. It was followed in 1951 by the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] story ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]''. While the show ran for nearly a year and included songs that later became pop standards, it was less successful than Lerner's previous work. He later said of ''Paint Your Wagon'', it was \"a success but not a hit.\"<ref>{{cite news| last1=Zink| first1=Jack| title=Folk Musical `Wagon` Claims Quite A History Lerner And Loewe`s `paint Your Wagon` Has Had Three Transformations In Its Lifetime.

In that same year Lerner also wrote the [[Academy Awards|Oscar-winning]] original [[screenplay]] for ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', produced by [[Arthur Freed]] and directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]]. This was the same team who would later join with Lerner and Loewe to create ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''.\n\nIn 1956, Lerner and Loewe unveiled ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Before finishing the musical, Lerner was eager to write while ''My Fair Lady'' was taking so long to complete. [[Burton Lane]] and Lerner were working on a musical about [[Li'l Abner]]. [[Gabriel Pascal]] owned the rights to ''Pygmalion'', which had been unsuccessful with other composers who tried to adapt it into a musical. [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Howard Dietz]] first tried, and then [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] attempted, but gave up and Hammerstein told Lerner, \"''Pygmalion'' had no subplot\". Lerner and Loewe's adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' retained his social commentary and added appropriate songs for the characters of Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, played originally by [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]]. It set box-office records in [[New York City|New York]] and [[London]]. When brought to the screen in 1964, the movie version won eight [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], including Best Picture and Best Actor for [[Rex Harrison]].\n\nLerner and Loewe's run of success continued with their next project, a film adaptation of stories from [[Colette]], the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning film musical ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'', starring [[Leslie Caron]], [[Louis Jourdan]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]]. The film won all of its nine Oscar nominations, a record at that time, and a special Oscar for co-star Maurice Chevalier.\n\nThe Lerner-Loewe partnership cracked under the stress of producing the Arthurian ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' in 1960, with Loewe resisting Lerner's desire to direct as well as write when original director [[Moss Hart]] suffered a heart attack in the last few months of rehearsals and died shortly after the show's premiere. Lerner was hospitalized with [[bleeding ulcer]]s while Loewe continued to have heart troubles. ''Camelot'' was a hit nonetheless, and immediately following the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], his widow told reporter [[Theodore H. White]] that JFK's administration reminded her of the \"one brief shining moment\" of Lerner and Loewe's ''Camelot''. As of the early 21st century, ''Camelot'' was still invoked to describe the [[idealism]], [[Romanticism|romance]], and [[tragedy]] of the Kennedy years.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Koehler| first1=Robert| title=Stage Review: Retunn to 'Camelot ' -- Sans Inspiration| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-23/entertainment/ca-2120_1_robert-goulet| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=December 16, 2016| date=December 23, 1992}}</ref>\n\nLoewe retired to [[Palm Springs, California]], while Lerner went through a series of  musicals\u2014some successful, some not\u2014with such composers as [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] (''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]''), [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] (''[[Lolita, My Love]]''), [[Leonard Bernstein]] (''[[1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (musical)|1600 Pennsylvania Avenue]]''), [[Burton Lane]] (''[[Carmelina]]'') and [[Charles Strouse]] (''[[Dance a Little Closer]]'', based on the film, ''[[Idiot's Delight (film)|Idiot's Delight]]'', nicknamed ''Close A Little Faster'' by Broadway humorists because it closed on opening night). Most biographers{{who|date=July 2015}} blame Lerner's professional decline on the lack of a strong director with whom Lerner could collaborate, as [[Neil Simon]] did with [[Mike Nichols]] or [[Stephen Sondheim]] with [[Harold Prince]] ([[Moss Hart]], who had directed ''[[My Fair Lady]],'' died shortly after ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' opened). In 1965 Lerner collaborated again with [[Burton Lane]] on the musical ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'', which was adapted for film in 1970. At this time, Lerner was hired by film producer [[Arthur P. Jacobs]] to write a treatment for an upcoming film project, ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'', but Lerner abrogated his contract after several non-productive months of non-communicative procrastination and was replaced with [[Leslie Bricusse]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Harris| first=Mark| title=Pictures at a Revolution| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwSv6lsPDxgC&printsec=frontcover&q=lerner%20bricusse| date=February 14, 2008| publisher=Penguin Press| pages=77\u201378| isbn=978-1101202852}}</ref> Lerner was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1971.\n\nIn 1973, Lerner coaxed Loewe out of retirement to augment the ''Gigi'' score for a [[Gigi (musical)|musical stage adaptation]]. The following year they collaborated on a musical film version of ''[[The Little Prince (1974 film)|The Little Prince]]'', based on the classic children's tale by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]. This film was a critical and box office failure, but it has gained a modern following.{{citation needed|date= August 2017}}\n\nLerner's autobiography, ''The Street Where I Live'' (1978), was an account of three of his and Loewe's successful collaborations, ''My Fair Lady'', ''Gigi'', and ''Camelot'', along with personal information. In the last year of his life he published ''The Musical Theatre:  A Celebration'', a well-reviewed{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} history of the theatre, with personal anecdotes and humor. A book of Lerner's lyrics entitled ''A Hymn To Him'', edited by British writer [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]], was published in 1987.\n\nAt the time of Lerner's death, he had been working with [[Gerard Kenny]] and [[Kristi Kane (libretto)|Kristi Kane]] in London on a musical version of the film ''[[My Man Godfrey]]''. He had also received an urgent call from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], asking him to write the lyrics to ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. He wrote \"[[Masquerade (The Phantom of the Opera song)|Masquerade]]\", but he then informed Webber that he wanted to leave the project because he was losing his memory (due to an undiagnosed brain tumor) and [[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]] replaced him.<ref>{{cite book| last=Furia| first=Philip| title=American Song Lyricists, 1920-1960| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLc7AQAAIAAJ&q=Alan+Lerner| pages=322\u2013335| year=2002| publisher=Gale| location=Detroit| isbn=978-0-7876-6009-3| subscription=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Citron| first=Stephen| title=Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWaZ1LAFAZEC&printsec=frontcover&q=lerner| date=September 13, 2001| publisher=Oxford University Press US| isbn= 978-0195357271| page=330| subscription=yes}}</ref>  He had turned down an invitation to write the English-language lyrics for the musical version of ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Behr| first=Edward| title=The Complete Book of Les Mis\u00e9rables| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&printsec=frontcover&q=lerner| date=January 1, 1993| publisher=Arcade Publishing| isbn=978-1559701563| page=62| accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter Lerner's death, Paul Blake made a musical revue based on Lerner's lyrics and life entitled ''Almost Like Being In Love'', which featured music by [[Frederick Loewe]], [[Burton Lane]], [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], [[Charles Strouse]], and [[Kurt Weill]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Almost Like Being In Love: A Musical Revue| url=http://www.playbill.com/production/almost-like-being-in-love-coms-0000026096| journal=Playbill| accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Theater Week| volume=3| issue=21| publisher=That New Magazine, Inc.| date=1990| page=8| language=en}}</ref> The show ran for 10 days at the [[Herbst Theatre]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Songwriting==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}Lerner often struggled with writing his lyrics. He was uncharacteristically able to complete \"[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]\" from ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' in one 24-hour period. He usually spent months on each song and was constantly rewriting them. Lerner was said{{by whom|date=August 2017}} to have insecurity about his talent. He would sometimes write songs with someone in mind, for instance, \"[[I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face]]\" from ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' was written with [[Rex Harrison]] in mind to complement his very limited vocal range.{{clarify|reason=This makes no sense. Lerner wrote the words of the song, not the music; in what way could HE have 'complemented [Harrison's] very limited vocal range', unless 'very limited vocal range' means that Harrison had a speech impediment that prevented him from pronouncing certain English words\u2014VERY unlikely since he was cast as a phonetics (pronunciation) professor\u2014and Lerner avoided using those words in the song. Otherwise, if 'very limited vocal range' refers, as it nearly always would, to a very limited range of musical pitches Harrison could sing, this statement belongs in the Loewe (composer) article, not in this Lerner (lyricist) article|date=August 2017}}\n\nLerner said of writing:\n<blockquote>You have to keep in mind that there is no such thing as realism or naturalism in the theater. That is a myth. If there was realism in the theater, there would never be a third act. Nothing ends that way. A man's life is made up of thousands and thousands of little pieces. In writing fiction, you select 20 or 30 of them. In a musical, you select even fewer than that.</blockquote> <blockquote> First, we decide where a song is needed in a play. Second, what is it going to be about? Third, we discuss the mood of the song. Fourth, I give (Loewe) a title. Then he writes the music to the title and the general feeling of the song is established. After he's written the melody, then I write the lyrics.</blockquote>\n\nIn a 1979 interview on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'', Lerner went into some depth about his lyrics for ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Professor Henry Higgins sings, \"Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters / Condemned by every syllable she utters / By right she should be taken out and hung / For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue.\" Lerner said he knew the lyric used incorrect grammar for the sake of a rhyme. He was later approached about it by another lyricist:\n<blockquote>I thought, oh well, maybe nobody will notice it, but not at all. Two nights after it opened, I ran into [[No\u00ebl Coward]] in a restaurant, and he walked over and he said, \"Dear boy, it is ''hanged'', not ''hung''.\" I said, \"Oh, Noel, I know it, I know it! You know, shut up!\" So, and there's another, \"Than to ever let a woman in my life.\" It should be, \"as to ever let a woman in my life,\" but it just didn't sing well.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Dramatists Guild==\nAlan Jay Lerner was an advocate for writers' rights in theatre. He was a member of the [[Dramatists Guild of America]]. In 1960, he was elected as the twelfth president of the non-profit organization. He continued to serve as the Guild's president until 1964.\n\n==Personal life==\nFor nearly twenty years, Lerner was [[Substance use disorder|addicted]] to [[amphetamine]]; during the 1960s he was a patient of [[Max Jacobson]], known as \"Dr. Feelgood\", who administered injections of \"vitamins with enzymes\" that were in fact laced with amphetamine. Lerner's addiction is believed to have been the result of Jacobson's  practice.<ref>{{cite news| last=Bryk| first=William| url=http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/dr-feelgood/20251/| title=Dr. Feelgood| newspaper=[[The New York Sun]]| date=September 20, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author-link=Nicolas Rasmussen| last=Rasmussen| first=Nicolas| title=On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mf5eEG0nRUC&pg=PA169&q=Dexamyl%20%22purple%20heart%22| publisher=New York University Press| location=New York City| date=March 1, 2008| page=169| isbn=978-0814776278}}</ref>\n\n===Marriages and children===\nLerner married eight times: Ruth Boyd (1940&ndash;1947), singer [[Marion Bell]] (1947&ndash;1949), actress [[Nancy Olson]] (1950&ndash;1957), lawyer Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo (1957&ndash;1965), editor Karen Gundersen (1966&ndash;1974),  [[Sandra Payne]] (1974&ndash;1976), Nina Bushkin (1977&ndash;1981) and [[Liz Robertson]] (1981&ndash;1986 [his death]).

He also wrote the comic strips ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' (in the years 1937\u201345) and ''[[Long Sam]]'' (1954). He won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 [[E. C. Segar|Elzie Segar Award]], posthumously for his \"unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning.\" Comic strips dealt with northern urban experiences until the year Capp introduced \"Li'l Abner,\" the first strip based in the South. Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching an estimated 60 million readers in over 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers in 28 countries. [[M. Thomas Inge]] says Capp made a large personal fortune on the strip and \"had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South.\"<ref>M. Thomas Inge, \"Li'l Abner, Snuffy, Pogo, and Friends: The South in the American Comic Strip,\" ''Southern Quarterly'' (2011) 48#2 pp 6-74</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], of East European Jewish heritage, Capp was the eldest child of Otto Philip and Matilda (Davidson) Caplin. His brothers, Elliott and Jerome, were cartoonists, and his sister, Madeline, was a publicist. Capp's parents were both natives of [[Latvia]] whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. \"My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants,\" wrote Capp in 1978. \"Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true&nbsp;\u2014 it was no crime to be a Jew.\" The Caplins were dirt poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.\n\nIn August 1919, at the age of nine, Capp was run down by a  [[Tram|trolley car]] and had to have his left leg amputated, well above the knee.<ref>See [http://lil-abner.com/al-capp/ Li'l Abner Official Site: Al Capp biography]</ref> According to his father Otto's unpublished autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg was removed.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) p. 4</ref> He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly painful as he grew older.<ref>See [http://www.tcj.com/reviews/al-capp-a-life-to-the-contrary/ Review: \"Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary,\" by R.C. Harvey, published March 14, 2013]</ref> The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp's cynical worldview, which was darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist.<ref>see [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811832,00.html \"Inhuman Man,\" ''Time'', February 6, 1950]</ref> \"I was indignant as hell about that leg,\" he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.\n\n\"The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else,\" Capp philosophically wrote (in ''[[Life magazine]]'' on May 23, 1960), \"was to be indifferent to that difference.\"<ref>see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3k4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA129&dq=Al+Capp&as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&q=Al%20Capp&f=false ''Life'', 23 May 1960, pp. 129\u2013140]</ref> It was the prevailing opinion among his friends that Capp's [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.\n[[File:Al Capp Self-portrait April 1951.JPG|right|450px|thumb|\"I do ''Li'l Abner!!'',\" a self-portrait by Al Capp, excerpted from the<br />April 16\u201317, 1951 ''Li'l Abner'' strips. Note the reference to [[Milton Caniff]].]]\nCapp's father, a failed businessman and an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, learning mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoonist\u2013illustrator [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], and American comic strip cartoonists [[Thomas Aloysius Dorgan|Tad Dorgan]], [[Cliff Sterrett]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Rudolph Dirks]], [[Frederick Burr Opper|Fred Opper]], [[Billy DeBeck]], [[George McManus]] and [[Milt Gross]]. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of Shakespeare and [[George Bernard Shaw]] by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Booth Tarkington]], and later, [[Robert Benchley]] and [[S. J. Perelman]].\n\nCapp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], without receiving a diploma. The cartoonist liked to joke about how he failed geometry for nine straight terms.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |title=Web page at Bridgeport Central High School devoted to Al Capp |access-date=2006-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185724/http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> His formal training came from a series of art schools in the [[New England]] area. Attending three of them in rapid succession, the impoverished Capp was thrown out of each for nonpayment of tuition&mdash;the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum School of Fine Arts]], the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], and Designers Art School in Boston&mdash;the last before launching his career. Capp had already decided to become a cartoonist. \"I heard that [[Bud Fisher]] (creator of ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'') got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses,\" Capp said. \"I decided that was for me.\"\n\nIn early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to [[New York City]]. He lived in \"airless rat holes\" in [[Greenwich Village]] and turned out advertising strips at $2 apiece while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the [[Associated Press]] when he was 23 years old. By March 1932, Capp was drawing ''Colonel Gilfeather'', a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by [[Richard Dorgan|Dick Dorgan]]. Capp changed the focus and title to ''Mister Gilfeather'', but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met [[Milton Caniff]], and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to [[Boston]] and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.\n\nLeaving his new wife with her parents in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. \"I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything.\" There he met [[Ham Fisher]], who hired him to ghost on ''[[Joe Palooka]]''. During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's ''Joe Palooka'' [[story arc]] introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named \"Big Leviticus,\" a crude [[prototype]]. (Leviticus was actually much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.)\n\nAlso during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that would eventually become ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural [[West Virginia]] and the [[Cumberland Valley]] as a teenager. (This was years before the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act brought basic utilities like electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving ''Joe Palooka'', Capp sold ''Li'l Abner'' to United Feature Syndicate (now known as [[United Media]]). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers&mdash;including the ''[[New York Mirror]]''&mdash;and was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became \"Al Capp\" because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame.<ref>A review of the 1934 strips reveals that the earliest strips were signed \"Al G. Cap,\" which became \"Al G. Capp\" and, finally, \"Al Capp.\" However, the middle initial (\"Al G. Capp\") appeared from time to time during the first year.</ref> Capp had it changed legally in 1949.\n\nHis younger brother [[Elliot Caplin]] also became a comic strip writer, best known for co-creating the [[soap opera]] strip ''[[The Heart of Juliet Jones]]'' with artist [[Stan Drake]] and conceiving the comic strip character ''[[Broom-Hilda]]'' with cartoonist [[Russell Myers]]. Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including ''A Nickel for Picasso'' (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/nyregion/theater-a-new-play-explores-fantasies-of-a-man-at-60.html ''New York Times'' theater column by Alvin Klein, November 8, 1987]</ref>\n\n==''Li'l Abner''==\n{{Main|Li'l Abner}}\nWhat began as a [[hillbilly]] [[burlesque]] soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular and well-drawn strips of the 20th century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts [[suspense]], [[slapstick]], [[irony]], [[satire]], [[black humor]] and biting [[social commentary]], ''Li'l Abner'' is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum\u2014the simple-minded, loutish but good-natured and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents\u2014scrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.\n\n\"Yokum\" was a combination of ''yokel'' and ''hokum'', although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965\u20131970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. \"It's phonetic [[Hebrew]]\u2014that's what it is, all right\u2014and that's what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound ''hickish,\"'' said Capp. \"That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it's a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name\u2014''[[Joachim]]'' means 'God's determination', something like that\u2014that also happens to have a rustic ring to it.\"<ref>[http://www.comicmix.com/news/2007/11/11/li-l-abner-lost-in-hollywood-shuffle-by-michael-h-price/ \"Li'l Abner Lost In Hollywood\" by Michael H. Price]</ref>\n\nThe Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of [[Dogpatch]], [[Kentucky]]. Described by its creator as \"an average stone-age community,\" Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, \"tarnip\" fields and \"hawg\" wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend\u2014until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of ''Life'' on March 31, 1952.\n\nCapp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-[[New Deal]] [[Dixiecrats]]), the ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs, Available Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a [[GI (military)|G.I.]] point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women like Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)\u2014all of whom found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft|bomber planes]] during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the [[Shmoo]]s, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was [[Joe Btfsplk]], who wants to be a loving friend but is \"the world's worst jinx,\" bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is \"pronounced\" by simply blowing a \"raspberry\" or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.\n\nDogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The last includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as [[Lower Slobbovia]], a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy that remains a contemporary reference.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia - '&#39;NY Times'&#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-01-13 |access-date=2009-08-29}}</ref> \"Indeed, ''Li'l Abner'' incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary,\" according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. \"Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a microcosm and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society.\"<ref>''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon'' by Anthony Harkins (2004, Oxford Univ. Press) pp. 124\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, ''Li'l Abner'' was estimated to have been read daily in the United States by 60 to 70 million people (the U.S. population at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.\n\nLi'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?,\" Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp said he finally found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver, in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=U99JAAAAMAAJ&q=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&dq=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=0 Steen, Mike ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History'' Putnam, 1974]</ref> In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\n\n==Parodies, toppers and alternate strips==\n''Li'l Abner'' also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' is a parody of [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently over the next 35 years. Gould was personally parodied in the series as cartoonist \"Lester Gooch\"\u2014the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of Fosdick. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicks ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping [[mortality rate]], the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived [[puppet show]] on [[NBC]], featuring the Mary Chase [[marionette]]s.\n\nBesides ''Dick Tracy'', Capp parodied many other comic strips in ''Li'l Abner''\u2014including ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'' (at least twice; first as \"Jack Jawbreaker\" in 1947, and again in 1966 as \"Chickensouperman\"), ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\", ''[[Peanuts]]'' {with \"Peewee\" a parody of Charlie Brown with \"Croopy\" parody of [[Snoopy]]\" {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of [[Charles Schulz]]}, ''[[Rex Morgan, M.D.]]'', ''[[Little Annie Rooney]]'' and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' (in which Punjab became \"Punjbag,\" an oleaginous slob). ''Fearless Fosdick''\u2014and Capp's other spoofs like \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952) and \"Jack Jawbreaker\"\u2014were almost certainly an early inspiration for [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', which began in 1952 as a [[comic book]] that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.\n\nCapp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as [[Elvis Presley]] (\"Hawg McCall,\" 1957), [[Liberace]] (\"Loverboynik,\" 1956), [[the Beatles]] (\"the Beasties,\" 1964)\u2014and in 1944, [[Frank Sinatra]]. \"Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about,\" Capp once said. \"I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me champagne whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant ...\" (from ''Frank Sinatra, My Father'' by [[Nancy Sinatra]], 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action\u2014as would [[Joan Baez]] later, over \"Joanie Phoanie\" in 1967.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ UPI Photo/Files Al Capp Jan. 11, 1967]</ref>\n\nCapp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in ''Li'l Abner''.<ref>''Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form'' by [[M. Thomas Inge]] (1995) University Press of Mississippi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with \"fans\" (see excerpt), or in his 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody, \"Hal Yappland.\" Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire\u2014in one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first President of the United States.\n \nIn addition to creating ''Li'l Abner'', Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' with magazine illustrator [[Raeburn van Buren]] in 1937, and ''[[Long Sam]]'' with cartoonist [[Bob Lubbers]] in 1954, as well as the Sunday \"[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]\" strips ''Washable Jones,'' ''Small Fry'' (a.k.a. ''Small Change''), and ''Advice fo' Chillun.''\n\n==Critical recognition==\nAccording to comics historian [[Coulton Waugh]], a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: ''Li'l Abner''. \"When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into ''Li'l Abner''. The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique\u2014as invigorating as it was unorthodox\u2014was later adopted by cartoonists like [[Walt Kelly]] [''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''] and [[Garry Trudeau]] [''[[Doonesbury]]''],\" wrote comic strip historian [[Rick Marschall]]. According to Marschall, ''Li'l Abner'' gradually evolved into a broad satire of [[human nature]]. In his book ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly misanthropic subtext.\n\nOver the years, ''Li'l Abner'' has been adapted to radio, [[Character animation|animated cartoons]], stage production, [[motion pictures]] and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, [[Dostoevski]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]] and [[Rabelais]].<ref>Brown, Rodger, \"Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum\" article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18-26</ref> Fans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp \"possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature\u2014to media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life.\" [[John Updike]], comparing Abner to a \"hillbilly [[Candide]],\" added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]].\"<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F.

''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by [[Arthur Asa Berger]] (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature and grotesquerie, the place of ''Li'l Abner'' in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying ... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.\n\n==The 1940s and '50s==\n[[File:Cappbio46.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Al Capp drew his own autobiography, the 34-page ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'' (1946), distributed to returning World War II amputee veterans.]]\nDuring World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to [[hospital]]s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his [[prosthetic]] leg his whole life. In 1946 Capp created a special full-color comic book, ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'', to be distributed by the [[Red Cross]] to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp was also involved with the [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Foundation]], which pioneered new treatments for [[polio]] in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fund-raising appeals, and entertained crippled and [[paraplegic]] children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories and sketches.<ref>[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/05/dont-keep-remembering-what-youve-lost.html Letters of Note: Dear Chip... (Columbus Hospital, 28 May 1964)]</ref>\n\nIn 1940, an [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] [[Li'l Abner (1940 film)|movie adaptation]] starred Granville Owen (later known as [[Jeff York]]) as Li'l Abner, with [[Buster Keaton]] taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by [[Milton Berle]]. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956, and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The [[Li'l Abner (musical)|stage musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Gene de Paul]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], was adapted into a [[Technicolor]] [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|motion picture]] at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1959 by producer [[Norman Panama]] and director [[Melvin Frank]], with a score by [[Nelson Riddle]]. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably [[Julie Newmar]] as Stupefyin' Jones and [[Stubby Kaye]] as Marryin' Sam.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F04E3D9103CE63BBC4A52DFB4678382649EDE The Screen 'Li'l Abner' - New York Times Review]</ref>\n\nOther highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's \"ideel\" (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest, in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]]; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' that aroused anger and legal threats from author [[Margaret Mitchell]], and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!,\" was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]''. It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a ''Superman'' story in ''[[Action Comics]] #55'', December 1942, in which a cartoonist named \"Al Hatt\" invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly \"Tiny Rufe.\")\n\nIn 1947, Capp earned a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story. That same year the ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker's]]'' profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the Shmoos, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was [[metaphor]]ically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]].\n\nFollowing his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with ''[[Steve Canyon]]''), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950\u2014including a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, ''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'', became a bestseller for [[Simon & Schuster]]. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, [[Halloween]] masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including \"Shmooveralls.\" The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'', have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated TV series.\n\nCapp followed this success with other [[allegory|allegorical]] fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] \"Kigmies\", who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded \"Nogoodniks\" (or ''bad'' shmoos), and the irresistible \"Bald Iggle\", a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness\u2014with predictably disastrous results.\n\n''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[United States Senate]]. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks&nbsp; ... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny - TIME]</ref> He criticized [[Senator Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, calling him a \"poet.\" \"He uses [[poetic license]] to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants,\" said Capp. \"He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and na\u00efve.\"<ref>\"Poet: Cartoonist Al Capp said in New York ...\" quoted in ''The Argus'', 10 May 1954</ref>\n\nCapp received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Billy DeBeck Memorial Award|Billy DeBeck Memorial Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Capp also retroactively received a [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben]] statuette.) He was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the NCS by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the Society had disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949 to protest their refusal of admission to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]''. According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The NCS finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in ''Real'' magazine titled \"The REAL Powers in America\" that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: \"The real powers in America are ''women''\u2014the wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies&nbsp; ...\"\n\nHighlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son \"Honest Abe\" Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both ''Life'' and ''[[TV Guide]]''. 1956 saw the debut of the Bald Iggle, considered by some ''Abner'' enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the \"Square Eyes\" Family\u2014Capp's thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This [[fable]]-like story was collected into an educational comic book called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'', and distributed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]'', a biographical comic book distributed by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].<ref name=Grio>Love, David A.

Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when [[General Motors]] president [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], nominated for a cabinet post, told [[United States Congress|Congress]] \"... &nbsp;what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa,\" he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires\u2014the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!''\" Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of \"haves\" versus \"have-nots\". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.\n\n==Feud with Ham Fisher==\nAfter Capp quit his ghosting job on [[Ham Fisher]]'s ''Joe Palooka'' in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had \"stolen\" his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as \"The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters\" and advising readers not to be \"fooled by imitations.\" (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character\u2014Big Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence\u2014bore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 ''Time'' article, \"Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813720-7,00.html Die Monstersinger - TIME]</ref>\n\n\"Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family&nbsp;\u2014 but he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public,\" (from [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]'').<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/abner.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia / Li'l Abner]</ref>\n\nThe Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed ''Joe Palooka'' in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, [[Moe Leff]]. After Fisher underwent [[plastic surgery]], Capp included a racehorse in ''Li'l Abner'' named \"Ham's Nose-Bob.\" In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named \"Happy Vermin\"\u2014a caricature of Fisher\u2014who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous \"temporary\" assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do&nbsp;\u2014 I'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!\"\n\nTraveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1998: \"They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.\"<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html Maeder, Jay. \u201cSpitting on Pictures Funny Papers, 1955\u201d, ''Daily News'', September 18, 1998.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008035428/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html |date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref> In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', titled \"I Remember Monster.\" The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed \"benefactor\" with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly-veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.\n\nFisher retaliated, doctoring photostats of ''Li'l Abner'' and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of ''Li'l Abner'' to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had actually been drawn there by Fisher. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.\n\nIn 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic ''Li'l Abner'' drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio. The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictionalized murder mystery, ''Strip for Murder'' by [[Max Allan Collins]].\n\nAnother \"feud\" seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm.\" The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. [[Allen Saunders]], the creator of the ''Mary Worth'' strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character \"Hal Rapp,\" a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a [[teetotaler]]). Later, it was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders \"feud\" fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips\u2014and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html Rap for Capp - TIME]</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nCapp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: [[Milton Caniff]] (''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', ''Steve Canyon'') and [[Walt Kelly]] (''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]''). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally referenced each other in their strips. According to one [[anecdote]] (from ''Al Capp Remembered'', 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home\u2014leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's [[baby grand piano]]. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between [[Argentina]] and the United States, and b. \"Because you can't play the piano, anyway!\" (''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' creator [[Mort Walker]] confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, ''Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook'', 2001.)\n\nMilton Caniff offered another anecdote (from ''Phi Beta Pogo'', 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, \"two boys from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], nose to nose,\" onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. \"Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing ''his'' version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them&nbsp; ...\"\n\nAlthough he was often considered a difficult person,<ref name=\"printmag.com\">http://www.printmag.com/interviews/lil-abner-al-capp-monster-cartoonist/</ref> some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side; in 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival [[Ted Kennedy]] had had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice as to how to deal with the loss of a limb,<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.243</ref> which he himself had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the [[Jonestown]] massacre.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.244</ref> Capp is also reported to have given money anonymously to charities and \"people in need\" at various points in his life.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/>\n\n==Allegations of sexual assault==\n\nIn her autobiography, American actress [[Goldie Hawn]] stated that Capp sexually propositioned her on a [[casting couch]] and exposed himself to her when she was nineteen years old. When she refused his advances, Capp became angry and told her that she was \"never gonna make anything in your life\" and that she should \"go and marry a Jewish dentist.

Then after an incident at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Capp was arrested and tried for indecent exposure and sodomy. He was fined $500, and his career and reputation were ruined. Two biographies, one about [[Goldie Hawn]] and the other about [[Grace Kelly]], describe Capp as trying to force Hawn and Kelly into sex.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/</ref>\n\n==Production methods==\nLike many cartoonists, Capp made extensive use of assistants (notably Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson and Frank Frazetta). During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics and other specialty work\u2014in addition to the regular six dailies and one [[Sunday strip]] per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for [[Cream of Wheat]] using the ''Abner'' characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks\u2014including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]\u2014and [[General Electric]] and [[Procter & Gamble]] products, all requiring special artwork.\n\nNo matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands\u2014especially of Abner and Daisy Mae\u2014himself, and his distinctive touch is often discernible. \"He had ''the touch,''\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.\"\n\nAs is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited\u2014 although, sensitive to his own experience working on ''Joe Palooka'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' even included photos of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp himself originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in ''Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20'' (Kitchen Sink, 1994):\n\n{{quote|text=By the time Frazetta began working on the strip, the work of producing ''Li'l Abner'' was too much for one person. Capp had a group of assistants who he taught to reproduce his distinctive individual style, working under his direct supervision. Actual production of the strip began with a rough layout in pencil done by Al Capp, from Capp's script or a co-authored script, and the page would pass to Andy Amato and Walter Johnson. Amato would ink the figures, then Johnson added backgrounds and any mechanical objects. Harvey Curtis was responsible for the lettering and also shared inking duties with Amato&nbsp; ... In order to make sure that the work stayed true to his style, the final touches would be added by Capp himself. He enjoyed adding a distinctive glint to an eye or an idiosyncratic contortion to a character's face. The finished strip was truly an ensemble effort, a skillful blending of talents.}}\n\nThere was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned [[Toby Press]], including ''Shmoo Comics'' featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too'' which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life.\" Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, [[Charles Schulz]] and [[Milton Caniff]].\n\nCapp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the [[Famous Artists School]], beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for [[Folkways Records]] (now owned by the [[Smithsonian]]) on which he identified and described \"The Mechanics of the Comic Strip.\"<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1284 An Interview with Al Capp - Smithsonian Folkways]</ref>\n\nFrazetta, later famous as a [[fantasy art]]ist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December, 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named \"Frankie,\" a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility\u2014along with various specialty art, such as a series of ''Li'l Abner'' greeting cards\u2014was tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in a four-volume hardcover series entitled ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years''. In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. \"[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. ''I'' said goodbye,\" (from ''Frazetta: Painting with Fire''). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called ''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space'', distributed by the [[Job Corps]] in 1965.\n\n==Public service works==\nCapp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies and charitable or non-profit organizations, spanning several decades.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708021015/http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/ |date=8 July 2012 }}</ref> The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for various [[public services]]:\n\n*''Al Capp by Li'l Abner''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] (1946)\n*''Yo' Bets Yo' Life!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Army]] (circa 1950)\n*''Li'l Abner Joins the Navy''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Navy|Dept. of the Navy]] (1950)\n*''Fearless Fosdick and the Case of the Red Feather''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by Red Feather Services, a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1951)\n*''The Youth You Supervise''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (1956)\n*''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] (1956)\n*''Operation: Survival!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Civil Defense|Dept. of Civil Defense]] (1957)\n*''Natural Disasters!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the Dept. of Civil Defense (1957)\n*''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by [[The Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (1958)<ref name=Grio />\n*''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Job Corps]] (1965)\n\nIn addition, Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the [[U.S. Treasury]], the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Foundation]], the [[Boy Scouts of America]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]], the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, [[Christmas Seal & Charity Stamp Society|Christmas Seals]], the National Amputation Foundation and [[Disabled American Veterans]],<ref name=\"news.google.com\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19500511&id=DZZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4AkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4808,2345975 \"Al Capp Replies to Critic of Newspaper Comic Strips;\" ''The News and Courier'', 11 May 1950]</ref> among others.\n\n==Public figure==\nIn the Golden Age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As ''Li'l Abner'' reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. \"Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era,\" writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) [[Denis Kitchen]]. \"His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated [[newspaper column]], and a 500-station [[radio program]] ...\" He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with ''[[The Phantom (comics)|The Phantom]]'' cartoonist [[Lee Falk]], bringing in Hollywood actors such as [[Mae West]], [[Melvyn Douglas]] and [[Claude Rains]] to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] urged Capp to run in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Massachusetts]] primary in 1970 against [[Ted Kennedy]], but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman [[Jack Kemp]].)\n[[File:Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida.jpg|thumb|Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida]]\nBesides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular guest speaker at universities, and on radio<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779734,00.html The Press: Bane of the Bassinet, ''Time'', 15 March 1948]</ref> and [[television]]. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by TV; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure.<ref>[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102060 Al Capp Views the Networks (April 1952) ''Nieman Reports'']</ref> Capp appeared as a regular on ''[[The Author Meets the Critics]]'' (1948\u2013'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's ''[[Who Said That?]]'' (1948\u2013'55), and co-hosted DuMont's ''[[What's the Story|What's the Story?]]'' (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least ''five'' television shows\u2013three different [[talk show]]s called ''The Al Capp Show'' (1952 and 1968) and ''Al Capp'' (1971\u2013'72), ''Al Capp's America'' (a live \"chalk talk,\" with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called ''Anyone Can Win'' (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio\u2014and was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including the long-running NBC Radio Monitor Beacon as a commentator dubbed \"An expert of nothing with opinions on everything\", ''[[Monitor (NBC radio)|Monitor]]''.\n\nHis frequent appearances on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' spanned three emcees ([[Steve Allen]], [[Jack Paar]] and [[Johnny Carson]]), from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As Capp was ushered into the [[Oval Office]], his [[Prosthesis|prosthetic leg]] suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, \"Call [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]] (Hospital), or maybe [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda]],\" to which Capp replied, \"Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!\" (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called \"The Tommy Wholesome Show.\")\n\nCapp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the [[Bob Hope]] film ''That Certain Feeling'', for which he also provided promotional art. He was interviewed live on ''[[Person to Person]]'' on November 27, 1959, by host [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]]. He also appeared as himself on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and guested on [[Ralph Edwards]]' ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''Show'', ''Pageant'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''Coronet'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Capp was impersonated by comedians [[Rich Little]] and [[David Frye]]. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends [[Milton Caniff]] and Walt Kelly), and\u2014with an irony that would become apparent later\u2014a brand of cigarettes, ([[Chesterfield cigarettes|Chesterfield]]).\n\nCapp would resume visiting war amputees during the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]]. He toured Vietnam with the [[USO]], entertaining troops along with [[Art Buchwald]] and [[George Plimpton]]. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had actually supported [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] for president in 1952 and 1956),<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/capp.jpg Al Capp's biography card from the National Cartoonists Society]</ref> which was organized to promote [[Savings bond]]s for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012]</ref>  During the [[Soviet Union]]'s blockade of [[West Berlin]] in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of \"Operation: Little Vittles.\" Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the [[humanitarian]] effort. \"When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted,\" (reported in ''[[Newsweek]]''\u2014October 11, 1948).\n\nIn addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column (\"Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street\") challenging federally funded [[Public Television]] endowments in favor of educational comics\u2014which, according to Capp, \"didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy ''[[Sesame Street]]'' ''without'' learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips ''unless'' he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such ''reading'' form might make better sense.\"\n\nCapp's academic interests included being one of nineteen original \"Trustees and Advisors\" for \"Endicott, Junior College for Young Woman\", located in Pride's Crossing (Beverly), Massachusetts, which was founded in 1939. Al Capp is listed in the 1942 Mingotide Yearbook, representing the first graduating class from Endicott Junior College. The yearbook entry includes his credential as a \"Cartoonist for United Feature Syndicate\" and a resident of New York City.\n\n\"Comics,\" wrote Capp in 1970, \"can be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.\" Capp would produce many giveaway educational comic books and [[public services]] pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]], the [[United States civil defense|Department of Civil Defense]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], the [[U.S. Army]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] (a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]]), and the [[Job Corps]]. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and [[non-profit organizations]] as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]], among others.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> They were also used to help sell [[Christmas Seals]].\n \nCapp was the ''[[Playboy]]'' interview subject in December 1965, in a conversation conducted by [[Alvin Toffler]]. In August 1967 Capp was the narrator and host of an ABC network special called ''Do Blondes Have More Fun?'' In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called ''This Is Al Capp.'' In the early 1960s, Capp regularly wrote a column entitled ''Al Capp's Column'' for the New York newspaper ''The Schenectady Gazette'' (currently [[The Daily Gazette]]).\n\n==The 1960s and '70s==\nCapp and his family lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], near [[Harvard]] during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their TV sets was happening live\u2014right in his own neighborhood. Campus [[Far left|radicals]] and \"[[hippies]]\" inevitably became one of Capp's favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing [[counterculture]] icons such as [[Joan Baez]] (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of \"protest songs\").<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html Which One Is the Phoanie? - Time]</ref> The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a [[limousine liberal]], a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, ''And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir''. Another target was Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], parodied as \"Senator O. Noble McGesture,\" resident of \"Hyideelsport.\" The town name is a play on [[Hyannisport, Massachusetts]], where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.\n\nCapp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as \"Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!\" (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to ''Time'', Capp insisted, \"The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers\u2014the less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844734-3,00.html Letters page April 18, 1969 - TIME]</ref>\n\nCapp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during TV appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the ''Tonight Show''. His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called ''Al Capp On Campus''. The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now [[California State University, Fresno]]) on such topics as \"sensitivity training,\" \"humanitarianism,\" \"abstract art\" (Capp hated it), and \"student protest.\" The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like \"End Capp Brutality,\" \"Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot,\" \"Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50\u2014all crossed out] the Hill!!,\" and \"If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!\"\n\nHighlights of the strip's final decades include \"Boomchik\" (1961), in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, \"Daisy Mae Steps Out\" (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious \"homewrecker gland,\" \"The Lips of Marcia Perkins\" (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on [[venereal disease]] and public health warnings, \"Ignoble Savages\" (1968), in which [[Mafia|the Mob]] takes over Harvard, and \"Corporal Crock\" (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.\n\nThe cartoonist visited [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their 1969 [[Bed-In for Peace]] in [[Montreal]], and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film ''[[Imagine: John Lennon]]'' (1988). Introducing himself with the words \"I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?,\" Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]'' nude album cover: \"I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it.\" Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono (\"Good God, you've gotta live with that?\"), and is asked to \"get out\" by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his ''[[Ballad of John and Yoko]]'' song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: \"Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify ''Capp!'' \"<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html Imagine: John Lennon Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or documentary movie about John Lennon]</ref>\n\nDespite his political conservatism in the last decade of his life, Capp is reported to have been liberal in some particular causes; he supported [[Gay Rights]], and did not tolerate any attempts at homophobic jokes.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/> He is also said to have supported [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the fight for racial equality in American society, although he was very sceptical of the tactics of [[Black Panthers]] and [[Malcolm X]].<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary (2013) Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 196</ref>\n\nIn 1968, a [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at Marble Falls, [[Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. By 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder,\" General Jubilation T. Cornpone) had been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and was slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.\n\nOn April 22, 1971, syndicated [[columnist]] [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] reported allegations that Capp made indecent advances to four female students when he was invited to speak at the [[University of Alabama]] in February 1968. Anderson and an associate confirmed that Capp was shown out of town by university police, but that the incident had been hushed up by the university to avoid negative publicity.<ref>[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Anderson, Jack]], \"Washington Merry-Go-Round,\" April 22, 1971</ref>\n\nThe following month, Capp was charged in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in connection with another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire|University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire]].<ref>\"Al Capp Accused on Moral Counts at Eau Claire U.\"; ''[[The Capital Times]]'', May 7, 1971</ref> Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [[Sodomy laws in the United States|\"sodomy.\"]] As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty to the charge of \"attempted adultery\" (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |title= Adultery is a crime in Wisconsin {{!}} Law Offices of criminal defense attorneys Christopher Van Wagner and Tracey Wood, Madison WI |access-date= 2008-06-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516092007/http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |archive-date= 2008-05-16 |dead-url= yes |df= }}</ref>) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs.<ref>\"Al Capp Admits One Morals Count; Pays $500 Fine\"; ''[[The Capital Times]],'' February 12, 1972</ref> In a December 1992 article for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Charles Colson]] had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against [[Ted Kennedy]] for the U.S. Senate. \"Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public,\" Hersh wrote. \"The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the President by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the President was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors.\" Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge.<ref>[[Seymour Hersh|Hersh, Seymour]], \"Nixon's Last Cover-Up: The Tapes He Wants the Archives to Suppress\"; ''[[The New Yorker]]'', December 14, 1992, pp. 80\u201381</ref> In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip,<ref name=\"salon\">[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= Dogpatch confidential - Salon.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304230031/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= |date=2008-03-04 }}</ref> and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking. [[Celebrity biographer]] James Spada has claimed that similar allegations were made by actress [[Grace Kelly]]. However, no firsthand allegation has ever surfaced.<ref>Spada, James, ''Grace: The Secret Lives of a Princess''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, 1987, p.37</ref>\n\n\"From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself,\" according to [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]''. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip\u2014and I had a sense of humor about mine\u2014you knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html Mr. Dogpatch - 1979 TIME obituary]</ref> adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. \"When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People magazine]]'' ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event,\" wrote publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].\n\nCapp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy. In October 1977, one of his two daughters died; a few weeks later, a beloved granddaughter was killed in a car accident. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]].<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x546276190/Al-Capp-was-here Al Capp Was Here ''Newburyport Daily News'' Sept. 27, 2009]</ref> Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from [[Thomas Gray]]: ''The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me,'' (from \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]],\" 1751).\n\n==Legacy==\n\"Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic; and in 1995, it was recognized as such by the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]],\" according to ''Toonopedia''. ''Li'l Abner'' was one of 20 American comic strips included in the [[Comic Strip Classics]] series of USPS [[commemorative stamp]]s. Al Capp, an inductee into the [[National Cartoon Museum]] (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art), is one of only 31 artists selected to their [[Hall of Fame]]. Capp was also inducted into the [[Will Eisner Award]] Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n[[Sadie Hawkins Day]] and [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]] are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term [[shmoo]] has also entered the [[lexicon]], defining highly technical concepts in no less than ''four'' separate fields of science, including the variations [[Mating of yeast|shmooing]] (a [[microbiological]] term for the \"budding\" process in yeast reproduction), and [[shmoo plot]] (a technical term in the field of [[electrical engineering]]). In [[socioeconomics]], a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to \"[[widget (economics)|widget]]s\" which require resources and active production.) In the field of [[particle physics]], \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument, as utilized at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus X-3]] [[constellation]]. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], [[schmooze]] and [[-nik|nogoodnik, neatnik, etc.]] In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding \"-nik\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning\u2014not with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]]\u2014but earlier, in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.\n\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating his 100th birthday. Created by resident artist [[Jon P. Mooers]], the mural was unveiled in downtown Amesbury on May 15, 2010.<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming [[WNET-TV]] ''[[American Masters]]'' [[documentary]], ''The Life and Times of Al Capp'', produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.\n\nSince his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. [[Underground comix|Underground cartoonist]] and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them. Kitchen is currently compiling a biographical [[monograph]] on Al Capp.\n\nAt the [[San Diego Comic Con]] in July 2009, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] announced the upcoming publication of ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays'' as part of their ongoing [[The Library of American Comics]] series.

Analcime consists of hydrated [[sodium]] [[aluminium]] [[silicate]] in cubic [[crystal]]line form. Its [[chemical formula]] is [[sodium|Na]][[aluminium|Al]][[silicon|Si]]<sub>2</sub>[[oxygen|O]]<sub>6</sub>'''\u00b7'''[[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]. Minor amounts of [[potassium]] and [[calcium]] substitute for sodium. A [[silver]]-bearing synthetic variety also exists (Ag-analcite).\n\nAnalcime is usually classified as a [[zeolite]] mineral, but structurally and chemically it is more similar to the [[feldspathoid]]s. Analcime occurs as a primary mineral in analcime [[basalt]] and other alkaline [[igneous rocks]]. It also occurs as cavity and vesicle fillings associated with [[prehnite]], [[calcite]], and zeolites.\n\n==Locations==\n\nWell known locations for sourcing analcime include [[Croft Quarry]] in [[Leicestershire]], UK; the [[Cyclopean Islands]] east off [[Sicily]] and near [[Trentino]] in northern Italy; [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in Australia; [[Kerguelen Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]; in the [[Lake Superior]] copper district of [[Michigan]], Bergen Hill, [[New Jersey]], [[Golden, Colorado]], and at [[Searles Lake]], California in the United States; and at Cape Blomidon, [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Mont Saint-Hilaire]], [[Quebec]] in Canada; and in [[Iceland]],and now in [[Namibia]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|List of minerals}}\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n* Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, Manual of Mineralogy, 20th ed., {{ISBN|0-471-80580-7}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170949/http://mineral.galleries.com/Minerals/silicate/analcime/analcime.htm Mineral Galleries]\n* [http://www.mindat.org/min-210.html Mindat.org]\n* [http://webmineral.com/data/Analcime.shtml Webmineral.com]\n{{Commons category|Analcime}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://helios.princeton.edu/zeomics/cgi-bin/view_structure.pl?src=iza&id=ANA structure type ANA]\n\n[[Category:Zeolites]]\n[[Category:Sodium minerals]]\n[[Category:Aluminium minerals]]\n[[Category:Orthorhombic minerals]]", "sha1": "rmgmzvkj4q64d7a9npfqk13r9aypefy"}}, {"title": "Alexey Pajitnov", "ns": "0", "id": "3017", "revision": {"id": "853567089", "parentid": "850927152", "timestamp": "2018-08-05T17:32:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lucas(CA)", "id": "1922679"}, "comment": "Added information about education.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Eastern Slavic name|Leonidovich|Pajitnov}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name = Alexey Pajitnov\n|image = Alexey Pajitnov - 2575833305 (crop).jpg\n|caption = Alexey Pajitnov in Barcelona, Spain,<br>14 June 2008\n|birth_name = Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov\n|birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1956|03|14|df=yes}}\n|birth_place = [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]\n|death_date = \n|death_place = \n|nationality = [[Russia]]n\n|occupation = [[Video game designer]] <br /> [[Computer engineering|Computer engineer]]\n|known for = Developer of ''[[Tetris]]''\n|awards = [[Game Developers Choice Awards#The Pioneer Award|Game Developers Choice Awards First Penguin Award]]<br />LARA - Der Deutsche Games Award\n}}\n'''Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov'''{{efn|{{lang-rus|\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u0430\u0301\u0436\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432|p=\u0250l\u02b2\u026a\u02c8ks\u02b2ej l\u02b2\u026a\u0250\u02c8n\u02b2id\u0259v\u02b2\u026at\u0255 \u02c8pa\u0290\u0268tn\u0259f}}<!-- but he prefers the spelling Pajitnov, as explained on the talk page -->}} (born 14 March 1956) is a Russian [[video game designer]] and [[Computer engineering|computer engineer]] who developed ''[[Tetris]]'' while working for the [[Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet government]]-founded [[Research and development|R&D]] center.\n\nHe only started to get royalties from his creation in 1996 when he and [[Henk Rogers]] formed [[The Tetris Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/special/tetrishist.html |title=Tetris: a history |publisher=Atarihq.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nPajitnov was born on 14 March 1956 in [[Moscow]], in the [[Soviet Union]].

He carried on a limited correspondence, which included the ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]'', a collection of 14 letters addressed to the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in North America|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds of North America]], later described as one of three \"charters\" of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. The letters assign a leadership role for the North American Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in spreading the religion around the planet. \n\nHaifa was under real threat of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] bombardment, enough that `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and other Bah\u00e1'\u00eds temporarily retreated to the hills east of `Akka.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=304}} \n\n`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was also under threats from [[Djemal Pasha|Cemal Pa\u015fa]], the Ottoman military chief who at one point expressed his desire to crucify him and destroy Bah\u00e1'\u00ed properties in Palestine.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=18}} The surprisingly swift [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Megiddo offensive|Megiddo offensive]] of the British [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] swept away the Turkish forces in Palestine before harm was done to the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, and the war was over less than two months later. \n\n===Post-war period===\n[[File:\u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 portrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The elderly `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]]\nThe conclusion of [[World War I]] led to the openly hostile Ottoman authorities being replaced by the more friendly [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], allowing for a renewal of correspondence, pilgrims, and development of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Centre]] properties.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=400\u2013431}} It was during this revival of activity that the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith saw an expansion and consolidation in places like [[Egypt]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[North America]] and [[South Asia]] under the leadership of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1.\n\nThe end of the war brought about several political developments that `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 commented on. The [[League of Nations]] formed in January 1920, representing the first instance of [[collective security]] through a worldwide organization. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 had written in 1875 for the need to establish a \"Union of the nations of the world\", and he praised the attempt through the League of Nations as an important step towards the goal. He also said that it was \"incapable of establishing Universal Peace\" because it did not represent all nations and had only trivial power over its member states.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980|pp=166-168}}{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=345}} Around the same time, the British Mandate supported the ongoing [[Aliyah|immigration of Jews to Palestine]]. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 mentioned the immigration as a fulfillment of prophecy, and encouraged the [[Zionism|Zionists]] to develop the land and \"elevate the country for all its inhabitants...

In 1901, `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 had purchased about 1704 acres of scrubland near the [[Jordan river]] and by 1907 many Bah\u00e1'\u00eds from Iran had begun [[sharecropping]] on the land. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 received between 20-33% of their harvest (or cash equivalent), which was shipped to [[Haifa]]. With the war still raging in 1917, `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 received a large amount of wheat from the crops, and also bought other available wheat and shipped it all back to Haifa. The wheat arrived just after the British seized control, and the wheat was widely distributed to allay the famine.{{sfn|McGlinn|2011}}{{sfn|Poostchi|2010}} For this service in averting a famine in Northern Palestine he received a [[Order of the British Empire|knighthood]] at a ceremony held in his honor at the home of the British Governor on 27 April 1920.<ref>{{cite book |last= Luke |first= Harry Charles | authorlink= Harry Luke |date= August 23, 1922 |title= The Handbook of Palestine |url= http://www.bahai-library.com/luke_handbook_palestine |location= London |publisher= Macmillan and Company |page= 59 |isbn=}}</ref><ref>[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/69065/3/Yazdani_Mina_20116_PhD_thesis.pdf Religious Contentions in Modern Iran, 1881-1941], by Mina Yazdani, PhD, Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations, University of Toronto, 2011, pp. 190-191, 199\u2013202.</ref> He was later visited by [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] (later king of Iraq), [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] (High Commissioner for Palestine), and [[Ronald Storrs]] (Military Governor of Jerusalem).{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=306-307}}\n\n===Death and funeral===\n[[File:Abdul Baha Abbas Funeral.jpg|thumb|350px|Funeral of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in [[Haifa]], [[British Mandate-Palestine]]]]\n`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 died on Monday, 28 November 1921, sometime after 1:15 a.m. (27th of [[Rabi' al-awwal]], 1340 [[Hijri year|AH]]).{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=311}}\n\n[[Winston Churchill]] telegraphed the High Commissioner for Palestine, \"convey to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Community, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, their sympathy and condolescence.\" Similar messages came from [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Viscount Allenby]], the [[Council of Ministers]] of Iraq, and others.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=312}}\n\nOn his funeral, which was held the next day, Esslemont notes:\n{{quote|text=... a funeral the like of which Haifa, nay Palestine itself, had surely never seen... so deep was the feeling that brought so many thousands of mourners together, representative of so many religions, races and tongues.<ref>{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=77}}, quoting 'The Passing of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1\", by Lady Blomfield and Shoghi Effendi, pp 11, 12.</ref>}}\n\nAmong the talks delivered at the funeral, [[Shoghi Effendi]] records [[Stewart Symes]] giving the following tribute:\n{{quote|text=Most of us here have, I think, a clear picture of Sir \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 \u2018Abb\u00e1s, of His dignified figure walking thoughtfully in our streets, of His courteous and gracious manner, of His kindness, of His love for little children and flowers, of His generosity and care for the poor and suffering. So gentle was He, and so simple, that in His presence one almost forgot that He was also a great teacher, and that His writings and His conversations have been a solace and an inspiration to hundreds and thousands of people in the East and in the West.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|pp=313-314}} }}\n\nHe was buried in the front room of the [[Shrine of the B\u00e1b]] on [[Mount Carmel]]. His interment there is meant to be temporary, until his own mausoleum can be built.\n\n===Legacy===\n\n`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 left a ''[[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1|Will and Testament]]'' that was originally written between 1901-1908 and addressed to [[Shoghi Effendi]], who at that time was only 4-11 years old. The will appoints Shoghi Effendi as the first in a line of [[Guardian (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith)|Guardians]] of the religion, a hereditary executive role that may provide authoritative interpretations of scripture. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 directed all Bah\u00e1'\u00eds to turn to him and obey him, and assured him of divine protection and guidance. The will also provided a formal reiteration of his teachings, such as the instructions to teach, manifest spiritual qualities, associate with all people, and shun [[Covenant-breaker]]s. Many obligations of the [[Universal House of Justice]] and the [[Hands of the Cause]] were also elaborated.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=356-357}}{{sfn|Iranica|1989}} Shoghi Effendi later described the document as one of three \"charters\" of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\nThe authenticity and provisions of the will were almost universally accepted by Bah\u00e1'\u00eds around the world, with the exception of [[Ruth White (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed author)|Ruth White]] and a few other Americans who tried to protest Shoghi Effendi's leadership. \n\nDuring his lifetime there was some ambiguity among Bah\u00e1'\u00eds as to his station relative to [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], and later to [[Shoghi Effendi]]. Some American newspapers reported him to be a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed prophet or the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]]. Shoghi Effendi later formalized his legacy as the last of three \"Central Figures\" of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the \"Perfect exemplar\" of the teachings, also claiming that holding him on an equal status to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h or Jesus was heretical. Shoghi Effendi also wrote that during the anticipated Bah\u00e1'\u00ed dispensation of 1000 years there will be no equal to `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1.{{sfn|Effendi|1938}}\n\n==Works==\nThe total estimated number of [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] that `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote are over 27,000, of which only a fraction have been translated into English.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings | title = Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts | author = Universal House of Justice |date=September 2002 | accessdate =20 March 2007}}</ref>  His works fall into two groups including first his direct writings and second his lectures and speeches as noted by others.{{sfn|Iranica|1989}} The first group includes ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' written before 1875, ''A Traveller's Narrative'' written around 1886, the Res\u0101la-ye s\u012b\u0101s\u012bya or ''Sermon on the Art of Governance'' written in 1893, the ''Memorials of the Faithful'', and a large number of [[tablets (religious)|tablets]] written to various people;{{sfn|Iranica|1989}} including various Western intellectuals such as [[August Forel]] which has been translated and published as the [[Tablet to Dr. Forel|Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel]].

Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)\n\nMost of the research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.\n\nBritish architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] have said that, as of 2002, <blockquote>\"It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a \"house with no bills\" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Vale |first= Brenda and Robert |authorlink= Brenda and Robert Vale |title= The New Autonomous House|year= 2000|publisher= Thames & Hudson Ltd|location= London |isbn=0-500-34176-1 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the 1970s, a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional [[construction]] techniques, they designed a series of \"[[bioshelter]]\" projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]]. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the \"New Alchemy Institute\".<ref>[http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html \"New Alchemy Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818015757/http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html |date=2006-08-18 }} (Website). ''The Green Center''. Retrieved on 2010-01-10.</ref> The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.\n\n[[Image:PHOENIXBATH.jpg|left|thumb|The bathroom of an [[Earthship]], featuring a recycled [[bottle wall]]]]\n\nThe 1990s saw the development of [[Earthship]]s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]]. The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]]. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]). [[Berm]]s are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally [[blackwater (waste)|black water]] is recycled again for more plant watering. The [[cistern]]s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from [[solar energy|solar power]].\n\n1990s architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]] applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING's]] [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.\n\n==Advantages==\n\nAs an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.\n\nAutonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.\n\nAutonomous buildings are usually [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.\n\nAn autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of [[renewable energy]] and other renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gas]]es than they consume, and other measures.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\nFirst and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.\n\nLiving within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.\n\nAn autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.\n\n[[Brenda and Robert Vale|The Vales]], among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice&mdash;under certain conditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==Systems==\nThis section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|A domestic [[rainwater harvesting]] system]]\n[[Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.]]\n\nThere are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.\n\n[[Greywater]] systems reuse drained wash water to flush [[toilet]]s or to water lawns and [[garden]]s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal]]s and even [[composting toilet]]s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.\n\nThe classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a [[water well|well]]. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The [[sono arsenic filter]] eliminates unhealthy [[arsenic]] in well water.\n\nHowever drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas.  It can also be expensive.\n\nIn regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use [[rainwater harvesting]], with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment.  If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.<ref>[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/ WHO | Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nMost [[desert]] and [[temperate]] climates get at least {{convert|250|mm|in}} of [[rain]] per year. This means that a typical one-story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a [[cistern]] of {{convert|30|m3|USgal}}. Many areas average {{convert|13|mm|in}} of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as {{convert|10|m3|USgal}}.\n\nIn many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking.<ref>[http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf Cistern Design, University of Alaska, referenced 2007-12-27 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517155419/http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }}</ref> To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a \"roof cleaner\" tank that diverts the first 40 liters.  Cistern water is usually [[water chlorination|chlorinated]], though [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide even better quality drinking water.\n\nIn the classic Roman house (\"Domus\"), household water was provided from a cistern (the \"impluvium\"), that was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward facing roof-opening (the \"compluvium\"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jefferey|title=The Roman House (Domus)|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/roman-domestic-architecture-domus|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Vitruvius|translator-last1=Morgan|translator-first1=Morris Hickey|title=The Ten Books of Architecture|date=1914|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=6.3|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Vitruvius__the_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nModern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.\n\nReducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below {{convert|10|USgal|L}} per person per day, so that in a [[drought]] a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.\n\nIt can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.\n\n[[Solar still]]s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency [[multiple effect humidification]] designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).\n\nNew technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]] can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[brine]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.\n\n===Sewage===\n{{see also|Anaerobic digestion}}\n====Resource====\n\n[[Image:Nature Loo Waterless Composting Toilet Pedestal.jpg|thumb|right|A composting toilet]]\n[[Composting toilet]]s use bacteria to decompose human [[feces]] into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste.  Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of \"[[humanure]]\" for growing food.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last= Jenkins|first=J.C. |year= 2005|publisher= Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|location=Grove City, PA |isbn= 978-0-9644258-3-5|pages=255 |url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com |accessdate=April 2011}}</ref> The risk is microbial and viral contamination.  In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months.  To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.<ref>See [[composting toilet]] for references.</ref>\n\nSome home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free [[reclaimed water]] can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].\n\nElectric [[incinerating toilet]]s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[bioreactor]] is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission.\n\nA big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.\n\nAnother method is NASA's [[urine]]-to-water [[distill]]ation system.\n\n====Waste====\n\nSewage handling is essential for public health. Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.\n\nThe standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]]. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]]. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by [[anaerobic digestion]], and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.\n\nSeptic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a [[Cesspool emptier|vacuum truck]] to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.\n\nHowever, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.\n\nComposting or [[packaging toilet]]s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.\n\nIncinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.\n\nTraditional methods of sewage handling include [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.\n\n===Storm drains===\n\nDrainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.\n\nTypically, elaborate, capital-intensive [[storm sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[stormwater]]. In some cities, such as the [[Victorian era]] London sewers or much of the old City of [[Toronto]], the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.\n\nAutonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:\n\nIf a water absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains.<ref>Swales replacing drains: [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]], \"Natural Capitalism,\" ch. 5, pp83.  The cited development is Village Homes, Davis, California, built in the 1970s by Michael and Judy Corbett</ref> One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.\n\nA [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.\n\n===Electricity===\n[[File:Green Building by Terry Farrel and Partners 394640345.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbine on the roof in Manchester, UK]]\n[[Image:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|right|A PV-solar system]]\n\n{{Further|Zero emissions|Zero-energy building}}Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. [[LED light]]s, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient.<ref>Sunfrost rates {{convert|15|cuft|L|abbr=on}}. refrigerators at [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 0.27 kWh/day] (2007-12-27), while Dometic brand (formerly Servel brand) gas refrigerators cool only {{convert|8|cuft}} for [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 325 W continuous] (i.e. 7.8 kWh/day) ALternatively, they use about {{convert|8|USgal}} of LP gas per month, which in most places is more expensive than the equivalent electricity.(2007-12-27)</ref> There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the [[Sun Frost]] company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market [[energy star]]-rated refrigerator.\n\nUsing a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.\n\nHowever, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself. In stormy or windy climates, [[wind turbine|wind generator]]s can replace or supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.\n\nThe main advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, a 10-metre (33 foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.<ref name=\"Gipe\">Paul Gipe, \"Wind Power for Home and Business\"</ref>\n\nDuring times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with [[net metering]]. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).<ref name=\"Gipe\"/>\n\nA grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using [[single-wire earth return]] systems (for example, the [[MALT (electricity system)|MALT]]-system).\n\nIn areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or sometimes [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.<ref>[http://www.eaton.com Eaton power]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27</ref><ref>[http://www.KohlerSmartPower.com Kohler Generators]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27</ref>\n\nRecent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a [[flywheel]] in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a \"[[regenerative fuel cell]]\", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.\n\n[[Earth battery|Earth batteries]] tap electric currents in the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.\n\n[[Microbial fuel cell]]s and [[thermoelectric generator]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=Biolite Portable Stoves|url=https://www.bioliteenergy.com/collections/stoves|website=bioliteenergy.com|publisher=Biolite|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Firebee:Charge your USB Device!|url=http://firebeecharger.com/|website=firebeecharger.com|publisher=Firebee|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref> allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.\n\n===Heating===\n[[Image:Active Solar Water Heater Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Schematic of an active solar heating system]]\n\nMost autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are [[trombe wall]]s and other technologies as [[Steve Baer|skylights]].\n\n[[passive solar building design|Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.\n\nThe basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.\n\nA recent, somewhat experimental [[solar heating]] system \"[[Annualized geo solar]] heating\" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter.<ref name=\"Stephens\">Stephens, Don. September 2005. [http://www.greenershelter.com/TokyoPaper.pdf \"'Annualized Geo-Solar Heating' as a Sustainable Residential-scale Solution for Temperate Climates iwht Less than Ideal Daily Heating Season Solar Availability.\"] (\"Requested Paper for the Global Sustainable Building Conference 2005, Tokyo, Japan\"). Greenershelter.org website. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.</ref> It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with {{nowrap|6 m}} skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.\n\nIn annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], for example, [[straw-bale construction]]. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.\n\nA more modest \"daily solar\" design is very practical.  For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the [[passive house|Passivhaus]] building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]]. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.\n\nIn all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small [[heat pump]], which also provides [[air conditioning]], or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the [[water heater]].  Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.\n\n[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} in North Dakota to {{convert|26|C|F|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"Stephens\"/> in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.\n\nRounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.\n\nAn increasing number of commercial buildings use a [[combined cycle]] with [[cogeneration]] to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas [[reciprocating engine]], [[gas turbine]] or [[stirling engine|stirling]] [[electric generator]].<ref>[http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf Capstone Microturbine White-Paper (PDF) Retrieved on 2007-12-28.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813123637/http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf |date=August 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHouses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a [[wood stove]], or heat and power from [[diesel fuel]] or [[bottled gas]], regardless of their other heating mechanisms.\n\nElectric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.\n\n===Water heating===\n\n{{Further|Solar hot water}}\n\n[[Hot water heat recycling]] units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water.  They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.\n\nCurrent practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a [[water heater#Tankless heaters|thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater]], so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.\n\n[[Solar water heater]]s can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.\n\nThe basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are [[vacuum]]- insulated, acting something like large [[thermos]] bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] systems produce hot water from [[waste heat]].  They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.\n\nHeat recycling, [[cogeneration]] and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used.  Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.\nSome authorities advocate replacing [[bottled gas]] or [[natural gas]] with [[biogas]]. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site.  The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough [[methane]] for anything more than small amounts of cooking.\n\n===Cooling===\n\nAnnualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend {{convert|6|m|ft}} from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.\n\nLess dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.\n\nAnother trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a [[whole-house fan]] and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.\n\nIf a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the \"dome effect.\"  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as {{nowrap|8 \u00b0C}} ({{nowrap|15 \u00b0F}}) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a [[grain silo]], and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.\n\nRefrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an \"[[absorptive refrigeration|absorptive chiller]]\". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.\n\nCogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an [[absorptive chiller]].\n\nA truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's [[diesel exhaust]] was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic [[ammonia]] gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.\n\nA similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (28&nbsp;\u00b0C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.\n\nIf enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].\n\n===Food production===\n\nFood production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.<ref name=\"publications\">[http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html Publications list of the New Alchemy Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217004825/http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html |date=February 17, 2010 }}.

With this connection, Anubis became the patron god of embalmers; during the rites of mummification, illustrations from the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' often show a wolf-mask-wearing priest supporting the upright mummy.\n\n===Guide of souls===\nBy the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|late pharaonic era]] (664\u2013332 BC), Anubis was often depicted as guiding individuals across the threshold from the world of the living to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife|afterlife]].{{sfnm|Kinsley|1989|1p=178|Riggs|2005|2p=166 (\"The motif of Anubis, or less frequently Hathor, leading the deceased to the afterlife was well-established in Egyptian art and thought by the end of the pharaonic era.\")}} Though a similar role was sometimes performed by the cow-headed [[Hathor]], Anubis was more commonly chosen to fulfill that function.{{sfn|Riggs|2005|pp=127 and 166}} Greek writers from the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]] of Egyptian history designated that role as that of \"[[psychopomp]]\", a Greek term meaning \"guide of souls\" that they used to refer to their own god [[Hermes]], who also played that role in [[ancient Greek religion|Greek religion]].{{sfn|Riggs|2005|p=166}} [[Funerary art#Ancient Egypt and Nubia|Funerary art]] from that period represents Anubis guiding either men or women dressed in Greek clothes into the presence of Osiris, who by then had long replaced Anubis as ruler of the underworld.{{sfn|Riggs|2005|pp=127\u201328 and 166\u201367}}\n\n===Weighing of the heart===\n[[File:BD Hunefer cropped 1.jpg|thumb|The \"weighing of the heart,\" from the book of the dead of [[Hunefer]].

From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the [[University of London]], [[Institute of Psychiatry]] with [[Hans Eysenck]].\n\nUpon returning to the [[United States]], he became a researcher and professor at the [[University of California]], Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of [[culture]], development, and genetics on intelligence and learning. He received [[tenure]] at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first [[sabbatical]] in 1964. He concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.\n\nJensen had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a [[Conducting|conductor]] himself. At 14, he conducted a [[Band (music)|band]] that won a nationwide [[competition|contest]] held in [[San Francisco]]. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a [[seminar]] given by [[Nikolai Sokoloff]]. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to [[New York City|New York]], mainly to be near the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]]. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of [[Gandhi]], producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in [[San Diego]] he spent time working as a [[social worker]] with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.\n\n==IQ and academic achievement==\nJensen's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. ''Level I'', or [[associative learning]], may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills. ''Level II'', or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.\n\nLater, Jensen was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|general factor of intelligence]], a concept which was essentially synonymous with his ''Level II'' conceptual learning. The general factor, or ''g'', is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.\n\nJensen claimed, on the basis of his research, that [[Heritability of IQ|general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait]], determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.\n\nJensen's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', was titled \"[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]\" It concluded, among other things, that [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]] programs designed to boost [[African-American]] [[IQ]] scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.<ref name=\"High\">{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p652y1977-78.pdf |title=High Impact Science and the Case of Arthur Jensen |format=PDF |date=9 October 1978 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe work became one of the most cited papers in the [[history]] of [[psychological testing]] and [[Psychometrics|intelligence research]], although a large number of citations consisted of rebuttals of Jensen's work, or references to it as an example of a controversial paper.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Wendy |title=Developmental Psychology: Revisiting the Classic Studies |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=Alan M. |editor2-last=Quinn |editor2-first=Paul C. |chapter=How Much Can We Boost IQ?

Jensen's car tires were slashed, the university police provided him with plain-clothes bodyguards, and he and his family received threats that were considered so realistic by the police that they temporarily left their house. Jensen was spat on and was prevented from delivering lectures by disruptive protests. The editorial board of the ''Harvard Educational Review'' for a time refused to let him have reprints of his article, and said that they had not solicited the section on racial differences; Jensen later provided correspondence in which the board had requested he do so.<ref name=\"scarr\">{{cite journal|title=On Arthur Jensen's integrity|journal=Intelligence|date=1 January 1998|volume=26|issue=3|pages=227\u2013232|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(99)80005-1|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289699800051|language=en|issn=0160-2896|last1=Scarr|first1=Sandra}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nyborg|first1=Helmuth|title=The Scientific Study of General Intelligence: Tribute to Arthur Jensen|date=2003|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080516660|pages=458\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPNFXBnwuNoC&pg=PA458|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Information|first1=Reed Business|title=New Scientist|date=1972|publisher=Reed Business Information|pages=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYqAz8FJbzwC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jensen1.jpg|right|thumb|Arthur Jensen winning the 2003 [[Kistler Prize]].]] -->\nIn a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:\n\n<blockquote>\n...nowhere have I \"claimed\" an \"innate deficiency\" of intelligence in blacks.

He did this because \"I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate.\" What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2002/10/01/race_and_iq?page=full |title=Race and IQ|author=Thomas Sowell|date=October 1, 2002|accessdate=14 November 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Jensen's 1998 ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ. In Chapter 12: Population Differences in ''g'': Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes:\n<blockquote>\nThe relationship of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., [[Spearman's hypothesis]]) suggests that the average white-black difference in ''g'' has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or [[Platonism|Platonic]], categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly ''g''.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on \"[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],<ref name=\"gottfredson\">Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994).

Gould writes that Jensen misapplies the concept of \"[[heritability]]\", which is defined as a measure of the [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of a trait due to inheritance ''within'' a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157). According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences ''between'' populations{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Gould also disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, ''g'', or \"the [[general factor]] common to a large number of cognitive abilities\" which can be measured along a unilinear scale.\n\nThis is a claim most closely identified with [[Charles Spearman]]. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of [[L. L. Thurstone]] to ultimately support this claim; Gould, however, argues that Thurstone's [[factor analysis]] of intelligence revealed ''g'' to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314). Gould criticizes Jensen's sources including his use of [[Catharine Cox]]'s 1926 ''Genetic Studies of Genius'', which examines [[historiometric]]ally the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths (Gould 1981: 153-154).\n\nIn 1980 Jensen published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled ''[[Bias in Mental Testing]]''. Reviewing this book, psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination, saying that he found many of Jensen's opponents to be more politically-biased than Jensen was.<ref>K. Kaye, ''The Sciences'', January 1981, pp. 26-28.</ref>\n\n==Jensen's response and criticism==\nIn Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled ''The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons'',<ref>[http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327023519/http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils |date=March 27, 2006 }}</ref> Jensen begins his paper with this observation:\n\n<blockquote>\nStephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, \"Biology as a Social Weapon.\" Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book. Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of Gould when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist [[Edward O. Wilson]], a leader in the development of sociobiology...\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile Jensen recognizes the validity of some of Gould's claims, in many places, he criticizes Gould's general approach:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth. In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.\n</blockquote>\n\nJensen adds that Gould made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present Jensen's own positions:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn his references to my own work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.\n</blockquote>\n\nJensen expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner, [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nNow and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, ''Race, IQ and Jensen'' (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jensen |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Jensen |editor1-last=Modgil |editor1-first=Sohan |editor2-last=Modgil |editor2-first=Celia |title=Arthur Jensen: Consensus and Controversy |date=1987 |publisher=Falmer Press |location=London |series=Falmer international master-minds challenged; 4 |isbn=978-1-85000-093-8 |page=379 |chapter=Chapter 21: Differential Psychology: Towards Consensus |ref=harv}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n{{See also|Race and intelligence|Science wars}}\n\n==Books==\n\n=== Bias in Mental Testing ===\n''[[Bias in Mental Testing]]'' (1980) is a book examining the question of test bias in commonly used [[standardized test]]s.

Jensen concluded that \"the currently most widely used standardized tests of mental ability -- IQ, scholastic aptitude, and achievement tests -- are, by and large, not biased against any of the native-born English-speaking minority groups on which the amount of research evidence is sufficient for an objective determination of bias, if the tests were in fact biased. For most nonverbal standardized tests, this generalization is not limited to English-speaking minorities.\" (p. ix).

The plot displays many classic elements of [[farce]], including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of [[mistaken identity]] (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by [[vaudeville]] comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\n\nThe musical's original 1962 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run won several [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). ''A Funny Thing'' has enjoyed several Broadway and [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals and was made into a successful [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film]] starring the original lead of the stage musical, [[Zero Mostel]].\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway===\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 8, 1962, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], and then transferred to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.\n\nThe show's creators originally wanted [[Phil Silvers]] in the lead role of [[Pseudolus]], but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being \"[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]] in a toga\". (Silvers eventually played the role \u2014 wearing his glasses \u2014 in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) [[Milton Berle]] also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.<ref name=green>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&lpg=PA198 \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum\"] ''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996),  Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p. 198</ref>\n\nDuring the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. [[Jerome Robbins]] was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace \"Love Is in the Air\" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song \"Comedy Tonight\" for this new opening.<ref name=green /> From that point on, the show was a success.\n\nIt was directed by [[George Abbott]] and produced by [[Hal Prince]], with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by [[Tony Walton]]. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by [[Jean Rosenthal]]. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including [[Jack Gilford]] (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[John Carradine]], [[Ruth Kobart]], and [[Raymond Walburn]]. The young lovers were played by Brian Davies and Preshy Marker. [[Karen Black]], originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.\n\nThe show won several [[Tony Award]]s: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.\n\n===London===\nThe show was presented twice in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]] and the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] respectively,<ref>[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/london_shows_chronology/1963.htm \"Listing, 1963 production\"] Guidetomusicaltheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/piccadilly111.html \"Listing, 1986 production\"] Thisistheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref> and featured [[Frankie Howerd]] starring as Pseudolus, [[Kenneth Connor]] as Hysterium, [['Monsewer' Eddie Gray]] as [[Senex]], [[Jon Pertwee]] as Marcus Lycus, and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus.\n\nIn 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the [[Royal National Theatre]], starring [[Desmond Barrit]] as Pseudolus, [[Philip Quast]] as Miles Gloriosus, [[Hamish McColl]] as Hysterium and [[Isla Blair]] as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production).<ref>Inverne, James.

In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\n\nOne day, Senex and Domina go on a trip and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin).  Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior [[Miles Gloriosus]], who is expected to claim her very soon.  Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a [[Yersinia pestis|plague]] from [[Crete]], which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan.\" To appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it?\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare's sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\n\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\n\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\n\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low.\" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\n\nFinally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children.  A happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''[[Pseudolus]]''': A Roman slave, owned by Hero, who seeks to win freedom by helping Hero win the heart of Philia.  The name ''Pseudolus''  means \"Faker\". While originally written as a male role, it has been performed by female actors as well.\n*'''Hero''': Young son of Senex who falls in love with the virgin, Philia.\n*'''Philia''': (Greek for \"love\") A virgin in the house of Marcus Lycus, and Hero's love interest. Her name is also a homophone of the Latin word \"Filia,\" which means daughter. This foreshadows her status as the daughter of Erronius.\n* '''Hysterium''': (Latin for \"Hysterical\", or \"Anxious\", the suffix \"-um\" makes the name neuter, and the character's gender is often mistaken throughout the piece) The chief slave in the house of Senex.\n*'''[[Senex]]''': (Latin for \"old man\") A henpecked, sardonic [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senator]] living in a less fashionable suburb of Rome.\n*'''Domina''': (Latin for \"mistress\") The wife of Senex. A manipulative, shrewish woman who is loathed by even her husband.\n*'''Marcus Lycus''': A purveyor of courtesans, who operates from the house to the left of Senex. (Name based on Lycus, the prostitute in [[Plautus]]'s ''Poenulus''.)\n*'''[[Miles Gloriosus]]''': (Latin for \"boastful soldier,\" the archetype of the braggart soldier in Roman comedies) A captain in the Roman army to whom Marcus Lycus has promised Philia.\n*'''Erronius''': (Latin for \"wandering\") Senex's elderly neighbor in the house to the right. He has spent the past twenty years searching for his two children, kidnapped in infancy by pirates.\n*'''Gymnasia''': (Greek for \"Athletic\", with the connotation of nakedness) A courtesan from the house of Lycus with whom Pseudolus falls in love.\n*'''Tintinabula''': (Latin for \"Bells\") A jingling, bell-wearing courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Vibrata''': (Latin for \"Vibrant\") A wild, vibrant courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Geminae''': (Latin for \"Twins\") Twin courtesans in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Panacea''': (Greek for \"Cure All\") A courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Proteans''': Choristers who play multiple roles (slaves, citizens, soldiers, and eunuchs). They accompany Pseudolus in \"Comedy Tonight\". On Broadway, three people played all of these roles.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

In addition, the population suffered as their customary lifestyles were disrupted. Russian traders and later Europeans married Aleut women and had families with them.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n==History==\n\n===After Russian contact=== \n\n[[File:Tikhanov - Aleut in Festival Dress in Alaska (1818).png|thumb|left|''Aleut in Festival Dress in Alaska'', watercolor by [[Mikhail Tikhanov]], 1818]]\nAfter the arrival of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[missionary|missionaries]] in the late 18th century, many Aleuts became [[Christianity|Christian]]. Of the numerous Russian Orthodox congregations in Alaska, most are majority Alaska Native in ethnicity. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in [[North America]] was Saint [[Peter the Aleut]].\n`\n\n====Recorded Uprising against the Russians====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nIn the 18th century, [[Russia]] ''[[promyshlenniki]]'' traders established settlements on the islands. There was high demand for the furs that the Aleut provided from hunting. In May 1784, local Aleut revolted on Amchitka against the Russian traders. (The Russians had a small trading post there.) According to what Aleut people said, in an account recorded by Japanese castaways and published in 2004, otters were decreasing year by year. The Russians paid the Aleut less and less in goods in return for the furs they made. The Japanese learned that the Aleut felt the situation was at crisis. The leading Aleuts negotiated with the Russians, saying they had failed to deliver enough supplies in return for furs. Nezimov, leader of the Russians, ordered two of his men, Stephanov (\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30ce ''Suteppano'') and Kazhimov (\u30ab\u30b8\u30e2\u30d5 ''Kazimofu'') to kill his mistress Oniishin (\u30aa\u30cb\u30a4\u30b7\u30f3 ''Oniishin''), who was the Aleut chief's daughter, because he doubted that Oniishin had tried to dissuade her father and other leaders from pushing for more goods.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThat evening, hundreds of Aleut men gathered on a mountain and marched to the Russians' houses. When five Russians opened fire, the Aleuts ran away. The next day the Aleut returned, but escaped again when the Russians started firing. While the men attempted another attack the next day, they yelled and moved more quickly towards the house. As Russians opened fire, they started to run away again. After they ran, the Russians noticed that all the men had left the village. The Russians took around 40 women and children hostage, forcing the Aleut to surrender. The Russians killed four Aleut leaders.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAfter the four leaders had been killed, the Aleut began to move from Amchitka to neighboring islands. Nezimov, leader of the Russian group, was jailed after the whole incident was reported to Russian officials.<ref name=\"kodayu\">Yamashita, Tsuneo. ''Daikokuya Kodayu''(Japanese), 2004.

The locally resident [[Nicole\u00f1o|Nicole\u00f1o nation]] sought a payment from the Aleut hunters for the large number of otters being killed in the area. Disagreement arose, turning violent; in the ensuing battle, the Aleut killed nearly all the Nicole\u00f1o men. Together with high fatalities from European diseases, the Nicole\u00f1os suffered so much from the loss of their men that by 1853, only one living Nicole\u00f1a person remained. (See [[Juana Maria]], ''The Lone Woman of San Nicolas'', also known as Karana)\n\n===Internment during World War II===\nIn 1942, during [[World War II]], Japanese forces occupied [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] Islands in the western Aleutians. They later transported captive Attu Islanders to [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where they were held as [[prisoners of war]] in harsh conditions. The United States government evacuated hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs during WWII, placing them in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died of [[measles]], [[influenza]] and other infectious diseases which spread quickly in the overcrowded dormitories. In total, about 75 died in American internment and 19 as a result of Japanese occupation.<ref>Ryan Madden, \"'The Government's Industry': Alaska Natives and Pribilof Sealing during World War II.\" ''Pacific Northwest Quarterly'' 91.4 (2000): 202-209.

Foreign diseases, harsh treatment and disruption of aboriginal society soon reduced the population to less than one-tenth this number. The 1910 [[Census]] count showed 1,491 Aleuts. In the 2000 Census, 11,941 people identified as being Aleut; nearly 17,000 said Aleuts were among their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |title=The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2000 Table 5 |url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-15.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=census.gov}}</ref> Alaskans generally recognize that [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] during the Russian occupation, while the colonists were limited in number, resulted in few full-blooded Aleuts remaining today. Full-blooded Aleuts still exist and are growing in number, and there are also people who may be part Russian or other descent but solely identify as Aleut.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n===Housing===\nThe Aleut constructed partially underground houses called ''[[barabara]]''.  According to [[Lillie McGarvey]], a 20th-century Aleut leader, ''barabaras'' keep \"occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds common to the area\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Aleuts traditionally built houses by digging an oblong square pit in the ground, usually {{convert|50|by|20|ft|m}} or smaller. The pit was then covered by a roof framed with driftwood, thatched with grass, then covered with earth for insulation.<ref>Cook 377</ref> Inside trenches were dug along the sides, with mats placed on top to keep them clean. The bedrooms were at the back of the lodge, opposite the entrance. Several families would stay in one house, with their own designated areas. Rather than fireplaces or bonfires in the middle, lanterns were hung in the house.\n\n===Subsistence===\nThe Aleut survived by hunting and gathering. They fished for salmon, crabs, shellfish, and cod, as well as harvesting sea mammals such as seal, walrus, and whales. They processed fish and sea mammals in a variety of ways: dried, smoked, or roasted. Caribou, musk oxen, deer, moose, whale, and other types of game were eaten roasted or preserved for later use. They dried berries. They were also processed as ''alutiqqutigaq'', a mixture of berries, fat, and fish. The boiled skin and blubber of a whale is a delicacy, as is that of walrus.\n\nToday, many Aleut continue to eat customary and locally sourced foods but also buy processed foods from [[Outside (Alaska)|Outside]], which is expensive in Alaska.\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n[[File:Hunting hat, Aleut - Ethol\u00e9n collection, Museum of Cultures (Helsinki) - DSC04917.JPG|thumb|Men's ''chagudax'', or bentwood hunting visor, Arvid Adolf Ethol\u00e9n collection, Museum of Cultures, Helsinki, Finland]]\n[[File:Basket and Lid, early 20th century, 36.498a-b.jpg|thumbnail|Unknown Aleut artist, [[sea-lyme grass]] basket and lid embellished with wool embroidery, early 20th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]] ]]\nCustomary arts of the Aleut include weapon-making, building of ''[[baidarka]]s'' (special hunting boats), [[weaving]], figurines, clothing, carving, and mask making. Men as well as women often carved ivory and wood. 19th-century craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with [[sea lion]] [[Vibrissae|whiskers]], feathers, and [[walrus ivory]]. [[Andrew Gronholdt]] of the Shumagin Islands has played a vital role in reviving the ancient art of building the ''chagudax'' or bentwood hunting visors.<ref>Black, Lydia T. ''Aleut Art: Unangam Aguqaadangin''. Anchorage, Alaska: Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, 2005</ref>\n\nAleut women sewed finely stitched, waterproof [[Anorak|parkas]] from [[Seal (mammal)|seal]] gut and wove fine baskets from [[sea-lyme grass]] (''[[Elymus mollis]]''). Some Aleut women continue weave ryegrass baskets. Aleut arts are practiced and taught throughout the state of Alaska. As many Aleut have moved out of the islands to other parts of the state, they have taken with them the knowledge of their arts. They have also adopted new materials and methods for their art, including [[serigraphy]], [[video art]], and [[installation art]].\n\nAleut carving, distinct in each region, has attracted traders for centuries, including early Europeans and other Alaska Natives. Historically, carving was a male art and leadership attribute. In today's world it is an art of both sexes. Most commonly the carvings of walrus ivory and driftwood originated as part of making hunting weapons. Sculptural carvings depict local animals, such as seals and whales. Aleut sculptors also have carved human figures.<ref name=AAUA>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Lydia|title=Aleut Art Unangam Aguqaadangin|year=2003|publisher=Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association|location=Anchorage, AK}}</ref>\n\nThe Aleut also carve walrus ivory for other uses, such as jewelry and sewing needles. Jewelry is made with designs specific to the region of each people. Each [[clan]] would have a specific style to signify their origin. Jewelry ornaments were made for piercing lips (labrum), nose, and ears, as well as for necklaces. Each woman had her own sewing needles, which she made, and that often had detailed end of animal heads.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/>\n\nThe main Aleut method of [[basketry]] was false embroidery (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, to obtain a plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/> Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is ''qiigam aygaaxsii''. One Aleut leader recognized by the State of Alaska for her work in teaching and reviving Aleut basketry was [[Anfesia Shapsnikoff]]. Her life and accomplishments are portrayed in the book ''Moments Rightly Placed''(1998).<ref>Hudson, 1998</ref>\n\nMasks were created to portray figures of their myths and oral history. The [[Atka people]] believed that another people lived in their land before them. They portrayed such ancients in their masks, which show anthropomorphic creatures named in their language. Knut Bergsland says their word means \"like those found in caves.\" Masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other natural products. Feathers were inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. These masks were used in ceremonies ranging from dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/>\n\n===Tattoos and piercings===\nThe tattoos and piercings of the Aleut people demonstrated accomplishments as well as their religious views. They believed their body art would please the spirits of the animals and make any evil go away. The body orifices were believed to be pathways for the entry of evil entities. By piercing their orifices: the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities, ''khoughkh'', from entering their bodies (Osborn, 52). Body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority.\n\nBefore the 19th century, piercings and tattoos were very common among the Aleut people, especially among women. Piercings, such as the nose pin, were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth.  The ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagle's feather shaft.  From time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins.\n\nPiercing ears was also very common.  The Aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. Materials associated with birds were important, as birds were considered to defend animals in the spirit world.  A male would wear sea lion whiskers in his ears as a trophy of his expertise as a hunter. Worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, Aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones. The individual with the most piercings held the highest respect.\n\nTattooing for women began when they reached physical maturity, after menstruation, at about age 20. Historically, men received their first tattoo after killing their first animal, an important rite of passage. Sometimes tattoos signaled social class. For example, the daughter of a wealthy, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father. They would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose.\n\nThe Russians arrived in the Aleutian Islands in 1786 and were maintained modest trading settlements and religious missions through the mid-19th century.\n\n===Aleut clothing===\n[[File:Aleut sax.jpg|thumb|Replica of the ''sax'', an Aleut coat made from bird skins and sea otter fur]]\n[[File:Parka (Kamleika) Aleutian Islands.JPG|thumb|A [[Kamleika]], or seal skin coat]]\n\nThe Aleut people developed in one of the harshest climates in the world, and learned to create and protect warmth. Both men and women wore parkas that extended below the knees. The women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter, and the men wore bird skin parkas, the feathers turned in or out depending on the weather. When the men were hunting on the water, they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, or whales. Parkas had a hood that could be cinched, as could the wrist openings, so water could not get in. Men wore breeches made from the esophageal skin of seals.  Children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps.<ref>''Enthnohistory'': Gross & Khera pg. 33, 34</ref> They called these parkas ''kameikas,'' meaning raingear in the English language.(Aleut Corp. Web.).\n\nSea-lions, harbor seals, and the sea otters are the most abundant marine mammals.  The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them.  The women undertook the sewing (''Enthnohistory:'' Gross & Khera pg. 32). Preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. The prepared intestines were turned inside out. A bone knife was used to remove the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. The gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. It was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles (Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 70). On some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. They would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use.  They caught [[puffins]], Lunda Cirrhata, Fratercula Corniculata, Guillemots, and Cephus & Murres.<ref>Lucien M. Turner, pg. 70</ref>\n\nIt took 40 skins of tufted puffin and 60 skins of horned puffin to make one parka. A woman would need a year for all the labor to make one parka. Each lasted two years with proper care. All parkas were decorated with bird feathers, beard bristles of seal and sea-lion, beaks of sea parrots, bird claws, sea otter fur, dyed leather, and caribou hair sewn in the seams. (Gross & Khera, pg. 34).\n\nWomen made needles from the wingbones of seabirds. They made thread from the sinews of different animals and fish guts.<ref>Gross & Khera pg. 33</ref> A thin strip of seal intestine could also be used, twisted to form a thread. The women grew their thumbnail extra long and sharpened it. They could split threads to make them as fine as a hair.<ref>Turner, pg. 71.</ref> They used vermilion paint, hematite, the ink bag of the octopus, and the root of a kind of grass or vine to color the threads.<ref>Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 71</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nRussian travelers making early contact with the Aleut mention [[storytelling|traditional tales]] of [[two-spirit]]s or [[third gender|third]] and [[fourth gender]] people, known as ''ayagigux\u0302'' (male-bodied, <!--saying e.g. \"male-assigned\", the preferred terminology for similar cases, would raise the question of \"assigned by whom? Europeans\"-->  \"man transformed into a woman\") and ''tayagigux\u0302'' (female-bodied, \"woman transformed into a man\"), but it is unclear whether these tales are about historical individuals or spirits.<ref name=\"MurrayPH\">Stephen O. Murray, ''Pacific Homosexualities'' (2002) p.206</ref>\n\n===Hunting technologies===\n\n====Boats====\n{{Main|Aleutian kayak}}\n[[File:Choris, Saint Paul.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of an Aleut paddling a baidarka, with an anchored Russian ship in the background, near [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]], by Louis Choris, 1817]]\nThe interior regions of the rough, mountainous Aleutian Islands provided little in terms of natural resources for the Aleutian people. They collected stones for weapons, tools, stoves or lamps. They collected and dried grasses for their woven baskets. For everything else, the Aleuts had learned to use the fish and mammals they caught and processed to satisfy their needs.<ref name=AHC>{{cite book|last=Antonson|first=Joan|title=Alaska's Heritage|year=1984|publisher=The Alaska Historical Commission|location=Anchorage|pages=85\u201395}}</ref>\n\nIn order to hunt sea mammals and to travel between islands, the Aleuts became experts of sailing and navigation. While hunting, they used small watercraft called ''[[Aleutian kayak|baidarkas]].'' For regular travel, they used their large baidaras.<ref name=\"AHC\"/> \n[[File:Rowing Baidara St George Is line1700.jpg|thumb|Men rowing a baidara (large skin boat)]]\n\nThe baidara was a large, open, walrus-skin-covered boat. Aleut families used it when traveling among the islands. It was also used to transport goods for trade, and warriors took them to battle.<ref name=CCP>{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Bill|title=Canoes and Kayaks of Western America|year=1960|publisher=Copper Canoe Press|location=Seattle|pages=11\u201320}}</ref>\n\nThe baidarka (small skin boat) was a small boat covered in sea lion skin. It was developed and used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability.  The Aleut baidarka resembles that of a [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]] [[kayak]], but it is hydrodynamically sleeker and faster. They made the baidarka for one or two persons only. The deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. Most one-man baidarkas were about {{convert|16|ft|m}} feet long and {{convert|20|in|cm}} wide, whereas a two-man was on average about {{convert|20|ft|m}} long and {{convert|24|in|cm}} wide. It was from the baidarka that Aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea.<ref name=\"CCP\"/>\n\n====Weapons====\nThe Aleuts hunted small sea mammals with barbed darts and harpoons slung from throwing boards. These boards gave precision as well as some extra distance to these weapons.<ref name=AIA>{{cite book|last=Jochelson|first=Waldemar|title=Archaeological Investigations In The Aleutian Islands|year=1925|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City|page=145}}</ref>\n\nHarpoons were also called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the foreshaft and the head was able to detach from the harpoon when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleuts used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe simple Aleut harpoon consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. The barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe compound harpoon was the most prevalent weapon of the Aleut people. Also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. This harpoon separated into four parts. The longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. The shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. Connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. This tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. The upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. Once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animal's body so that it could not get away from the hunter.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe throwing lance may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. A lance was a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a man's chest to his back. The lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. The bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\n===Burial practices===\nThey buried their dead ancestors near the village.\n[[Archeologists]] have found many different types of burials, dating from a variety of periods, in the Aleutian Islands. The Aleut developed a style of burials that were accommodated to local conditions, and honored the dead. They have had four main types of burials: ''umqan'', cave, above-ground sarcophagi, and burials connected to communal houses.\n\nUmqan burials are the most widely known type of mortuary practice found in the Aleutian Islands. The people created burial mounds, that tend to be located on the edge of a bluff.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\">Veltre 2001</ref> They placed stone and earth over the mound to protect and mark it.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> Such mounds were first excavated by archeologists in 1972 on Southwestern Unmak Island, and dated to the early contact period.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> Researchers have found a prevalence of these umqan burials, and concluded it is a regional mortuary practice.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> It may be considered a pan-Aleutian mortuary practice.\n\nCave burials have been found throughout the Eastern Aleutian Islands. The human remains are buried in shallow graves at the rear of the cave.<ref>West et al. 2003</ref> These caves tend to be located next to [[middens]] and near villages.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\">Nelson and Barnett 1955</ref> Some [[grave goods]] have been found in the caves associated with such burials. For example, a deconstructed boat was found in a burial cave on Kanaga Island.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/> There were no other major finds of grave goods in the vicinity.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/>\n\nThroughout the Aleutian Islands, gravesites have been found that are above-ground [[sarcophagi]]. These sarcophagi are left exposed, with no attempt to bury the dead in the ground.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\">Corbett 2001</ref> These burials tend to be isolated and limited to the remains of adult males, which may indicate a specific ritual practice.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> In the Near Islands, isolated graves have also been found with the remains, and not just the sarcophagus, left exposed on the surface.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> This way of erecting sarcophagi above ground is not as common as umqan and cave burials, but it is still widespread.\n\nAnother type of practice has been to bury remains in areas next to the communal houses of the settlement.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> Human remains are abundant in such sites. They indicate a pattern of burying the dead within the main activity areas of the settlement. These burials consist of small pits adjacent to the houses and scattered around them.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> In these instances, mass graves are common for women and children.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> This type of mortuary practice has been mainly found in the Near Islands.\n\nIn addition to these four main types, other kinds of burials have been found in the Aleutian Islands. These more isolated examples include [[mummification]], private burial houses, abandoned houses, etc.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> To date, such examples are not considered to be part of a larger, unifying cultural practice. The findings discussed represent only the sites that have been excavated.\n\nThe variety of mortuary practices mostly did not included the ritual of including extensive grave goods, as has been found in other cultures. The remains so far have been mainly found with other human and faunal remains.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> The addition of objects to \"accompany\" the dead is rare.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/> Archaeologists have been trying to dissect the absence of grave goods, but their findings have been ambiguous and do not really help the academic community to understand these practices more.\n\nNot much information is known about the ritual parts of burying the dead. Archeologists and anthropologists have not found much evidence related to burial rituals.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> This lack of ritual evidence could hint at either no ritualized ceremony, or one that has not yet been revealed in the archaeological record. As a result, archaeologists cannot decipher the context to understand exactly why a certain type of burial was used in particular cases.\n\n==Notable Aleut==\n* [[John Hoover (artist)|John Hoover]] (1919\u20132011), sculptor\n* [[Carl E.

According to the usual Adoptionist formulations, it was at his moment of baptism that Jesus moved into this special relationship or metaphorical \u201csonship\u201d with God \u2013 not at his conception or virgin birth. [...] the oldest Greek manuscripts of and quotations from ''Luke'' render the key verse in question as follows. \"Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove.

The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] that \u2013 in respect to his human nature \u2013 Christ was ''adoptive'' [[Son of God]]. Another leading advocate of this Christology was [[Felix of Urgel]]. In Spain, adoptionism was opposed by [[Beatus of Liebana]], and in the [[Carolingian]] territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by [[Pope Hadrian I]], [[Alcuin of York]], [[Agobard]], and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt (794).\n\nDespite the shared name of \"adoptionism\" the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term ''adoptivus'' of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son \"emptied himself\" of divinity and \"took the form of a servant\" (Philippians 2:7), Christ's human nature was \"adopted\" as divine.<ref>James Ginther, ''Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology'', (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), 3.</ref>\n\nHistorically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists' Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of \u201c[[Nestorianism|Nestorian]]\u201d Christology.<ref>For an example of this characterization, see Adolph Harnack, \u2018\u2019History of Dogma\u2019\u2019, vol. 5, trans. Neil Buchanan, (New York: Dover, 1961), 280.</ref> John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his study, ''The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785\u2013820''.<ref>John C. Cavadini, \u2018\u2019The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785\u2013820\u2019\u2019, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 4\u20135.</ref>\n\n=== Scholastic Neo-adoptionism ===\nA third wave was the revived form (\"Neo-adoptionism\") of [[Peter Abelard]] in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified Adoptionist tenets emerged from some theologians in the 14th century. [[Duns Scotus]] (1300) and [[Durandus of Saint-Pour\u00e7ain]] (1320) admit the term ''Filius adoptivus'' in a qualified sense. In more recent times the Jesuit [[Gabriel V\u00e1squez]], and the Lutheran divines [[Georgius Calixtus]] and [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch]], have defended adoptionism as essentially orthodox.\n\n=== Modern adoptionist groups ===\nA form of adoptionism surfaced in [[Unitarianism]] during the 18th century as [[denial of the virgin birth of Jesus|denial of the virgin birth]] became increasingly common, led by the views of [[Joseph Priestley]] and others. \n\nA similar form of adoptionism was expressed in the writings of [[James Strang]], a [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] leader who founded the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]] after the [[death of Joseph Smith]] in 1844.  In his [[Book of the Law of the Lord]], a purported work of ancient scripture found and translated by Strang, he offers an essay entitled \"Note on the Sacrifice of Christ\" in which he explains his unique (for Mormonism as a whole) doctrines on the subject.  Jesus Christ, said Strang, was the natural-born son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being begotten by the Father or the [[Holy Spirit]]) to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role.<ref>Book of the Law, pp. 157-58, note 9.</ref>  Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence \"adopted\" as God's son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>Book of the Law, pp. 165-66.</ref>  After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]].<ref>Book of the law, pp. 155-58.</ref>\n\n== Alleged scriptural basis ==\n\nAdoptionism in Christian scripture has been the subject of considerable speculation and controversy. Some scholars such as [[Bart D. Ehrman]] and [[Daniel Boyarin]] see Adoptionist concepts in the [[Gospel of Mark]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|title=The Orthodox Corruption of the Scripture|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=48\u201349}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Boyarin|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Boyarin|title=The Jewish Gospels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd48nOco0-wC&pg=PT56|date=20 March 2012|publisher=New Press|isbn=978-1-59558-711-4|page=56|quote=[W]e can still observe within the Gospel (especially in Mark, which has no miraculous birth story, and also even in Paul) the remnants of a version of Christology in which Jesus was born a man but became God at his baptism.

The letters of [[Paul the Apostle]], for example, do not mention a [[virgin birth of Christ]]. Paul describes Jesus as \"born of a woman, born under the [[Law of Moses|law]]\" and \"as to his [[human nature]] was a descendant of David\" in the [[Epistle to the Galatians]] and the [[Epistle to the Romans]].

The reception of a proton by a base produces its ''[[conjugate acid]]'', which is the base with a hydrogen ion added.\n\nUnlike the previous definitions, the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition does not refer to the formation of salt and solvent, but instead to the formation of ''conjugate acids'' and ''conjugate bases'', produced by the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base.<ref name=\"miessler_165\"/><ref name=\"miessler_167\"/> In this approach, acids and bases are fundamentally different in behavior from salts, which are seen as electrolytes, subject to the theories of [[Peter Debye|Debye]], [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]], and others. An acid and a base react not to produce a salt and a solvent, but to form a new acid and a new base. The concept of neutralization is thus absent.<ref name=review1940/> Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base behavior is formally independent of any solvent, making it more all-encompassing than the Arrhenius model. The calculation of [[pH]] under the Arrhenius model depended on alkalis (bases) dissolving in water ([[aqueous solution]]). The Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry model expanded what could be [[pH]] tested using insoluble and soluble solutions (gas, liquid, solid).\n\nThe general formula for acid\u2013base reactions according to the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition is:\n:HA + B \u2192 BH<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>\u2212</sup>\nwhere HA represents the acid, B represents the base, BH<sup>+</sup> represents the conjugate acid of B, and A<sup>\u2212</sup> represents the conjugate base of HA.\n\nFor example, a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry model for the dissociation of [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) in [[aqueous solution]] would be the following:\n:HCl + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe removal of H<sup>+</sup> from the HCl produces the [[chloride]] ion, Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, the conjugate base of the acid. The addition of H<sup>+</sup> to the H<sub>2</sub>O (acting as a base) forms the [[hydronium]] ion, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, the conjugate acid of the base.\n\nWater is [[amphoterism|amphoteric]]\u2014that is, it can act as both an acid and a base. The Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry model explains this, showing the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and [[hydroxide]] ions:\n:H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThis equation is demonstrated in the image below:\n[[File:Bronsted lowry 3d diagram.png|600px|center]]\n\nHere, one molecule of water acts as an acid, donating an H<sup>+</sup> and forming the conjugate base, OH<sup>\u2212</sup>, and a second molecule of water acts as a base, accepting the H<sup>+</sup> ion and forming the conjugate acid, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>.\n\nAs an example of water acting as an acid, consider an aqueous solution of [[pyridine]], C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N.\n:C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} [C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH]<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nIn this example, a water molecule is split into a hydrogen ion, which is donated to a pyridine molecule, and an hydroxide ion.\n\nIn the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry model, the solvent does not necessarily have to be water that is required by the [[Acid\u2013base reaction#Arrhenius definition|Arrhenius Acid-Base model]]. For example, consider what happens when [[acetic acid]], CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, dissolves in [[liquid ammonia]].\n:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|NH|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} + {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}}\n\nAn H<sup>+</sup> ion is removed from acetic acid, forming its conjugate base, the [[acetate]] ion, CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>\u2212</sup>. The addition of an H<sup>+</sup> ion to an ammonia molecule of the solvent creates its conjugate acid, the ammonium ion, {{chem|NH|4|+}}.\n\nThe Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry model calls hydrogen-containing substances (like HCl) acids. Thus, some substances, which many chemists considered to be acids, such as SO<sub>3</sub> or BCl<sub>3</sub>, are excluded from this classification due to lack of hydrogen. [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] wrote in 1938, \"To restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term [[oxidizing agent]] to substances containing [[oxygen]].\"<ref name=review1940/> Furthermore, KOH and KNH<sub>2</sub> are not considered Br\u00f8nsted bases, but rather salts containing the bases OH<sup>\u2212</sup> and {{chem|NH|2|\u2212}}.\n\n===Lewis definition===\n{{Further|Lewis acids and bases}}\nThe hydrogen requirement of Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry was removed by the Lewis definition of acid\u2013base reactions, devised by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1923,<ref name=\"lewis_1\">{{harvnb|Miessler|Tarr|1991|p=166}} \u2013 Table of discoveries attributes the date of publication/release for the Lewis theory as 1924.</ref> in the same year as Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938.<ref name=review1940/> Instead of defining acid\u2013base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a ''Lewis base'') to be a compound that can donate an ''[[electron pair]]'', and an acid (a ''Lewis acid'') to be a compound that can receive this electron pair.<ref name=\"lewis_2\">{{harvnb|Miessler|Tarr|1991|pp=170\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nFor example, [[boron trifluoride]], BF<sub>3</sub> is a typical Lewis acid. It can accept a pair of electrons as it has a vacancy in its [[octet rule|octet]]. The [[fluoride]] ion has a full octet and can donate a pair of electrons. Thus\n:BF<sub>3</sub> + F<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 {{chem|BF|4|\u2212}}\nis a typical Lewis acid, Lewis base reaction. All compounds of [[boron group|group 13]] elements with a formula AX<sub>3</sub> can behave as Lewis acids. Similarly, compounds of [[group 15]] elements with a formula DY<sub>3</sub>, such as [[amine]]s, NR<sub>3</sub>, and [[phosphine]]s, PR<sub>3</sub>, can behave as Lewis bases. Adducts between them have the formula X<sub>3</sub>A\u2190DY<sub>3</sub> with a [[dative covalent bond]], shown symbolically as \u2190, between the atoms A (acceptor) and D (donor). Compounds of [[group 16]] with a formula DX<sub>2</sub> may also act as Lewis bases; in this way, a compound like an [[ether]], R<sub>2</sub>O, or a [[thioether]], R<sub>2</sub>S, can act as a Lewis base. The Lewis definition is not limited to these examples. For instance, [[carbon monoxide]] acts as a Lewis base when it forms an adduct with boron trifluoride, of formula F<sub>3</sub>B\u2190CO.\n\nAdducts involving metal ions are referred to as co-ordination compounds; each ligand donates a pair of electrons to the metal ion.<ref name=\"lewis_2\"/> The reaction\n:[Ag(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> + 2NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O\ncan be seen as an acid\u2013base reaction in which a stronger base (ammonia) replaces a weaker one (water)\n\nThe Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definitions are consistent with each other since the reaction\n:H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>\u2212</sup> {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>O\nis an acid\u2013base reaction in both theories.\n\n===Solvent system definition===\nOne of the limitations of the Arrhenius definition is its reliance on water solutions. [[Edward Curtis Franklin]] studied the acid\u2013base reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to the water-based Arrhenius theory. [[Albert Fredrick Ottomar Germann|Albert F. O. Germann]], working with liquid [[phosgene]], {{chem|COCl|2}}, formulated the solvent-based theory in 1925, thereby generalizing the Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Germann |first=Albert F.

A solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvate ions and a decrease in the concentration of the solvonium ions is defined as a ''base''.\n\nThus, in liquid ammonia, {{chem|KNH|2}} (supplying {{chem|NH|2|\u2212}}) is a strong base, and {{chem|NH|4|NO|3}} (supplying {{chem|NH|4|+}}) is a strong acid.

On the other hand, solvent system theory has been criticized as being too general to be useful.

The model assigned ''E'' and ''C'' parameters to many Lewis acids and bases. Each acid is characterized by an ''E''<sub>A</sub> and a ''C''<sub>A</sub>. Each base is likewise characterized by its own ''E''<sub>B</sub> and ''C''<sub>B</sub>.   The ''E'' and ''C'' parameters refer, respectively, to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form. The equation is\n\n:  \u2212\u0394''H''  =  ''E''<sub>A</sub>''E''<sub>B</sub>  +  ''C''<sub>A</sub>''C''<sub>B</sub>  +  ''W''\n\nThe ''W'' term represents a constant energy contribution for acid\u2013base reaction such as the cleavage of a dimeric acid or base.  The equation predicts reversal of acids and base strengths. The graphical presentations of the equation show that there is no single order of Lewis base strengths or Lewis acid strengths.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Vogel G. C.; Drago, R.

For example,\n:HCl<sub>(aq)</sub> + Na(OH)<sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl<sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nIn this reaction both the sodium and chloride ions are spectators as the neutralization reaction,\n:H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O\ndoes not involve them. With weak bases addition of acid is not quantitative because a solution of a weak base is a [[buffer solution]]. A solution of a weak acid is also a buffer solution. When a weak acid reacts with a weak base an equilibrium mixture is produced. For example, [[adenine]], written as AH can react with a hydrogen [[phosphate]] ion, {{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}}.\n:AH + {{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}} {{eqm}} A<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|H|2|PO|4|\u2212}}\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction can be derived from the acid dissociation constants of adenine and of the dihydrogen phosphate ion.\n:[A<sup>\u2212</sup>][H<sup>+</sup>] = ''K''<sub>a1</sub>[AH]\n:[{{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}}][H<sup>+</sup>] = ''K''<sub>a2</sub>[{{chem|H|2|PO|4|\u2212}}]\n\nThe notation [X] signifies \"concentration of X\". When these two equations are combined by eliminating the hydrogen ion concentration, an expression for the equilibrium constant, ''K'' is obtained.\n:[A<sup>\u2212</sup>][{{chem|H|2|PO|4|\u2212}}] = ''K''[AH][{{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}}];{{spaces|5}} ''K'' = {{sfrac|''K''<sub>a1</sub>|''K''<sub>a2</sub>}}\n\n==Acid\u2013alkali reaction==\n{{Main|Neutralization (chemistry)}}\nAn acid\u2013alkali reaction is a special case of an acid\u2013base reaction, where the base used is also an [[alkali]]. When an acid reacts with an alkali salt (a metal hydroxide), the product is a metal [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and water. Acid\u2013alkali reactions are also [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] reactions.\n\nIn general, acid\u2013alkali reactions can be simplified to\n:[[hydroxide|{{chem|OH|\u2212}}<sub>(aq)</sub>]] + {{chem|H|+}}<sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 [[water (molecule)|{{chem|H|2|O}}]]\nby omitting [[spectator ion]]s.\n\nAcids are in general pure substances that contain [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen cations]] ({{chem|H|+}}) or cause them to be produced in solutions. Hydrochloric acid ({{chem|HCl}}) and sulfuric acid ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) are common examples. In water, these break apart into ions:\n:{{chem|HCl}} \u2192 {{chem|H|+}}<sub>(aq)</sub> + {{chem|Cl|\u2212}}<sub>(aq)</sub>\n:{{chem|H|2|SO|4}} \u2192 {{chem|H|+}}<sub>(aq)</sub> + {{chem|HSO|4|\u2212}}<sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe alkali breaks apart in water, yielding dissolved hydroxide ions:\n:{{chem|NaOH}} \u2192 {{chem|Na|+}}<sub>(aq)</sub> + {{chem|OH|\u2212}}<sub>(aq)</sub>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Acid\u2013base titration]]\n*[[Donor number]]\n*[[Electron configuration]]\n*[[Gutmann\u2013Beckett method]]\n*[[Lewis structure]]\n*[[Nucleophilic substitution]] and [[Redox reaction]]s\n*[[Protonation]] and [[Deprotonation]]\n*[[Resonance structure]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book |ref=harv| last1 = Clayden | first1 = Jonathan | first2 =  Nick |last2 =Greeves | last3 = Warren | first3 = Stuart | first4 = Peter|last4= Wothers | edition = First | date =2000 | title = Organic Chemistry|publisher =Oxford University Press }}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv| first1 = H.

The church later evolved into the [[Monastery of Alcoba\u00e7a]], one of the most magnificent [[gothic architecture|gothic]] monuments in the country. In the [[Church (building)|church]] are the tombs of [[Pedro I of Portugal]] and his murdered mistress [[In\u00eas de Castro]]. Over the centuries this monastery played an important role in shaping [[Portuguese culture]].\n\nA few kilometers to the north of Alcoba\u00e7a is the [[Monastery of Batalha]], another gothic building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of [[Battle of Aljubarrota|Aljubarrota]]. To the west of Alcoba\u00e7a is the fishing village of [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal|Nazar\u00e9]], now a popular resort town. To the south is the city of [[Caldas da Rainha]] and the medieval town of [[\u00d3bidos, Portugal|\u00d3bidos]]. Also to the northeast is the town of [[Porto de M\u00f3s]] with its rebuilt castle.\n\n== History ==\nA town that only became notable in the 12th century when it was chosen as the future site of Portugal's largest church. In March 1147, the fledgling King Dom [[Afonso Henriques]], defeated the Moors by capturing the city of [[Santar\u00e9m, Portugal|Santar\u00e9m]]. As a tribute to his victory he vowed to build a magnificent home for the [[Cistercian|Order of Cistercians]]. It took another 76 years before this task was completed. The [[monarchy]] continued to carry out further construction and 60 years later [[Dinis I of Portugal|King Dinis]] built the main cloister. The [[Monastery]] was consecrated in 1262.\n\nThe church contains the tombs of [[Pedro I of Portugal]] and his murdered mistress [[In\u00eas de Castro]] and with it the story of the tragic liaison between Pedro and In\u00eas. Forced at an early age as a royal duty, he was to marry Constanza, the ''[[Infanta]]'' (Princess) of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], but died shortly after the marriage. Dom Pedro escape with his true love and later lived in the city of [[Coimbra]]. His father, [[Afonso IV of Portugal|King Afonso IV]], believing that the family of In\u00eas was a threat to his own kingdom had her murdered. Shortly after the death of his father Dom Pedro declared that he had married In\u00eas in a prior secret ceremony in [[Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal|Bragan\u00e7a]], and promptly took a gruesome revenge on the  killers and exhumed her body. He presented the embalmed corpse at the court with a crown on her head and demanded that all his courtiers kneel and individually pay homage to her decomposed hand. Today, their ornate tombs face each other so that on [[Judgment Day]] his first sight would be of his beloved In\u00eas.\n\nDuring the following centuries the monks from this monastery had a major influence on the development of Portuguese culture. Notably, in 1269 they were the first to give public lessons to their flock, and later they produced the first authoritative history on Portugal in a series of books. In 1810 the invading [[France|French]] pillaged the Abbey taking with them most of its most important treasures, including the noteworthy library. The items that remained were later stolen in 1834 during an anti-clerical riot and the banning of the religious Orders in Portugal.\n\n==Parishes==\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 13 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 7|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=16 July 2014|author=''[[Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica]]''|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n* [[Vestiaria, Portugal|Alcoba\u00e7a e Vestiaria]]\n* [[Alfeizer\u00e3o]]\n* [[Aljubarrota]]\n* [[B\u00e1rrio (Alcoba\u00e7a)|B\u00e1rrio]]\n* [[Benedita (Alcoba\u00e7a)|Benedita]]\n* [[Cela, Alcoba\u00e7a|Cela]]\n* [[Coz, Alpedriz e Montes]]\n* [[\u00c9vora de Alcoba\u00e7a]]\n* [[Maiorga]]\n* [[Pataias e Martingan\u00e7a]]\n* [[S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto]]\n* [[Turquel]]\n* [[Vimeiro (Alcoba\u00e7a)|Vimeiro]]\n\n== City information==\nThe main feature of the city is essentially the monastery that proudly presents a long and sombre fa\u00e7ade with 18th-century embellishments. This austerity is further emphasized in the cloisters with its apt name of \"Cloister of Silence\". In contrast within the Abbey is the massive kitchen with a running stream specially diverted to pass through as a supply of fresh water. The open area of the kitchen chimney is large enough to take a whole ox for roasting. The surround to the sacristy doorway is an outstanding example of [[Manueline]] decoration. In 1794, [[William Thomas Beckford|Lord Beckford]] visited the Abbey and commented that he found some 300 monks \"living in a very splendid manner\"!\n\n== Nearby locations ==\nA few kilometers to the north of Alcoba\u00e7a is another wondrous building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of [[Battle of Aljubarrota|Aljubarrota]] in 1385, when King [[John I of Portugal]] defeated the Castilians and ensuring two hundred years of independence from the Castilian invaders. The construction of the Abbey at [[Batalha, Portugal|Batalha]] commenced in 1388 and was added to by various Portuguese Kings over these next two centuries. To the east of Batalha is the world-famous location of [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal|F\u00e1tima]] and a point of pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religion due to the [[Our Lady of F\u00e1tima|vision of the Virgin Mary]] in 1917 by three young children whilst tending their flock. To the west of Alcoba\u00e7a is the well-known fishing village of [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal|Nazar\u00e9]]. Today, the village is now a small town and a popular holiday resort with most of its past and traditions having rapidly evaporated in the course of time. A very successful Portuguese feature film was made in the early 20th century that dramatically captured the primitive and dangerous life of these fishermen. Stoutly Catholic, the inhabitants have retained some of their past as can be still seen in their own particular style of costume. To the south is [[Caldas da Rainha]] and the quaint medieval town of [[\u00d3bidos, Portugal|\u00d3bidos]] that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the south is the town of [[Porto de M\u00f3s]] with its fanciful rebuilt castle. This town borders the Nature Reserve [[Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros]]. These 390 square kilometres of limestone-covered landscape is also known for its underground caverns. The best known being the [[Gruta de Moinhos Velhos|Grutas de Mira de Aire]] can be visited and consists of tunnels, caverns with stalactites, stalagmites, lakes, and a music and light finale.\n\n== Major events ==\n* Market days \u2013 Every Monday\n* [[Carnival|Carnaval]] de Alcoba\u00e7a \u2013 February/March\n* [[Cisterm\u00fasica]] \u2013 classical music festival \u2013 June / July<ref>http://www.cistermusica.com/</ref>\n* [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]]'s fair \u2013 August 20\n* Municipal holiday \u2013 August 20\n* ''Marionetas na Cidade'' \u2013 [[puppetry]] festival \u2013 mid-October<ref>http://www.samarionetas.com/#!marionetas-na-cidade/c1l7k</ref>\n* [[Simon the Zealot|Saint Simon]]'s fair \u2013 4th week of October\n* International display of Sweets and Conventual Liqueurs \u2013 November\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Portugal}}\n\nAlcoba\u00e7a is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]], [[Poland]]<ref name=\"Be\u0142chat\u00f3w twinnings\">{{cite web |url=http://www.belchatow.pl/portal.php?aid=1158607934450ef43e80428|title=Portal Be\u0142chat\u00f3w|work=Miasto Be\u0142chat\u00f3w [Be\u0142chat\u00f3w town council] belchatow.pl|year=2010|accessdate=22 June 2011|language=Polish|trans-title=Be\u0142chat\u00f3w - Partnership Cities|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613131345/http://www.belchatow.pl/portal.php?aid=1158607934450ef43e80428 |archivedate=13 June 2011}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|ANG}} [[Cacuaco]], [[Angola]]\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Aubergenville]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]], [[United States]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Portugal}}\n*[[Alcoba\u00e7a IPR]]\n*[[Alcoba\u00e7a Monastery|Monastery of Alcoba\u00e7a]]\n*[[Monastery of Batalha]]\n*[[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal|Nazar\u00e9]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Alcoba\u00e7a}}\n{{Commons category|Alcoba\u00e7a (Portugal)}}\n*[http://www.cm-alcobaca.pt/ Municipality official website]\n\n\n{{Comunidade Intermunicipal do Oeste}}\n{{Municipalities of Leiria}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alcobaca}}\n[[Category:Municipalities of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Leiria District]]\n[[Category:Cities in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Centro Region, Portugal|Centro Region]]\n[[Category:Alcoba\u00e7a, Portugal| ]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Leiria District]]", "sha1": "g7dbogoi4d7kfo1usmp348bzwu4nww8"}}, {"title": "Amphisbaena", "ns": "0", "id": "3044", "revision": {"id": "854923535", "parentid": "853873282", "timestamp": "2018-08-14T18:36:49Z", "contributor": {"ip": "31.52.113.206"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the mythological creature|suborder|Amphisbaenia|genus|Amphisbaena (genus)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=January 2015}}\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2013}}\n}}\n[[Image:Uroboros.png|thumb|right|200px|Amphisbaena]]\nThe '''amphisbaena''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u00e6|m|f|\u026a|s|\u02c8|b|i\u02d0|n|\u0259}}, plural: '''amphisbaenae'''; {{lang-grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1}}) is a [[mythological]], [[ant]]-eating [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] with a head at each end.

He also says: \"From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other.\" [[Nicander]]'s account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the [[Amphisbaenia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Habitat ==\n[[Image:POL gmina Zapolice COA.svg|thumb|An amphisbaena on [[coat of arms]] of [[Gmina Zapolice]]]]\nThe amphisbaena is said to make its home in the [[desert]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Folk medicine ==\nIn ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of [[folk medicine]] and other such remedies. Pliny notes that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies; however, if one's goal was to cure ailments such as [[arthritis]] or the [[common cold]], one should wear only its skin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ritual significance of personal ornament in Roman Britain|last=Puttock|first=Sonia|publisher=Archaeopress|year=2002|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=93}}</ref> By eating the meat of the amphisbaena, one could supposedly attract many lovers of the opposite sex, and slaying one during the [[full moon]] could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Lumberjacks]] suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to be felled more easily.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Origins ==\nIn ''The Book of Beasts'', [[T.H.

The amphisbaena was endangering the region of Kovir until the beast was slain by Geralt's hand.\n\nIn the 1984 Scandinavian animated film [[Gallavants |''Gallavants'']], an amphisbaena (called in the film as a 'Vanterviper') appears as a minor antagonist.

It is a colourless liquid of density 0.8247 g/cm\u00b3 (0&nbsp;\u00b0C), boiling at 131.6&nbsp;\u00b0C, slightly soluble in water, and easily dissolved in organic solvents. It has a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste. Amyl alcohol has an oral LD50 of 200&nbsp;mg/kg in mice,<ref>http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/</ref> suggesting that it is significantly more toxic than ethanol.

Of these, tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain, with the first reported synthesis in 1891 by L. Tissier<ref>Comptes Rendus'', 1891, 112, p. 1065''</ref> using the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam.

Once some stimulative drugs wear off, a common side effect is a period of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], colloquially called a \"come down\"; amyl nitrite is sometimes used to combat these negative after-effects.  This effect, combined with its dissociative effects, has led to its use as a recreational drug (see  [[poppers]]).<ref name=\"detoxification48\">AJ Giannini, AE Slaby, MC Giannini.

For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.   When the amyl group is a [[Alkane#Linear alkanes|linear or normal (n)]] [[alkyl]] group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>ONO.\n\nDespite a very similar name to amyl nitrite, [[amyl nitrate]] has a different chemical composition and different properties. The two compounds may be confused, especially by those wishing to purchase \"poppers\" (amyl nitrite) for recreational purposes.\n\n==Synthesis and reactions==\nAlkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of [[alcohol]]s with [[nitrous acid]]:<ref>{{OrgSynth |author =Noyes, W. A. |author-link=William A.

Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories. A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol. The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily [[Decantation|decanted]] from the reaction mixture.\n\nIsoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the [[Amyl alcohol|isoamyl alcohol]]:\n:C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>ONO  +  NaOH  \u2192 C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>OH  +  [[sodium nitrite|NaNO<sub>2</sub>]]\n\nAmyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with [[carbanion]]s to give [[oxime]]s.<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Chen, Y.

In the [[Medieval]] period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use.\n\nBefore the 16th century, ''[[harvest]]'' was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is common in other [[West Germanic languages]] to this day ([[cf.]] Dutch ''{{lang|nl|herfst}}'', German ''{{lang|de|Herbst}}'' and Scots ''{{lang|sco|hairst}}''). However, as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns, the word ''harvest'' lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and ''autumn'', as well as ''fall'', began to replace it as a reference to the season.<ref>{{OEtymD|harvest}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|autumn}}</ref>\n\nThe alternative word ''fall'' for the season traces its origins to old [[Germanic languages]]. The exact derivation is unclear, with the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|fi\u00e6ll}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|feallan}}'' and the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|fall}}'' all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning \"to fall from a height\" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in [[16th-century England]], a contraction of [[Middle English]] expressions like \"[[Abscission|fall of the leaf]]\" and \"fall of the year\".<ref>{{OEtymD|fall}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|English emigration to the British colonies]] in North America was at its peak, and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term ''fall'' gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.\n\nThe name ''backend'', a once common name for the season in [[Northern England]], has today been largely replaced by the name autumn.<ref>{{cite news|title=Revealed: How London accents have killed off local dialects across England|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/05/26/revealed-how-london-accents-have-killed-off-local-dialects-acros/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Associations==\n\n===Harvest===\n[[File:Harvest Straw Bales in Schleswig-Holstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Harvest]] straw bales in a field of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]]]\nAssociation with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of the primary [[harvest]], has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Many cultures feature autumnal [[harvest festival]]s, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the autumn [[Thanksgiving]] holiday of the United States and Canada, and the Jewish [[Sukkot]] holiday with its roots as a full-moon harvest festival of \"tabernacles\" (living in outdoor huts around the time of harvest). {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} There are also the many North American Indian festivals tied to harvest of ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese Mid-Autumn or [[Moon festival]], and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather.\n\nThis view is presented in English poet [[John Keats]]' poem ''[[To Autumn]]'', where he describes the season as a time of bounteous fecundity, a time of 'mellow fruitfulness'.\n\nIn North America, while most foods are harvested during the autumn, foods particularly associated with the season include [[pumpkin]]s (which are integral parts of both Thanksgiving and [[Halloween]]) and [[apple]]s, which are used to make the seasonal beverage [[apple cider]].\n\n===Melancholia===\nAutumn, especially in poetry, has often been associated with [[melancholia]]. The possibilities and opportunities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. Skies turn grey, the amount of usable daylight drops rapidly, and many people turn inward, both physically and mentally.<ref>[http://www.symbolism.org/writing/books/sp/4/page2.html Cyclical Regenerative Time - (c) Autumn] (from 'Symbolism of Place', symbolism.org website)</ref> It has been referred to as an unhealthy season.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0002.576|title = Autumn|year = 2013|accessdate = 31 March 2015|website = The Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project|publisher = Michigan Publishing|last = D'Alembert|first = Jean Le Rond|editor-last = Holtrop|editor-first = Ellen|orig-year = 1751}}</ref>\n\nSimilar examples may be found in Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]]' poem ''[[The Wild Swans at Coole]]'' where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents his own ageing self. Like the natural world that he observes, he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death. French poet [[Paul Verlaine]]'s \"''[[Chanson d'automne]]''\" (\"Autumn Song\") is likewise characterised by strong, painful feelings of sorrow. [[John Keats|Keats]]' ''[[To Autumn]]'', written in September 1819, echoes this sense of melancholic reflection, but also emphasises the lush abundance of the season. The song, [[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]], which is based on a French song, \" \"Les Feuilles mortes\", uses the melancholic atmosphere of the season and the end of summer as a simile to compare to the mood of being separated from a loved one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/music/2017/09/the-original-autumn-leaves/|accessdate=8 September 2018|title=The Original \u201cAutumn Leaves\"}}</ref>\n\n===Halloween===\n[[File:Pumpkins-2009.jpg|left|thumb|[[Halloween]] [[pumpkin]]s]]\nAutumn is associated with [[Halloween]] (influenced by [[Samhain]], a Celtic autumn festival),<ref name=\"ENC\">{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572079/Halloween.html |title=Halloween |work=[[Microsoft Encarta|Encarta]] |publisher=Microsoft |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKs5kQp?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572079/Halloween.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it. Halloween is in autumn in the northern hemisphere. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such a holiday, with promotions going from early September to 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends, and advertising starts concentrating on Christmas.\n\n===Other associations===\n[[File:Pumpkin-Pie-Whole-Slice.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pumpkin pie]] is commonly served on and around [[Thanksgiving]] in North America]]\n[[File:01259 All Saints Day Sanok, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[All Saints' Day]] at a cemetery in [[Sanok]] \u2013 flowers and lit candles are placed to honor the memory of deceased relatives. Poland, 1 November 2011]]\nIn some parts of the northern hemisphere, autumn has a strong association with the end of [[summer vacation|summer holiday]] and the [[first day of school|start of a new school year]], particularly for children in primary and secondary education. \"[[Back to school (marketing)|Back to School]]\" advertising and preparations usually occurs in the weeks leading to the beginning of autumn.\n\n[[Easter]] falls in autumn in the southern hemisphere. \n\n[[Thanksgiving Day]] is a national holiday celebrated in Canada, in the United States, in some of the [[Caribbean|Caribbean islands]] and in [[Liberia]]. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|second Monday of October]] in Canada and on the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|fourth Thursday of November]] in the United States, and around the same part of the year in other places. Similarly named festival holidays occur in [[Germany]] and [[Japan]].\n\nTelevision stations and networks, particularly in North America, traditionally begin their regular seasons in their autumn, with new series and new episodes of existing series debuting mostly during late September or early October (series that debut outside the fall season are usually known as [[mid-season replacement]]s). A sweeps period takes place in November to measure [[Nielsen Ratings]].\n\n[[American football]] is played almost exclusively in the autumn months; at the [[high school football|high school level]], seasons run from late August through early November, with some playoff games and [[American football on Thanksgiving|holiday rivalry contests]] being played as late as Thanksgiving.  In many American states, the championship games take place in early December. [[College football]]'s regular season runs from September through November, while the main [[professional football (gridiron)|professional]] circuit, the [[National Football League]], plays from September through to early January. Summer sports, such as [[stock car racing]], [[Major League Soccer]], and [[Major League Baseball]], wrap up their seasons in early to late autumn; MLB's championship [[World Series]] is known popularly as the \"Fall Classic\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTaW87klkGIC|title=The Fall Classic: The Definitive History of the World Series|first=Eric|last= Enders|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2007|isbn=9781402747700}}, ''et al.''</ref> (Amateur baseball is usually finished by August.) Likewise, professional winter sports, such as [[professional ice hockey]], [[basketball]] and most leagues of [[association football|soccer football]] in Europe, are in the early stages of their seasons during autumn; American [[college basketball]] and [[college ice hockey]] play teams outside their [[athletic conference]]s during the late autumn before their in-conference schedules begin in winter.\n\nThe [[Christianity|Christian]] religious holidays of [[All Saints' Day]] and [[All Souls' Day]] are observed in autumn in the Northern hemisphere.\n\nSince 1997, [[Autumn (given name)|Autumn]] has been one of the top 100 names for girls in the United States.<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ Popular Baby Names], Social Security Online.</ref>\n\nIn Indian mythology, autumn is considered to be the preferred season for the goddess of learning [[Saraswati]], who is also known by the name of \"goddess of autumn\" (Sharada).\n\nIn Asian mysticism, Autumn is associated with the [[Wu Xing|element]] of [[Metal (Wu Xing)|metal]], and subsequently with the colour [[white]], the [[Bai Hu|White Tiger of the West]], and death and mourning.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Maple Trees by Creek.jpg|thumb|Maple leaves changing colour by a creek.]]\n{{See also|Leaf peeping}}Although [[Autumn leaf color|colour change in leaves]] occurs wherever [[deciduous]] trees are found, coloured autumn [[foliage]] is noted in various regions of the world: most of [[North America]], [[Eastern Asia]] (including China, [[Korea]], and Japan), [[Europe]], the forest of [[Patagonia]], eastern [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]].\n\nEastern [[Canada]] and [[New England]] are famous for their autumnal foliage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/news/details.asp?id=19990921001 |title=Nova Scotia Capitalizes on Fall Tourism &#124; Government of Nova Scotia |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date=21 September 1999 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-complete-guide-to-leafpeeping-612904.html |title=The Complete Guide to Leaf-Peeping  & Advice, Travel |work=The Independent |date=14 September 2002 |accessdate=2010-03-06 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Ross}}</ref> and this attracts major tourism (worth billions of US dollars) for the regions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shir Haberman |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071009/NEWS/710090335 |title=Leaf peepers storm N.H., Maine |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=a3vkUrgIabaA&refer=us |title=Record New England Rains Make Foliage `a Dud,' Hurt Tourism |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=4 November 2005 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Paintings==\n<gallery>\nFile:Frederic Edwin Church - Autumn.jpg|''Oto\u00f1o'', [[Frederic Edwin Church]], 1875.

The grant was later confirmed by the new [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]] upon its independence from Spain.\n\nOver time, the place became known as Bolsa de Encinal or Encinal de San Antonio.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|592}}</ref>\n\n===City development===\nThe city was founded on June 6, 1853, and the town originally contained three small settlements. \"Alameda\" referred to the village at Encinal and High Streets, [[Hibbardsville, Alameda, California|Hibbardsville]] was at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and [[Woodstock, Alameda, California|Woodstock]] was on the west near the ferry piers of the [[South Pacific Coast Railroad]] and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]. Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the [[Alameda Mole]], featuring transit connections between San Francisco ferries, local trollies and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] (formerly Central Pacific) commuter lines.\n\nThe first post office opened in 1854.<ref name=CGN /> The first school, Schmermerhorn School, was opened in 1855 (and eventually became Lincoln School), Encinal School was opened in 1860 (and closed in 1980).

Bowman, an early settler.<ref name=CGN />\n\nThe [[Alameda Terminal]] was the site of the arrival of the first train via the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] into the San Francisco Bay Area on September 6, 1869.

The ''Cottage Baths'' were available for rent.\n\nNeptune Beach's two huge outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian [[Johnny Weissmuller]], who later starred as the original Tarzan, and [[Jack LaLanne]], who started a chain of health clubs. The park closed down in 1939 because of the [[Great Depression]], the completion of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]], people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.\n\nSome of the resort homes and buildings from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The [[Croll Building]], on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautifully preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort life was like in Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.\n\nThe vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures&nbsp;\u2013 the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the [[Ferris wheel]], the roller coaster, and other rides&nbsp;\u2013 were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost. Today,{{When|date=February 2011}}  A consequence of the Neptune Beach closing around 1940 was a total dearth of quality, clean swimming facilities in town. A grass roots effort to create swimming pools at two high schools and two city parks would continue into the early 1960s.\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Oakland 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of East Bay area in 1917, showing Alameda, Oakland, and Berkeley]]\nWhen the railroad came to town in the 1860s Park Street developed into the major thoroughfare of the city and the location of the main Alameda train station, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. As a result, they designated their mutual property line as Park Street.\n\nThe need for expanded shipping facilities and flow through the estuary led to the dredging of a canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda. Construction started in 1874, but wasn't completed until 1902, when Alameda became an island.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/12/18/days-gone-by-in-1902-island-city-alameda-celebrates-its-new-tidal-canal/|title=Days Gone By: In 1902, \u2018island city\u2019 Alameda celebrates its new tidal canal|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|date=December 18, 2013|last=Rego|first=Nilda}}</ref> Most of the soil from the canal was used to fill in nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author [[Jack London]] was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone. The [[Alameda Works Shipyard]] was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the [[Oakland Estuary|Alameda Estuary]], where the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane was used. Currently, the [[Port of Oakland]] across the estuary serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast, using the shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda. As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a \"Coast Guard City\", one of seven in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060322/ai_n16140812|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202181523/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060322/ai_n16140812/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 2, 2010|title=After 80 years, Alameda named 'Coast Guard City'|last=Bender|first=Kristin|date=March 22, 2006|work=Oakland Tribune|publisher=BNET|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the regular trains running to the Alameda Mole, Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific) which were later transformed into the [[East Bay Electric Lines]]. Southern Pacific's electrified trains were not [[streetcar]]s, but full-sized railroad cars which connected to the mainland by bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today). The trains ran to both the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland Mole]] and the Alameda Mole. In fact, one line which ran between the two moles was dubbed the \"Horseshoe Line\" for the shape of the route on a map. Soon after the completion of the Bay Bridge, Alameda trains ran directly to San Francisco on the lower deck of the bridge, the ferries having been rendered unnecessary. Alameda was the site of the Southern Pacific's West Alameda Shops where all the electric trains were maintained and repaired.\n\nIn the 1930s [[Pan American Airways]] established a [[seaplane]] port along the fill that led to the Alameda Mole. This was the original home base for the famous [[China Clipper]] flying boat.\nIn 1929, the University of California established the San Francisco Airdrome located near the current Webster Street tube as a public airport. The Bay Airdrome had its gala christening party in 1930. The airfield was a busy place, as an early home base for Coastal Air Freight, Varney Air Lines, West Coast Air Transport, Western Air Express, the transbay Air Ferries, and Boeing's Pacific Air Transport. The Airdrome was closed in 1941 when its air traffic interfered with the newly built [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS Alameda).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_Oakland.htm#sanfranbay|title=Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Oakland Area|last=Freeman|first=Paul|date=December 27, 2009|work=[[Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields]]: California|publisher=Paul Freeman|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> With the advent of World War II, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the NAS Alameda established. This major Naval facility included a large airfield, as well as docks for several [[aircraft carriers]]. It closed in 1997.\n\n===1950\u2013present===\nIn the late 1950s the Utah Construction Company began a landfill beyond the ''Old Sea Wall'' and created ''South Shore''.\n\nOn February 7, 1973, a USN [[Ling-Temco-Vought|Vought]] [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7E Corsair II]] fighter jet on a routine training mission from [[Lemoore Naval Air Station]], suddenly caught fire, 28,000 feet over the [[San Francisco Bay]] and crashed into the Tahoe Apartments in Alameda.

Today, the city consists of the main original section, with the former [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS Alameda) at the west end of Alameda Island, [[South Shore, Alameda, California|Southshore]] along the southern side of Alameda Island, and [[Bay Farm Island]], which is part of the mainland proper. The area of the former NAS is now known as \"Alameda Point.\" The Southshore area is separated from the main part of Alameda Island by a lagoon; the north shore of the lagoon is located approximately where the original south shore of the island was.

Following the ''Encinal'', several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the ''Daily Argus'' eventually rose to prominence. A young Alameda native, [[Joseph R. Knowland]], wrote political and historical articles for the Alameda papers. Later, Knowland owned the powerful ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''. Around 1900, the ''Daily Argus'' began to fade in importance and east and west papers ''The Times'' and ''The Star'' combined to take the leading role as the ''[[Alameda Times-Star]]'' in the 1930s. The ''Times-Star'' was sold to the [[Alameda Newspaper Group]] in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1997, the Hills Newspaper chain was bought by [[Knight Ridder]], at the time, the second-largest newspaper chain in the U.S. Following the buyout, former Hills Newspapers employees recognized the lack of a local community voice in Alameda, and again formed a new locally based newspaper, the ''Alameda Sun'', in 2001. In 2006, Knight Ridder announced its impending sale to [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Corp.]], a Sacramento-based publishing firm. McClatchy Corp. has put the ''Contra Costa Times'', which under the Knight Ridder reorganization included all five of the original Hills Newspapers, up for sale. The current owners of the ''Alameda Times-Star'', [[Digital First Media]], based in [[Colorado]], have announced a strong interest in buying both the ''Contra Costa Times'' chain and the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', consolidating the daily newspaper market of the East Bay, effectively under one owner. MediaNews closed the ''Times-Star'' in 2011.\n\nThe Alameda community is currently served by two weekly newspapers, the Alameda Journal, owned by the Digital First Media, and the Alameda Sun.\n\n==Services==\n===Alameda Free Library===\n\nAfter two previous failures, voters in the city passed a ballot measure in 2000 authorizing a [[bond measure]] for construction of a new main library to replace the city's [[Carnegie library]], damaged during the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]]. The city also received state funds for the new main library and opened the doors to the new facility in November 2006.\n\nThere are three library locations: the '''Main Library''' in downtown Alameda and two library branches; the '''Bay Farm Island Library''' serving the Bay Farm and Harbor Bay communities and the '''West End Library''' serving the West End of Alameda.\n\n===Alameda Hospital===\nFounded in 1894, [[Alameda Hospital]] is located at Clinton Avenue and Willow Street.\n\n===Alameda Municipal Power===\nUnlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power service, [[Alameda Municipal Power]] (AMP), that delivers services directly to consumers. AMP sold the majority of its telecommunications business to [[Comcast]] in 2008 but continues to provide telecommunication service at Alameda Point.\n\nDuring the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000 and 2001, Alameda Municipal Power did not raise electricity rates, while residents in most of the state endured significant price increases.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Energy/Alameda-Produces-Energy.htm Alameda Produces Its Own Energy Island residents sustain low rates GeorgeRaine / SF Chronicle 13jan01] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325161330/http://www.mindfully.org/Energy/Alameda-Produces-Energy.htm |date=March 25, 2005 }} Alameda Produces Its Own Energy Island residents sustain low rates SF Chronicle, Jan 13, 2001 (archived)</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2007}}\nThe Alameda Arts Council (AAC) serves as the local Alameda City [[arts council]].

The Association began in 1944. An annual benefit, Circus for Arts in the Schools, was started by clown artist [[Jeff Raz]] in 2004. Photo-realist [[Robert Bechtle]] has painted numerous Alameda subjects, including \"Alameda Gran Torino\", which was acquired by [[SFMOMA]] in 1974 and remains one of Bechtle's most famous works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/3509|title=Robert Bechtle, Alameda Gran Torino, 1974|website=SFMOMA|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Films shot in Alameda===\nAlameda has been home to many movie sets. Some of the movies filmed on the island have included ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', ''[[Bee Season]]'', the original 1968 ''Your, Mine and Ours'' and the movie musical ''[[Rent (film)|Rent]]''. Parts of [[Alameda High School]] were animated for the ''[[Animatrix]]'' episode \"Kid's Story\". A massive hangar at the former Naval Air Station Alameda was used to film special scenes requiring [[computer-generated imagery]] for movies such as ''Bicentennial Man'', ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]'', ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' and many scenes from the ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' trilogy, including the signature [[bullet time]] scene. The open space of the decommissioned naval base often hosts ''[[MythBusters]]''' more dangerous experiments. The movie \"Spirit Of '76\" was filmed all throughout Alameda.\n\nThe documentary, ''Shallow Waters: The Public Death of Raymond Zack'' was filmed at Alameda locations, and chronicled the 2011 [[Death of Raymond Zack]] on Crown Beach in Alameda. The film was screened in 2016 at the Michaan Auction House Theater in Alameda.\n\nThe [[USS Hornet Museum]], permanently moored at [[Alameda Point, Alameda, California|Alameda Point]], has been the site for scenes used in major theatrical releases: ''[[XXX: State of the Union]]'', ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'', and ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]''. In addition, the aircraft carrier has been used for television shows such as ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', ''[[Carrier (documentary)|Carrier]]'', ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]'', ''[[The Great Escape (U.S. TV series)|The Great Escape]]'', and the special military episode of ''[[Fear Factor]]''; plus a number of television commercials.<ref>http://www.uss-hornet.org/groups/filming/ USS Hornet Museum website, film and television location rentals</ref>\n\n===The Altarena Playhouse===\nThe Altarena Playhouse, which performs comedies, dramas and musicals, was founded in 1938 and is the longest continuously operating community theater in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n===Rhythmix Cultural Works===\nRhythmix Cultural Works (RCW) brings people of all ages together to experience and explore music, dance, visual art and educational opportunities. RCW's programs are housed in a restored industrial waterfront building that speaks to Alameda\u2019s history while creating an inclusive venue that reflects the Bay Area\u2019s rich diversity. The organization offers an array of arts programming to the community including Island Arts, Island City Waterways, Round the World Festival and its Performance Art and Learning program (PAL) that serves more than 2000 youth with free cultural arts assemblies each year.\n\n===Festivals on Webster Street===\nWebster Street in Alameda has long been the host of many arts, crafts and holiday festivals. During some of these festivals, the Chamber of Commerce along with the West Alameda Business Association (WABA) will block of a portion of Webster St. for the entertainment of festival goers. Festivals such as The Island JAM formerly known as the [http://westalamedabusiness.com/events/ Peanut Butter Jam Festival] brings a lot of local and outside visitors. Other event on the \"West-End\" include Trick-or-Treat on Webster Street where merchants supply goodies for local children and culminates with a parade and costume contest; in December \"Santa Claus Meet-n-Greet on Webster Street\" happens with elves, and a photo with the big guy.\n\n===Festivals on Park Street===\nThere are three major events when the street in Alameda's historic downtown district is closed to vehicular traffic. The ''Park Street Spring Festival'' takes place every May during the weekend of Mother's Day and attracts over 50,000 visitors. The ''Park Street Art & Wine Faire'' takes place the last weekend of every July and attracts over 100,000 visitors. Both street fairs feature over 150 arts & crafts vendors, food vendors, beer and wine pouring, a children's area, and two stages with regional entertainment. The ''Park Street Classic Car Show'' is held on the second Saturday every October and displays over 400 vintage vehicles.<ref>http://www.shopparkstreet.com/ Park Street Business Association website, special events</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Albert Arents]], mining engineer who helped develop mineral resources of Rocky Mountains.\n* [[Ian Axel]], originally from [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey]]; singer-songwriter, lead singer of two-member indie group A Great Big World.\n* [[John Baker (baseball)|John Baker]], MLB catcher for [[San Diego Padres]] and [[Chicago Cubs]], was born in Alameda.\n* [[Shirley Temple Black]], actress and former U.S. ambassador, resident.\n* [[Mike Brisiel]], offensive guard for [[Oakland Raiders]].\n* [[Virginia Lee Burton]], Caldecott-winning children's author and illustrator.\n* [[Harold Camping]], television and radio personality, president and general manager of [[Family Stations, Inc.]]\n* One of Alameda's most famous natives was [[Jimmy Doolittle|General James Doolittle]], who won the Medal of Honor for his bombing of Japan during World War II; Doolittle was born in Alameda in 1896.\n* [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[landscape architect]] who lived in Alameda as a child, later forming the Bay Area firm of Eckbo, Royston, Williams with [[Robert Royston]] and Edward Williams.\n* Actor [[Leif Erickson (actor)|Leif Erickson]] was born in Alameda in 1911.\n* College basketball coach [[Larry Eustachy]] was born in Alameda.\n* [[Debbi Fields]], founder of Mrs. Fields Cookies, attended Alameda High School, where she was a cheerleader.\n* [[Albert Ghiorso]], nuclear scientist, co-discoverer of 12 chemical elements on periodic table; in [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for Most Elements Discovered.\n* [[Brad Gillis]], guitarist with Night Ranger, a San Francisco rock band formed in the 1980s.\n* [[Katharine Graham]], the late publisher of the [[Washington Post]], lived in Alameda as a child, according to ''Personal History'', her autobiography.\n* [[Tim Hardaway Jr.]], professional basketball player, was born in Alameda.\n* Bandleader and radio personality [[Horace Heidt]] was born in Alameda on May 21, 1901.\n* [[Bruce Henderson]], author, lived in Alameda, according to his book ''Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War''.\n* [[Benjamin Jealous]], former President of the NAACP, lived in Alameda.\n* Mikael Johnston, founding member of [[Warner Bros.

The pivotal moment came in the early spring of 1948, when Pauling caught a cold and went to bed. Being bored, he drew a polypeptide chain of roughly correct dimensions on a strip of paper and folded it into a helix, being careful to maintain the planar peptide bonds.

It is generated by opening the cylindrical surface of each helix along a line parallel to the axis and laying the result out vertically. The helix net is not suitable for studying helix\u2013helix packing interactions, but it has become the dominant means of representing the sequence arrangement for [[integral membrane protein]]s because it shows important relationships of the helical sequence to vertical positioning within the membrane even without knowledge of how the helices are arranged in 3D.\n\n=== Stability ===\n{{See also|Stapled peptide}}\nHelices observed in proteins can range from four to over forty residues long, but a typical helix contains about ten amino acids (about three turns). In general, short [[polypeptide]]s do not exhibit much \u03b1-helical structure in solution, since the [[entropy|entropic]] cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is not compensated for by a sufficient amount of stabilizing interactions. In general, the backbone [[hydrogen bond]]s of \u03b1-helices are considered slightly weaker than those found in [[beta sheet|\u03b2-sheets]], and are readily attacked by the ambient water molecules.

The N-terminus is at the top, here.]]\n\n== Experimental determination ==\nSince the \u03b1-helix is defined by its hydrogen bonds and backbone conformation, the most detailed experimental evidence for  \u03b1-helical structure comes from atomic-resolution [[X-ray crystallography]] such as the example shown at right.  It is clear that all the backbone carbonyl oxygens point downward (toward the C-terminus) but splay out slightly, and the H-bonds are approximately parallel to the helix axis. Protein structures from [[protein NMR|NMR spectroscopy]] also show helices well, with characteristic observations of [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] (NOE) couplings between atoms on adjacent helical turns. In some cases, the individual hydrogen bonds can be observed directly as a small scalar coupling in NMR.\n\nThere are several lower-resolution methods for assigning general helical structure. The [[protein NMR|NMR]] [[chemical shift]]s (in particular of the C<sup>\u03b1</sup>, C<sup>\u03b2</sup> and C\u2032) and [[residual dipolar coupling]]s are often characteristic of helices. The far-UV (170\u2013250&nbsp;nm) [[circular dichroism]] spectrum of helices is also idiosyncratic, exhibiting a pronounced double minimum at around 208 and 222&nbsp;nm. [[Infrared]] spectroscopy is rarely used, since the \u03b1-helical spectrum resembles that of a [[random coil]] (although these might be discerned by, e.g., [[hydrogen-deuterium exchange]]). Finally, cryo [[electron microscopy]] is now capable of discerning individual \u03b1-helices within a protein, although their assignment to residues is still an active area of research.\n\nLong homopolymers of amino acids often form helices if soluble. Such long, isolated helices can also be detected by other methods, such as [[dielectric relaxation]], [[flow birefringence]], and measurements of the [[diffusion constant]]. In stricter terms, these methods detect only the characteristic [[Prolate spheroid|prolate]] (long cigar-like) hydrodynamic shape of a helix, or its large [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]].\n\n== Amino-acid propensities ==\nDifferent amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming \u03b1-helical structure. [[Methionine]], [[alanine]], [[leucine]], [[glutamate]], and [[lysine]] uncharged (\"MALEK\" in the [[amino-acid]] 1-letter codes) all have especially high helix-forming propensities, whereas [[proline]] and [[glycine]] have poor helix-forming propensities.<ref name=\"pmid9649402\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pace CN, Scholtz JM | title = A helix propensity scale based on experimental studies of peptides and proteins | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 422\u20137 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9649402 | pmc = 1299714 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77529-0 | bibcode = 1998BpJ....75..422N }}</ref> [[Proline]] either breaks or kinks a helix, both because it cannot donate an amide [[hydrogen bond]] (having no amide hydrogen), and also because its sidechain interferes sterically with the backbone of the preceding turn{{snd}} inside a helix, this forces a bend of about 30\u00b0 in the helix's axis.<ref name=\"Anatax\"/> However, proline is often seen as the ''first'' residue of a helix, it is presumed due to its structural rigidity.

[[Coiled coil]]s contain a highly characteristic [[sequence motif]] known as a '''[[heptad repeat]]''', in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence (''amino acid'' residues, not DNA base-pairs). The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the ''a'' and ''d'' positions) are almost always [[hydrophobic]]; the fourth residue is typically [[leucine]]{{snd}} this gives rise to the name of the [[structural motif]] called a ''[[leucine zipper]]'', which is a type of coiled-coil. These hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the helix bundle. In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the ''e'' and ''g'' positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by [[electrostatic]] interactions. [[Fibrous protein]]s such as [[keratin]] or the \"stalks\" of [[myosin]] or [[kinesin]] often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several [[protein dimer|dimerizing]] proteins. A pair of coiled-coils{{snd}} a four-[[helix bundle]]{{snd}} is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human [[growth hormone]] and several varieties of [[cytochrome]]. The [[Rop protein]], which promotes plasmid replication in bacteria, is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle.\n\n== Facial Arrangements ==\nThe amino acids that make up a particular helix can be plotted on a [[helical wheel]], a representation that illustrates the orientations of the constituent amino acids (see the article for [[leucine zipper]] for such a diagram).

This pattern is especially common in [[antimicrobial peptides]], and many models have been devised to describe how this relates to their function.

These riots spread from Accrington through Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Darwen, Rossendale, Bury and Chorley. In the end after three days of riots 1,139 looms were destroyed, 4 rioters and 2 bystanders shot dead by the authorities in Rossendale and 41 rioters sentenced to death (all of whose sentences were commuted).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm |title=Cotton Times |publisher=Doug Peacock |accessdate=17 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604221023/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Turner|first=William|title=Riot!

The [[Pals battalion]]s were a peculiarity of the 1914-18 war: [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], believed that it would help recruitment if friends and work-mates from the same town were able to join up and fight together. Strictly speaking, the 'Accrington Pals' battalion is properly known as the '11th [[East Lancashire Regiment]]': the nickname is a little misleading, since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion only one was composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other east [[Lancashire]] towns such as [[Burnley]], [[Blackburn]] and [[Chorley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pals.org.uk/pals_e.htm|title=The Accrington Pals|first=Andrew C|last=Jackson|year=2009|accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Pals' first day of action, 1 July 1916, took place in [[Serre-l\u00e8s-Puisieux|Serre]], near [[Montauban-de-Picardie|Montauban]] in the north of France.<ref>[http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/somme/serre.html]</ref> It was part of the 'Big Push' (later known as the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]) that was intended to force the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] into a retreat from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], a line they had held since late 1914. The German defences in Serre were supposed to have been obliterated by sustained, heavy, British shelling during the preceding week; however, as the battalion advanced it met with fierce resistance. 235 men were killed and a further 350 wounded &mdash; more than half of the battalion &mdash; within half an hour. Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, [[First day on the Somme|in a disastrous day]] for the British Army (approximately 19,000 British soldiers were killed in a single day).\n\nLater in the year, the East Lancashire Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers &mdash; in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during World War I. All of these names are recorded on a war memorial, an imposing white stone cenotaph, which stands in Oak Hill Park in the south of the town. The [[cenotaph]] also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from [[World War II]]. The trenches from which the Accrington Pals advanced on 1 July 1916 are still visible in John Copse west of the village of Serre, and there is a memorial there made of Accrington brick.\n\nAfter the war and until 1986, Accrington Corporation buses were painted in the regimental colours of red and blue with gold lining.

The Hyndburn or Accrington Brook flows through the centre of the town. Hill settlements origins were as the economic foci of the district engaging in the spinning and weaving of woolen cloth. Wool, lead and coal were other local industries.\nGeographical coordinates: 53\u00b0 46' 0\" North, 2\u00b0 21' 0\" West. Height above sea level: there is a [[spot height]] outside the Market Hall which is 133.5m; the bench mark on the side of the neighbouring Town Hall is 441.10 feet. The highest height in the town is 320m which is in [[Baxenden]] and the lowest is the town hall which is at 132.5m. most of the town is around 200m.\n\n==Transport==\nThe town has strong local travel links as [[Accrington railway station]] lies on the [[East Lancashire Line]] serving trains running locally and trains running from [[Blackpool]] to [[York]]. However, recent changes to the train timetables have been a disservice to Accrington, increasing the journey time to Preston (a vital link to London or Scotland) by up to 1.5 hours. However, there are still buses to Manchester every thirty minutes as well as more frequent services to other towns in east Lancashire. The main road running through the town centre is the [[A680 road|A680]] running from [[Rochdale]] to [[Whalley, Lancashire|Whalley]]. The town is served by junction seven of the [[M65 motorway|M65]] and is linked from the A680 and the [[A56 road|A56]] [[dual carriageway]] which briefly merge; linking to the [[M66 motorway]] heading towards Manchester. The closest airports are [[Manchester Airport]] at {{convert|27|mi}}, [[Blackpool Airport]] at {{convert|28|mi}} and [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] at {{convert|30|mi}}.\n\nThere was once a rail link south to Manchester via [[Haslingden]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]], but this was closed in the 1960s as part of cuts following the [[Beeching Report]]. The trackbed from Accrington to [[Baxenden]] is now a linear treelined cycleway/footpath. A train service to Manchester via the [[Todmorden Curve]] opened in 2015.

Jordan]], [http://www.biblicalhorizons.com/biblical-horizons/no-85-some-observations/ Biblical Horizons, No. 85]</ref> [[R. J.

Armageddon is the symbolic name given to this event based on scripture references regarding divine obliteration of God's enemies.  The hermeneutical method supports this position by referencing Judges 4 and 5 where God miraculously destroys the enemy of His elect, Israel, at Megiddo, also called the [[Valley of Josaphat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nChristian scholar [[William Hendriksen]] says:\n{{quote|For this cause, Har Magedon is the symbol of every battle in which, when the need is greatest and believers are oppressed, the Lord suddenly reveals His power in the interest of His distressed people and defeats the enemy.  When Sennacherib's 185,000 are slain by the Angel of Jehovah, that is a shadow of the final Har-Magedon.  When God grants a little handful of Maccabees a glorious victory over an enemy which far outnumbers it, that is a type of Har-Magedon. But the real, the great, the final Har Magedon coincides with the time of Satan\u2019s little season.  Then the world, under the leadership of Satan, anti-Christian government, and anti-Christian religion \u2013 the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet \u2013 is gathered against the Church for the final battle, and the need is greatest; when God's children, oppressed on every side, cry for help; then suddenly, Christ will appear on the clouds of glory to deliver his people; that is Har-Magedon.<ref>[[William Hendriksen]], ''More Than Conquerors'', 163.</ref>}}\n\n=== Dispensationalism ===\n{{See also|Dispensationalism}}\nIn his discussion of Armageddon, [[J. Dwight Pentecost]] has devoted a chapter to the subject, titled \"The Campaign of Armageddon\", in which he discusses Armageddon as a [[Military campaign|campaign]] and not a specific [[battle]], which will be fought in the [[Middle East]]. Pentecost writes:\n{{Quote|It has been held commonly that the battle of Armageddon is an isolated event transpiring just prior to the second advent of Christ to the earth. The extent of this great movement in which God deals with \"the kings of the earth and of the whole world\" (Rev. 16:14) will not be seen unless it is realized that the \"battle of that great day of God Almighty\" (Rev. 16:14)<ref>{{bibleverse||Revelation|16:14|NKJV}}</ref> is not an isolated battle, but rather a campaign that extends over the last half of the tribulation period. The Greek word \"polemo\", translated \"battle\" in Revelation 16:14, signifies a war or campaign, while \"mach\u0113\" signifies a battle, and sometimes even single combat. This distinction is observed by Trench, (see [[Richard Chenevix Trench|Richard C. Trench]], ''New Testament Synonyms'', pp.301-2) and is followed by Thayer (see [[Joseph Henry Thayer]], ''Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament'', p. 528) and Vincent (see Marvin R. Vincent, ''Word Studies in the New Testament'', II, 541). The use of the word polemos (campaign) in Revelation 16:14 would signify that the events that culminate in the gathering at Armageddon at the second advent are viewed by God as one connected campaign.|Pentecost, p. 340}}\n\nPentecost then discusses the location of this campaign, and mentions the \"hill of Megiddo\" and other geographic locations such as \"the [[Valley of Josaphat|valley of Jehoshaphat]]\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Joel|3:2|NKJV}}</ref> and \"the valley of the passengers\",<ref>{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|39:11|NKJV}}</ref> \"Lord coming from [[Edom]] or Idumea, south of [[Jerusalem]], when He returns from [[Last judgment|the judgment]]\"; and Jerusalem itself.<ref>Zech. 12:2\u201311; 14:2</ref><ref>Pentecost, p. 341</ref>\n\nPentecost further describes the area involved:\n{{quote|This wide area would cover the entire land of Israel and this campaign, with all its parts, would confirm what Ezekiel pictures when he says the invaders will 'cover the land'.<ref>{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|38:9\u201316|NKJV}}</ref> This area would conform to the extent pictured by [[John of Patmos|John]] in Revelation 14:20.\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Revelation|14:20|NKJV}}</ref>}}\n\nPentecost then outlines the biblical time period for this campaign to occur and with further arguments concludes that it must take place with the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|70th week of Daniel]]. The invasion of Israel by the Northern Confederacy \"will bring the Beast and his armies to the defense of Israel as her protector\".

The original Athlon (now called ''Athlon Classic'') was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz).  It made its debut on June 23, 1999.\n\nAMD has continued using the ''Athlon'' name with the 64-bit [[Athlon 64]] architecture, the [[Athlon II]], and [[Accelerated Processing Unit]] (APU) chips targeting the [[Socket AM1]] desktop [[System on a chip|SoC]] architecture, and [[Socket AM4]] [[Zen microarchitecture]].<ref name=\"anandtech-20180906\">{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/13332/amd-athlon-200ge-55-usd|title=AMD Announces New $55 Low-Power Processor: Athlon 200GE|accessdate=2018-09-06|publisher=AnandTech}}</ref>\n\nAthlon comes from the Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u1f06\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}} (''athlon'') meaning \"(sport) contest\", or \"prize of a contest\", or \"place of a contest; arena\".<!-- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/\u1f06\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd -->\n\n==Background==\nAMD founder (and then-CEO) [[Jerry Sanders (businessman)|Jerry Sanders]] aggressively pursued strategic partnerships and engineering talent in the late 1990s, desiring to leverage the success AMD had gained in the PC market with the preceding [[AMD K6]] line of processors.

In the announcement, Sanders referred to the partnership as creating a \"virtual gorilla\" that would enable AMD to compete with Intel on fabrication capacity while limiting AMD's financial outlay for new facilities.\n\nThe K7 design team was led by [[Dirk Meyer]], who had worked as a lead engineer at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] on multiple [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] microprocessors during his employment at DEC. When DEC was sold to [[Compaq]] in 1998, the company discontinued Alpha processor development. Sanders approached many of the Alpha engineering staff as Compaq/DEC wound down their semiconductor business, and was able to bring in nearly all of the Alpha design team. The K7 engineering design team was thus now consisted of both the previously acquired [[NexGen]] K6 team (already including engineers such as [[Vinod Dham]]) and the nearly complete Alpha design team.\n\nIn August 1999, AMD released the Athlon (K7) processor.\n\nBy working with Motorola, AMD was able to refine copper interconnect manufacturing to the production stage about one year before Intel. The revised process permitted [[180 nm|180-nanometer]] processor production. The accompanying die-shrink resulted in lower power consumption, permitting AMD to increase Athlon clock speeds to the 1&nbsp;GHz range.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.amd.com/us/press-releases/Pages/Press_Release_729.aspx |title=AMD Announces First Revenue Shipments From Dresden \"MEGAFAB\" |publisher=AMD Press Release |date=June 5, 2000 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> Yields on the new process exceeded expectations, permitting AMD to deliver high speed chips in volume in March 2000.\n\nThe Athlon architecture also used the [[Alpha 21264#External interface|EV6]] bus licensed from DEC as its main system bus. Intel required licensing to use the [[Gunning transceiver logic|GTL+]] bus used by its [[Slot 1]] Pentium II and later processors. By licensing the EV6 bus used by the Alpha line of processors from DEC, AMD was able to develop its own chipsets and motherboards, and avoid being dependent on licensing from its direct competitor.\n\n==General architecture==\n[[Image:Athlon arch.png|right|thumb|350px|Athlon architecture]]\n\nInternally, the Athlon is a fully seventh generation x86 processor, the first of its kind.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Like the AMD K5 and K6, the Athlon dynamically buffers internal micro-instructions at runtime resulting from parallel x86 instruction decoding. The CPU is an [[Out-of-order execution|out-of-order]] design, again like previous post-5x86 AMD CPUs. The Athlon utilizes the [[Alpha 21264]]'s EV6 bus architecture with [[double data rate]] (DDR) technology. This means that at 100&nbsp;MHz, the Athlon front side bus actually transfers at a rate similar to a 200&nbsp;MHz single data rate bus (referred to as 200&nbsp;[[Transfer (computing)|MT/s]]), which was superior to the method used on Intel's [[Pentium III]] (with SDR bus speeds of 100&nbsp;MHz and 133&nbsp;MHz).\n\nAMD designed the CPU with more robust x86 instruction decoding capabilities than that of K6, to enhance its ability to keep more data in-flight at once. The Athlon's three decoders could potentially decode three x86 instructions to six microinstructions per clock, although this was somewhat unlikely in real-world use.<ref name=PaulHsieh>{{citation |author=Paul Hsieh |url=http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/cpujihad.shtml |title=7th Generation CPU Comparisons |date=August 11, 1999 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> The critical branch predictor unit, essential to keeping the pipeline busy, was enhanced compared to what was on board the K6.

Athlon was the first x86 processor with a 128&nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]<ref>{{BDprefix|p=b}}</ref> split level 1 cache; a [[CPU cache|2-way associative]] cache separated into 2\u00d764&nbsp;kB for data and instructions (a concept from [[Harvard architecture]]).<ref name=PaulHsieh /> This cache was double the size of K6's already large 2\u00d732&nbsp;kB cache, and quadruple the size of [[Pentium II]] and III's 2\u00d716&nbsp;kB L1 cache. The initial Athlon (Slot A, later called Athlon Classic) used 512&nbsp;kB of level 2 cache separate from the CPU, on the processor cartridge board, running at 50% to 33% of core speed. This was done because the 250&nbsp;nm manufacturing process was too large to allow for on-die cache while maintaining cost-effective die size. Later Athlon CPUs, afforded greater transistor budgets by smaller [[180 nanometer|180&nbsp;nm]] and [[130 nanometer|130&nbsp;nm]] process nodes, moved to on-die L2 cache at full CPU clock speed.\n\n===Athlon \"Classic\"===\n[[Image:Argonathlon.jpg|right|thumb|Athlon Slot A cartridge.

It used the same, commonly available, physical 242 pin connector used by Intel Slot 1 processors but rotated by 180 degrees to connect the processor to the [[motherboard]]. The reversal served to make the slot keyed to prevent installation of the wrong CPU, as the Athlon and Intel processors used fundamentally different (and incompatible) signaling standards for their [[front-side bus]]. The cartridge assembly allowed the use of higher speed cache memory modules than could be put on (or reasonably bundled with) motherboards at the time. Similar to the Pentium II and the Katmai-based Pentium III, the Athlon Classic contained 512&nbsp;kB of L2 cache. This high-speed SRAM cache was run at a divisor of the processor clock and was accessed via its own 64-bit bus, known as a \"[[back-side bus]]\" allowing the processor to both service system front side bus requests (the rest of the system) and cache accesses simultaneously versus the traditional approach of pushing ''everything'' through the [[front-side bus]].<ref>{{citation |author=De Gelas, Johan |url=http://aceshardware.com/read.jsp?id=71 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011225163156/http://aceshardware.com/read.jsp?id=71 |title=Clash of Silicon, The Athlon 650 |publisher=Ace's Hardware |date=September 29, 1999 |archivedate=December 25, 2001 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne limitation (also afflicting the Intel Pentium III) is that [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]] cache designs at the time were incapable of keeping up with the Athlon's clock scalability, due both to manufacturing limitations of the cache chips and the difficulty of routing electrical connections to the cache chips themselves. It became increasingly difficult to reliably run an external processor cache to match the processor speeds being released\u2014and in fact it became impossible. Thus initially the [[Level 2 cache]] ran at half of the CPU clock speed up to 700&nbsp;MHz (350&nbsp;MHz cache). Faster Slot-A processors had to compromise further and run at 2/5 (up to 850&nbsp;MHz, 340&nbsp;MHz cache) or 1/3 (up to 1&nbsp;GHz, 333&nbsp;MHz cache).<ref>{{citation |author=Lal Shimpi, Anand |url=http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=1189&p=2 |title=AMD Athlon 1&nbsp;GHz, 950&nbsp;MHz, 900&nbsp;MHz |publisher=Anandtech |page=2 |date=March 6, 2000}}</ref> This later race to 1&nbsp;GHz (1000&nbsp;MHz) by AMD and Intel further exacerbated this bottleneck as ever higher speed processors demonstrated decreasing gains in overall performance\u2014stagnant SRAM cache memory speeds choked further improvements in overall speed. This directly lead to the development of integrating L2 cache onto the processor itself and remove the dependence on external cache chips. AMD's integration of the cache onto the Athlon processor itself would later result in the [[Athlon#Thunderbird .28T-Bird.29|Athlon Thunderbird]].\n\nThe Slot-A Athlons were the first multiplier-locked CPUs from AMD. This was partly done to hinder CPU remarking being done by questionable resellers around the globe. AMD's older CPUs could simply be set to run at whatever clock speed the user chose on the motherboard, making it trivial to relabel a CPU and sell it as a faster grade than it was originally intended. These relabeled CPUs were not always stable, being overclocked and not tested properly, and this was damaging to AMD's reputation. Although the Athlon was multiplier locked, crafty enthusiasts eventually discovered that a connector on the PCB of the cartridge could control the multiplier. Eventually a product called the \"Goldfingers device\" was created by Ryan Petersen that could unlock the CPU, named after the gold connector pads on the processor board that it attached to.<ref>{{citation |author=Jim Noonan; James Rolfe |url=http://www.overclockers.com.au/techstuff/r_gfd1/ |title=Athlon Gold-Finger Devices |publisher=Overclockers.com.au |date=March 21, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190219/http://www.overclockers.com.au/techstuff/r_gfd1/ |archivedate=February 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn commercial terms, the Athlon \"Classic\" was an enormous success{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\u2014not just because of its own merits, but also because Intel endured a series of major production, design, and quality control issues at this time.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In particular, Intel's transition to the 180&nbsp;nm production process, starting in late 1999 and running through to mid-2000, suffered delays.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} There was a shortage of Pentium III parts.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In contrast, AMD enjoyed a remarkably smooth process transition and had ample supplies available,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} causing Athlon sales to become quite strong.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe Argon-based Athlon contained 22 million transistors and measured 184&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>.

This increases total cache size of the processor and effectively makes caching behave as if there is a very large L1 cache with a slower region (the L2) and a very fast region (the L1).<ref>{{citation |author=Stokes, John |url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/02/amd-hammer-1.ars/9 |title=Inside AMD's Hammer: the 64-bit architecture behind the Opteron and Athlon 64 |publisher=Ars Technica |page=9 |date=February 1, 2005 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> Because of Athlon's very large L1 cache and the exclusive design, which turns the L2 cache into basically a \"[[CPU cache#Victim cache|victim cache]]\", the need for high L2 performance and size was lessened. AMD kept the 64-bit L2 cache data bus from the older Athlons, as a result, and allowed it to have a relatively high latency. A simpler L2 cache reduced the possibility of the L2 cache causing clock scaling and yield issues. Still, instead of the [[CPU cache#Associativity|2-way associative]] scheme used in older Athlons, Thunderbird did move to a more efficient 16-way associative layout.<ref name=SandpileK7 />\n\nThe Thunderbird was AMD's most successful product since the [[Am386|Am386DX-40]] ten years earlier.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Mainboard designs had improved considerably by this time, and the initial trickle of Athlon mainboard makers had swollen to include every major manufacturer.

Palomino's design also allowed AMD to continue using the same 180&nbsp;nm manufacturing process node and core voltages as Thunderbird.\n\nThe Palomino core debuted earlier in the mobile market\u2014branded as '''Mobile Athlon 4''' with the codename \"Corvette\".

The \"Thoroughbred\" core marked AMD's first production 130&nbsp;nm silicon, resulting in a significant reduction in die size compared to its 180&nbsp;nm predecessor.\n\nThere came to be two [[Stepping level|steppings]] (revisions) of this core commonly referred to as Tbred-A ([[cpuid]]:6 8 0) and Tbred-B ([[cpuid]]:6 8 1).<ref name=\"TbredCoreStep\">{{citation |url=http://www.cpu-world.com/Cores/Thoroughbred.html |title=AMD Athlon Thoroughbred core |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> The initial version (later known as A) was simply a direct [[die shrink]] of the Palomino, and demonstrated that AMD had successfully transitioned to a 130&nbsp;nm process. While successful in reducing the production cost per processor, the unmodified Palomino design did not demonstrate the expected reduction in heat and clock scalability usually seen when a design is shrunk to a smaller process. As a result, AMD was not able to increase Thoroughbred-A clock speeds much above those of the Palomino it was to replace. Tbred-A was only sold in versions from 1333&nbsp;MHz to 1800&nbsp;MHz, and was only able to displace the more production-costly Palomino from AMD's lineup.\n\nAMD thus reworked the Thoroughbred's design to better match the process node on which it was produced, in turn creating the Thoroughbred-B. A significant aspect of this redesign was the addition of another ninth \"metal layer\" to the already quite complex eight-layered Thoroughbred-A. For comparison, the competing Pentium 4 Northwood only utilized six, and its successor Prescott seven layers. While the addition of more layers itself does not improve performance, it gives more flexibility for chip designers routing electrical pathways within a chip, and importantly for the Thoroughbred core, more flexibility in working around electrical bottlenecks that prevented the processor from attaining higher clock speeds. The Tbred-B offered a startling improvement in headroom over the Tbred-A, which made it very popular for [[overclocking]]. The Tbred-A often struggled to reach clock speeds above 1.9&nbsp;GHz, while the Tbred-B often could easily reach 2.3&nbsp;GHz and above.<ref name=\"AnandTbredB\">{{citation |author=Lal Shimpi, Anand |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/972/3 |title=Introducing Thoroughbred Revision B |publisher=Anandtech |date=August 21, 2002 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Thoroughbred line received an increased front side bus clock during its lifetime, from 133&nbsp;MHz (266 MT/s) to 166&nbsp;MHz (333&nbsp;MT/s) improving the processor's ability to access memory and I/O efficiency, and resulted in improved per-clock performance.

The Athlon's exclusive-cache architecture and shorter pipeline made it less sensitive to L2 cache size, and the Barton only saw an increase of several percent gained in per-clock performance over the Thoroughbred-B it was derived from.<ref name=AceBarton /> While the increased performance was welcome, it was not sufficient to overtake the Pentium 4 line in overall performance. The PR also became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower clock rates were being given higher PR than higher-clocked Thoroughbred processors. Instances where a computational task did not benefit more from the additional cache to make up for the loss in raw clock speed created situations where a lower rated (but faster clocked) Thoroughbred would outperform a higher-rated (but lower clocked) Barton.<ref name=BartonAnand />\n\nThe Barton was also used to officially introduce a higher 400&nbsp;MT/s bus clock for the Socket A platform, which was used to gain some Barton models more efficiency (and increased PR). However, it was clear by this time that Intel's quad-pumped bus was scaling well above AMD's double-pumped EV6 bus. The 800&nbsp;MT/s bus used by many later Pentium 4 processors was well out of the Athlon XP's reach. In order to reach the same bandwidth levels, the Athlon&nbsp;XP's bus would have to be clocked at levels simply unreachable.<ref name=AceBarton />\n\nBy this point, the four-year-old Athlon EV6 bus architecture had scaled to its limit.

Processors are usually binned and selected to become a mobile processor by their ability run a given processor speed while supplied with a lower (than desktop) voltage. This results in lower power consumption, longer battery life, and reduced heat over using a normal desktop part. Additionally Mobile XPs feature not being [[CPU multiplier|multiplier]]-locked and generally higher-rated maximum operating temperatures, requirements intended for better operation within the tight thermal constraints within a notebook PC\u2014but also making them attractive for [[overclocking]].\n\nThe Athlon XP-M replaced the older Mobile Athlon 4 based on the ''Palomino'' core, with the Athlon XP-M using the newer ''Thoroughbred'' and ''Barton'' cores. The Athlon XP-M was also offered in a compact microPGA [[socket 563]] version for space constrained applications as an alternative to the larger Socket A.\n\nLike their mobile [[AMD K6-III|K6-2+/III+]] predecessors, the CPUs were capable of dynamic clock adjustment for power optimization, and also was the reason for the unlocked multiplier. When the system is [[idle]], the CPU clocks itself down via lower bus multiplier and selects a lower voltage. When a program demands more computational resources, the CPU quickly (there is some latency) returns to an intermediate or maximum speed with appropriate voltage to meet the demand. This technology was marketed as \"[[PowerNow!]]\" and was similar to Intel's [[SpeedStep]] power saving technique. The feature was controlled by the CPU, motherboard [[BIOS]], and [[operating system]]. AMD later renamed the technology to [[Cool'n'Quiet]] on their K8-based CPUs ([[Athlon 64]], etc.), and introduced it for use on desktop PCs as well.\n\nAthlon XP-Ms were popular with desktop [[overclocking|overclockers]], as well as [[underclocking|underclockers]]. The lower voltage requirement and higher heat rating selected CPUs that were essentially \"[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]]\" from the manufacturing line. Being some of the best cores \"off the line\", these CPUs typically overclocked more reliably than their desktop-headed counterparts. Also, the fact that they were not locked to a single multiplier was a significant simplification in the overclocking process. Some ''Barton'' core Athlon XP-Ms have been successfully overclocked as high as 3.1&nbsp;GHz.\n\nThe chips were also liked for their [[undervolting]] ability. Undervolting is a process of determining the lowest voltage at which a CPU can remain stable at a given clock speed. As Athlon XP-M CPUs were already rated running lower voltages than their desktop siblings, it was a better starting point for lowering voltage even further. A popular application was use in [[home theater PC]] systems due to high performance and low heat output resultant from low Vcore settings.\n\nBesides not being multiplier locked, XP-Ms curiously were not disabled from [[Symmetric multiprocessing|multi processor]] operation. Thus they could be used in place of the more expensive Athlon MP in dual socket A motherboards. Since those boards generally lacked multiplier and voltage adjustment, and normally only supported 133&nbsp;MHz FSB, adjustments would still be needed for full speed operation. One method of modification known as wire-modding involves connecting the appropriate CPU pins on the CPU socket with small lengths of wire to select the appropriate multiplier. A typical overclock of a mobile 2500+ CPU to 2.26&nbsp;GHz with 17x multiplier would result in being faster than highest official 2800+ MP CPU running at 2.13&nbsp;GHz.\n\n==Athlon competitors==\n* Intel [[Pentium III]], [[Pentium 4]], and [[Celeron]]\n* [[VIA C3]] and [[VIA C7|C7]]\n* [[Transmeta Efficeon]]\n\n==Supercomputers==\nThe fastest supercomputers based on AthlonMP:\n* Rutgers University, Department of Physics & Astronomy.

Despite the biblical [[Mitzvah|prohibition]] on sexual relations between half-brothers and sisters,<ref>{{Bibleref2|Leviticus 18:11|3=AKJV}}</ref> Amnon had an overwhelming desire for her. He acted on advice from his cousin, [[Jonadab]] the son of Shimeah, David's brother, to lure Tamar into his quarters by pretending to be sick and desiring her to cook a special meal for him. While in his quarters, and ignoring her protests, he [[rape]]d her, then had her expelled from his house. King David was angry about the incident, but could not bring himself to punish his eldest son, while [[Absalom]], Amnon's half-brother and Tamar's full brother, nursed a bitter grudge against Amnon for the rape of his sister.\n\n[[File:Convito di Ansalonne.jpg|thumb|220px|''The Banquet of Absalom'', attributed to [[Niccol\u00f2 De Simone]].]]\nTwo years later, to avenge Tamar, Absalom invited all of David's sons to a feast at sheep-shearing time, then had his servants kill Amnon after he had become drunk with wine.<ref>{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13|3=AKJV}}</ref> As a result, Absalom fled to [[Geshur]].\n\n{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13:39|3=AKJV}} records that in time David came to terms with the death of Amnon, his first-born.

The river is navigable for over {{convert|1450|km|mi}}. All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual [[precipitation]] can be over {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

Use of water from the Amu Darya for [[irrigation]] has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late 1950s.

Much of the time \u2013 most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century \u2013 the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, reaching the latter via a large [[distributary]] called the [[Uzboy River]]. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the river's delta. Sometimes the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian.\n\nPeople began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century, establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. In about 985 [[Common Era|CE]], the massive Gurganj Dam at the bifurcation of the forks started to divert water to the Aral.

A direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the [[Hindu Kush]] and isolated areas like [[Kafiristan]]. Some in Britain feared that the Empire of Russia, which at the time wielded great influence over the Oxus area, would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade [[British India]] \u2013 but this never came to pass.<ref>See for example ''Can Russia invade India?'' by Henry Bathurst Hanna, 1895, (Google eBook), or ''The K\u00e1firs of the Hindu-Kush'', Sir George Scott Robertson, Illustrated by Arthur David McCormick, Lawrence & Bullen, Limited, 1896, (Google eBook)</ref> The area was taken over by Russia during the [[Russian conquest of Turkestan]].\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] became the ruling power in the early 1920s and expelled [[Mohammed Alim Khan]].

Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The [[Qaraqum Canal]], Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. However, the [[Main Turkmen Canal]], which would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, was never built. The 1970s, in the course of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], Soviet forces used the valley to invade Afghanistan through [[Termez]].<ref>Termez \u2013 See the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] article</ref> The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pavlovskaya |first=L.

In return, [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]] received Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek coal, gas, and electricity in winter.

(697-8), had appointed Ubaidallah, who was a ''mawla'' of mixed [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]] and Iraqi-Persian origins, as his deputy in Sistan. The Zunbils who had been left unchecked had completely stopped paying the tribute. This provided a pretext to terminate the peace between the both sides. Ubaidallah was appointed for an expedition against them in 698 and was ordered by Al-Hajjaj to \"attack until he laid waste to Zunbil's territories, destroyed his strongholds, killed all his fighting men and enslaved his progeny\". The ensuing campaign was called the \"Army of Destruction\" (''Jaish al-Fana'''). However, it ended disastrously for the Arabs.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&pg=PA122&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP2JiR6LTYAhWFuI8KHYMkAcwQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&f=false|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries|publisher=Brill|page=122}}</ref>\n\nAl-Baladhuri's account on the authority of Al-Mada'ini in ''Futuh al-Buldan'' and ''[[Genealogies of the Nobles|Ansab al-Ashraf]]'', is the fullest documentation of the campaign. Tabari's account runs parallel but is based on [[Abu Mikhnaf]] and does not include the poem of A'sha Hamdan included in ''Ansab al-Ashraf''. [[Ibn Qutaybah]]'s ''Kitab al-Ma'arif'' only makes a bare mention. ''[[History of the Caliphs|Ta'rikh al-khulafa']]'' has a more detailed account and epitomises accounts of Tabari and Baladhuri. ''Tarikh-e-Sistan'' confuses the campaign with another one against the [[Khwarij]] of Zarang. The army consisted of Iraqis from Basra and Kufa, though Baladhuri mentions presence of some Syrians. Ubaidallah himself led the Basrans while the [[Tabi\u2018 al-Tabi\u2018in|Tabi]] Shuraih b. Hani' al-Harithi ad-Dabbi led the Kufans.<ref name=Fanaa>{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 362\u2013366|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}</ref>\n\nThey marched to [[Zamindawar]] or al-Rukhkhaj (the classical [[Arachosia]]) but found it was barren and foodless. Their advance probably happened in summer of 698 as A'sha Hamdan's poem refers to the scorching heat they had to endure. In [[Zabulistan]]'s regions of [[Ghazna]] and [[Gardiz]], they plundered a significant amount of cattle and other animals in addition to destroying various strongholds. The Zunbils who were [[scorched earth|devastating the countryside whilst retreating]], were luring the Arabs into a trap to an inhospitable and foodless terrain. ''Futuh al-Buldan'' states that the Muslims almost penetrated Kabul. Tabari meanwhile says that they came within 18 farsakhs of the summer capital of Zunbils in the [[Kandahar Province|Qandahar region]].<ref name=Fanaa/>\n\nThe plan of the Zunbils worked and they trapped the Arabs into a valley. Ubaidallah realizing the gravity of the situation, offered 500,000 or 700,000 dirhams as well as his three sons along with some Arab leaders as hostages while promising not to raid again during his tenure as Sistan's governor. Shuraih, who had earlier advised retreat, felt a withdrawal would be dishonorable. He was joined by a group of people into the battle, and all but a handful of them were killed. The remnant of the Arab army withdrew back to Bust and Sistan, suffering from starvation and thirst. Many died in the \"Desert of Bust\", presumably the [[Registan Desert]], with only 5,000 making it back to Bust. Many of those who survived died by gorging themselves on the food sent to them according to Tabari. Ubaidallah had arranged food for them after seeing their suffering and himself died, either from grief or an ear affliction.<ref name=Fanaa/>\n\nAl-Hajjaj prepared another expedition in 699, reportedly of 40,000 troops from Kufa and Basra under [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath|Abdurrahman b. Muhammad b. al-Ash'ath]]. Though disguised as a military expedition, it was actually a forced migration of the elements from the two Iraqi cities troublesome to Hajjaj. It was equipped to the best stanadards and was called the \"Army of Peacocks\" because of the men included in its ranks. It included proudest and most distinguished leaders of Iraq led by Ibn al-Ash'ath, grandson of [[Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays]]. It also included distinguished elders who served in the first armies of conquest as well as those who fought at [[Battle of Siffin]].

During the second one in late 727-728, he was warned by the Sijistanis who were with him to not campaign in winter especially in mountain defiles. Per [[Ya'qubi]], his army was completely annihilated by the Zunbils. Per ''Tarikh al-Sistani'', al-Asfah managed to get back to Sistan where he died. The next two governors didn't undertake any campaigns. Zunbil was unable to take advantage of the annihilation of al-Asfah's army but the defeat was a heavy one.

'Amr asked the Zunbil to pay tribute in cash but he refused, prompting Qutayba to march against him. The campaign was also partially encouraged by his desire to eliminate the support of the southern Hepthalites, the Zabulites, for their northern brethren to revolt. Zunbil who was surprised by this unexpected move and scared of his reputation, quickly capitulated.

He recorded one of its anecdotes which records history of Ghazna by the Indian traditionist and lexicographer Radi ad-Din Hasan b. Muhammad al-Saghani [died 1252] from Abu Hamid az-Zawuli. According to it, a great mosque at Ghazna was earlier a great idol-temple built in honor of the Rutbils and Kabul-Shahs by Wujwir Lawik. His son Khanan converted to Islam and was sent a poem by the Kabul-Shah saying, \"Alas!

In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], and other tribes of northern Afghanistan. Ahmad Shah invaded the remnants of the Mughal Empire a third time, and then a fourth, consolidating control over the Kashmir and Punjab regions, with [[Lahore]] being governed by Afghans.

''Panipat''.</ref> Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and the Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (the Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent [[Raghunathrao]]. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.<ref name=K.RoyIHB>{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80\u20131 |isbn=978-81-7824-109-8}}</ref> Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the formidable attacks of the Maratha Confederacy.\n\nAhmad Shah declared a [[jihad]] (or [[Islam]]ic holy war) against the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army, including the [[Baloch people]] under the command of [[Khan of Kalat]] Mir [[Nasir I of Kalat]]. Suba Khan Tanoli  (Zabardast Khan) was selected as army chief of all military forces. Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the much larger Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. Ahmad Shah Durrani was famous for winning wars much larger than his army. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The Third Battle of Panipat (14 January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely Hindu armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges. As far as losses are concerned, Afghans too suffered heavily in the Third Battle of Panipat. This weakened his grasp over Punjab which fell to the rising [[Sikh]] [[misls]]. There were rebellions in the north in the region of [[Bukhara]].\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Bala_Hisar_Fort.jpg|thumb|The [[Bala Hissar, Peshawar|Bala Hissar]] fort in [[Peshawar]] was one of the royal residences of the Durrani kings.]]\n\nThe victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's\u2014and Afghan\u2014power. However, even prior to his death, the empire began to unravel. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]]. From this time and on, the domination and control of the Empire began to loosen under his gran sons rule Zaman Shah Durrani .<ref>Meredith L.

Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others in this half century. By 1818, the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than Kabul and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani Pashtuns.\n\n===Timur Shah (1772\u20131793)===\n{{main|Timur Shah Durrani}}\n\nAhmad Shah was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah, who had been deputed to administer his father's conquests in Northern India, but had been driven out by the Marathas. Upon Ahmad Shah's death, the Durrani chieftains only reluctantly accepted Timur's accession. Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from Kandahar to Kabul due to the insurgency. Timur Shah proved an ineffectual ruler, during whose reign the Durrani empire began to crumble. He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani territories. Timur died in 1793 and was then succeeded by his fifth son Zaman Shah\n\n===Zaman Shah (1793\u20131801)===\n{{Main|Zaman Shah Durrani}}\n{{Pashtuns}}\n[[File:The main street in the bazaar at Caubul.jpg|thumb|The main street in the bazaar at [[Kabul]]]]\n\nAfter the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession. [[Zaman Shah]], governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three. Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that through Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the interventions of outside forces.\n\nThe efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful. The [[Sikhs]] started rising to power in defense of the years of invasions of Punjab by the Afghanis. Zaman Shah was unsuccessful in subduing them. A young Sikh chief, [[Ranjit Singh]], then succeeded in wresting power from Zaman's forces. Later when Zaman was blinded by his brother, it was Ranjit Singh who gave him asylum in Punjab.\n\nZaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the [[Nurzai]] and the [[Alizai tribe|Alizai]] Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the [[Qizilbash]] clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's younger brother, [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.\n\n===Mahmud Shah (first reign, 1801\u20131803)===\n{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}\nZeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence. Mahmud Shah's first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shuja Shah]].\n\n===Shuja Shah (1803\u20131809 and 1839\u20131842)===\n{{Main|Shuja Shah Durrani}}\nYet another of Timur Shah's sons, Shuja Shah (or Shah Shuja), ruled for only six years. On June 7, 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the [[British East India Company|British]], which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a [[Europe]]an power, stipulated joint action in case of [[France|Franco]]-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud. Much later, he was reinstated by the British, ruling during 1839\u20131842. Two of his sons also ruled for a brief period in 1842.\n\n===Mahmud Shah (second reign, 1809\u20131818)===\n{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}\n\nMahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].\n\n===Sultan Ali Shah (1818\u20131819)===\n{{Main|Ali Shah Durrani}}\nAli Shah was another son of [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]]. He seized power for a brief period in 1818\u20131819.\n\n===Ayub Shah (1819\u20131823)===\n{{Main|Ayub Shah Durrani}}\nAyub Shah was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah. He was himself later deposed, and presumably killed in 1823. The loss of Kashmir during his reign opened a new chapter in South Asian history.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Indian Campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani]]\n* [[List of Pashtun empires and dynasties]]\n* [[Deoni]]\n\n==Notes==\n<!--<nowiki>\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags.\n</nowiki>-->\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n*Malleson, George Bruce (1879) ''History of Afghanistan, from the Earliest Period to the Outbreak of the War of 1878'' W.H.

Brooks led a new generation of self-reflective baby-boomer comics appearing on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. His onstage persona, that of an [[egotistical]], [[narcissistic]], nervous comic, an ironic showbiz insider who punctured himself before an audience by disassembling his mastery of comedic stagecraft, influenced other '70s [[post-modern]] comedians, including [[Steve Martin]], [[Martin Mull]], and [[Andy Kaufman]].\n\nAfter two successful comedy albums, ''Comedy Minus One'' (1973) and the [[Grammy Award]]\u2013nominated ''A Star Is Bought'' (1975), Brooks left the stand-up circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker. He had already made his first short film, ''The Famous Comedians School'', a satiric short and an early example of the [[mockumentary]] subgenre that appeared on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] show ''[[The Great American Dream Machine]]'' in 1972.<ref>Ramsey Ess, [http://splitsider.com/2013/01/the-short-films-of-albert-brooks/ \"The Short Films of Albert Brooks\"], January 4, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1975, he directed six short films for the first season of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':\n* October 11, 1975, episode (host: [[George Carlin]]): \"The Impossible Truth\"\n* October 18, 1975, episode (host: [[Paul Simon]]): failed ''[[Candid Camera]]'' stunts and home movies\n* October 25, 1975, episode (host: [[Rob Reiner]]): heart surgery\n* November 8, 1975, episode (host: [[Candice Bergen]]): upcoming season\n* December 13, 1975, episode (host: [[Richard Pryor]]): sick\n* January 9, 1976, episode (host: [[Elliott Gould]]): audience test screening\n\nIn 1976, he appeared in his first mainstream film role, in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s landmark ''[[Taxi Driver]]''; Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue. The role reflected Brooks's decision to move to Los Angeles to enter the film business. In an interview, Brooks mentioned a conversation he had had with ''Taxi Driver'' screenwriter [[Paul Schrader]], in which Schrader said that Brooks's character was the only one in the movie that he could not \"understand\" \u2013 a remark that Brooks found amusing, as the movie's antihero was a psychotic loner.\n\nBrooks directed his first feature film, ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', in 1979. The film, in which Brooks (playing a version of himself) obnoxiously films a typical suburban family in an effort to win both an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and a Nobel Prize, was a sendup of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[An American Family]]'' documentary. It has also been viewed as foretelling the future emergence of reality television.<ref>Montoya, Maria (February 28, 2009).

These include [[1981 in film|1981's]] ''[[Modern Romance (film)|Modern Romance]]'', where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend ([[Kathryn Harrold]]).

Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the chemistry between Brooks and [[Meryl Streep]], as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]'' (1996), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged writer moving back home to resolve tensions between himself and his mother ([[Debbie Reynolds]]). [[1999 in film|1999's]] ''[[The Muse (1999 film)|The Muse]]'' featured Brooks as a Hollywood screenwriter who has \"lost his edge\" using the services of an authentic [[muse]] ([[Sharon Stone]]) for inspiration. In an interview with Brooks with regards to ''The Muse'', Gavin Smith wrote, \"Brooks's distinctive film making style is remarkably discreet and unemphatic; he has a light, deft touch, with a classical precision and economy, shooting and cutting his scenes in smooth, seamless successions of medium shots, with clean, high-key lighting.\"<ref>Film Comment, Jan/Feb 1999, [http://www.filmcomment.com/article/all-the-choices-albert-brooks-interview All The Choices: Albert Brooks Interview]</ref>\n\nBrooks has appeared as a guest voice on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' five times during its run (always under the name ''A.

He had a cameo in the opening scene of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', playing a driver whose passenger ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) has a shocking secret. In [[James L. Brooks]]'s hit ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' (1987), Albert Brooks was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for playing an insecure, supremely ethical [[television network|network TV]] [[reporter]], who offers the rhetorical question, \"Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?\" He also won positive notices for his role in [[1998 in film|1998's]] ''[[Out of Sight (1998 film)|Out of Sight]]'', playing an untrustworthy banker and ex-convict.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nBrooks received positive reviews for his portrayal of a dying retail store owner who befriends disillusioned teen [[Leelee Sobieski]] in ''[[My First Mister]]'' (2001). Brooks continued his voiceover work in [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), as the voice of Marlin, one of the film's protagonists.\nIn 2005, his film ''[[Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World]]'' was dropped by [[Sony Pictures]] due to their desire to change the title. [[Warner Independent Pictures]] purchased the film and gave it a limited release in January 2006; the film received mixed reviews and a low box office gross. The movie goes back to the days of Brooks's ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', as Brooks once again plays himself, a filmmaker commissioned by the U.S. government to see what makes the Muslim people laugh, thus sending him on a tour of India and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2006 he appeared in the documentary film ''[[Wanderlust (2006 film)|Wanderlust]]'' as David Howard from \"Lost in America\".

Like all red giants, the true size of Antares is uncertain based on the uncertainties like the star's distance and luminosity, so the 300 million kilometre radius shown here tends towards minimum of the range of published values. Antares may well be much larger.]]\nAntares A is a red [[supergiant star]] with a [[stellar classification]] of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class.<ref name=perkins/> Due to the nature of star, the derived [[parallax]] measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately {{Convert|550|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the [[Sun]].<ref name=aaa474_2_653/>\n\n===Luminosity and mass===\nThe [[Absolute magnitude|brightness]] of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the [[Sun]], but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], the true [[bolometric luminosity]] is around 100,000 times that of the Sun.  There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more.  There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example {{solar luminosity|75,900}} and {{solar luminosity|97,700}} published in 2012 and 2013.<ref name=Pecaut/><ref name=ohnaka2013/>\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be approximately {{solar mass|12}},<ref name=Pecaut/> or {{solar mass|11 to 14.3}}.<ref name=ohnaka2013/>  Comparison of the [[effective temperature]] and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a  progenitor mass of {{solar mass|17}} and an age of 12 million years (MYr),<ref name=\"Pecaut\"/> or an initial mass of {{solar mass|15}} and an age of 11 to 15 MYr.<ref name=ohnaka2013/>  Massive stars like Antares are expected to become [[supernova]]e.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\"/>\n\n===Size===\n[[File:VLTI reconstructed view of the surface of Antares.jpg|left|thumb|[[Very Large Telescope|VLTI]] reconstructed view of the surface of Antares]]\n\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star.  Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths within the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed.<ref name=Ireland2004/>  In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by {{solar radius|165}} or 19%.<ref name=Pecaut/>  It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind [[radial velocity]] changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.<ref name=pugh2013/>\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using [[interferometry]] or observing [[Occultation|lunar occultation]]s events.  An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 \u00b1 0.1 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|milliarcseconds]] has been published.<ref name=richichi/>  Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a [[Limb darkening|limb-darkened]] disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere.  The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as {{val|37.38|0.06|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2009 and {{val|37.31|0.09|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2010.  The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance.  However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.  Using the [[Hipparcos]] satellite's [[parallax|trigonometric parallax]] of {{val|5.40|1.68|u=\"}}<ref name=\"HIPPARCOS\"/>) leads to a radius of about {{solar radius|680}}.<ref name=ohnaka2013/>  Older radii estimates exceeding {{solar radius|850}} were derived from older measurements of the diameter,<ref name=pugh2013/> but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths.<ref name=ohnaka2013/> Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], which is almost 30 times larger in terms of volume, or [[VV Cephei]] A and [[Mu Cephei]].\n\n===Variable star===\nAntares is a type ''LC'' [[slow irregular variable]] star, whose [[apparent magnitude]] slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0.  There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or {{val|1,650|640}} days.<ref name=kiss/>  No separate long secondary period has been detected,<ref name=percy/> although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.<ref name=kiss/>\n\n===Position===\n[[File:Antares near the Sun every year around 2 December.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Antares near the Sun on 30 November. This date may vary between 30 November and 2 December every year]]\nAntares is visible in the sky all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at [[opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]] to the [[Sun]].

For approximately two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun;<ref name=\"LASCO\"/> this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[declination]] is significantly south of the celestial equator.\n\nAntares is 4.57 degrees south of the ecliptic, one of four first magnitude stars within 6.5\u00b0 of the ecliptic (the others are [[Spica]], [[Regulus]] and [[Aldebaran]]) and so can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the Moon. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East.<ref name=iota/><ref name=timesofindia/> Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5\u00b0 north of Antares.<ref name=\"LASCO\"/>\n\n===Companion star===\n[[File:Antares overlooking an Auxiliary Telescope.jpg|thumb|Antares seen from ground.<ref>{{cite web|title=Antares overlooking an Auxiliary Telescope|url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1744a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>]]\nAntares has a magnitude 5.5 companion star, Antares B, that changed from an angular separation (from its primary, Antares A) of 3.3 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcseconds]] in 1854 to 2.67\" +/-0.01\" in 2006.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dave|first=Gault,|last2=Brian|first2=Loader,|date=September 2006|title=Determining the Separation and Position Angle of Antares A-B during Lunar Occultation|bibcode=2006SouSt..45c..14G|journal=Southern Stars|language=en|volume=45|issue=3|issn=0049-1640}}</ref> It was first observed by Scottish astronomer [[James William Grant (astronomer)|James William Grant]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] while in [[India]] on 23 July 1844.<ref>https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Grant,_James_William_(DNB00)</ref> The last is equal to a [[projected separation]] of about 529 [[astronomical unit]]s (au) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the separation of the pair. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is about 224&nbsp;au beyond the primary.<ref name=aaa474_1_229/> Antares B is a [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main-sequence star]] of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares A.<ref name=aaa474_1_229/>\n\nThe companion star is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares A, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=schaaf/> The companion is often described as green, but this is probably either a [[contrast effect]],<ref name=\"kaler\" /> or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares A is hidden by the [[Moon]]. It was discovered by [[Johann Tobias B\u00fcrg]] during one such occultation on April 13, 1819,<ref name=burnham/> but until its existence was confirmed in 1846 it was thought by some to be merely the light of Antares viewed through the Moon's atmosphere (which at the time was theorised to exist).<ref name=\"Johnson1879\">S.J.

Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. [[Venus]] (called a planetary occultation), but these events are extremely rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will take place on November 17, 2400.<ref>''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'' {{ISBN|978-1-345-66291-7}} p. 155</ref> Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, and nor will this occur during the next millennium, as the planets following the [[ecliptic]] always pass northward of Antares due to the actual planetary node positions and inclinations.<ref>''NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe'' {{ISBN|978-0-713-67939-7}} p. 46</ref>\n\n===Supernova progenitor===\n[[File:Star-sizes.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Relative sizes of some planets in the Solar System and several well-known stars, including Antares<br />\n1.

For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n==Other names==\nIn the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\". In [[MUL.APIN]], which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and marks breast of the Scorpion goddess Ishhara.<ref name=rogers/> Later names that translate as \"the Heart of Scorpion\" include ''{{lang|la|Calbalakrab}}'' from the Arabic ''{{transl|ar|Qalb al-\u0386qrab}}''.<ref name=kunitzsch/>  This had been directly translated from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c5}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kardia Skorpi\u016b}}''. ''{{lang|la|Cor Scorpii}}'' translated above Greek name into [[Latin]].''<ref name=\"allen\" />\n\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Antares may have been known by the following names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (\"the Lord of the Seed\"), Kak-shisa (\"the Creator of Prosperity\"), Dar Lugal (\"The King\"), Masu Sar (\"the Hero and the King\"), and Kakkab Bir (\"the Vermilion Star\").<ref name=\"allen\" /> In ancient [[Egypt]], Antares represented the scorpion goddess [[Serket]] (and was the symbol of [[Isis]] in the pyramidal ceremonies).<ref name=\"allen\" />\n\nIn [[Persia]], Antares was known as ''Satevis'', one of the four \"[[royal stars]]\".<ref>Allen, R. H. (1963): According to [[Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dupuis]], a French astronomical writer</ref> In [[India]], it with [[Sigma Scorpii|Sigma]] and [[Tau Scorpii]] were [[Jyeshtha (nakshatra)|Jyeshth\u0101]] (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one  of  the ''[[nakshatra]]'' ([[Hindu]] [[lunar mansion]]s).<ref name=\"allen\"/> The ancient Chinese called Antares ''({{zh|c=\u5fc3\u5bbf\u4e8c|p=X\u012bnxi\u00f9'\u00e8r|l=second star of mansion Heart}})'', because it was the second star of the mansion ''[[Heart (Chinese constellation)|Xin]]'' (\u5fc3). It was the national star of the [[Shang Dynasty]], and it was sometimes referred to as ({{zh|c=\u706b\u661f|p=Hu\u01d2x\u012bng|l=fiery star}}) because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people]] of New Zealand call Antares ''Rehua'', and regard it as the chief of all the stars. Rehua is father of ''[[Puanga]]/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]]), an important star in the calculation of the M\u0101ori calendar. The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (''Balayang'') as the brother of ''Bunjil'' ([[Altair]]).<ref name=mudrooroo/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stars and planetary systems in fiction#Antares (Alpha Scorpii)|Antares in fiction]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=kiss>{{cite journal|last1=Kiss|first1=L.

Aldebaran is the red dot to the right, barely visible in the thumbnail.]]\nAldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find in the [[night sky]], partly due to its brightness and partly due to its spatial relation to one of the more noticeable [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] in the sky. If one follows the three stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]'s belt from left to right (in the Northern Hemisphere) or right to left (in the Southern), the first bright star found by continuing that line is Aldebaran.\n\nSince the star is located (by chance) in the line of sight between the Earth and the Hyades, it has the appearance of being the brightest member of the more scattered [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] [[open star cluster]] that makes up the bull's-head-shaped asterism; however, the star cluster is actually more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.\n\nAldebaran is 5.47 degrees south of the [[ecliptic]] and can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]]. Such occultations occur when the Moon's [[ascending node]] is near the [[autumnal equinox]]. A series of 49 occultations occur starting at 29 January 2015 and ending at 3 September 2018.<ref name=konnen>{{cite journal|bibcode=1972JBAA...82..431K|title=Occultation series of five stars|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume=82|pages=431|author1=K\u00f6nnen|first1=G.

The closest conjunction of a planet with Aldebaran in the 21st century occurred on 9 July 2012, when Venus passed Aldebaran 56' northward. However, in far past and future, occultations of Aldebaran by Mercury and Venus have and will occur as result of wandering nodes.

However these measurements are difficult to make because the dim B component appears so close to the bright primary star. The resulting margin of error is too large to positively establish (or exclude) a physical relationship between the two stars. So far neither the B component, nor anything else, has been unambiguously shown to be physically associated with Aldebaran.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Statistical studies of visual double and multiple stars.

It is currently principally funded by direct grants from the Australian government, but is expressly independent of Government and politics. The ABC plays a leading role in journalistic independence and is fundamental in the [[history of broadcasting in Australia]].\n\nIt is modelled on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in the United Kingdom, and was originally financed by consumer licence fees on broadcasting receivers. Licence fees were abolished in 1973 and replaced principally by direct government grants, as well as revenue from commercial activities related to its core broadcasting mission.\n\nThe ABC now provides television, radio, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia and overseas through [[ABC Australia (Asia-Pacific Television)|ABC Australia]] and [[Radio Australia]]. The ABC headquarters is in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], an inner-city suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].\n\n==Origin==\nFounded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], the ABC was a Government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers, authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system. The \"A\" system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers, with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas, whilst the \"B\" system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology. Following the general downward economic trends of the era, as entrepreneurial ventures in National infrastructure struggled with viability, the \"Company\" was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932 and renamed as '''Australian Broadcasting Commission''', re-aligning more closely to the British, BBC model.\n\nThe ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name=\"abc-act83\" /> changed the name of the organisation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, effective 1 July 1983.<ref name=\"abc-act83\" /> Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''.<ref name=\"abc-act83\" />\n\nThe ABC is sometimes informally referred to as \"Aunty\",<ref name=\"NewTeethForAunty\">{{cite web |title=New Teeth for Aunty: Reinvigorating the National Broadcaster |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/reinvigorating-national-broadcaster-new-teeth-aunty-robert-manne-749 |date=1 December 2007 | work=Monthly |author=Robert Manne|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/aunty-celebrates-75th-birthday-in-townsville/2503718|title=Aunty celebrates 75th birthday in Townsville|last=|first=|date=16 July 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=1 August 2018|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/06/28/3534787.htm|title=Why I love Aunty at 80|last=|first=|date=28 June 2012|website=ABC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> originally in imitation of the [[BBC#Attitudes toward the BBC in popular culture|British Broadcasting Corporation's nickname]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |title=Aunty, a personality of steady and solid conservatism |work=Background briefing 4 \u2013 Ken Inglis |publisher=Friends of the ABC |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127091453/http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}\n\n===1920s\u201340s===\n{{See also|Australian Broadcasting Company}}\n[[File:ABC Mobile Studio Caravan.jpg|thumb|ABC mobile studio [[Travel trailer|caravan]], used for concerts presented by the ABC at army camps and other locations, 1940]]\n\nThe first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney on 23 November 1923 under the call sign 2SB with other stations in Melbourne, [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Hobart]] following.<ref name=\"abcradio100\">{{cite web\n| title = Celebrating 100 Years of Radio \u2013 History of ABC Radio\n| publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n| url = http://abc.net.au/radio/celebrate100/history.htm\n| accessdate =3 October 2007\n}}</ref> A licensing scheme, administered by the [[Postmaster-General's Department]], was soon established allowing certain stations government funding, albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content.<ref name=\"langdon95\">{{cite web | year = 1996\n | first = Jeff | last = Langdon | title = The History of Radio in Australia\n | publisher = Radio 5UV| url = http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RADIO_HIST_AUS.html\n | archive-url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RADIO_HIST_AUS.html\n | dead-url = yes\n | archive-date = 3 March 2004\n | accessdate =16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a 1927 [[royal commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations.

The ABC under Boyer and general manager [[Charles Moses]] invested as best it could in the cultural capital of the nation, establishing viable symphony orchestras and seizing on the potential of television....

In addition, [[ABC DiG|DiG Radio]] launched on digital platforms in 2002, currently offering three separate stations.\n\n[[ABC Local Radio]] is the Corporation's flagship radio station in each broadcast area. There are 54 individual stations, each with a similar format consisting of locally presented light entertainment, news, talk back, music, sport and interviews, in addition to some national programming such as ''AM'', ''PM'', ''[[The World Today (Australian radio program)|The World Today]]'', sporting events and ''Nightlife''.\n\nABC Grandstand is a live radio sports focused commentary and talk-back program which runs on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation local radio network across Australia and on one digital-only station. The program runs on Saturdays and Sundays, typically from noon or an hour before, until 6 pm.\n\nDouble J is aimed at over-30s alternative music listeners. It is owned and operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nABC Jazz was launched as a digital only station designed to broadcast a variety of different jazz styles including bebop, acid jazz, cool jazz and contemporary styles of Jazz.\n\nTriple J Unearthed is where artists upload their music and they play and judge it on the channel.\n\nABC Extra is for special events national Digital Radio channel brings you extra coverage of events and ideas that matter.\n\nABC Radio Australia is the international radio station.\n\nABC Country features country style music.\n\n[[Radio National]] broadcasts more than 60 special interest programmes per week covering a range of topics including music, comedy, book readings, radio dramas, poetry, science, health, the arts, religion, social history and current affairs.\n\n[[ABC NewsRadio]] is a rolling news service, previously known as the [[Parliamentary and News Network]]. The service was established to broadcast federal parliamentary sittings, to relieve the local ABC radio network from this intermittent task, and to provide a news service at other times. The network broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter-hour. Much of its news content is produced by the ABC itself, however many programmes are relayed from the [[BBC World Service]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio Netherlands]] and [[CNN Radio]].\n\n[[ABC Classic FM]] was the ABC's first FM radio service. It was originally known simply as \"ABC FM\", and for a short time{{quantify|eg \"until [year] as\"|date=April 2013}} \"ABC Fine Music\". Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the Fine Music Network, as well as [[BBC Radio 3]].\n\n[[Triple J]] is the national youth radio network, and broadcasts contemporary alternative and independent music; it is targeted at people aged 18\u201335. While the network plays music from around the world, it has a strong focus on local artists. Triple J was formerly known as \"Double Jay\" when it launched in Sydney on 19 January 1975.\n\nABC Radio broadcasts regular news bulletins across most of its radio stations.  Many of these bulletins are heralded by the \"[[Majestic Fanfare]]\", written by British composer [[Charles Williams (composer)|Charles Williams]] in 1935.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|ABC Television}}\n\nThe ABC operates 6 national television channels.\n\nABC is a TV channel that consists of programs of:\n* Art and Culture: Stories I Want To Tell You In Person, The A-Z Of Contemporary Art,\n* Current Affairs: 7.30, ABC News, Australian Story, Back Roads, Four Corners, Insiders, Landline, Media Watch, Q&A, The Drum.\n* Comedy: Birds of a feather, Growing Up Gracefully, It's A Date, Luke Warm Sex, Shaun Micallef's MAD AS HELL, Utopia\n* Documentaries and Factual: Antiques Roadshow, Ask The Doctor, Back Roads, Brian Cox: Life Of A Universe, Catalyst, City In The Sky, Compass, David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive, Dream Build, Enigma Man: A Stone Age Mystery, Grand Designs, Grand Designs New Zealand, The Checkout, Q&A, Joanna Lumley's India, Mary Berry's Absolute Favourites, Media Watch.\n* Drama: Agatha Raisin, Cleverman, Death In Paradise, Doc Martin, Father Brown, Happy Valley, Humans, Line Of Duty, Midsomer Murders, Prime Suspect 1973, Pulse\n* Entertainment: Adam Hills: The Last Leg, Eggheads, Gardening Australia, Grand Designs, Growing Up Grafefully, Hard Quiz, Pointless, QI, Antiques Roadshow, Short Cuts To Glory, The Checkout, The House,  You Can't Ask That\n* Indigenous: Cleverman\n* Environment: Wild Life At The Zoo, Landline, Gardening Australia\n* News: 7.30, ABC News, Australian Story, Back Roads, Four Corners, Insiders, Landline, Media Watch, Offsiders, Q&A, The Drum.\n* Sport: Golf: PGA TOUR Highlights, Offsiders\n* Special Events\n* Science: Ask The Doctor, Becoming Superhuman, Brian Cox: Life Of A Universe, Catalyst, Gardening Australia, Humans, Stargazing Live, Todd Sampson's Life On The Line\n\nABC HD has the same programs as ABC but is in [[High-definition television|high definition]].\n\nABC Comedy has comedy and was renamed on 4 December 2017 from ABC 2.\n\nABC Me is another TV channel, but with a focus for primary school children, 6\u201315 years old.

In the early years of television, the ABC had been using [[Lissajous curve]]s as fillers between programmes. In July 1963, the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles.<ref name=\"atvh-50s60s\">{{cite web |title=AusTVHistory: Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1950s\u20131960s |url=http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |publisher=Aus TV History |author=Brooklyn Ross-Hulands |accessdate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007030333/http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |archivedate = 7 October 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Memoirs of a Space Engineer \u2013 about Doug Rickard | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 19 October 2000 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/memoirs/about.htm | accessdate =30 January 2008 }}</ref> In 1965, ABC graphics designer Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the [[cathode ray oscilloscope]] displays, submitted a design which was part of the waveform from an oscilloscope. The letters \"ABC\" were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with [[Australian pound|\u00a3]]25 for his design.<ref name=\"atvh-50s60s\"/>\n\nOn 19 October 1974, the Lissajous curve design experienced its first facelift with the line thickened to allow for colour to be used. It would also be treated to the \u2018over and under\u2019 effect, showing the crossover of the line in the design. This logo would be served as the longest-running design with a lifespan of 44 years and 28 on its first on-air run. To celebrate its 70th anniversary on 1 July 2002, the ABC adopted a new logo, which was created by (Annette) Harcus Design in 2001. This logo utilized a silver 3D texture but the crossover design was left intact. This logo would then be used across the ABC's media outlets. However, some brands may continue to use this logo. The 2002 silver logo is no longer in use by the corporation, with the exception of some of the ABC's radio station logos. After the on-air revival of the 1974 logo since 2014, the ABC gradually reinstated the classic symbol while using a new logotype in 2018. The change comes with a press release that the ABC released on 12 February announcing a new brand positioning under its tagline, ''Yours''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television in Australia}}\n* [[History of broadcasting in Australia]]\n* [[Pool (website)|Pool]], a website hosted by the ABC\n* [[Timeline of Australian radio]]\n* [[Gold Walkley]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  Cater, Nick ''The Lucky Culture and the Rise of an Australian Ruling Class '' (2013) pp 199\u2013228\n*  Curgenven, Geoffrey.

Its low elevation on the [[Nile delta]] makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is an important industrial center because of its [[natural gas]] and [[Pipeline transport|oil pipeline]]s from [[Suez]]. Alexandria is also a popular tourist destination.\n\nAlexandria was founded around a small, [[ancient Egypt]]ian town {{circa|332 BC}} by [[Alexander the Great]]. It became an important center of [[Hellenistic civilization]] and remained the capital of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman and Byzantine Egypt]] for almost 1,000 years, until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in AD&nbsp;641, when a new capital was founded at [[Fustat]] (later absorbed into [[Cairo]]). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (''Pharos''), one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]; its [[Great Library]] (the largest in the ancient world; now replaced by a [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|modern one]]); and the [[Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa|Necropolis]], one of the [[Wonders of the Middle Ages|Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages]]. Alexandria was at one time the second most powerful city of the ancient Mediterranean region, after [[Rome]]. Ongoing [[maritime archaeology]] in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in 1994, is revealing details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named [[Rhacotis]] existed there, and during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].\n\nFrom the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the [[Red Sea]], and the lucrative trade in [[Egyptian cotton]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Alexandria|Timeline of Alexandria}}\n\n===Ancient era===\n{{hiero |''raqd(y).t'' (Alexandria) |<hiero>r:Z1:a A35 t::niwt</hiero>''', or '''\n<br/><hiero>r:a qd d:i*i t:niwt</hiero> |align=left |era=default}}\n[[File:Alexander1256.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander The Great]]]]\n\nAlexandria is believed to have been founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in April 331 BC as {{lang|el|\u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}} (''Alexandreia''). Alexander's chief architect for the project was [[Dinocrates]]. Alexandria was intended to supersede [[Naucratis]] as a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich [[Nile]] valley. Although it has long been believed only a small village there, recent [[radiocarbon dating]] of seashell fragments and lead contamination show significant human activity at the location for two millennia preceding Alexandria's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dofundodomar.blogspot.com/2006/05/sediments-reveal-alexandrias-hidden.html|title=Do fundo do mar...

The city and its museum attracted many of the greatest scholars, including Greeks, Jews and Syrians. The city was later plundered and lost its significance.<ref name=\"FPAl\">{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/23/lighthouse-dims-egypt-alexandria-salafists-mubarak-sisi-longform/ |title=The Lighthouse Dims |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Christian Church, the city was the center of the [[Patriarchate of Alexandria]], which was one of the major centers of early Christianity in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. In the modern world, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] both lay claim to this ancient heritage.\n\nJust east of Alexandria (where [[Abu Qir Bay]] is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] and [[Heracleion]]. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.\n\nAn Egyptian city, [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]], already existed on the shore  and later gave its name to Alexandria in the [[Egyptian language]] (Egyptian '''*Ra\u02c1-\u1e32\u0101\u1e6dit''', written ''r\u02c1-\u1e33\u1e6dy.t'', 'That which is built up'). It continued to exist as the Egyptian quarter of the city. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to his city. After Alexander's departure, his [[viceroy]], [[Cleomenes of Naucratis|Cleomenes]], continued the expansion. Following a struggle with the other successors of Alexander, his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy Lagides]] succeeded in bringing Alexander's body to Alexandria, though it was eventually lost after being separated from its burial site there.<ref>O'Connor, Lauren (2009) \"The Remains of Alexander the Great: The God, The King, The Symbol,\" ''Constructing the Past'': Vol. 10: Iss. 1, Article 8</ref>\n\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's continuous development, the ''[[Heptastadion]]'' and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than [[Carthage]]. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with [[Greeks|Greek people]] from diverse backgrounds.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece & Rome, 2nd Ser., |volume=42 |issue=1 |date = April 1995|pages=38\u201348 [42] |quote=One effect of the newly created Hellenistic kingdoms was the imposition of Greek cities occupied by Greeks on an alien landscape.

The [[Septuagint]], a Greek version of the [[Tanakh]], was produced there.

The assertion of Greek culture serves to enforce Egyptian subjection.

Texts from other cultures could be kept in the library, but only once they had been translated, that is to say Hellenized.<br/>[\u2026] A reading of Alexandrian poetry might easily give the impression that Egyptians did not exist at all; indeed Egypt itself is hardly mentioned except for the Nile and the Nile flood, [\u2026] This omission of the Egypt and Egyptians from poetry masks a fundamental insecurity.

Although the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]] recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] captured it during the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], after a [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|siege]] that lasted 14 months.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Ridaniya]] in 1517, the city was conquered by the [[Ottoman Turks]] and remained under [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman rule]] until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of [[Rosetta]] during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the [[Mahmoudiyah Canal]] in 1807.\n\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition to Egypt]] in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801.

He was the disciple of Sheikh Abu Abbas El Mursi, who was the disciple of Abu El Hasan El Shadali, who is known to be a servant of God. Abu Abbas was the author of the Hizb El Bahr and was famous for piety and miracles. Abu Abd Allah El Murshidi was a great interpreting saint that lived secluded in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. He lived alone but was visited daily by emirs, viziers, and crowds that wished to eat with him. The Sultan of Egypt (El Malik El Nasir) visited him, as well. Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/502998972|title=The travels of Ibn Battuta in the Near East, Asia and Africa|last=1304-1377.|first=Ibn Batuta,|date=2009|publisher=Cosimo|others=Lee, Samuel, 1783-1852.|isbn=9781605206219|location=New York|oclc=502998972}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)]], Julius Caesar's civil war\n*[[Battle of Alexandria (30 BC)]], final war of the Roman Republic\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (619)]], Byzantine-Persian Wars\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (641)]], Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\n*[[Alexandrian Crusade]] (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\n*[[Battle of Alexandria|Battle of Alexandria (1801)]], Napoleonic Wars\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (1801)]], Napoleonic Wars\n*[[Alexandria expedition of 1807|Alexandria expedition (1807)]], Napoleonic Wars\n\n==Layout of the ancient city==\n[[File:Macedonian Army Alexander.jpg|thumb|[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Army]]\n\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\n;Brucheum\n:the Royal or Greek quarter, forming the most magnificent portion of the city. In [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]] Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\n;The Jewish quarter\n:forming the northeast portion of the city;\n;Rhakotis\n:The old city of [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]] that had been absorbed into Alexandria was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Rakot\u0259'' \"Alexandria\").\n[[File:Canopic Street Alexandria 1784 by LF Cassa.png|thumb|[[Engraving]] by L F Cassas of the [[Canopic Street]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]] made in 1784.]]Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about {{convert|sp=us|60|m|ft}} wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]) rose. This point is very near the present [[mosque]] of [[Nebi Daniel]]; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\n\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a {{convert|1260|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[mole (architecture)|mole]] and called the ''Heptastadion'' (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek [[unit of length]] measuring approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\n\nIn [[Strabo]]'s time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\n#The [[Palace|Royal Palaces]], filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land [[subsidence]] here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\n#The Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by [[Julius Caesar]] as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the [[battle of Pharsalus]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{clarify|reason=Caesar retreated from a mob??|date=July 2014}}\n#The [[Poseidon]], or [[Greek temple|Temple]] of the Sea God, close to the theater\n#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]]\n#The Emporium (Exchange)\n#The Apostases (Magazines)\n#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\n#Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s, which become known as \"[[Cleopatra's Needle]]s,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\n#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\n#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; alexandria west.\n#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\n#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theater in the same region; site unknown.\n#The [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.\n\nThe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be {{convert|138|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]) completed it, at a total cost of 800&nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s. It took 12&nbsp;years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\n\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens,<ref>Rostovtzeff 1941: (1138\u201339)</ref> according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves.

Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god [[Serapis]] were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\n\nAlexandria's [[catacombs]], known as ''[[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom El Shoqafa]]'', are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large [[Stairway|spiral staircase]], and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other [[syncretism|syncretic]] Romano-Egyptian [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]], burial niches, and [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased.

It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its [[Thermae|Roman-era baths]].\n\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n[[File:Magna temple1.JPG|thumb|right|Side view of The Temple of Taposiris Magna.]]\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. [[Cleopatra VII]]'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual [[subsidence]] in the 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |title=Fgs Project Alexandria |publisher=Underwaterdiscovery.org |date= |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307175057/http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2010 }}</ref> This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] and his [[underwater archaeology|team]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |title=Divers probe underwater palace |publisher=BBC News |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}</ref> It raised a noted head of [[Caesarion]].

Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense [[catacombs]] and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\n\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in [[Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa|Kom El Shoqafa]] (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\n\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of [[Kom El Deka]], which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\n\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n===Temple of Taposiris Magna===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus.

The [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] was second only to the bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] until 430. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] and the [[Melkite]]s. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In the 19th century, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\n\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|Saint Mark Cathedral]] in Ramleh. The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include [[Cyril of Alexandria|Pope Cyril I]] Church in Cleopatra, [[Saint George]]s Church in Sporting, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Pope Peter I]] Church in Sidi Bishr, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, [[Saint Menas|Saint Mina]] Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|Saint Takla Haymanot's Church]] in Ibrahimeya.\n\nThe most important [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches in Alexandria are [[Holy Unmercenaries|Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi]] Church, Church of the [[Annunciation]], [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]] Church, [[Gabriel|Archangels Gabriel]] & [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Church, Taxiarchon Church, [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] Church, Cathedral of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] Church, [[Saint George]] Church, Church of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Ibrahemeya, [[Saint Joseph]] Church in Fleming, [[Joseph of Arimathea|Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] Church, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nektarios]] Chapel in Ramleh, [[Saint Nicholas]] Church, [[Paraskevi of Rome|Saint Paraskevi]] Church, [[Saint Sava]] Cathedral in Ramleh, [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] Chapel and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] church of [[Alexander Nevsky|Saint Alexander Nevsky]] in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\n\nThe [[Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said]] has jurisdiction over all [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its [[Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan]], which uses the [[Byzantine Rite]], and the nominal see of the [[Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria]] (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the [[Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]], using the [[Armenian Rite]].\n\nThe Saint Mark Church in [[Shatby]], founded as part of [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]], is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and Coptic Orthodox rites.\n\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called [[Gnosticism]] (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n===Judaism===\n[[File:Egyptian Alexandria Jewish girls during BatMitzva.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish girls during [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bat Mitzva]] in Alexandria]]\n{{see also|History of the Jews in Egypt}}\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], after which negative reactions towards [[Zionism]] among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established [[Israel]], [[France]], [[Brazil]] and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s.

[[Alexandria University]] is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its [[Alexandria Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] & [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]]. In addition, [[Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology]] in [[New Borg El Arab]] city, its is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010, the [[Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport]] is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC [[American University in Cairo]] because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. [[Senghor University|Universit\u00e9 Senghor]] is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly targets students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include [[Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology|Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT)]] and [[Pharos University in Alexandria]].\n\n===Schools===\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by [[Catholic]] missionaries include [[Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu]], Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]], Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the [[Istituto \"Don Bosco\"]].\n\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, [[British School of Alexandria]], Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, [[Schutz American School, Alexandria|Schutz American School]], [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]], [[Manar English Girls School|El Manar Language School for Girls]] (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and [[El Nasr Girls' College]].\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are [[Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4erinnen Alexandria|Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen]] (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and [[Future Deutsche Schule]].\n\nThe [[Montessori education|Montessori]] educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at [[Alexandria Montessori]].\n\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Borg El Arab International Airport..jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Borg El Arab International Airport]]\n\n===Airports===\nAlexandria is served by [[El Nouzha Airport]] which is currently closed and [[Borg El Arab Airport]] which is located about {{convert|sp=us|25|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the city center.\n\nFrom late 2011, Alexandria International Airport was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of [[Borg El Arab Airport]] from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed in February 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A new gateway for Alexandria |newspaper=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/954/sk1.htm |postscript=<!--None--> |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904072239/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/954/sk1.htm |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}</ref>\nIn 2017 the government officially announced that Alexandria International Airport will shut down for good due to operational reasons, after having initially announced that it was to open during mid-2017.\n\n===Highways===\n*International Coastal Road ([[Mersa Matruh]] \u2013 Alexandria \u2013 [[Port Said]])\n*[[Cairo\u2013Alexandria desert road|Cairo\u2013Alexandria Desert Road]] (Alexandria \u2013 Cairo \u2013 {{convert|220|km|sp=us|0|abbr=on}}, 6\u20138 lanes)\n*Cairo-Alexandria Agriculture Road (Alexandria \u2013 [[Cairo]])\n*Mehwar El Ta'meer \u2013 (Alexandria \u2013 [[Borg El Arab]])\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Misr Train Station, Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Misr Railway Station]]\nAlexandria's intracity [[commuter rail]] system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity [[railway station]]) to [[Abu Qir]], parallel to the [[Alexandria Tram|tram line]]. The commuter line's [[locomotive]]s operate on [[diesel locomotive|diesel]], as opposed to the [[railway electrification system#Overhead systems|overhead-electric]] tram.\n\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned [[Misr Station]] (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and [[Sidi Gaber railway station]] (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]].\n\n===Trams===\n{{Main|Trams in Alexandria}}\n[[File:The yellow tram passing through Saad Zaghloul's square.jpg|thumb|An Alexandria tram]]\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the [[Mahatet El Raml|El Raml district]] in the west and ends in the [[Victoria (neighborhood)|Victoria district]] in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at [[Bolkly]] (Isis) and ends at [[San Stefano (neighborhood)|San Stefano]]. The other begins at [[Sporting (neighborhood)|Sporting]] and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. It has also the cafe tram which costs 5 L.E\n\n'''The Tram stations:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n\n1.

Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.\n[[File:Alexandria harbour (February 2007).jpg|thumb|Alexandria port]]\nFare is generally L.E. 3.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.\n\n===Port===\n{{Main|Alexandria Port}}\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port, which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country\u2019s exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate.

It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and [[Egypt]]. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria.

[[Alexandria Stadium]] is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]]. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006 African Cup of Nations]]. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the [[Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations]] in January 2006, which [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] won. Sea sports such as [[surfing]], [[Personal water craft|jet-skiing]] and [[water polo]] are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the [[Alexandria Sporting Club]], which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the [[Egypt national basketball team|country's national team]] with key players. The city hosted the [[AfroBasket]], the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\n\nAlexandria has four [[stadium]]s:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Alexandria Stadium]]\n*[[Borg El Arab Stadium]]\n*El Krom Stadium\n*[[Harras El Hodoud Stadium]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are usually played in private [[Social club|social]] and [[sports club]]s, like:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Acacia Country Club\n*Alexandria Sporting Club \u2013 in \"[[Sporting, Alexandria, Egypt|Sporting]]\"\n*Alexandria Country club\n*[[Al Ittihad Alexandria Club]]\n*[[Olympic Club (Egypt)|Olympic Club]]\n*[[Haras El Hodoud SC]] Club\n*[[Koroum]] Club\n*Lagoon Resort Courts\n*[[Smouha SC]] \u2013 in \"[[Smouha]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Theaters===\n*[[Alexandria Opera House]], where classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera are performed.\n\n===Tourism===\nAlexandria is a main summer resort and [[Tourism in Egypt|tourist attraction]], due to its public and private beaches and ancient history and [[Museum]]s, the art that appears in the building especially in the oldest building and the ancient decorations of the hotels, especially the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]], based on reviving the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]].\n\nOne of the main tourism attractions that start every year from the city is [[Cross Egypt Challenge]]. Started in 2011, Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt. Alexandria is known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city.\n\nThe Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are located in Alexandria, Egypt. the catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria\u2019s acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity.

The area developed as an assemblage of traders, [[Caddo people]], and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north and providing a link from the south to the [[Old San Antonio Road|El Camino Real]] and then larger settlement of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], the oldest permanent settlement in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].\n\n[[Alexander Fulton (Louisiana)|Alexander Fulton]], a [[business]]man from [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]], near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], received a land grant from Spain in 1785, and the first organized settlement was made at some point in the 1790s. In 1805, Fulton and business partner Thomas Harris Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town in Fulton's honor. The earliest deed that survives for an Alexandria resident is from June 24, 1805 when a William Cochren, who identifies himself as a \"of the Town of Alexandria\", sold a tract of land across the Red River to a William Murrey.<ref>[Louisiana State Land Office, Historical Records, Sales Documents, South Western District, Sales Letters, 39]</ref>\n\nThat same year Fulton was appointed [[coroner]] in Rapides Parish by [[Louisiana Territory|territorial]] [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[William C.C.

Banks]]. Porter arrived with his gunboats on May 7. Later in the day Banks reached Alexandria with his [[cavalry]], whose members had marched twenty-five miles that day to reach the city. According to the [[historian]] [[John D. Winters]] of Louisiana Tech University, Porter disliked Banks but nevertheless turned over Alexandria to him and then departed to rejoin [[General]] [[U.S. Grant]] at the ongoing [[siege of Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]]. Banks posted guards and declared [[martial law]]. Porter left behind the gunboat ''[[USS Lafayette (1848)|USS Lafayette]]'' in Alexandria and posted the ''[[USS Pittsburgh (1861)|USS Pittsburg]]'' on the [[Black River (Louisiana)|Black River]] to the northeast.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, p. 235</ref>\n\nIn 1864, Admiral Porter returned to the area and quarreled with General Banks over possession of [[cotton]] supplies. Porter seized three hundred bales of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cotton from various warehouses in Alexandria and stamped it \"U.S.N. prize\", referring to the [[United States Navy]]. Porter sent his sailors into the country to search for unginned cotton. After the crop was located, it was brought to Alexandria to be ginned and baled. The sailors also seized [[molasses]] and [[wool]]. Winters writes that Porter \"took all cotton wherever he found it, cotton belonging to the Confederate government, cotton belonging to the 'rebels,' and cotton belonging to 'loyal' citizens.\"<ref>Winters, p. 331</ref>\n\nWinters continues: \"Banks was furious with Porter when he learned that the admiral was scouring the interior for cotton. Since he had no authority to stop Porter's speculative activities, Banks could only try to beat him to the remaining cotton. Army wagons were sent out in large numbers to collect the cotton. Thousands of bales were brought in by the troops and stored for future shipment. Jealous of the abundant transportation facilities of the army, unprincipled navy men stole army wagons and teams at night, repainted the wagons, and branded the mules with navy initials, and dove deep in the country in search of cotton. . . . \"<ref>Winters, pp. 331-332</ref>\n\nThe federal army made itself as comfortable as possible during its long stay in Alexandria. Winters writes that \"lumber and tools were foraged, and the men busied themselves by building wooden tent floors, benches, and furniture. . . . Alexandria [was enclosed] with a zigzag line of fortifications.\"<ref>Winters, pp. 366-367</ref> While Banks remained in Alexandria in the spring of 1864, Porter was temporarily trapped north of the city because of the low level of the Red River, four feet instead of the needed seven feet to accommodate gunboats.<ref>Winters, pp. 367-369</ref>\n\nConfederate citizens as a whole were most fearful of the Union. According to Winters, \"most [Confederates] had never before seen a Yankee soldier [and] expected the worse from the invader. . . . 'Some cried, some cursed, some whined; and some overcome with fear, hid themselves in the woods, leaving everything to the tender mercies of the army.' Negroes were responsible for much of the plunder and pillage. Negro camp followers and officers' servants roamed the plantations and small farms without hindrance, bringing in their booty to camps each afternoon. . . . \"<ref>Winters, p. 236</ref>\n\nOn May 13, 1864, when the Union decided to abandon Alexandria, the city was set afire despite General Banks' order to the contrary. Winters reports that \"burning and plundering\" by two Union corps, who set fire to a store on Front Street. Then \"a strong wind spread the flames rapidly from one building to the next.\"<ref>Winters, pp. 373-374</ref> Banks later claimed that the fire \"broke out in the attic of one of the buildings on the [[levee]] inhabited by either soldiers or refugees.\"<ref name=\"Winters, p. 374\">Winters, p. 374</ref> Winters reports that \"pandemonium reigned; frightened cows bellowed and charged through the flaming streets; squawking chickens with scorched wings tried to fly out of danger. Hundreds of women, children, and old people ran through the streets, trying to carry a few of their belongings to safety. When the heat became unbearable, they dropped their loads and fled to the levee. Thieves ran from house to house and even along the levee taking whatever they wanted from the shocked people. By noon the most congested parts of town were destroyed. An attempt to blow up a church in the path of the fire only succeeded in helping to spread the flames. . . . \"<ref name=\"Winters, p. 374\"/>\n\nAlexandria faced the overwhelming task of rebuilding with a year of the war remaining. Prices became exorbitant; butter cost $10 a pound, bacon $5 a pound, flour $3 a pound, and a bushel of meal $10. Many of the helpless lived in the forest without food, shelter, or clothing, subsisting on [[blackberry|blackberries]]. All clothing was homespun, and shoes were mostly made of cloth.<ref>Winters, pp. 386-387</ref> While Admiral Porter expressed sympathy for the suffering Alexandria residents, he declared the \"burning of Alexandria a fit termination of the unfortunate Red River expedition.\"<ref name=\"Winters, p. 374\"/>\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nAlexandria is located at {{Coord|31|17|34|N|92|27|33|W}}<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> and has an elevation of {{convert|75|ft|1}}.<ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|27.0|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which 26.4 square miles (68.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) is land and 0.6 square mile (1.5&nbsp;km\u00b2) (2.15%) is water.\n\n[[File:Bayou Rapides in Alexandria, LA IMG 1082.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Trees cast shadows over Bayou Rapides east of MacArthur Drive in Alexandria]]\n\n[[File:AlexandriaRitaDamage.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexandria gas station awning damaged by [[Hurricane Rita]]]]\n\nAlexandria is on a level plain in the center of the Louisiana [[Longleaf Pine]] [[forest]]s, in which pine is interspersed with various [[hardwood]]s. A number of small [[bayou]]s, such as Bayou Rapides, Bayou Robert, and Hynson Bayou, meander throughout the city. In the immediate vicinity of the city, [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[alfalfa]], and garden vegetables are cultivated.\n\nThe climate is [[humid subtropical]] with some continental influence in the winter. Summers are consistently hot and humid, whereas winters are mild, with occasional cold snaps. On average, the first freeze occurs in early to mid November and the last freeze occurs in early to mid March. The area receives plentiful rainfall year-round, with thunderstorms possible throughout the year. Some storms can be severe, especially during the spring months. According to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Alexandria reports an average of 69 days per year with thunder reported, which is nearly double the national average. Snowfall is rare, with measurable snow having occurred 27 times since 1895. The heaviest snowfall event took place February 12\u201313, 1960 when 9.1\" of snow fell.<ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/?n=climate</ref><ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/?n=snowclimo</ref><ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/?n=e0124-2814</ref>\n\nTropical storms and hurricanes affect Alexandria from time to time, but rarely cause severe damage, unlike areas closer to the coast. In September 2005 [[Hurricane Rita]] moved inland and affected Alexandria and surrounding areas, causing widespread power outages and damaging the roofs of some structures. The most recent hurricane, [[Hurricane Gustav|Gustav]] in 2008, caused widespread flooding, knocked over trees and power lines leading to power outages, and damaged structures. Some low-lying Alexandria neighborhoods had substantial flooding from Gustav, leaving several feet of water in houses.\n\n{{Weather box | width = auto\n| location = Alexandria, Louisiana, 1981\u20132010 normals\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high F = 87\n| Feb record high F = 88\n| Mar record high F = 93\n| Apr record high F = 98\n| May record high F = 99\n| Jun record high F = 106\n| Jul record high F = 109\n| Aug record high F = 108\n| Sep record high F = 109\n| Oct record high F = 98\n| Nov record high F = 89\n| Dec record high F = 85\n| year record high F = 109\n| Jan high F = 59.0\n| Feb high F = 62.7\n| Mar high F = 70.0\n| Apr high F = 77.3\n| May high F = 84.5\n| Jun high F = 90.2\n| Jul high F = 92.8\n| Aug high F = 93.3\n| Sep high F = 88.6\n| Oct high F = 79.6\n| Nov high F = 69.6\n| Dec high F = 60.7\n| Jan mean F = 48.5\n| Feb mean F = 52.1\n| Mar mean F = 59.3\n| Apr mean F = 66.4\n| May mean F = 74.5\n| Jun mean F = 80.7\n| Jul mean F = 83.2\n| Aug mean F = 83.2\n| Sep mean F = 78.0\n| Oct mean F = 68.0\n| Nov mean F = 58.6\n| Dec mean F = 50.2\n| year mean F = 66.9\n| Jan low F = 38.1\n| Feb low F = 41.6\n| Mar low F = 48.6\n| Apr low F = 55.5\n| May low F = 64.4\n| Jun low F = 71.1\n| Jul low F = 73.6\n| Aug low F = 73.1\n| Sep low F = 67.4\n| Oct low F = 56.4\n| Nov low F = 47.5\n| Dec low F = 39.9\n| year low F = 56.4\n| Jan record low F = 4\n| Feb record low F = 3\n| Mar record low F = 22\n| Apr record low F = 31\n| May record low F = 38\n| Jun record low F = 50\n| Jul record low F = 57\n| Aug record low F = 55\n| Sep record low F = 40\n| Oct record low F = 27\n| Nov record low F = 20\n| Dec record low F = 7\n| year record low F = 3\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation inch = 5.44\n| Feb precipitation inch = 5.21\n| Mar precipitation inch = 5.30\n| Apr precipitation inch = 4.55\n| May precipitation inch = 4.72\n| Jun precipitation inch = 5.14\n| Jul precipitation inch = 4.39\n| Aug precipitation inch = 4.11\n| Sep precipitation inch = 3.93\n| Oct precipitation inch = 5.26\n| Nov precipitation inch = 6.19\n| Dec precipitation inch = 6.24\n| year precipitation inch = 60.37\n| unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n| Jan precipitation days = 9.6\n| Feb precipitation days = 8.6\n| Mar precipitation days = 8.1\n| Apr precipitation days = 6.1\n| May precipitation days = 7.8\n| Jun precipitation days = 9.6\n| Jul precipitation days = 8.6\n| Aug precipitation days = 8.3\n| Sep precipitation days = 6.9\n| Oct precipitation days = 7.1\n| Nov precipitation days = 7.6\n| Dec precipitation days = 9.3\n| year precipitation days = 97.6\n| source 1 = NOAA<ref name= \"NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data\">\n  {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=lch\n  |title = NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = 2013-11-16}}\n</ref> NOAA<ref name= \"Summary of Monthly Normals 1981-2010\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/\n| title = Summary of Monthly Normals 1981-2010\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 2011-11-16\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 814\n|1850= 672\n|1860= 1461\n|1870= 1218\n|1880= 1800\n|1890= 2861\n|1900= 5648\n|1910= 11213\n|1920= 17510\n|1930= 23025\n|1940= 27066\n|1950= 34913\n|1960= 40279\n|1970= 41811\n|1980= 51648\n|1990= 49188\n|2000= 46342\n|2010= 47723\n|estyear=2016\n|estimate=47832\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|footnote=[https://web.archive.org/web/20060208103743/http://www.census.gov:80/prod/www/abs/decennial/ U.S. Decennial Census]\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=September 11, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> of 2010, there were 47,723 people, 17,816 households, and 11,722 families residing in the city.

Large congregations include [[Emmanuel Baptist Church (Alexandria, Louisiana)|Emmanuel Baptist Church]] downtown on Jackson Street and Calvary Baptist off Jackson Street Extension. Alexandria is also headquarters of the [[Louisiana Baptist Convention]]. A significant [[Roman Catholic]] population is also present,<ref>[http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/Metro/0220_2000.asp The Association of Religion Data Archives | Maps & Reports]</ref> a result of the large Catholic [[Cajun|Acadian]] French population which resides in and around Alexandria, many from neighboring [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles Parish]].

There is a large number of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] too. Alexandria has a small, though active [[Judaism|Jewish]] community which dates back to the mid-19th century.  Jews have consistently been leaders in government, civic organizations, education, and medicine.  The long-time Alexandria City Council member, Harry B. Silver, is Jewish. From 1973 to 1977, another Jew, [[Arnold Jack Rosenthal]], was the last commissioner of finance and utilities under the previous [[City commission government|commission form of municipal government]].  At one time, many large businesses in the downtown were Jewish-owned, with prominent stores including: Wellan's, Caplan's, Bialy's, Weiss & Goldring and Schwartzberg's.  The Jewish community in Alexandria maintains two [[synagogue]]s, which are approximately two blocks apart: [[Congregation Gemiluth Chassodim]] (Reform) and [[B'nai Israel Traditional Synagogue]] (Conservative).\n\n==Annual cultural events and festivals==\n\n===Mardi Gras===\n\n[[File:AMGA Krewes Parade.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mardi Gras float in the AMGA Krewes Parade in Alexandria.]]\n\nAs Alexandria is at the cusp of [[Cajun]] culture's extension to the north, the city recognizes [[Mardi Gras]] as an official holiday. The annual Mardi Gras Krewes Parade \u2013 occurring on the Sunday before Mardi Gras \u2013 on Texas Avenue is a major cultural festivity in the area. It is featured as a family-oriented event, and parade goers can enjoy over 20 New Orleans style floats, high school and college marching bands, as well as appearances by local celebrities. In addition to the main Sunday parade, the College Cheerleaders & Classic Cars Parade, which was established in 2008, takes place downtown on the Friday before Mardi Gras, the Children's Parade takes place downtown on the Saturday before Mardi Gras, and the Krewe of Provine Parade is held on [[Fat Tuesday]], processing along Coliseum Boulevard.

The building was built c. 1898 and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The museum opened to the public in March 1998. In 1998, the Alexandria Museum of Art expanded and constructed its grand foyer and offices as an annex to the Rapides Bank Building. In 1999, the Alexandria Museum of Art was honored as an Outstanding Arts Organization in the Louisiana Governor's Arts Awards. In 2007, the Alexandria Museum of Art entered into a collaborative endeavor agreement with Louisiana State University of Alexandria (LSUA). The Alexandria Museum of Art now also serves as a downtown campus for LSUA classes, and is host to multidisciplinary community events, including concerts and recitals, lectures, yoga classes, Second Saturday Markets, and Museum Afterhours.\n\nThe [[Louisiana History Museum]] is located downtown on the bottom floor of the former library. A small facility, it showcases the history of all Louisiana, with emphasis on the central portion of the state, Rapides Parish, and Alexandria. Major exhibit areas concern [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], Louisiana geography, politics, health care, farming, and the impact of war.\n\nThe T.R.E.E. House Children's Museum and [[Arna Bontemps]] African American Museum are located within the Cultural Arts District.\n\nThe [[Kent Plantation House]] in Alexandria, completed by 1800, was located on a Spanish land grant. It is the oldest standing structure in Central Louisiana, one of only two buildings in the city to survive the burning of 1864 by Union troops fleeing after having been defeated at the [[Battle of Mansfield]] in [[DeSoto Parish, Louisiana|DeSoto Parish]]. The house has been moved from its original location but is still located on part of the first land grant. It is open for tours daily except Sundays at 9, 10, and 11 a.m. and 1, 2, and 3 p.m. The tour is led by costumed docents and includes the house furnished in period pieces, some belonging to the original family, and all nine outbuildings, including an 1840-50s sugar mill, [[blacksmith]] shop, barn, two slave cabins, open-hearth kitchen, and milk house.\n\n==Performing arts==\n\nThe performing arts are centered in the Alexandria Cultural Arts District in the downtown. Located within a few blocks of each other are three performance venues: Coughlin-Saunders Performing Arts Center, the Hearn Stage, and the Riverfront Amphitheater.\n\nThe Coughlin-Saunders Performing Arts Center is the home of the Rapides Symphony Orchestra, which has performed in Alexandria since 1968. The center hosts the Performing Arts Series of the Arts Council of Central Louisiana, the Red River Chorale (an auditioned community chorus), and presentations of numerous local theater groups. The land for the center was donated by ''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|The Alexandria Town Talk]]'' newspaper, owned by the [[Gannett Company]] of [[McLean, Virginia|McLean]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]].\n\nBusinesswoman Jacqueline Seagall Caplan (1935-2016) was the president of the Arts Council of Central Louisiana and the chairman of the group's executive committee when the Coughlin-Saunders Performing Arts Center opened in 2004. She predicted that Coughlin-Saunders would in time \"provide a place people can point to and say it's theirs. ... [Until now], we've never had a performing arts center where every type of performing art can come.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/2016/07/30/alexandrias-jacque-caplan-dies-81/87839566/|title=Alexandria's Jacque Caplan dies at 81|publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk''|date=July 31, 2016|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Hearn Stage is a black box theater for smaller productions.

The Rapides Symphony holds an annual fall Pops concert in the amphitheater.

The Bentley, which was closed on December 12, 2004, was once one of only two four-star hotels in Louisiana. The hotel was set to reopen in August 2007, in time for the 100th anniversary of its construction, but was prevented by funding issues. The current owner, Michael Jenkins, purchased the Bentley for $3.4 million. His plan is to keep the older portion of the building to remain a hotel and turn the 7-story tower portion into luxury condominiums, and also to reopen Bentley's restaurant and Mirror Room lounge. The hotel and all of its components were to have been opened by the summer of 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130308/news01/303080336/buyer-hopes-reopen-alexandria-s-hotel-bentley-summer |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411234059/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130308/news01/303080336/buyer-hopes-reopen-alexandria-s-hotel-bentley-summer |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |title=Buyer hopes to reopen Alexandria's Hotel Bentley this summer |date=March 8, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 }}</ref> but the hotel remained unfinished as of November 2014.\n\n=== Central Alexandria ===\nCentral Alexandria is bounded by MacArthur Drive, Masonic Drive, Mason Street, the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway, and the Red River.\n*'''Downtown''' - location of the Alexandria Cultural Arts District.\n*'''West End'''\n*'''Garden District''' \u2013 contains many large historical homes and brick roads.

On September 29, 1868, the city was granted a new charter with a government consisting of a Mayor, Treasurer, and Justice of the Peace. Nine aldermen represented the four wards of the city \u2013 two from each ward and one elected at-large.\n\nIn 1912, the [[Lawrason Act]] established Alexandria municipal government in a strong mayor format, where the mayor was also the Commissioner of Public Health and Safety (Police, Fire, Sanitation). There were separate Commissioners of Streets and Parks and Finance and Utilities, elected citywide. The last to hold those positions, which ended in 1977, were Mayor [[John K. Snyder]] (1922\u20131993), Malcolm P. Hebert, Sr. (1926\u20132006), and [[Arnold Jack Rosenthal]] (1923\u20132010), respectively.\n\n==== Today ====\nAlexandria has a mayoral-council system of government.  The Mayor serves as the executive branch of the local government. The current Mayor \u2013 [[Jacques Roy (mayor)|Jacques Roy]] \u2013 was elected to office in November 2006, succeeding long-time mayor [[Ned Randolph|Edward Gordon \"Ned\" Randolph, Jr.]] Randolph had succeeded John K. Snyder.\n\nThe City Council serves as the legislative branch. The five districts of the city are represented on the Council; in addition there are two council members elected to serve as at-large representatives of the city.\n\nThe Alexandria Court has a limited jurisdiction, consisting of the citizens of Wards 1, 2 and 8 in [[Rapides Parish]]. Within those boundaries the court has the power to hear and decide both criminal and civil cases, rule in civil cases and hand down judgment for punishment in criminal cases.\n\n=== Area politics ===\n\nOverall, the people of the Alexandria area tend to be [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]]. Even though the majority typically elects Republicans in national elections, they vote for Democrats in local elections, many of which are not contested by the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.\n\n=== United States Congressional district ===\nFrom 1913 to 1993, Alexandria served as the seat of [[Louisiana's 8th congressional district|Louisiana's Eighth Congressional district]].  A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] seat, it was held by the [[Huey P. Long|Long family]] for nearly half of its existence, from 1953 to 1987, broken only by the two terms of [[Harold B. McSween]] and three terms of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Clyde Holloway]] of [[Forest Hill, Louisiana|Forest Hill]]. The seat was removed after the 1990 census indicated Louisiana no longer had the population to support it. The district was split among the [[Louisiana's 4th congressional district|Fourth]], [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district|Fifth]] and [[Louisiana's 6th congressional district|Sixth Congressional districts]]. Alexandria is now in the Fifth district and was represented from 2003 to 2013 by [[Rodney Alexander]], a Democrat-turned-Republican. From November 2013 to January 2015 the representative is [[Vance McAllister]] of [[Ouachita Parish, Louisiana|Ouachita Parish]].\n\n==Education==\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n\n[[File:LSUA sign in Alexandria, LA IMG 1149.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Louisiana State University at Alexandria]] off [[U.S. Highway 71]] south]]\n\n[[File:Entrance to Louisiana College, Pineville, LA IMG 4369.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Entrance to [[Southern Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in Pineville]]\n\nSituated south of the city, [[Louisiana State University at Alexandria]] (or LSUA) is a regional campus of the state's flagship university system, [[Louisiana State University]].  From its establishment in 1959, the campus offered only two-year degrees; students seeking baccalaureate degrees had to commute or move to the main campus in [[Baton Rouge]] in order to gain a four-year degree.  After 1976, students could either commute or telecommute in order to attend upper level courses, including graduate classes.  In 2002, following approval by the Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors and the [[Louisiana]] [[Board of Regents]] the Louisiana Legislature passed legislation allowing LSUA to offer baccalaureate degrees.\n\nA four-year degree is also attainable through [[Southern Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in Pineville, founded in 1906.\n\nAlexandria also has one of the Region 6 Louisiana Technical College campuses.\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\n[[File:Bolton High School, Alexandria, LA IMG 4265.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Bolton High School in the [[Alexandria Garden District]]]]\n\n[[File:Menard High School, Alexandria, LA IMG 1158.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Holy Savior Menard Central High School]] on [[Louisiana Highway 28]] West]]\n[[Rapides Parish School Board]] operates public schools.\n\nAlexandria has three public high schools: [[Bolton High School (Louisiana)|Bolton High School]], [[Alexandria Senior High School]], and [[Peabody Magnet High School]]. In addition, there are two private high schools: the Roman Catholic [[Holy Savior Menard Central High School]], and Grace Christian.\n\nThe [[Renaissance Home for Youth]] west of Alexandria is a haven for youthful offenders who live in a group-home setting as an alternative to [[reform school]] or adult jail. Since the facility opened in 1973, nearly 12 thousand young people have lived at the home in search of rehabilitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://renaissancehome.org/history/ |title=Renaissance: Our History |publisher=renaissancehome.org |accessdate=March 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913084728/http://www.renaissancehome.org/history/ |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20130412034216/http://abja-sda.com/ Alfred Booker Junior Academy] proudly follows faith- centered education for all students Pre-Kindergarten through eighth grade.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Roads ===\nAlexandria serves as the crossroads of [[Louisiana]]. To reach either [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] or [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] from the southern portion of the state, the easiest method of travel takes the driver through Alexandria.  Likewise, if a visitor is to head from the northern portion of the state to the [[Cajun]] portions of the state ([[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]), or the greater metropolitan areas of either [[Baton Rouge]] or [[New Orleans]], the easiest method of travel involves driving down [[Interstate 49]] through Alexandria.\n\nIn addition to [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]], travelers can follow Louisiana 1 up to Alexandria from Baton Rouge and points south.  Also, Highway 167 could be taken from Opelousas north to Ruston, crossing through Alexandria at one of the few bridges over the Red River in central Louisiana.  Highways 165 and 71 also link Alexandria and points south with the northern and southern portions of the state via the Curtis-Coleman bridge.\n\nThere are possible plans for a 50-mile, 4 lane beltway to encircle Alexandria and Pineville. As of now, it is only in the planning stages of development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kalb.com/story/14493914/beltway-to-loop-cenla-could-be-on-its-way |title=Beltway to Loop Cenla Could Be On Its way |publisher=KALB-TV News Channel 5 |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160448/http://www.kalb.com/story/14493914/beltway-to-loop-cenla-could-be-on-its-way |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Bridges ===\nThree road bridges cross the Red River in the Alexandria area.  They are:\n*The '''Purple Heart Memorial Bridge'''. Part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway (also referred to as the Cottingham Expressway), it connects [[Interstate 49]] to Highway 167 by crossing the Red River from downtown Alexandria to [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. It replaced the Fulton Street Bridge and has six lanes of traffic.  Designed by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD), the bridge cost $15.9 million in federal and state funds. The northbound portion was completed in 1995, the southbound in 1998.\n\n[[File:Jackson St. bridge.JPG|thumb|200px|Jackson Street Bridge]]\n*The '''U.S. 165 Business Bridge''' (alternatively, the '''Gillis Long Bridge''', the '''Red River Bridge''' or the '''Jackson Street Bridge''') connecting downtown Pineville with the business district in Alexandria. It is a two-lane vertical-lift bridge with a sidewalk/bikepath on either side. The bridge is named after U.S. Representative Gillis Long, who represented Louisiana's Eighth Congressional District. It was built in 1985 to replace the '''Murray Street Bridge'''.\n*The '''Oscar K. Allen Bridge''' connecting Highway 165/71 on both sides of the Red River. It is a two-lane K-truss type bridge, named after Governor [[Oscar K. Allen]]. It was built in 1936 to connect Alexandria to the (former) Fort Buhlow. A new four-lane (two lanes in each direction) bridge is being built beside the aging OK Allen Bridge (appropriately named the Fort Buhlow Bridge) and should be open in mid-2013.  At that time [[US 165]] will be completely four-laned for most of its traverse of Louisiana.\n\nFormer bridges include:\n*The '''Murray Street Bridge'''.  One of the first bridges in Alexandria.  A two-lane steel truss swing bridge, it decayed over time, finally being demolished in 1983.  The approach on the Alexandria side was turned into a river overlook as part of the Alexandria Levee Park.\n*The '''Fulton Street Bridge'''.  Named after Fulton Street which it connected with Highway 167. Technically part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway, it was a four-lane steel vertical-lift bridge.  It was demolished in 1994 to make way for the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.\n\nThere are two railroad bridges over the Red River in Alexandria. One is located near the Buhlow area north of the OK Allen bridge. The other is south of the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.\n\n=== Mass transit ===\nRegional mass transit is handled by '''ATRANS''' (Alexandria Transportation Authority).\n\nFor those leaving or arriving at the city by bus, [[Greyhound Lines]] has a terminal downtown.\n\n=== Airports ===\nAlexandria is served by the [[Alexandria International Airport (Louisiana)|Alexandria International Airport]] and the [[Esler Regional Airport]] in Pineville.\n\n=== Rail ===\nAlexandria does not have [[Amtrak]] service, nor a commuter rail system. The [[Kansas City Southern Railway|Kansas City Southern]] and the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]] (since absorbed by [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]]) operated train stations in the area in the early part of the 20th century but these have since closed.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Red River at Alexandria, LA IMG 1134.JPG|Scenic view of the [[Red River of the South]] taken from [[levee]] in Alexandria\nFile:Downtown Third Street in Alexandria, LA IMG_4316.JPG|Another view of Third Street in Alexandria\nFile:Christmas chapel, Alexandria, LA IMG_4311.JPG|[[Christmas]] chapel is a seasonal exhibit near Alexandria City Hall.\nFile:Louisiana State Office Building, Alexandria, LA IMG_4267.JPG|Louisiana State Office Building in Alexandria\nFile:Health and Human Services, Alexandria, LA IMG_4317.JPG|Human Services in Alexandria occupies a former financial institution building at 429 Murray Street downtown.\nFile:Chase Bank in Alexandria, LA IMG_4334.JPG|[[Chase Bank]] in Alexandria absorbed the former Rapides Bank and Trust Company location at 400 Murray Street.\nFile:Missouri Pacific station, Alexandria, LA IMG 1138.JPG|Former [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] [[railroad station|depot]] in downtown [[historic]] district\nFile:Rapides Parish Courthouse (lower view) IMG 1142.JPG|Lower view of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]] Courthouse in Alexandria\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Alexandria (Louisiana)}}\n{{Commons category|Alexandria, Louisiana}}\n{{EB1911 Poster|Alexandria (Louisiana)|Alexandria, Louisiana}}\n* [http://www.cityofalexandriala.com/ City of Alexandria] : Government and community services.\n* [http://www.thetowntalk.com/ The Town Talk] : Alexandria's Local Daily Newspaper.\n* [http://www.kalb.com/ KALB-TV] : Alexandria's local NBC and CBS station.\n* [http://www.klax-tv.com/ KLAX-TV] : Alexandria's local ABC station.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130728123653/http://www.comevisitalexandriala.com/ Visit Alexandria] : Business Directory.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070310095215/http://www.theriverfest.com/ River Fest]\n\n{{Rapides Parish, Louisiana}}\n{{Alexandria, Louisiana}}\n{{Louisiana parish seats}}\n{{Louisiana}}\n{{Alexandria, Louisiana Mayors}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Alexandria, Louisiana| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Cities in Rapides Parish, Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Parish seats in Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1785]]\n[[Category:Cities in Alexandria, Louisiana metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Cities in the Central Louisiana]]\n[[Category:1785 establishments in New Spain]]", "sha1": "fnh0usvsn3wrjbyx9iloribqlyerz7e"}}, {"title": "Alexandria Troas", "ns": "0", "id": "3085", "revision": {"id": "865324865", "parentid": "865323737", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T06:03:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Botteville", "id": "347079"}, "comment": "/* top */ width on pic", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox ancient site\n|name = Alexandria Troas\n|native_name = {{lang|el|\u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03a4\u03c1\u03c9\u03ac\u03c2}}<br/>{{lang|tr|Eski Stambul}}\n|alternate_name = Sigeia, Antigonia Troas, Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas, Troas\n|image = Troas Therme 2.JPG\n|alt = \n|caption = [[Thermae]] in Aleaxandria Troas\n|map_type = Turkey\n|map_alt = \n|map_size = 270\n|coordinates = {{coord|39|45|06|N|26|09|31|E|display=inline,title}}\n|location = Dalyan, [[\u00c7anakkale Province]], [[Turkey]]\n|region = [[Troad]]\n|type = Settlement\n|part_of = \n|length = \n|width = \n|area = {{convert|400|ha|abbr=on}}\n|height = \n|builder = \n|material = \n|built = \n|abandoned = \n|epochs = <!-- actually displays as \"Periods\" -->\n|cultures = \n|dependency_of = \n|occupants = \n|event = \n|excavations = \n|archaeologists = \n|condition = \n|ownership = \n|management = \n|public_access = \n|website = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n|notes = \n}}\n[[File:Alexandreia-Smintheus.jpg|275px|thumb|Coin ([[Didrachm]]) of Alexandreia, 102-66 BC.

However, Pliny's view is not correct, because the city continued being called Alexandria Troas, and so is also stated in the 4th-5th c. AD Tabula Peutingeriana. As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a \"free and autonomous city\" as early as 188&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"Lendering\"/> and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday the city may have had a population of about 100,000.<ref name=\"Jewett\"/> [[Strabo]] mentions that a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] was created at the location in the reign of [[Augustus]], named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period).

It was originally built in 1906 as the [[Argyll Motor Works]], for [[Argyll (car)|Argyll Motors Ltd]]. A carving above the entrance shows one of the company's cars. After the car production ceased in 1914 it was used by the [[Admiralty]] for the manufacture of [[torpedo]]es, which were test-fired in [[Loch Long]], and in the early 1970s was the scene of the [[Plessey]] sit-in.<ref name=wdc>{{cite web |url=http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/tourism-and-visitor-attractions/museums-and-galleries/collections/industry/argyll-motor-works/ |title=Argyll Works |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=28 August 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130828140953/http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/tourism-and-visitor-attractions/museums-and-galleries/collections/industry/argyll-motor-works/ |archive-date=2013-08-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nAlexandria sits on the former [[A82 road|A82]] main road between [[Glasgow]] and [[Loch Lomond]].

These are strict inequalities if {{math|''x'' \u2260 ''y''}}.\n\n{{math|''M''(''x'', ''y'')}} is thus a number between the geometric and arithmetic mean of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}; it is also between {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.\n\nIf {{math|''r'' \u2265 0}}, then {{math|''M''(''rx'',''ry'') {{=}} ''r M''(''x'',''y'')}}.\n\nThere is an integral-form expression for {{math|''M''(''x'',''y'')}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n M(x,y) &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\div \\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{x^2\\cos^2\\theta+y^2\\sin^2\\theta}}\\\\\n        &= \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cdot \\frac{x + y}{K\\left( \\frac{x - y}{x + y} \\right)}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''K''(''k'')}} is the [[elliptic integral|complete elliptic integral of the first kind]]:\n\n:<math>K(k) = \\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - k^2\\sin^2(\\theta)}} </math>\n\nIndeed, since the arithmetic\u2013geometric process converges so quickly, it provides an efficient way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula.

Thus, by the [[monotone convergence theorem]], the sequence is convergent, so there exists a {{math|''g''}} such that:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}g_n = g</math>\n\nHowever, we can also see that:\n\n:<math>a_n = \\frac{g_{n + 1}^2}{g_n}</math>\n\nand so:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}a_n = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{g_{n + 1}^2}{g_{n}} = \\frac{g^2}{g} = g</math>\n\n[[Q.E.D.]]\n\n==Proof of the integral-form expression==\nThis proof is given by Gauss.<ref name=\"BerggrenBorwein2004\" />\nLet\n\n:<math>I(x,y) = \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{x^2\\cos^2\\theta+y^2\\sin^2\\theta}},</math>\n\nChanging the variable of integration to <math>\\theta'</math>, where\n\n:<math> \\sin\\theta = \\frac{2x\\sin\\theta'}{(x+y)+(x-y)\\sin^2\\theta'}, </math>\n\ngives\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nI(x,y) &= \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{d\\theta'}{\\sqrt{\\bigl(\\frac12(x+y)\\bigr)^2\\cos^2\\theta'+\\bigl(\\sqrt{xy}\\bigr)^2\\sin^2\\theta'}}\\\\\n       &= I\\bigl(\\tfrac12(x+y),\\sqrt{xy}\\bigr).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThus, we have\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nI(x,y) &= I(a_1, g_1) = I(a_2, g_2) = \\cdots\\\\\n  &= I\\bigl(M(x,y),M(x,y)\\bigr) = \\pi/\\bigr(2M(x,y)\\bigl).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe last equality comes from observing that <math>I(z,z) = \\pi/(2z)</math>.\n\nFinally, we obtain the desired result\n\n:<math>M(x,y) = \\pi/\\bigl(2 I(x,y) \\bigr). </math>\n\n==The AGM method==\n[[Gauss]] noticed<ref>{{cite journal |author=B.

He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful [[manga]] series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', before going on to create ''[[Dragon Ball]]''\u2014his best-known work\u2014and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series, ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]''. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly ''Dragon Ball,'' which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.\n\nHe earned the 1981 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for best ''[[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' or ''[[sh\u014djo manga|sh\u014djo]]'' manga with ''Dr. Slump'', and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful [[anime]] series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, ''Dragon Ball'', would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold more than 350 million copies worldwide, it is the [[List of best-selling manga|second best-selling manga of all time]] and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, ''Dragon Ball''{{'}}s anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world.\n\n==Early life==\nAkira Toriyama was born in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.

It is also a member of the large and diffuse [[Ursa Major moving group]]. Historically, the star was frequently used in [[celestial navigation]] in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 [[navigational stars]].{{ref label|1728|1|^}}\n\n==Stellar properties==\n[[Image:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Ursa Major.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Book plate by [[Sidney Hall]] depicting Ursa Major's stars]]\n\nAccording to ''[[Hipparcos]]'', Alioth is {{convert|81|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the [[Sun]]. Its [[spectral type]] is [[Ap and Bp stars|A1p]]; the \"p\" stands for ''[[Peculiar star|peculiar]]'', as its [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]] is characteristic of an [[Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable]]. Alioth, as a representative of this type, may harbor two interacting processes. First, the star's strong [[magnetic field]] separating different elements in the star's [[hydrogen]] 'fuel'. In addition, a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth. The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange [[spectral line]]s that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days.   The ''kB9'' suffix to the spectral type indicates that the [[calcium]] K line is present and representative of a B9 spectral type even though the rest of the spectrum indicates A1.\n\nWith Alioth, the rotational and magnetic axes are at almost 90 degrees to one another. Darker (denser) regions of [[chromium]] form a band at right angles to the equator.\n\nA recent study{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} suggests Alioth's 5.1-day variation may be due to a substellar object of about 14.7 Jupiter masses in an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) with an average separation of 0.055 [[astronomical unit]]s.\n\nAlioth has a relatively weak magnetic field, 15 times weaker than \u03b1 CVn, but it is still 100 times stronger than that of the Earth.\n\n==Name and etymology==\n\n''\u03b5&nbsp;Ursae Majoris'' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to ''Epsilon Ursae Majoris'') is the star's [[Bayer designation]].\n\nThe traditional name ''Alioth'' comes from the [[Arabic]] ''alyat'' (fat tail of a sheep). In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organized a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)<ref name=\"WGSN\">{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/working_groups/280/ | title=IAU Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref> to catalog and standardize proper names for stars.

It utilizes a Motorola 68000 microprocessor running at {{nowrap|7.15909 [[MHz]]}} (NTSC) or {{nowrap|7.09379 MHz}} (PAL). The CPU implements a 32-bit model, has 32-bit registers and 32-bit internal data bus, but it has a 16-bit main [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], uses a 16-bit external data bus and 24-bit address bus, providing a maximum of 16&nbsp;MB of [[address space]].\n\nThe earliest Amiga 500 models use nearly the same [[Original Amiga chipset]] as the Amiga 1000.<ref>Agnus was enhanced to control up to 1&nbsp;MB [[Random access memory|RAM]] and glue logic was integrated into [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] to reduce costs.</ref> So graphics can be displayed in multiple resolutions and color depths, even on the same screen.

Each hardware channel has its own independent volume level and sampling rate, and can be designated to another channel where it can modulate both volume and frequency using its own output.  With [[Direct memory access|DMA]] disabled it's possible to output with a sampling frequency up to {{nowrap|56 kHz}}.  There's a common trick to [[Original Chip Set#Audio|output sound with 14-bit precision]] that can be combined to output 14-bit {{nowrap|56 kHz}} sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aminet.net/package/mus/play/Play16 |title=Aminet: mus/play/Play16.lha |date=2003-11-09 |accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref>\n\nThe stock system comes with [[AmigaOS]] version 1.2 or 1.3 and {{nowrap|512 KiB}} of [[Amiga Chip RAM|chip RAM]] (150 ns access time), one built-in double-density [[floppy disk drive|standard floppy disk drive]] that is completely programmable and can read {{nowrap|720 KiB}} [[IBM PC]] disks, {{nowrap|880 KiB}} standard Amiga disks, and up to {{nowrap|984 KiB}} using custom-formatting drivers.\n\nDespite the lack of [[Amiga Zorro II|Amiga 2000-compatible internal expansion slots]], there are many ports and expansion options. There are two [[D-subminiature|DE9M]] [[Atari joystick port]]s for [[joystick]]s or [[mouse (computing)|mice]], stereo audio ([[RCA connector]]s 1&nbsp;V [[peak-to-peak|p-p]]).

This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] to provide output on [[television]]s with a coaxial RF input, while monochrome [[composite video]] is available via an [[RCA connector]] (also coaxial). There is also a Zorro bus expansion on the left side (behind a plastic cover). Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's [[AutoConfig]] standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to {{nowrap|8 MB}} of so-called \"fast RAM\" (memory that can be accessed by the CPU only) can be added using the side expansion slot.  This connector is electronically identical with the Amiga 1000's, but swapped on the other side.\n\nThe Amiga 500 has a \"trap-door\" slot on the underside for a RAM upgrade (typically of {{nowrap|512 KiB}}). This extra RAM is classified as \"fast\" RAM, but is sometimes referred to as \"slow\" RAM: due to the design of the expansion bus, it is actually on the chipset bus. Such upgrades usually include a battery-backed [[real-time clock]]. All versions of the A500 can have the additional RAM configured as chip RAM by a simple hardware modification, which involves fitting a later model (8372A) [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip. Likewise, all versions of the A500 can be upgraded to {{nowrap|2 MB}} chip RAM by fitting the {{nowrap|8372B Agnus}} chip and adding additional memory.\n\nThe Amiga 500 also sports an unusual feature for a budget machine, socketed chips, which allow easy replacement of defective chips. The CPU can be directly upgraded on the motherboard to a [[Motorola 68010|68010]]; or to a [[Motorola 68020|68020]], [[Motorola 68030|68030]], or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] via the side expansion slot; or by removing the CPU and plugging a CPU expansion card into the CPU socket (though this will require opening the computer and voiding any remaining warranty).  In fact, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) versions.\n\nThe case is made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastics which may become brown with time. This may be reversed by using the [[public-domain]] chemical mix \"[[Retr0bright]]\", though without a clearcoat to block oxygen, the brown colouring will return.\n\nWhenever the computer is powered on a self-diagnostic test is run that will show any failure with a specific colour where {{background color|green|&nbsp;&nbsp;}} medium green means no chip RAM found or is damaged, {{background color|red|&nbsp;&nbsp;}} red means bad [[Kickstart (Amiga)|kickstart]]-[[Read-only memory|ROM]], {{background color|#DFDF00|&nbsp;&nbsp;}} yellow means the [[central processing unit|CPU]] has crashed (no trap routine or trying to run bad code) or a bad [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro]] [[expansion card]].<ref>[http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=497 abime.net - Question blinking power LED/no screen on Amiga 500] read 2011-11-03</ref>\n{{background color|blue|&nbsp;&nbsp;}} Blue means custom chip problem ([[Denise (OCS)|Denise]], [[Paula (computer chip)|Paula]], or [[Original Chip Set#Agnus|Agnus]]),\n{{background color|lime|&nbsp;&nbsp;}} {{nowrap|light green}} means [[MOS Technology CIA|CIA]] problem.\nStopping on {{background color|silver|&nbsp;&nbsp;}} {{nowrap|light gray}} means that the CIA might be defective. {{nowrap|{{background color|black|&nbsp;}} {{background color|black|&nbsp;}} Black and white stripes}}<!--verify?--> mean there is a ROM or [[MOS Technology CIA|CIA]] problem, while\n{{background color|black|&nbsp;&nbsp;}} black only (no video) means there is no video output.<ref name=a3b>[http://amiga.serveftp.net/A3000_HardwareGuide/booting-problems.html amiga.serveftp.net - A3000 Booting Problems] read 2011-11-03</ref>\nThe keyboard [[light-emitting diode|LED]] uses blink codes: one blink means the keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure.<ref name=a3b/> Using [[Caps Lock]] key and getting a response means [[MOS Technology CIA|CIA]] and the CPU works.<ref name=a3b/> There is no guarantee that every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is '''very''' brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so there is no guarantee that any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvqZuIs8uJg youtube.com - Discussion relating to incorrect diagnostic of green screen fault on Amiga 500] retrieved 2017-03-02</ref>\n\n== Technical specifications ==\n[[Image:Amiga 1.3 and disks.jpg|thumb|right|The standard Amiga 500 requires floppies to boot]]\n* [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] (1.2 & 1.3 models) or [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] (1.3 and 500+ 2.04 models) chipset.

The A1000's case was designed by [[Howard Stolz]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | title=ISM 101 Seminar: 13 January 2005 | work=USCS Engineering | accessdate=2009-03-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617144450/http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | archive-date=June 17, 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  As Senior Industrial Designer at Commodore, Stolz was the mechanical lead and primary interface with [[Sanyo]] in Japan, the contract manufacturer for the A1000 casing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/howardstolz | title=Howard Stolz profile | work=Howard Stolz LinkedIn profile | accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Amiga 1000 was manufactured in two variations:  One uses the [[NTSC]] television standard and the other uses the [[PAL]] television standard. The NTSC variant was the initial model manufactured and sold in [[North America]]. The later PAL model was manufactured in Germany and sold in countries using the PAL television standard. The first NTSC systems lacks the [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB video mode]] which is present in all later Amiga models.\n\nBecause [[AmigaOS]] was rather [[Software bug|buggy]] at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM then. Instead, the A1000 includes a [[daughterboard]] with 256&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of RAM, dubbed the \"writable control store\" (WCS), into which the core of the operating system is loaded from floppy disk (this portion of the operating system is known as the \"[[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]]\"). The WCS is write-protected after loading, and system resets do not require a reload of the WCS. In Europe, the WCS was often referred to as WOM (Write Once Memory), a play on the more conventional term \"ROM\" ([[read-only memory]]).\n\n== Technical information ==\nThe preproduction Amiga (which was codenamed \"Velvet\") released to developers in early 1985 contained {{nowrap|128 KB}} of RAM with an option to expand it to {{nowrap|256 KB.}} Commodore later increased the system memory to {{nowrap|256 KB}} due to objections by the Amiga development team. The names of the custom chips were different; Denise and Paula were called Daphne and Portia respectively. The casing of the preproduction Amiga was almost identical to the production version: the main difference being an embossed Commodore logo in the top left corner. It did not have the developer signatures or the carry handle.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Amiga 1000 Developer \"Velvet\" - computer collection vienna ENG|url = http://scacom.bplaced.net/Collection/velvet/velveten.php|website = scacom.bplaced.net|accessdate = 2015-08-23|first = Stefan|last = Egger}}</ref>\n\nThe Amiga 1000 has a [[Motorola 68000]] CPU running at 7.15909&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] (on [[NTSC]] systems) or 7.09379&nbsp;MHz ([[PAL]] systems), precisely double the video color [[carrier frequency]] for NTSC or 1.6 times the color carrier frequency for PAL. The system clock timings are derived from the video frequency, which simplifies [[glue logic]] and allows the Amiga&nbsp;1000 to make do with a single [[crystal oscillator|crystal]]. In keeping with its video game heritage, the chipset was designed to synchronize CPU memory access and chipset [[direct memory access|DMA]] so the hardware runs in real time without wait-state delays.\n\nThough most units were sold with an analog [[RGB color model|RGB]] monitor, the A1000 also has a built-in [[composite video]] output which allows the computer to be connected directly to some monitors other than their standard RGB monitor. The A1000 also has a \"TV MOD\" output, into which an RF Modulator can be plugged, allowing connection to a TV that was old enough not to even have a composite video input.\n\nThe original 68000 CPU can be directly replaced with a [[Motorola 68010]], which can execute instructions slightly faster than the 68000 but also introduces a small degree of software incompatibility. Third-party CPU upgrades, which mostly fit in the CPU socket, use faster successors 68020/68881 or 68030/68882 microprocessors and integrated memory. Such upgrades often have the option to revert to 68000 mode for full compatibility. Some boards have a socket to seat the original 68000, whereas the 68030 cards typically come with an on-board 68000.\n\nThe original Amiga&nbsp;1000 is the only model to have 256&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Amiga Chip RAM]], which can be expanded to 512&nbsp;KB with the addition of a [[daughterboard]] under a cover in the center front of the machine.<ref name=\"a1000_intro\">{{Cite journal | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/Amiga_1000_Introduction.pdf | title=Introduction to the Amiga | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | year=1986 | journal= | access-date=August 26, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032259/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/Amiga_1000_Introduction.pdf | archive-date=June 13, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{inconsistent citations}} RAM may also be upgraded via official and third-party upgrades, with a practical upper limit of about 9&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] of \"fast RAM\" due to the 68000's 24-bit [[address bus]]. This memory is accessible only by the CPU permitting faster code execution as DMA cycles are not shared with the chipset.\n\nThe Amiga 1000 features an 86-pin expansion port (electrically identical to the later [[Amiga 500]] expansion port, though the A500's connector is inverted). This port is used by third-party expansions such as memory upgrades and [[SCSI]] adapters. These resources are handled by the Amiga [[Autoconfig]] standard. Other expansion options are available including a bus expander which provides two [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro-II]] slots.\n\n=== Specifications ===\n[[File:JayMiner Mitch.jpg|thumb|Jay Miner's signature from the top cover of a Commodore Amiga&nbsp;1000 computer.

Before the release of the [[Amiga 500]] and [[Amiga 2000]] models in 1987, the A1000 was simply called ''Amiga''.\n\nIn the US, the A1000 was marketed as ''The Amiga from Commodore'', with the Commodore logo omitted from the case. The Commodore branding was retained for the international versions.  \n\nAdditionally, the Amiga 1000 was sold exclusively in computer stores in the US rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores through which the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]] were retailed. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's \"toy-store\" computer image created during the [[Jack Tramiel|Tramiel]] era.<ref>{{cite news | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&res=9A01EFDC1038F93AA1575BC0A962948260&scp=5&sq=amiga&st=nyt | title = Amiga's High-Tech Gamble | accessdate = 2008-04-11 | first = Susan | last = Chira | work = New York Times, August 29, 1984 | date=August 29, 1984}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last=Starfire | first=Brian | title=Commodore in tough market with new personal computer | newspaper=The Evening Independent (Dallas Morning News) | date=September 13, 1985| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19850913&id=5-cLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZFkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5279,3001216 }}</ref> \n\nAlong with the operating system, the machine came bundled with a version of [[AmigaBASIC]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and a [[speech synthesis]] library developed by [[Softvoice, Inc]].\n\n== Aftermarket upgrades ==\nMany A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the Motorola 68000 socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the ''Rejuvenator'' series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an [[Australia]]n-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called ''The Phoenix'' utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and on-board [[SCSI]] controller.\n\n== Impact ==\nIn 1994, as Commodore filed for bankruptcy, ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine called the Amiga 1000 \"the first [[multimedia computer]]... so far ahead of its time that almost nobody\u2014including Commodore's marketing department\u2014could fully articulate what it was all about\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Halfhill |first=Tom |url=http://byte.com/art/9408/sec14/art1.htm |title=R.I.P.

The ''x'' and ''y''-axes are the asymptotes.]]\nThe idea that a curve may come arbitrarily close to a line without actually becoming the same may seem to counter everyday experience. The representations of a line and a curve as marks on a piece of paper or as pixels on a computer screen have a positive width. So if they were to be extended far enough they would seem to merge, at least as far as the eye could discern. But these are physical representations of the corresponding mathematical entities; the line and the curve are idealized concepts whose width is 0 (see [[Line (geometry)|Line]]). Therefore, the understanding of the idea of an asymptote requires an effort of reason rather than experience.\n\nConsider the graph of the function <math>f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}</math> shown to the right. The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form <math>\\left(x, \\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math> where x is a number other than 0. For example, the graph contains the points (1, 1), (2, 0.5), (5, 0.2), (10, 0.1), \u2026 As the values of <math>x</math> become larger and larger, say 100, 1,000, 10,000 \u2026, putting them far to the right of the illustration, the corresponding values of <math>y</math>, .01, .001, .0001, \u2026, become infinitesimal relative to the scale shown. But no matter how large <math>x</math> becomes, its reciprocal <math>\\frac{1}{x}</math> is never 0, so the curve never actually touches the ''x''-axis. Similarly, as the values of <math>x</math> become smaller and smaller, say .01, .001, .0001, \u2026, making them infinitesimal relative to the scale shown, the corresponding values of <math>y</math>, 100, 1,000, 10,000 \u2026, become larger and larger. So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the ''y''-axis. Thus, both the ''x'' and ''y''-axes are asymptotes of the curve. These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a [[Limit of a function|limit]] in mathematics, and this connection is explained more fully below.<ref>Reference for section: [https://books.google.com/books?id=HTwi2M37rQAC&pg=PA541 \"Asymptote\"] ''[[Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia|The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia]]'' vol. 2, The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight and Co., London p. 541</ref>\n\n==Asymptotes of functions==\nThe asymptotes most commonly encountered in the study of [[calculus]] are of curves of the form {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&fnof;''(''x'')}}. These can be computed using [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and classified into ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes depending on their orientation. Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to +\u221e or &minus;\u221e. As the name indicates they are parallel to the ''x''-axis. Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines (perpendicular to the ''x''-axis) near which the function grows without bound. Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines such that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as ''x'' tends to +\u221e or &minus;\u221e. \n\n===Vertical asymptotes===\nThe line ''x'' = ''a'' is a ''vertical asymptote'' of the graph of the function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&fnof;''(''x'')}} if at least one of the following statements is true:\n\n# <math>\\lim_{x \\to a^{-}} f(x)=\\pm\\infty,</math>\n# <math>\\lim_{x \\to a^{+}} f(x)=\\pm\\infty,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\lim_{x\\to a^-}</math> is the limit as ''x'' approaches the value ''a'' from the left (from lesser values), and <math>\\lim_{x\\to a^+}</math> is the limit as ''x'' approaches ''a'' from the right.\n\nFor example, if \u0192(''x'') = ''x''/(''x''\u20131), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as ''x'' approaches 1. So\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to 1^{+}}\\frac{x}{x-1}=+\\infty</math>\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to 1^{-}}\\frac{x}{x-1}=-\\infty</math>\nand the curve has a vertical asymptote ''x''=1. \n\nThe function ''\u0192''(''x'') may or may not be defined at ''a'', and its precise value at the point ''x'' = ''a'' does not affect the asymptote.  For example, for the function\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{x} & \\mbox{if } x > 0, \\\\ 5 & \\mbox{if  } x \\le 0. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nhas a limit of +\u221e as {{nowrap|''x'' &rarr; 0<sup>+</sup>}}, ''\u0192''(''x'') has the vertical asymptote  {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}, even though ''\u0192''(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5. The graph of this function does intersect the vertical asymptote once, at (0,5). It is impossible for the graph of a function to intersect a vertical asymptote (or [[vertical line test|a vertical line in general]]) in more than one point. Moreover, if a function is [[continuous function|continuous]] at each point where it is defined, it is impossible that its graph does intersect any vertical asymptote.\n\nA common example of a vertical asymptote is the case of a rational function at a point x such that the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.\n\nIf a function has a vertical asymptote, then it isn't necessarily true that the derivative of the function has a vertical asymptote at the same place. An example is <math>f(x) =  1/x + \\sin(1/x)</math> at <math>x=0</math>. This function has a vertical asymptote at <math>x=0</math> because \n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to0^-}1/x + \\sin(1/x) = +\\infty</math>.\nIt is also true that \n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to0^+}1/x + \\sin(1/x) = -\\infty</math>.\nHowever, its derivative is the function <math>f'(x)=\\frac{-(\\cos(1/x) + 1)}{x^2}</math>. The sequence of points <math>x_n=(-1)^n/(\\pi+2n\\pi)</math>, for <math>n=0,1,2,\\ldots</math> tend to <math>x=0</math>, approaching both from the left and from the right. The value of <math>f'(x)</math> at the points of this sequence is <math>f'(x_n)=0</math>. Therefore, the lateral limits of <math>f'(x)</math> at <math>x=0</math> cannot be neither <math>+\\infty</math> nor <math>-\\infty</math>. Hence <math>f'(x)</math> doesn't have a vertical asymptote at <math>x=0</math>.\n\n===Horizontal asymptotes===\n[[File:Asymptote03.png|right|frame|The graph of a function can have two horizontal asymptotes. An example of such a function would be <math>y=\\arctan(x).</math>]]\n\n''Horizontal asymptotes'' are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as {{nowrap|''x'' &rarr; \u00b1&infin;}}.  The horizontal line ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of the function ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u0192''(''x'') if\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\rightarrow -\\infty}f(x)=c</math> or <math>\\lim_{x\\rightarrow +\\infty}f(x)=c</math>.\nIn the first case, ''\u0192''(''x'') has ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'' as asymptote when ''x'' tends to &minus;\u221e, and in the second ''\u0192''(''x'') has ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'' as an asymptote as ''x'' tends to +\u221e\n\nFor example, the arctangent function satisfies\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\rightarrow -\\infty}\\arctan(x)=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> and <math>\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\arctan(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}.</math>\n\nSo the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &minus;&pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to &minus;\u221e, and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to +\u221e.\n\nFunctions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions. For example, the function {{nowrap|1=\u0192(''x'') = 1/(''x''<sup>2</sup>+1)}} has a horizontal asymptote at ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 when ''x'' tends both to &minus;\u221e and +\u221e because, respectively,\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty}\\frac{1}{x^2+1}=\\lim_{x\\to +\\infty}\\frac{1}{x^2+1}=0.</math>\n\n===Oblique asymptotes===\n[[File:1-over-x-plus-x.svg|right|thumb|220px|In the graph of <math>f(x)=x+\\tfrac{1}{x}</math>, the ''y''-axis (''x'' = 0) and the line ''y'' = ''x'' are both asymptotes.]]\nWhen a linear asymptote is not parallel to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis, it is called an ''oblique asymptote'' or ''slant asymptote''. A function ''f''(''x'') is asymptotic to the straight line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} (''m''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0) if\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x \\to +\\infty}\\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\\right] = 0 \\, \\mbox{ or } \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty}\\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\\right] = 0.</math>\n\nIn the first case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''\u0192''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +\u221e, and in the second case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''\u0192(x)'' when ''x'' tends to &minus;\u221e.\n\nAn example is \u0192(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' + 1/''x'', which has the oblique asymptote ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' (that is ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) as seen in the limits\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}\\left[f(x)-x\\right]</math>\n:<math>=\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}\\left[\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)-x\\right]</math>\n:<math>=\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}\\frac{1}{x}=0.</math>\n\n== Elementary methods for identifying asymptotes ==\nThe asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits).\n\n===General computation of oblique asymptotes for functions===\n\nThe oblique asymptote, for the function ''f''(''x''), will be given by the equation ''y''=''mx''+''n''. The value for ''m'' is computed first and is given by\n\n:<math>m\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\lim_{x\\rightarrow a}f(x)/x</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is either <math>-\\infty</math> or <math>+\\infty</math> depending on the case being studied. It is good practice to treat the two cases separately. If this limit doesn't exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction.\n\nHaving ''m'' then the value for ''n'' can be computed by\n\n:<math>n\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\lim_{x\\rightarrow a}(f(x)-mx)</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' should be the same value used before. If this limit fails to exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction, even should the limit defining ''m'' exist. Otherwise {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is the oblique asymptote of ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''x'' tends to ''a''.\n\nFor example, the function {{nowrap|1=''&fnof;''(''x'') = (2''x''<sup>2</sup> + 3''x'' + 1)/''x''}} has\n\n:<math>m=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}f(x)/x=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x^2}=2</math> and then\n:<math>n=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\left(\\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x}-2x\\right)=3</math>\n\nso that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 2''x'' + 3}} is the asymptote of ''\u0192''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +\u221e.\n\nThe function {{nowrap|1=''&fnof;''(''x'') = ln ''x''}} has\n\n:<math>m=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}f(x)/x=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\frac{\\ln x}{x}=0</math> and then\n\n:<math>n=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\ln x</math>, which does not exist.\n\nSo {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ln ''x''}} does not have an asymptote when ''x'' tends to +\u221e.\n\n=== Asymptotes for rational functions ===\nA [[rational function]] has at most one horizontal asymptote or oblique (slant) asymptote, and possibly many vertical asymptotes.\n\nThe [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of the numerator and degree of the denominator determine whether or not there are any horizontal or oblique asymptotes.

For example, the following function has vertical asymptotes at ''x'' = 0, and ''x'' = 1, but not at ''x'' = 2.\n:<math>f(x)=\\frac{x^2-5x+6}{x^3-3x^2+2x}=\\frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{x(x-1)(x-2)}</math>\n\n==== Oblique asymptotes of rational functions ====\n[[File:SlantAsymptoteError.svg|right|thumb|320px|Black: the graph of <math>f(x)=(x^2+x+1)/(x+1)</math>.

Green: difference between the graph and its asymptote for <math>x=1,2,3,4,5,6</math>]]\n\nWhen the numerator of a rational function has degree exactly one greater than the denominator, the function has an oblique (slant) asymptote. The asymptote is the polynomial term after [[Polynomial long division|dividing]] the numerator and denominator. This phenomenon occurs because when dividing the fraction, there will be a linear term, and a remainder. For example, consider the function\n:<math>f(x)=\\frac{x^2+x+1}{x+1}=x+\\frac{1}{x+1}</math>\nshown to the right. As the value of ''x'' increases, ''f'' approaches the asymptote ''y'' = ''x''. This is because the other term,  1/(''x''+1), approaches 0.\n\nIf the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator, and the denominator does not divide the numerator, there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as ''x'' increases, but the quotient will not be linear, and the function does not have an oblique asymptote.\n\n=== Transformations of known functions ===\nIf a known function has an asymptote (such as ''y''=0 for ''f''(x)=''e''<sup>''x''</sup>), then the translations of it also have an asymptote.\n* If ''x''=''a'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''x''=''a''+''h'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''-''h'')\n* If ''y''=''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''c''+''k'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x'')+''k''\n\nIf a known function has an asymptote, then the [[Homothetic transformation|scaling]] of the function also have an asymptote.\n\n* If ''y''=''ax''+''b'' is an asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''cax''+''cb'' is an asymptote of ''cf''(''x'')\nFor example, ''f''(''x'')=''e''<sup>''x''-1</sup>+2 has horizontal asymptote ''y''=0+2=2, and no vertical or oblique asymptotes.\n\n== General definition ==\n[[File:Graph of sect csct.svg|right|thumb|200px|(sec(t), cosec(t)), or x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = (xy)<sup>2</sup>, with 2 horizontal and 2 vertical asymptotes.]]\n\nLet {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} be a [[parametric curve|parametric]] plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')).

No closed curve can have an asymptote.\n\nFor example, the upper right branch of the curve ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/''x'' can be defined parametrically as ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t'', ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/''t'' (where ''t'' > 0). First, ''x''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e as ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e and the distance from the curve to the ''x''-axis is 1/''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e. Therefore, the ''x''-axis is an asymptote of the curve. Also, ''y''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e as ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;0 from the right, and the distance between the curve and the ''y''-axis is ''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;0. So the ''y''-axis is also an asymptote. A similar argument shows that the lower left branch of the curve also has the same two lines as asymptotes.\n\nAlthough the definition here uses a parameterization of the curve, the notion of asymptote does not depend on the parameterization. In fact, if the equation of the line is <math>ax+by+c=0</math> then the distance from the point ''A''(''t'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')) to the line is given by\n:<math>\\frac{|ax(t)+by(t)+c|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</math>\nif \u03b3(''t'') is a change of parameterization then the distance becomes\n:<math>\\frac{|ax(\\gamma(t))+by(\\gamma(t))+c|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</math>\nwhich tends to zero simultaneously as the previous expression.\n\nAn important case is when the curve is the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a [[real function]] (a function of one real variable and returning real values). The graph of the function ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u0192''(''x'') is the set of points of the plane with coordinates (''x'',''\u0192''(''x'')). For this, a parameterization is\n:<math>t\\mapsto (t,f(t)).</math>\nThis parameterization is to be considered over the open intervals (''a'',''b''), where ''a'' can be &minus;\u221e and ''b'' can be +\u221e.\n\nAn asymptote can be either vertical or non-vertical (oblique or horizontal). In the first case its equation is ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'', for some real number ''c''. The non-vertical case has equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}}, where ''m'' and <math>n</math> are real numbers. All three types of asymptotes can be present at the same time in specific examples.  Unlike asymptotes for curves that are graphs of functions, a general curve may have more than two non-vertical asymptotes, and may cross its vertical asymptotes more than once.\n\n==Curvilinear asymptotes==\n[[File:nonlinear asymptote.svg|right|thumb|200px|''x''<sup>2</sup>+2''x''+3 is a parabolic asymptote to (''x''<sup>3</sup>+2''x''<sup>2</sup>+3''x''+4)/''x'']]\nLet {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} be a parametric plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')), and ''B'' be another (unparameterized) curve.

For a [[conic]], there are a pair of lines that do not intersect the conic at any complex point: these are the two asymptotes of the conic.\n\nA plane algebraic curve is defined by an equation of the form ''P''(''x'',''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 where ''P'' is a polynomial of degree ''n''\n:<math>P(x,y) = P_n(x,y) + P_{n-1}(x,y) + \\cdots + P_1(x,y) + P_0</math>\nwhere ''P''<sub>''k''</sub> is [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] of degree ''k''.  Vanishing of the linear factors of the highest degree term ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> defines the asymptotes of the curve: setting {{math|1=''Q'' = ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, if {{math|1=''P''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'' &minus; ''by'') ''Q''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>(''x'', ''y'')}}, then the line\n:<math>Q'_x(b,a)x+Q'_y(b,a)y + P_{n-1}(b,a)=0</math>\nis an asymptote if <math>Q'_x(b,a)</math> and <math>Q'_y(b,a)</math> are not both zero. If  <math>Q'_x(b,a)=Q'_y(b,a)=0</math> and <math>P_{n-1}(b,a)\\neq 0</math>, there is no asymptote, but the curve has a branch that looks like a branch of parabola. Such a branch is called a '''{{vanchor|parabolic branch}}''', even when it does not have any parabola that is a curvilinear asymptote. If <math>Q'_x(b,a)=Q'_y(b,a)=P_{n-1}(b,a)=0,</math> the curve has a singular point at infinity which may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches.\n\nOver the complex numbers, ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> splits into linear factors, each of which defines an asymptote (or several for multiple factors).  0ver the reals, ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> splits in factors that are linear or quadratic factors. Only the linear factors correspond to infinite (real) branches of the curve, but if a linear factor has multiplicity greater than one, the curve may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches. It may also occur that such a multiple linear factor corresponds to two complex conjugate branches, and does not corresponds to any infinite branch of the real curve.  For example, the curve {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>4</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> - 1 = 0}} has no real points outside the square <math> |x|\\leq 1, |y|\\leq 1</math>, but its highest order term gives the linear factor ''x'' with multiplicity 4, leading to the unique asymptote ''x''=0.\n\n==Asymptotic cone==\n{{col-begin}}\n[[File:Conic section hyperbola.gif|thumb|Hyperbolas, obtained cutting the same right circular cone with a plane and their asymptotes.]]\nThe [[hyperbola]]\n:<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}= 1</math>\nhas the two asymptotes\n:<math>y=\\pm\\frac{b}{a}x.</math>\nThe equation for the union of these two lines is\n:<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=0.</math>\nSimilarly, the [[hyperboloid]]\n:<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1</math>\nis said to have the '''asymptotic cone'''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YMU0AAAAMAAJ L.P.

These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.\n\nTanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]]. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.\n\nTanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Amsterdam Compiler Kit===\nThe [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S.

It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books]</ref> The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the \"Who wrote Linux\" Kerfuffle]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5sfayBi29?url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ |date=September 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.<ref>[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf USENIX April 06]</ref> The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure operating system. The system is based on a [[microkernel]], with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode.<ref>[http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Professor at the Vrije Universiteit]</ref> The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free.\n\n===Research projects===\nTanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]].

He stated that he created the site as an American who \"knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again.\"<ref name=\"EVFAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html |title=The Votemaster FAQ |accessdate=2017-02-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041102014915/http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html |archivedate=November 2, 2004 |df= }}</ref> The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as \"the Votemaster\" and acknowledging only that he personally preferred [[John Kerry]]. Mentioning that he supported the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]], he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day before the election, and also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.<ref name=\"EVFAQ\" />\n\nThrough the site he also covered the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.\n\nFor the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 elections]], he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]] over [[Al Franken]]. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).\n\nIn 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]].\n\nHe incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton would win the [[2016 United States presidential election]].\n\n==Tanenbaum\u2013Torvalds debate==\nThe [[Tanenbaum\u2013Torvalds debate]] was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on [[Usenet]] in 1992.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI%5B1-25-false%5D \"LINUX is obsolete\" Usenet Debate Text]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n* Fellow of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]]\n* Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1994)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/4853 |title=Andrew Tanenbaum |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>\n* Eurosys Lifetime Achievement Award, 2015\n* Honorary doctorate from Petru Maior University, Targu Mures, Romania, 2011\n* Winner of the TAA [[William Holmes McGuffey#McGuffey Awards|McGuffey award]] for classic textbooks for Modern Operating Systems, 2010\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the LADC Conference, 2009\n* Winner of a 2.5 million euro [[European Research Council]] Advanced Grant, 2008\n* [[USENIX]] Flame Award 2008 <ref>[http://www.usenix.org/about/flame.html USENIX Flame Award]</ref> for his many contributions to systems design and to openness both in discussion and in source\n* Honorary doctorate from Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Romania\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the Real-Time and Network Systems Conf., 2008\n* Winner of the 2007 [[IEEE James H.

The award was given in the academic senate chamber, after which Tanenbaum gave a lecture on his vision of the future of the computer field. The degree was given in recognition of Tanenbaum's career work, which includes about 150 published papers, 18 books (which have been translated into over 20 languages), and the creation of a large body of open-source software, including the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, Amoeba, Globe, and MINIX.\n* On October 7, 2011, Universitatea Petru Maior din T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 ([[Petru Maior University of T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]) granted Tanenbaum the Doctor Honoris Causa (honorary doctorate) title for his remarkable work in the field of computer science and achievements in education. The academic community is hereby honoring his devotion to teaching and research with this award. At the ceremony, the Chancellor, the Rector, the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and others all spoke about Tanenbaum and his work. The pro-rector then read the 'laudatio,' summarizing Tanenbaum's achievements. These include his work developing MINIX (the predecessor to Linux), the RFID Guardian, his work on Globe, Amoeba, and other systems, and his many books on computer science, which have been translated in many languages, including Romanian, and which are used at Petru Maior University.\n\n==Keynote talks==\nTanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently\n* [http://www.froscon.de/en/home FrOSCon 2015] Sankt Augustin, Germany, Aug. 22, 2015\n* [http://www.bsdcan.org BSDCan 2015] Ottawa, Canada, June 12, 2015\n* [http://www.haxpo.nl HAXPO 2015] Amsterdam May 28, 2015\n* [[Codemotion 2015]]  Rome Italy, March 28, 2015\n* [http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_889BS7 SIREN 2010]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Veldhoven, The Netherlands, Nov. 2, 2010\n* [[FOSDEM]] Brussels, Belgium, Feb 7, 2010\n* [http://neteng.nudt.edu.cn/NSCNE09/cfp2.html NSCNE '09]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Changsha, China, Nov. 5, 2009\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090924085448/http://www.e-democracy2009.gr/ E-Democracy 2009 Conference] Athens, Greece, Sept. 25, 2009\n* [http://www.froscon.org Free and Open Source Conference] Sankt Augustin, Germany, August 23, 2008\n* XV [http://www.sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/ Semana Inform\u00e1tica] of the [[Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico]], Lisbon, Portugal, March 13, 2008\n* [[NLUUG]] [https://www.nluug.nl/events/nj07/en/programma/tanenbaum.html 25 year anniversary] conference, Amsterdam, November 7, 2007\n* [[linux.conf.au]] in Sydney, Australia, January 17, 2007\n* Academic IT Festival in Cracow, Poland, February 23, 2006 (2nd edition)\n* [http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp05/default.htm ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles], Brighton, England, October 24, 2005\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Andrew S.

that is part of the [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane rocket family]], an [[expendable launch system]] used to deliver payloads into [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) or [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).\n\nAriane 5 [[rocket]]s are manufactured under the authority of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the French spatial agency [[CNES|Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales]]. [[Airbus Defence and Space]] is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a consortium of other European contractors.\n\nAriane 5 is operated and marketed by [[Arianespace]] as part of the ''[[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]]'' programme. The rockets are launched by Arianespace  from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].\n\nAriane 5 succeeded [[Ariane 4]], but was not derived from it directly as Ariane 5 was developed from scratch. Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions, \"G\", \"G+\", \"GS\", \"ECA\", and most recently, \"ES\".  ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] spaceplane, and thus intended it to be [[Human-rating certification|human rated]] from the beginning.\n\nTwo satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier (''SYst\u00e8me de Lancement Double Ariane,'' \"Ariane Double-Launch System\"). Three main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA (''Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement TRiple Ariane,'' \"Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure\").

They are fueled by a mix of ammonium perchlorate (68%) and aluminum fuel (18%) and [[hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene|HTPB]] (14%). They each burn for 130 seconds before being dropped into the ocean. The SRBs are usually allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean, but, like the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s, they can be recovered with parachutes, and this has occasionally been done for post-flight analysis. (Unlike Space Shuttle SRBs, Ariane 5 boosters are not reused.) The most recent attempt was for the first Ariane 5 ECA mission. One of the two boosters was successfully recovered and returned to the Guiana Space Center for analysis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.france-science.org/spip.php?article399#3-ARIANE-5-ECA-BOOSTER-RECOVERED |title=France in Space #387 |publisher=Office of Science and Technology Embassy of France in the USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125213207/http://www.france-science.org/spip.php?article399#3-ARIANE-5-ECA-BOOSTER-RECOVERED |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}</ref> Prior to that mission, the last such recovery and testing was done in 2003.\n\nThe French [[M51 (missile)|M51]] [[SLBM]] shares a substantial amount of technology with these boosters.\n\nIn February 2000 the suspected [[nose cone]] of an Ariane 5 booster washed ashore on the [[South Texas]] coast, and was recovered by [[Beachcombing|beachcombers]] before the government could get to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/etcetera/022900/space.sml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010224100038/http://www.foxnews.com/etcetera/022900/space.sml|title=Government Loses Unidentified Floating Object|archivedate=24 February 2001|work=foxnews.com}}</ref>\n\n===Second stage===\nThe second stage is on top of the main stage and below the payload. The Ariane 5 G used the EPS (''\u00c9tage \u00e0 Propergols Stockables''\u2014Storable Propellant Stage), which is fueled by [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) and [[nitrogen tetroxide]]. It also has 10 tonnes of storable propellants. The EPS was improved for use on the Ariane 5 G+, GS, and ES. Ariane 5 ECA uses the ESC (''\u00c9tage Sup\u00e9rieur Cryotechnique''\u2014Cryogenic Upper Stage), which is fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.\n\nThe EPS upper stage is capable of multiple ignitions, first demonstrated during flight V26 which was launched on 5 October 2007. This was purely to test the engine, and occurred after the payloads had been deployed. The first operational use of restart capability as part of a mission came on 9 March 2008, when two burns were made to deploy the first [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] into a circular parking orbit, followed by a third burn after ATV deployment to de-orbit the stage. This procedure was repeated for all subsequent ATV flights.\n\n===Fairing===\nThe payload and all upper stages are covered at launch by a fairing, which is jettisoned once sufficient altitude has been reached (typically above 100&nbsp;km). The fairing is also used for aerodynamic stability and protection from heating during supersonic flight and acoustic loads.\n\n==Variants==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Variant\n!

The GS used the improved EAP boosters of the ECA variant and the improved EPS of the G+ variant, but the increased mass of the modified ECA core compared to the G and G+ core resulted in slightly reduced payload capacity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ariane 5 Evolution|url=http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/ariane-5-evolution.shtml|accessdate=8 November 2014|language=German}}</ref> Ariane 5 GS could carry a single payload of {{convert|6600|kg|abbr=on}} or a dual payload of {{convert|5800|kg|abbr=on}} to GTO.

The EPS second stage was replaced by the ESC-A (''Etage Sup\u00e9rieur Cryog\u00e9nique''-A), which has a dry weight of {{convert|2100|kg|abbr=on}} and is powered by an [[HM-7B]] engine burning {{convert|14000|kg|abbr=on}} of cryogenic [[Rocket propellant|propellant]]. The ESC-A uses the liquid oxygen tank and lower structure from the Ariane 4's H10 third stage, mated to a new liquid hydrogen tank. Additionally, the EAP booster casings were lightened with new welds and carry more propellant.

This was the rocket's heaviest dual payload to date, at more than {{nowrap|8,000 kg}}.\n\nOn 27 May 2006, an Ariane 5 ECA rocket set a new commercial payload lifting record of 8.2 tonnes.

It has been speculated{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that Commodore had already sold out the remaining stocks of Amiga 500s, before the run up to the profitable Christmas sales period. In order to make enough A500s before Christmas, Commodore used stocks of the new 8A revision motherboards destined for the A500+. Many users were unaware that they were purchasing anything other than a standard Amiga 500. Although the Amiga 500+ was an improvement to the Amiga 500, it was minor. It was discontinued and replaced by the [[Amiga 600]] in summer 1992, making it the shortest lived Amiga model.\n\n== Reason for design ==\nCommodore created the A500+ for a couple of reasons. The first was cost reduction; minor changes were made to the motherboard to make it cheaper to produce. It was also so that Commodore could introduce the new version of the [[AmigaOS|Amiga Operating system]], 2.04.\n\n== Compatibility problems ==\nDue to the new Kickstart, quite a few popular games (such as [[Treasure Island Dizzy]], [[SWIV]],  and [[Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge]]) failed to work on the Amiga 500+, and some people took them back to dealers demanding an original Kickstart 1.3 Amiga 500. This problem was solved by third parties who produced Kickstart [[Read-only memory|ROM]] [[switching boards]], that could allow the Amiga 500+ to be downgraded to Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3. It also encouraged game developers to use better programming habits, which was important since Commodore already had plans for the introduction of the next-generation [[Amiga 1200]] computer. A program, Relokick, was also released (and included with an issue of CU Amiga) which loaded a [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 1.3 ROM image into memory and booted the machine into Kickstart 1.3, allowing incompatible software to run. In some cases, updated compatible versions of games were later released, such as budget versions of Lotus 1 and SWIV.\n\n== Technical specifications ==\n* [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] running at {{nowrap|7.09 MHz}} (PAL) / {{nowrap|7.16 MHz}} (NTSC), like its predecessor\n* 1 MB of [[Chip RAM]] (very early versions came with 512&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]].)\n* Kickstart 2.04 (v37.175)\n* Workbench 37.67 (release 2.04)\n* Built in battery backed RTC (Real Time Clock)\n* Full [[Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] chipset including new version of the [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip and [[Original Amiga chipset#Denise|Denise]] chip\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Amiga models and variants]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{CBM_computers}}\n{{Amiga hardware}}\n{{AmigaOS}}\n\n[[Category:Amiga]]\n[[Category:68000-based home computers]]", "sha1": "6aupz1zampp8yyrpot3cogdd1rnfi6x"}}, {"title": "Accumulator (computing)", "ns": "0", "id": "3116", "revision": {"id": "852832689", "parentid": "839709313", "timestamp": "2018-07-31T17:44:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nhitchborn", "id": "34183960"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Walther WSR-16 Inside the Machine.jpg|thumb|Walther WSR-16 mechanical calculator. The row of digit-wheels in the carriage (at the front), is the Accumulator]]\nIn a [[computer]]'s central processing unit ([[central processing unit|CPU]]), an '''accumulator''' is a [[processor register|register]] in which [[:wikt:intermediate|intermediate]] [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic]] results are stored. \n\nWithout a [[Processor register|register]] like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, [[Bitwise operation#bit shifts|shift]], etc.) to [[primary storage|main memory]], perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next [[operation (computer science)|operation]]. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register. Early electronic computer systems were often split into two groups, those with accumulators and those without.\n\nModern computer systems often have multiple general purpose registers that operate as accumulators, and the term is no longer as common as it once was. However, a number of special-purpose processors still use a single accumulator for their work to simplify their design.\n\n==Basic concept==\nMathematical operations often take place in a stepwise fashion, using the results from one operation as the input to the next. For instance, a manual calculation of a worker's weekly payroll might look something like:\n\n  look up the number of hours worked from the employee's time card\n  look up the pay rate for that employee from a table\n  multiply the hours by the pay rate to get their basic weekly pay\n  multiply their basic pay by a fixed percentage to account for income tax\n  subtract that number from their basic pay to get their weekly pay after tax\n  multiply that result by another fixed percentage to account for retirement plans\n  subtract that number from their basic pay to get their weekly pay after all deductions\n\nA computer program carrying out the same task would follow the same basic sequence of operations, although the values being looked up would all be stored in computer memory. In early computers the number of hours would likely be held on a [[punch card]] and the pay rate in some other form of memory, perhaps a [[magnetic drum]]. Once the multiplication is complete, the result needs to be placed somewhere. On a \"drum machine\" this would likely be back to the drum, an operation that takes considerable time. And then the very next operation has to read that value back in, which introduces another considerable delay.\n\nAccumulators dramatically improve performance in systems like these by providing a scratchpad area where the results of one operation can be fed to the next one for little or no performance penalty. In the example above, the basic weekly pay would be calculated and placed in the accumulator, which could then immediately be used by the income tax calculation. This removes one save and one read operation from the sequence, operations that generally took tens to hundreds of times as long as the multiplication itself.\n\n==Accumulator machines==\nAn '''accumulator machine''', also called a [[Instruction_set_architecture#Number_of_operands|1-operand machine]], or a CPU with ''accumulator-based architecture'', is a kind of CPU where, although it may have several registers, the CPU mostly stores the results of calculations in one special register, typically called \"the accumulator\". Almost all early computers were accumulator machines with only the high-performance \"[[supercomputer]]s\" having multiple registers. Then as [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems gave way to [[microcomputer]]s, accumulator architectures were again popular with the [[MOS 6502]] being a notable example. Many 8-bit [[microcontroller]]s that are still popular as of 2014, such as the [[PICmicro]] and [[8051]], are accumulator-based machines.\n\nModern CPUs are typically 2-operand or 3-operand machines. The additional operands specify which one of many [[general purpose register]]s (also called \"general purpose accumulators\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=DRMCRHC16OV&srch=1 |title=HC16 Overview |publisher=Freescale.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031937/http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=DRMCRHC16OV&srch=1 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}</ref>) are used as the source and destination for calculations. These CPUs are not considered \"accumulator machines\".\n\nThe characteristic which distinguishes one register as being the accumulator of a [[computer architecture]] is that the accumulator (if the architecture were to have one) would be used as an ''implicit'' [[operand]] for arithmetic [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s. For instance, a CPU might have an instruction like: <code>ADD ''[[memory address|memaddress]]''</code> that adds the value read from memory location ''memaddress'' to the value in the accumulator, placing the result back in the accumulator. The accumulator is not identified in the instruction by a register number; it is [[addressing_mode#Implicit|implicit]] in the instruction and no other register can be specified in the instruction.  Some architectures use a particular register as an accumulator in some instructions, but other instructions use register numbers for explicit operand specification.\n\n== History of the computer accumulator ==\nAny system that uses a single \"memory\" to store the result of multiple operations can be considered an accumulator. [[J. Presper Eckert]] refers to even the earliest [[adding machine]]s of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] as accumulator-based systems.<ref>J. Presper Eckert, \"A Survey of Digital Computer Memory Systems\", IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 1988, pp. 15-28.</ref>\n\nHistorical convention dedicates a register to \"the accumulator\", an \"arithmetic organ\" that literally accumulates its number during a sequence of arithmetic operations:\n\n:\"The first part of our arithmetic organ ... should be a parallel storage organ which can receive a number and add it to the one already in it, which is also able to clear its contents and which can store what it contains. We will call such an organ an Accumulator. It is quite conventional in principle in past and present computing machines of the most varied types, e.g. desk multipliers, standard IBM counters, more modern relay machines, the ENIAC\" (Goldstine and von Neumann, 1946; p. 98 in Bell and Newell 1971).\n\nJust a few of the instructions are, for example (with some modern interpretation):\n* Clear accumulator and add number from memory location X\n* Clear accumulator and subtract number from memory location X\n* Add number copied from memory location X to the contents of the accumulator\n* Subtract number copied from memory location X from the contents of the accumulator\n* Clear accumulator and shift contents of register into accumulator\n\nNo convention exists regarding the names for operations from registers to accumulator and from accumulator to registers. Tradition (e.g. [[Donald Knuth]]'s (1973) hypothetical [[MIX]] computer), for example, uses two instructions called ''load accumulator'' from register/memory (e.g. \"LDA r\") and ''store accumulator'' to register/memory (e.g. \"STA r\"). Knuth's model has many other instructions as well.\n\n== Notable accumulator-based computers ==\n[[File:IBM 701console.jpg|thumb|Front panel of an [[IBM 701]] computer with lights displaying the accumulator and other registers]]\nThe 1945 configuration of [[ENIAC]] had 20 accumulators, which could operate in parallel.<ref name=\"ENIAC\">{{cite book |last1=Haigh |first1=Thomas |first2=Mark |last2=Priestley |first3=Crispin |last3=Ropefir  |title=ENIAC in Action: Making and Remaking the Modern Computer |year= 2016 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262334419}}</ref>{{rp|46}}  Each one could store an eight decimal digit number and add to it (or subtract from it) a number it received.<ref name=\"ENIAC\" />{{rp|33}} Most of IBM's early binary \"scientific\" computers, beginning with the vacuum tube [[IBM 701]] in 1952, used a single 36-bit accumulator, along with a separate multiplier/quotient register to handle operations with longer results. The [[IBM 650]], a decimal machine, had one 10 digit accumulator; the [[IBM 7070]], a later, transistorized decimal machine had three accumulators.\n\nThe 12-bit [[PDP-8]] was one of the first minicomputers to use accumulators, and inspired many later machines.<ref>[[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Maynard, Massachusetts]] (1961) \"[http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp1/F15B_PDP1_Handbook_1961.pdf PROGRAMMED  DATA PROCESSOR-1  MANUAL]\", page 7: PDP-1 system block diagram accessdate=2014-07-03. The PDP-1 was an 18-bit processor, and was a predecessor of [[PDP-8]]\n*[[TX-0]] was the transistorized predecessor of [[PDP-1]]\n*[[Whirlwind I]] was the vacuum tube predecessor of Tx-0</ref> The PDP-8 had but one accumulator. The [[HP 2100]] and [[Data General Nova]] had 2 and 4 accumulators. The Nova was created when this follow-on to the PDP-8 was rejected in favor of what would become the [[PDP-11]]. The Nova provided four accumulators, AC0-AC3, although AC2 and AC3 could also be used to provide offset addresses, tending towards more generality of usage for the registers. The [[PDP-11]] introduced a more contemporary model of general registers, numbered R0-R7 or more, adopted by most later CISC and RISC machines.\n \nEarly 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors such as the [[4004]], [[8008]] and numerous others, typically had single accumulators. The [[8051]] microcontroller has two, a primary accumulator and a secondary accumulator, where the second is used by instructions only when multiplying (MUL AB) or dividing (DIV AB); the former splits the 16-bit result between the two 8-bit accumulators, whereas the latter stores the quotient on the primary accumulator A and the remainder in the secondary accumulator B. As a direct descendent of the 8008, the [[8080]], and the [[Intel 8086|8086]], the modern ubiquitous [[Intel x86]] processors still uses the primary accumulator EAX and the secondary accumulator EDX for multiplication and division of large numbers. For instance, MUL ECX will multiply the 32-bit registers ECX and EAX and split the 64-bit result between EAX and EDX. However, MUL and DIV are special cases, other arithmetic-logical instructions (ADD, SUB, CMP, AND, OR, XOR, TEST) may specify any of the eight registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI as the accumulator (i.e. left operand and destination); this is also supported for multiply if the upper half of the result is not required.  x86 is thus a fairly general register architecture, despite being based on an accumulator model.<ref>{{cite book |last= Irvine |first= Kip R. |title= Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers |year= 2007 |edition= 5th  |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-238310-1 |pages=633, 622}}</ref>  The 64-bit extension of x86, [[x86-64]], has been further generalized to 16 instead of 8 general registers.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n*Goldstine, Herman H., and von Neumann, John, \"Planning and Coding of the Problems for an Electronic Computing Instrument\", Rep. 1947, [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Princeton.

There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account.\"<ref name=\"risen\"/></blockquote>\n\nA search of the safehouse turned up Zubaydah's personal 10,000-page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts as a young boy, old man, and at his current age. What appears to be split personalities is how Zubaydah was piecing his memories together after his 1992 shrapnel head wound. As part of his therapy to regain his memories, he began recording the diary that detailed his life, emotions, and what people were telling him. He split information into categories, such as what he knew about himself and what people told him, and listed them under different names to distinguish one set from the other. This was later incorrectly interpreted by some analysts reviewing the diary as symptoms of split [[personality disorder]].<ref name=\"mayer\"/><ref name=BlackBanners>{{cite book|last=Soufan|first=Ali|title=The Black Banners}}</ref>\n\nZubaydah was turned over to the CIA.<ref name=\"DanFroomkin\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/12/18/BL2007121800862.html Dan Froomkin, \"Bush\u2019s Exhibit A for Torture\"], ''The Washington Post'', December 18, 2007</ref><ref name=\"DanaPriestCIAHolds\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644.html Dana Priest, \"CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons\"], ''The Washington Post'', November 2, 2005</ref> Reports later alleged that he was transferred to secret CIA-operated prisons, known as [[black sites]], in Pakistan, [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base#CIA Detention Site Green|Thailand]], Afghanistan, Poland, Northern Africa, and [[Diego Garcia]].<ref name=\"DiegoGarcia\">[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/europe/EU-GEN-Britain-Diego-Garcia.php \"Lawmakers to examine claims Indian Ocean island used in secret prison network\"], ''International Herald Tribune'', October 19, 2007</ref><ref name=\"DickMarty\">Dick Marty, [http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2007/Emarty_20070608_NoEmbargo.pdf \"Secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states: Second report\"], Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, June 7, 2007</ref><ref name=\"RossAndEsposito\">[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 Brian Ross and Richard Esposito, \"EXCLUSIVE: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons\"], ABC News, December 5, 2005</ref><ref name=\"CIAShuffledPrisoners\">[http://www.globalpulse.net/archives/security/cia_shuttled_pr_000087.php \"CIA Shuffled Prisoners Out of Poland\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070504121937/http://www.globalpulse.net/archives/security/cia_shuttled_pr_000087.php |date=May 4, 2007 }}, ''Global Pulse'', December 5, 2005</ref><ref name=\"JasonBurke\">[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1237589,00.html Jason Burke, \"Secret World of U.S. Jails\"], ''The Observer,'' June 13, 2004</ref><ref name=\"EnforcedDisappearance\">[http://www.reprieve.org.uk/documents/FinalReprieveFASCExecutiveSummary.pdf ''Enforced Disappearance, Illegal Interstate Transfer, and Other Human Rights Abuses Involving the UK Overseas Territories: Executive Summary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706132241/http://www.reprieve.org.uk/documents/FinalReprieveFASCExecutiveSummary.pdf |date=July 6, 2008 }}, Reprieve</ref> Historically, renditions of prisoners to countries which commit torture have been illegal.

Arithmetic is an elementary part of [[number theory]], and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level [[Areas of mathematics|divisions of modern mathematics]], along with [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. The terms ''arithmetic'' and ''higher arithmetic'' were used until the beginning of the 20th&nbsp;century as synonyms for ''number theory'' and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.<ref>[[Harold Davenport|Davenport, Harold]], ''The Higher Arithmetic: An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers'' (7th ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-63446-6}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a small number of artifacts which may indicate the conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the [[Ishango bone]] from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|central Africa]], dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000&nbsp;BC, although its interpretation is disputed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rudman |first=Peter Strom |title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years |year=2007 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-59102-477-4 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest written records indicate the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] used all the [[elementary arithmetic]] operations as early as 2000&nbsp;BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular [[numeral system]] strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for [[Egyptian numerals]], like the later [[Roman numerals]], descended from [[tally marks]] used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a [[decimal]] base but did not include [[positional notation]]. Complex calculations with Roman numerals required the assistance of a [[counting board]] or the [[Roman abacus]] to obtain the results.\n\nEarly number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the [[sexagesimal]] (base&nbsp;60) system for [[Babylonian numerals]] and the [[vigesimal]] (base&nbsp;20) system that defined [[Maya numerals]]. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation.\n\nThe continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the [[Hellenistic civilization]] of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of [[Euclid]] around 300&nbsp;BC, [[Greek mathematics|Greek studies in mathematics]] overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, [[Nicomachus]] summarized the viewpoint of the earlier [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]''.\n\n[[Greek numerals]] were used by [[Archimedes]], [[Diophantus]] and others in a [[positional notation]] not very different from ours. The ancient Greeks lacked a symbol for zero until the Hellenistic period, and they used three separate sets of symbols as [[numerical digit|digits]]: one set for the units place, one for the tens place, and one for the hundreds. For the thousands place they would reuse the symbols for the units place, and so on. Their addition algorithm was identical to ours, and their multiplication algorithm was only very slightly different. Their long division algorithm was the same, and the [[Methods of computing square roots#Digit-by-digit calculation|digit-by-digit square root algorithm]], popularly used as recently as the 20th century, was known to Archimedes, who may have invented it. He preferred it to [[Heron's method|Hero's method]] of successive approximation because, once computed, a digit doesn't change, and the square roots of perfect squares, such as 7485696, terminate immediately as 2736. For numbers with a fractional part, such as 546.934, they used negative powers of 60 instead of negative powers of 10 for the fractional part 0.934.<ref>''The Works of Archimedes'', Chapter IV, ''Arithmetic in Archimedes'', edited by T.L. Heath, Dover Publications Inc, New York, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe ancient Chinese had advanced arithmetic studies dating from the Shang Dynasty and continuing through the Tang Dynasty, from basic numbers to advanced algebra. The ancient Chinese used a positional notation similar to that of the Greeks. Since they also lacked a symbol for zero, they had one set of symbols for the unit's place, and a second set for the ten's place. For the hundred's place they then reused the symbols for the unit's place, and so on. Their symbols were based on the ancient [[counting rods]]. It is a complicated question to determine exactly when the Chinese started calculating with positional representation, but it was definitely before 400&nbsp;BC.<ref>Joseph Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', Vol. 3, p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1959.</ref> The ancient Chinese were the first to meaningfully discover, understand, and apply negative numbers as explained in the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (''Jiuzhang Suanshu''), which was written by [[Liu Hui]].\n\nThe gradual development of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation, which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing [[0 (number)|0]]. This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers. This approach eventually replaced all other systems. In the early {{nowrap|6th century AD,}} the Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] incorporated an existing version of this system in his work, and experimented with different notations. In the 7th&nbsp;century, [[Brahmagupta]] established the use of&nbsp;0 as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers, except for the result of [[division by 0]]. His contemporary, the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] bishop [[Severus Sebokht]] (650&nbsp;AD) said, \"Indians possess a method of calculation that no word can praise enough. Their rational system of mathematics, or of their method of calculation. I mean the system using nine symbols.\"<ref>Reference: Revue de l'Orient Chretien by Fran\u00e7ois Nau pp.327-338. (1929)</ref> The Arabs also learned this new method and called it ''hesab''.\n\n[[File:Leibniz Stepped Reckoner.png|thumb|200px|Leibniz's [[Stepped Reckoner]] was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations.]]\nAlthough the [[Codex Vigilanus]] described an early form of Arabic numerals (omitting&nbsp;0) by 976&nbsp;AD, Leonardo of Pisa ([[Fibonacci]]) was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout Europe after the publication of his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202. He wrote, \"The method of the Indians (Latin ''Modus Indoram'') surpasses any known method to compute. It's a marvelous method. They do their computations using nine figures and symbol [[zero]]\".<ref>Reference: Sigler, L., \"Fibonacci's Liber Abaci\", Springer, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages, arithmetic was one of the seven [[liberal arts]] taught in universities.\n\nThe flourishing of [[algebra]] in the [[medieval]] [[Islamic]] world and in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]] was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of [[computation]] through [[decimal]] notation.\n\nVarious types of tools have been invented and widely used to assist in numeric calculations. Before Renaissance, they were various types of [[abaci]]. More recent examples include [[slide rule]]s, [[nomogram]]s and [[mechanical calculator]]s, such as [[Pascal's calculator]]. At present, they have been supplanted by electronic [[calculator]]s and [[computer]]s.\n\n==Arithmetic operations==\n{{See also|Algebraic operation}}\nThe basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, although this subject also includes more advanced operations, such as manipulations of [[percentage]]s, [[square root]]s, [[exponentiation]], [[logarithmic function]]s, and even [[trigonometric function]]s, in the same vein as logarithms ([[Prosthaphaeresis]]). Arithmetic expressions must be evaluated according to the intended sequence of operations. There are several methods to specify this, either \u2013most common, together with [[infix notation]]\u2013 explicitly using parentheses, and relying on [[Order of operations|precedence rules]], or using a [[Polish notation|pre\u2013]] or [[Reverse Polish notation|postfix]] notation, which uniquely fix the order of execution by themselves. Any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations (except division by&nbsp;0) can be performed, and where these four operations obey the usual laws (including distributivity), is called a [[field mathematics|field]].<ref name=Oxford>{{cite book\n|title=The Oxford Mathematics Study Dictionary\n|first1=Frank\n|last1=Tapson\n|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|year=1996\n|isbn=0 19 914551 2}}</ref>\n\n===Addition (+)===\n{{main|Addition}}\nAddition is the most basic operation of arithmetic. In its simple form, addition combines two numbers, the ''addends'' or ''[[term (mathematics)|terms]]'', into a single number, the ''sum'' of the numbers (Such as {{math|2 + 2 {{=}} 4}} or {{math|3 + 5 {{=}} 8}}).\n\nAdding finitely many numbers can be viewed as repeated simple addition; this procedure is known as [[summation]], a term also used to denote the definition for \"adding infinitely many numbers\" in an [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]]. Repeated addition of the number&nbsp;[[one|1]] is the most basic form of [[counting]], the result of adding {{math|1}} is usually called the [[successor function|successor]] of the original number.\n\nAddition is [[commutative]] and [[associative]], so the order in which finitely many terms are added does not matter. The [[identity element]] for a [[binary operation]] is the number that, when combined with any number, yields the same number as result. According to the rules of addition, adding&nbsp;{{math|0}} to any number yields that same number, so {{math|0}} is the [[additive identity]]. The ''[[inverse element|inverse]] of a number'' with respect to a [[binary operation]] is the number that, when combined with any number, yields the identity with respect to this operation. So the inverse of a number with respect to addition (its [[additive inverse]], or the opposite number), is the number, that yields the additive identity,&nbsp;{{math|0}}, when added to the original number; it is immediate that this is the negative of the original number. For example, the additive inverse of {{math|7}} is {{math|\u22127}}, since {{math|7 + (\u22127) {{=}} 0}}.\n\nAddition can be interpreted geometrically as in the following example:\n:If we have two sticks of lengths ''2'' and ''5'', then, if we place the sticks one after the other, the length of the stick thus formed is {{math|2 + 5 {{=}} 7}}.\n\n===Subtraction (\u2212)===\n{{Main|Subtraction}}\n{{See also|Method of complements}}\nSubtraction is the inverse operation to addition. Subtraction finds the ''difference'' between two numbers, the ''minuend''  minus the ''subtrahend'': {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''M'' - ''S''.}} Resorting to the previously established addition, this is to say that the difference is the number that, when added to the subtrahend, results in the minuend: {{math|''D'' + ''S'' {{=}} ''M''.}}\n\nFor positive arguments {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|S}} holds:\n:If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference {{mvar|D}} is positive.\n:If the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference {{mvar|D}} is negative.\nIn any case, if minuend and subtrahend are equal, the difference {{math|''D'' {{=}} 0.}}\n\nSubtraction is neither [[Commutative property|commutative]] nor [[Associative property|associative]]. For that reason, in modern algebra the construction of this inverse operation is often discarded in favor of introducing the concept of inverse elements, as sketched under [[#Addition (+)| Addition]], and to look at subtraction as adding the additive inverse of the subtrahend to the minuend, that is {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''b'' {{=}} ''a'' + (\u2212''b'')}}. The immediate price of discarding the binary operation of subtraction is the introduction of the (trivial) [[unary operation]], delivering the additive inverse for any given number, and losing the immediate access to the notion of [[difference (mathematics)|difference]], which is potentially misleading, anyhow, when negative arguments are involved.\n\nFor any representation of numbers there are methods for calculating results, some of which are particularly advantageous in exploiting procedures, existing for one operation, by small alterations also for others. For example, digital computers can reuse existing adding-circuitry and save additional circuits for implementing a subtraction by employing the method of [[two's complement]] for representing the additive inverses, which is extremely easy to implement in hardware ([[Inverter (logic gate)|negation]]). The trade-off is the halving of the number range for a fixed word length.\n\nA formerly wide spread method to achieve a correct change amount, knowing the due and given amounts, is the ''counting up method'', which does not explicitly generate the value of the difference. Suppose an amount ''P'' is given in order to pay the required amount ''Q'', with ''P'' greater than ''Q''. Rather than explicitly performing the subtraction ''P'' \u2212 ''Q'' = ''C'' and counting out that amount ''C'' in change, money is counted out starting with the successor of ''Q'', and continuing in the steps of the currency, until ''P'' is reached. Although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction ''P'' \u2212 ''Q'', the subtraction was never really done and the value of ''P'' \u2212 ''Q'' is not supplied by this method.\n\n===Multiplication (\u00d7 or \u00b7 or *)===\n{{main|Multiplication}}\nMultiplication is the second basic operation of arithmetic. Multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number, the ''product''. The two original numbers are called the ''multiplier'' and the ''multiplicand'', mostly both are simply called ''factors''.\n\nMultiplication may be viewed as a scaling operation. If the numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplication by a number, say ''x'', greater than&nbsp;1 is the same as stretching everything away from&nbsp;0 uniformly, in such a way that the number&nbsp;1 itself is stretched to where ''x'' was. Similarly, multiplying by a number less than&nbsp;1 can be imagined as squeezing towards&nbsp;0. (Again, in such a way that&nbsp;1 goes to the multiplicand.)\n\nAnother view on multiplication of integer numbers, extendable to rationals, but not very accessible for real numbers, is by considering it as repeated addition. So {{math|3 \u00d7 4}} corresponds to either adding {{math|3}} times a {{math|4}}, or {{math|4}} times a {{math|3}}, giving the same result. There are different opinions on the advantageousness of these [[Multiplication and repeated addition|paradigmata]] in math education. \n\nMultiplication is commutative and associative; further it is [[distributivity|distributive]] over addition and subtraction. The [[multiplicative identity]] is&nbsp;1, since multiplying any number by&nbsp;1 yields that same number (no stretching or squeezing). The [[multiplicative inverse]] for any number except&nbsp;{{math|0}} is the [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of this number, because  multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity {{math|1}}.  {{math|0}}&nbsp;is the only number without a multiplicative inverse, and the result of multiplying any number and {{math|0}} is again {{math|0.}} One says, {{math|0}} is not contained in the multiplicative [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of the numbers.\n\nThe product of ''a'' and ''b'' is written as {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b''}} or {{math|''a''\u00b7''b''}}. When ''a'' or ''b'' are expressions not written simply with digits, it is also written by simple juxtaposition:&nbsp;''ab''. In computer programming languages and software packages in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard, it is often written with an asterisk:&nbsp;{{math|''a'' * ''b''.}}\n\nAlgorithms implementing the operation of multiplication for various representations of numbers are by far more costly and laborious than those for addition. Those accessible for manual computation either rely on breaking down the factors to single place values and apply repeated addition, or employ [[Mathematical table|tables]] or [[slide rules]], thereby mapping the multiplication to addition and back. These methods are outdated and replaced by mobile devices. Computers utilize diverse sophisticated and highly optimized algorithms to implement multiplication and division for the various number formats supported in their system.\n\n===Division (\u00f7 or /)===\n{{main|Division (mathematics)}}\nDivision is essentially the inverse operation to multiplication. Division finds the ''quotient'' of two numbers, the ''dividend'' divided by the ''divisor''. Any dividend [[division by 0|divided by&nbsp;0]] is undefined. For distinct positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient is greater than&nbsp;1, otherwise it is less than&nbsp;1 (a similar rule applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend.\n\nDivision is neither commutative nor associative. So as explained for [[#Subtraction_(%E2%88%92)|subtraction]], in modern algebra the construction of the division is discarded in favor of constructing the inverse elements with respect to multiplication, as introduced [[#Multiplication_(%C3%97_or_%C2%B7_or_*)|there]]. That is, division is a multiplication with the dividend and the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the divisor as factors, that is {{math|''a'' \u00f7 ''b'' {{=}} ''a'' \u00d7 {{sfrac|1|''b''}}.}}\n\nWithin natural numbers there is also a different, but related notion, the [[Euclidean division]], giving two results of \"dividing\" a natural {{mvar|N}} (numerator) by a natural {{mvar|D}} (denominator), first, a natural {{mvar|Q}} (quotient) and second, a natural {{mvar|R}} (remainder), such that {{math|''N'' {{=}} ''D''\u00d7''Q'' + ''R''}} and {{math|''R'' < ''Q''.}}\n\n==Decimal arithmetic==\n'''[[Decimal representation]]''' refers exclusively, in common use, to the written [[numeral system]] employing [[arabic numerals]] as the [[numerical digit|digits]] for a [[radix]] [[decimal|10&nbsp;(\"decimal\")]] [[positional notation]]; however, any [[numeral system]] based on powers of&nbsp;10, e.g., [[Greek Numerals|Greek]], [[Cyrillic numerals|Cyrillic]], [[Roman numerals|Roman]], or [[Chinese numerals]] may conceptually be described as \"decimal notation\" or \"decimal representation\".\n\nModern methods for four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) were first devised by [[Brahmagupta]] of India. This was known during medieval Europe as \"Modus Indoram\" or Method of the Indians. Positional notation (also known as \"place-value notation\") refers to the representation or encoding of [[number]]s using the same symbol for the different [[orders of magnitude]] (e.g., the \"ones place\", \"tens place\", \"hundreds place\") and, with a [[radix point]], using those same symbols to represent [[arithmetic fraction|fractions]] (e.g., the \"tenths place\", \"hundredths place\"). For example, 507.36 denotes 5&nbsp;hundreds (10<sup>2</sup>), plus 0&nbsp;tens (10<sup>1</sup>), plus 7&nbsp;units (10<sup>0</sup>), plus 3&nbsp;tenths (10<sup>\u22121</sup>) plus 6&nbsp;hundredths (10<sup>\u22122</sup>).\n\nThe concept of [[Zero|0]] as a number comparable to the other basic digits is essential to this notation, as is the concept of&nbsp;0's use as a placeholder, and as is the definition of multiplication and addition with&nbsp;0. The use of&nbsp;0 as a placeholder and, therefore, the use of a positional notation is first attested to in the [[Jainism|Jain]] text from [[India]] entitled the ''[[Lokavibh\u00e2ga]]'', dated 458&nbsp;AD and it was only in the early 13th&nbsp;century that these concepts, transmitted via the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|scholarship of the Arabic world]], were introduced into [[Europe]] by [[Fibonacci]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-4153/Leonardo-Pisano Leonardo Pisano \u2013 p. 3: \"Contributions to number theory\"]. ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' Online, 2006. Retrieved 18 September 2006.</ref> using the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system.\n\n[[Algorism]] comprises all of the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value&nbsp;9, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by the value of the second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This adjustment is termed a ''carry'' of the value&nbsp;1.\n\nThe process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers is similar to the process for addition. A multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair of digits. If an individual product of a pair of digits exceeds&nbsp;9, the ''carry'' adjustment increases the result of any subsequent multiplication from digits to the left by a value equal to the second (leftmost) digit, which is any value from {{nowrap|1 to 8}} ({{math|9 \u00d7 9 {{=}} 81}}). Additional steps define the final result.\n\nSimilar techniques exist for subtraction and division.\n\nThe creation of a correct process for multiplication relies on the relationship between values of adjacent digits. The value for any single digit in a numeral depends on its position. Also, each position to the left represents a value ten times larger than the position to the right. In mathematical terms, the [[exponentiation|exponent]] for the [[radix]] (base) of&nbsp;10 increases by&nbsp;1 (to the left) or decreases by&nbsp;1 (to the right). Therefore, the value for any arbitrary digit is multiplied by a value of the form&nbsp;10<sup>''n''</sup> with [[integer]]&nbsp;''n''. The list of values corresponding to all possible positions for a single digit is written {{nowrap|as {..., 10<sup>2</sup>, 10, 1, 10<sup>\u22121</sup>, 10<sup>\u22122</sup>, ...}.}}\n\nRepeated multiplication of any value in this list by&nbsp;10 produces another value in the list. In mathematical terminology, this characteristic is defined as [[closure (mathematics)|closure]], and the previous list is described as '''closed under multiplication'''. It is the basis for correctly finding the results of multiplication using the previous technique. This outcome is one example of the uses of [[number theory]].\n\n==Compound unit arithmetic{{anchor|Compound Unit Arithmetic}}==\nCompound<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.lloffion.org.uk/docs/walkingames_arithmetic/walkingames_arithmetic.pdf\n|title=The Tutor's Companion; or, Complete Practical Arithmetic\n|first=Francis\n|last=Walkingame\n|pages=24\u201339\n|publisher=Webb, Millington & Co\n|year=1860\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004020/http://www.lloffion.org.uk/docs/walkingames_arithmetic/walkingames_arithmetic.pdf\n|archivedate=2015-05-04\n|df=\n}}</ref> unit arithmetic is the application of arithmetic operations to [[mixed radix]] quantities such as feet and inches, gallons and pints, pounds shillings and pence, and so on.

This approach is suited for automated calculations. A typical example is the handling of time by [[Microsoft Excel]] where all time intervals are processed internally as days and decimal fractions of a day.\n* '''On-going normalization method''' in which each unit is treated separately and the problem is continuously normalized as the solution develops. This approach, which is widely described in classical texts, is best suited for manual calculations. An example of the ongoing normalization method as applied to addition is shown below.\n{|class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-style=\"border-bottom-width=0; background:lightblue;\"\n!align=\"center\"|UK pre-decimal currency\n|-\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|4 farthings (f) = 1 penny\n|-\n|12 pennies (d) = 1 shilling\n|-\n|20 shillings (s) = 1 pound (\u00a3)\n|}\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" ||style=\"border: 1px solid #FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n[[File:MixedUnitAddition.svg|left|thumb]]\nThe addition operation is carried out from right to left; in this case, pence are processed first, then shillings followed by pounds. The numbers below the \"answer line\" are intermediate results.\n\nThe total in the pence column is 25. Since there are 12 pennies in a shilling, 25 is divided by&nbsp;12 to give&nbsp;2 with a remainder of&nbsp;1. The value&nbsp;\"1\" is then written to the answer row and the value&nbsp;\"2\" carried forward to the shillings column. This operation is repeated using the values in the shillings column, with the additional step of adding the value that was carried forward from the pennies column. The intermediate total is divided by&nbsp;20 as there are 20&nbsp;shillings in a pound. The pound column is then processed, but as pounds are the largest unit that is being considered, no values are carried forward from the pounds column.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the example chosen did not have farthings.\n|}\n\n===Operations in practice===\n[[File:Yarloop wkshop gnangarra 14.jpg|thumb|A scale calibrated in imperial units with an associated cost display.]]\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries various aids were developed to aid the manipulation of compound units, particularly in commercial applications. The most common aids were mechanical tills which were adapted in countries such as the United Kingdom to accommodate pounds, shillings, pennies and farthings and \"Ready Reckoners\"&nbsp;\u2013 books aimed at traders that catalogued the results of various routine calculations such as the percentages or multiples of various sums of money. One typical booklet<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_94706#page/n5/mode/2up\n|title=The Ready Reckoner in miniature containing accurate table from one to the thousand at the various prices from one farthing to one pound.\n|first=J\n|last=Thomson\n|location=Montreal\n|year=1824\n|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref> that ran to 150&nbsp;pages tabulated multiples \"from one to ten thousand at the various prices from one farthing to one pound\".\n\nThe cumbersome nature of compound unit arithmetic has been recognized for many years&nbsp;\u2013 in 1586, the Flemish mathematician [[Simon Stevin]] published a small pamphlet called ''[[De Thiende]]'' (\"the tenth\")<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Stevin|date=January 2004}}</ref> in which he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time. In the modern era, many conversion programs, such as that included in the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;7 operating system calculator, display compound units in a reduced decimal format rather than using an expanded format (i.e. \"2.5&nbsp;ft\" is displayed rather than {{nowrap|\"2 ft 6 in\"}}).\n\n==Number theory==\n{{main|Number theory}}\nUntil the 19th century, ''number theory'' was a synonym of \"arithmetic\". The addressed problems were directly related to the basic operations and concerned [[prime number|primality]], [[divisibility]], and the [[Diophantine equation|solution of equations in integers]], such as [[Fermat's last theorem]]. It appeared that most of these problems, although very elementary to state, are very difficult and may not be solved without very deep mathematics involving concepts and methods from many other branches of mathematics. This led to new branches of number theory such as [[analytic number theory]], [[algebraic number theory]], [[Diophantine geometry]] and [[arithmetic algebraic geometry]]. [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] is a typical example of the necessity of sophisticated methods, which go far beyond the classical methods of arithmetic, for solving problems that can be stated in elementary arithmetic.\n\n==Arithmetic in education==\n[[Primary education]] in mathematics often places a strong focus on algorithms for the arithmetic of [[natural number]]s, [[integer]]s, [[arithmetic fraction|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s (using the decimal place-value system). This study is sometimes known as algorism.\n\nThe difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement in this direction was the [[New Math]] of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory, an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000519063231/http://mathematicallycorrect.com/glossary.htm Mathematically Correct: Glossary of Terms<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref>\n\nAlso, arithmetic was used by [[Ulama|Islamic Scholars]] in order to teach application of the rulings related to [[Zakat]] and [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|Irth]]. This was done in a book entitled ''The Best of Arithmetic'' by Abd-al-Fattah-al-Dumyati.<ref>{{cite web |last=al-Dumyati |first=Abd-al-Fattah Bin Abd-al-Rahman al-Banna |url={{wdl|3945}} |date=1887 |title=The Best of Arithmetic |work=[[World Digital Library]] |language=Arabic |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe book begins with the foundations of mathematics and proceeds to its application in the later chapters.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Arithmetic}}\n* [[Lists of mathematics topics]]\n* [[Outline of arithmetic]]\n* [[Slide rule]]\n\n===Related topics===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Addition of natural numbers]]\n* [[Additive inverse]]\n* [[Arithmetic coding]]\n* [[Arithmetic mean]]\n* [[Arithmetic progression]]\n* [[Arithmetic properties]]\n* [[Associativity]]\n* [[Commutativity]]\n* [[Distributivity]]\n* [[Elementary arithmetic]]\n* [[Finite field arithmetic]]\n* [[Geometric progression]]\n* [[Integer]]\n* [[List of important publications in mathematics]]\n* [[Mental calculation]]\n* [[Number line]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Cunnington, Susan, ''The Story of Arithmetic: A Short History of Its Origin and Development'', Swan Sonnenschein, London, 1904\n* [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|Dickson, Leonard Eugene]], ''[[History of the Theory of Numbers]]'' (3 volumes), reprints: Carnegie Institute of Washington, Washington, 1932; Chelsea, New York, 1952, 1966\n* [[Leonhard Euler|Euler, Leonhard]], ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110413234352/http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/C.J.Sangwin/euler/ Elements of Algebra]'', Tarquin Press, 2007\n* [[Henry Burchard Fine|Fine, Henry Burchard]] (1858\u20131928), ''The Number System of Algebra Treated Theoretically and Historically'', Leach, Shewell & Sanborn, Boston, 1891\n* [[Louis Charles Karpinski|Karpinski, Louis Charles]] (1878\u20131956), ''The History of Arithmetic'', Rand McNally, Chicago, 1925; reprint: Russell & Russell, New York, 1965\n* [[\u00d8ystein Ore|Ore, \u00d8ystein]], ''Number Theory and Its History'', McGraw\u2013Hill, New York, 1948\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Weil|Weil, Andr\u00e9]], ''Number Theory: An Approach through History'', Birkhauser, Boston, 1984; reviewed: [[Mathematical Reviews]] 85c:01004\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikibooks}}\n{{Commons category|Arithmetic}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Arithmetic.html MathWorld article about arithmetic]\n* [[:s:The New Student's Reference Work/Arithmetic|The New Student's Reference Work/Arithmetic]] (historical)\n* [http://mathdl.maa.org/convergence/1/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1293&bodyId=1422 The Great Calculation According to the Indians, of Maximus Planudes] \u2013 an early Western work on arithmetic at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070713083148/http://mathdl.maa.org/convergence/1/ Convergence]\n* {{cite AmCyc |last=Weyde |first=P.

After the close of the prison and end of the war, the town continued economically dependent on agriculture, primarily the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop. The town changed very little over the years.\n\nIt was not until 1968, when the large-scale mining of [[kaolin]], bauxitic kaolin, and [[bauxite]] was begun by Mulcoa, Mullite Company of America, that the town was dramatically altered. This operation exploited {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of scrub oak wilderness into a massive mining and refining operation. The company now ships more than 2000 tons of refined ore from Andersonville each week.\n\nIn 1974, long-time mayor Lewis Easterlin and a group of concerned citizens decided to promote tourism in the town; they stressed its history, redeveloping Main Street to look much as it did during the American Civil War. The city of Andersonville and the [[Andersonville National Historic Site]], location of the prison camp, are now tourist attractions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Andersonville, Georgia\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 60\n|Feb high F = 62\n|Mar high F = 70\n|Apr high F = 78\n|May high F = 86\n|Jun high F = 91\n|Jul high F = 92\n|Aug high F = 92\n|Sep high F = 88\n|Oct high F = 79\n|Nov high F = 68\n|Dec high F = 61\n|year high F =\n|Jan low F = 38\n|Feb low F = 40\n|Mar low F = 46\n|Apr low F = 53\n|May low F = 61\n|Jun low F = 68\n|Jul low F = 71\n|Aug low F = 70\n|Sep low F = 66\n|Oct low F = 55\n|Nov low F = 44\n|Dec low F = 39\n|year low F =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 4.3\n|Feb precipitation inch = 4.8\n|Mar precipitation inch = 5.3\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.9\n|May precipitation inch = 3.5\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.3\n|Jul precipitation inch = 5.5\n|Aug precipitation inch = 4.9\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.4\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.3\n|Nov precipitation inch = 2.7\n|Dec precipitation inch = 4.0\n|year precipitation inch = 48.9\n|source 1 = ''Weatherbase''<ref name=\"Weatherbase\">{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=352090&cityname=Andersonville-Georgia-United-States-of-America |title=Andersonville, Georgia Travel Weather Averages |publisher=Weatherbase, Canty and Associates LLC |location=Great Falls, VA, US |work=weatherbase.com |accessdate=2016-09-21}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 308\n|1900= 245\n|1910= 174\n|1920= 196\n|1930= 231\n|1940= 211\n|1950= 281\n|1960= 263\n|1970= 274\n|1980= 267\n|1990= 277\n|2000= 331\n|2010= 255\n|estyear=2016\n|estimate=234\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=May 12, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 331 people, 124 households, and 86 families residing in the city.

An afterglow may appear above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of fading [[twilight]], or be [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] off high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]]. The particles produce a [[scattering]] effect upon the component parts of [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation .28light.29|white light]].\n\nTrue [[alpenglow]], which occurs long after sunset or long before sunrise, is caused by the [[backscatter]]ing of red sunlight by [[aerosols]] and fine dust particles low in the atmosphere. After sunset, alpenglow is an afterglow caused by the illumination of atmospheric particles by sunlight as it gets [[refraction|refracted]] and [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] through the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe [[energy of light|high-energy]] and [[high-frequency]] light is [[scattering of electromagnetic radiation|scattered]] out the most, while the remaining low-energy and -frequency light reaches the observer on the [[horizon]] at [[twilight]]. The backscattering of this light further turns it pinkish to reddish. This period of time is referred to as [[blue hour]] and is widely treasured by [[photographers]] and [[painters]], as it offers breathtaking views.\n\nThe afterglow persists until the [[Earth's shadow]] ([[terminator (solar)|terminator]] line) overtakes the sky above the observer as night falls and the stars appear, with [[Venus]] (the second-brightest [[celestial object]] after the Moon in the [[night sky]]) visible above the horizon opposite of the [[Belt of Venus]] around the [[antisolar point]].\n\nAfter the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|1883 eruption]] of the [[volcano]] [[Krakatoa]], a remarkable series of red [[sunset]]s appeared worldwide. An enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust were blown to a great height by the volcano's explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric winds.

Because of this essential uniqueness, we often speak of ''the'' algebraic closure of ''K'', rather than ''an'' algebraic closure of ''K''.\n\nThe algebraic closure of a field ''K'' can be thought of as the largest algebraic extension of ''K''.\nTo see this, note that if ''L'' is any algebraic extension of ''K'', then the algebraic closure of ''L'' is also an algebraic closure of ''K'', and so ''L'' is contained within the algebraic closure of ''K''.\nThe algebraic closure of ''K'' is also the smallest algebraically closed field containing ''K'',\nbecause if ''M'' is any algebraically closed field containing ''K'', then the elements of ''M'' that are [[algebraic extension|algebraic over]] ''K'' form an algebraic closure of ''K''.\n\nThe algebraic closure of a field ''K'' has the same [[cardinal number|cardinality]] as ''K'' if ''K'' is infinite, and is [[countably infinite]] if ''K'' is finite.<ref name=Kap7476/>\n\n==Examples==\n*The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] states that the algebraic closure of the field of [[real number]]s is the field of [[complex number]]s.\n*The algebraic closure of the field of [[rational number]]s is the field of [[algebraic number]]s.\n*There are many countable algebraically closed fields within the complex numbers, and strictly containing the field of algebraic numbers; these are the algebraic closures of transcendental extensions of the rational numbers, e.g. the algebraic closure of '''Q'''(\u03c0).\n*For a [[finite field]] of [[prime number|prime]] power order ''q'', the algebraic closure is a [[countably infinite]] field that contains a copy of the field of order ''q''<sup>''n''</sup> for each positive [[integer]] ''n'' (and is in fact the union of these copies).<ref>{{citation | title=Infinite Algebraic Extensions of Finite Fields | volume=95 | series=Contemporary Mathematics | first1=Joel V. | last1=Brawley | first2=George E. | last2=Schnibben | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-8218-5428-0 | contribution=2.2 The Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field | pages=22\u201323 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HNfpAsMXhUC&pg=PA22 | zbl=0674.12009}}.</ref>\n\n==Existence of an algebraic closure and splitting fields==\nLet <math>S = \\{ f_{\\lambda} | \\lambda \\in \\Lambda\\}</math> be the set of all monic irreducible polynomials in ''K''[''x''].\nFor each <math>f_{\\lambda} \\in S</math>, introduce new variables <math>u_{\\lambda,1},\\ldots,u_{\\lambda,d}</math> where <math>d = {\\rm degree}(f_{\\lambda})</math>.\nLet ''R'' be the polynomial ring over ''K'' generated by <math>u_{\\lambda,i}</math> for all <math>\\lambda \\in \\Lambda</math> and all <math>i \\leq {\\rm degree}(f_{\\lambda})</math>. Write\n: <math>f_{\\lambda} - \\prod_{i=1}^d (x-u_{\\lambda,i}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} r_{\\lambda,j} \\cdot x^j \\in R[x]</math>\n\nwith <math>r_{\\lambda,j} \\in R</math>.\nLet  ''I'' be the ideal in ''R'' generated by the <math>r_{\\lambda,j}</math>. Since ''I'' is strictly smaller than  ''R'',\nZorn's lemma implies that there exists a maximal ideal ''M'' in ''R'' that contains ''I''.\nThe field ''K''<sub>1</sub>=''R''/''M'' has the property that every polynomial <math>f_{\\lambda}</math> with coefficients in ''K'' splits as the product of <math>x-(u_{\\lambda,i} + M),</math> and hence has all roots in ''K''<sub>1</sub>. In the same way, an extension ''K''<sub>2</sub> of ''K''<sub>1</sub> can be constructed, etc. The union of all these extensions is the algebraic closure of ''K'', because any polynomial with coefficients in this new field has its coefficients in some ''K''<sub>n</sub> with sufficiently large ''n'', and then its roots are in ''K''<sub>n+1</sub>, and hence in the union itself. \n\nIt can be shown along the same lines that for any subset ''S'' of ''K''[''x''], there exists a [[splitting field]] of ''S'' over ''K''.\n\n==Separable closure==\nAn algebraic closure ''K<sup>alg</sup>'' of ''K'' contains a unique [[separable extension]] ''K<sup>sep</sup>'' of ''K'' containing all (algebraic) [[separable extension]]s of ''K'' within ''K<sup>alg</sup>''.  This subextension is called a '''separable closure''' of ''K''. Since a separable extension of a separable extension is again separable, there are no finite separable extensions of ''K<sup>sep</sup>'', of degree > 1. Saying this another way, ''K'' is contained in a ''separably-closed'' algebraic extension field. It is  unique ([[up to]] isomorphism).<ref name=McC22>McCarthy (1991) p.22</ref>\n\nThe separable closure is the full algebraic closure if and only if ''K'' is a [[perfect field]]. For example, if ''K'' is a field of characteristic ''p'' and if ''X'' is transcendental over ''K'', <math>K(X)(\\sqrt[p]{X}) \\supset K(X)</math> is a non-separable algebraic field extension.\n\nIn general, the [[absolute Galois group]] of ''K'' is the Galois group of ''K<sup>sep</sup>'' over ''K''.<ref name=FJ12>{{cite book | last1=Fried | first1=Michael D. | last2=Jarden | first2=Moshe | title=Field arithmetic | edition=3rd | series=Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete. 3.

[[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] is intended as the successor to APM. Microsoft dropped support for APM in [[Windows Vista]]. The [[Linux|Linux kernel]] still mostly supports APM, with the last fully functional APM support shipping in 3.3.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:APM-Layers.svg|thumb|The layers in APM]]\nAPM uses a layered approach to manage devices. APM-aware applications (which include device drivers) talk to an OS-specific APM driver. This driver communicates to the APM-aware BIOS, which controls the hardware. There is the ability to opt out of APM control on a device-by-device basis, which can be used if a driver wants to communicate directly with a hardware device.\n\nCommunication occurs both ways; power management events are sent from the BIOS to the APM driver, and the APM driver sends information and requests to the BIOS via function calls. In this way the APM driver is an intermediary between the BIOS and the operating system.\n\nPower management happens in two ways; through the above-mentioned function calls from the APM driver to the BIOS requesting power state changes, and automatically based on device activity.\n\n== Power management events ==\nThere are 12 power events (such as standby, suspend and resume requests, and low battery notifications), plus [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]-defined events, that can be sent from the APM BIOS to the operating system. The APM driver regularly [[Polling (computer science)|polls]] for event change notifications.\n\nPower Management Events:<ref name=\"APM_spec_V12\">{{cite web|title=Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS Interface Specification Revision 1.2 February 1996 Intel/Microsoft|url= http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/1/161ba512-40e2-4cc9-843a-923143f3456c/APMV12.rtf}} 090429</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!

Example function calls include letting the BIOS know about current CPU usage (the BIOS may respond to such a call by placing the CPU in a low-power state, or returning it to its full-power state), retrieving the current power state of a device, or requesting a power state change.\n\n==Power states==\nThe APM specification defines system power states and device power states.\n\n===System power states===\nAPM defines five power states for the computer system:\n* Full On: The computer is powered on, and no devices are in a power saving mode.\n* APM Enabled: The computer is powered on, and APM is controlling device power management as needed.\n* APM Standby: Most devices are in their low-power state, the CPU is slowed or stopped, and the system state is saved. The computer can be returned to its former state quickly (in response to activity such as the user pressing a key on the keyboard).\n* APM Suspend: Most devices are powered off, but the system state is saved. The computer can be returned to its former state, but takes a relatively long time. (Hibernation is a special form of the APM Suspend state).\n* Off: The computer is turned off.\n\n===Device power states===\nAPM also defines power states that APM-aware hardware can implement. There is no requirement that an APM-aware device implement all states.\n\nThe four states are:\n* Device On: The device is in full power mode.\n* Device Power Managed: The device is still powered on, but some functions may not be available, or may have reduced performance.\n* Device Low Power: The device is not working. Power is maintained so that the device may be 'woken up'.\n* Device Off: The device is powered off.\n\n==CPU==\nThe CPU core (defined in APM as the CPU clock, [[CPU cache|cache]], [[Front side bus|system bus]] and system timers) is treated specially in APM, as it is the last device to be powered down, and the first device to be powered back up. The CPU core is always controlled through the APM BIOS (there is no option to control it through a driver). Drivers can use APM function calls to notify the BIOS about CPU usage, but it is up to the BIOS to act on this information; a driver cannot directly tell the CPU to go into a power saving state.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Active State Power Management]] - hardware power management protocol for [[PCI Express]]\n* [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI) - successor to APM\n* [[Green computing]]\n* [[Power management]]\n* [[BatteryMAX (idle detection)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*APM V1.2 [http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/1/161ba512-40e2-4cc9-843a-923143f3456c/APMV12.rtf Specification] ([[Rich Text Format|RTF]] file).\n*{{FOLDOC}}\n\n{{Computer processor power management technologies}}\n{{CPU technologies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Advanced Power Management}}\n[[Category:BIOS]]", "sha1": "7mp4a5y8i1nqskg7avtovyuawe6vc7x"}}, {"title": "Adolphe Sax", "ns": "0", "id": "3132", "revision": {"id": "863870036", "parentid": "862990201", "timestamp": "2018-10-13T16:37:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ymnes", "id": "19494222"}, "comment": "/* Honors and awards */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox person\n| name        = Adolphe Sax\n| image       = Adolphe Sax 4a.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| alt         = Adolphe Sax\n| caption     = Adolphe Sax\n| birth_name  = Antoine-Joseph Sax\n| birth_date  = {{Birth date|df=yes|1814|11|06}}\n| birth_place = [[Dinant]], [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands]]<br><small>(now in [[Belgium]])</small>\n| death_date  = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1894|02|07|1814|11|06}}\n| death_place = [[Paris]], [[French Third Republic]]\n| burial_place =[[Montmartre Cemetery]] (Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre), Paris France\n| burial_coordinates = {{coord|48|53|16|N|2|19|49|E|region:FR_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n| nationality = Belgian\n| other_names = \n| known_for   = Inventor of the [[saxophone]]\n| occupation  = Inventor, musician, musical instrument designer\n}}\n[[File:X5228_-_Altsaxofon_-_Adolphe_Sax_-_foto_Mikael_Bodner.jpg|thumb|upright|Saxophone produced by Sax]]\n'''Antoine-Joseph''' \"'''Adolphe'''\" '''Sax''' ({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303twan.\u0292oz\u025bf ad\u0254lf saks}}; 6 November 1814 \u2013  7 February 1894)<ref>Many sources give alternative dates for Sax's death, mainly 3 and 7 February.

He also invented the [[saxotromba]], [[saxhorn]] and [[saxtuba]].\n\n==Early life==\nAntoine-Joseph Sax was born on 6 November 1814, in [[Dinant]], in what is now [[Belgium]], to [[Charles-Joseph Sax]] and his wife.

Adolphe began to make his own instruments at an early age, entering two of his [[flute]]s and a [[clarinet]] into a competition at the age of 15. He subsequently studied performance on those two instruments as well as voice at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]].<ref name=hubbard-encycl/><ref name=\"Ingham1998\"/>\n\nSax faced many near-death experiences. Over the course of his childhood, he:\n\n* fell from a height of three floors, hit his head on a stone and could barely stand afterwards,\n* at the age of three, drank a bowl full of [[vitriol]]ized water and later swallowed a pin, \n* burnt himself seriously in a gunpowder explosion, \n* fell onto a hot cast iron frying pan, burning his side,\n* survived poisoning and suffocation in his own bedroom where varnished items were kept during the night,\n* was hit on the head by a cobblestone, and\n* fell into a river and barely survived.\n\nHis mother once said that \"he's a child condemned to misfortune; he won't live.\" His neighbors called him \"little Sax, the ghost\".<ref name=\"Cleary\">Cleary, Tom. \"[http://heavy.com/news/2015/11/adolphe-sax-google-doodle-201st-birthday-photos-saxophone-inventor-bio-history-almost-died-near-death-wine-facts-age-death-family-sons/ Adolphe Sax: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know]\", ''Heavy.com'', Retrieved 06 November 2015</ref><ref name=\"Dinant\">R\u00e9my, Albert. \"[http://www.dinant.be/en/inheritance/adolphe-sax Adolphe Sax]\".

Adolphe's first important invention was an improvement of the [[bass clarinet]] design, which he patented at the age of 24.{{sfn|Cottrell|2013|pp=12\u201313}} Sax relocated permanently to [[Paris]] in 1842 and began working on a new set of instruments. [[Hector Berlioz]] was so enamoured of them that he arranged in February 1844 for one of his pieces to be played entirely on Sax's new instruments.{{sfn|Cottrell|2013|p=18}} These were valved [[bugle]]s, and although he had not invented the instrument itself, his examples were much more successful than those of his rivals and became known as [[saxhorn]]s. They came in seven different sizes, and paved the way for the creation of the [[flugelhorn]]. Today, saxhorns are sometimes used in [[concert band]]s, marching bands and, [[orchestra]]s. The saxhorn also laid the groundwork for the modern [[euphonium]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-03/meet-dangerous-belgian-who-invented-sax |title=Meet the 'dangerous Belgian' who invented the sax |last=Boyd |first=Clark |date=3 December 2013 |work=The World|publisher=Public Radio International |access-date=3 February 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSax also developed the ''[[saxotromba]]'' family, valved brass instruments with narrower bore than the saxhorns, in 1845, though they survived only briefly.<ref name=hubbard-encycl>{{Cite book\n| last = Hubbard |first = W.

The saxhorn valves were accepted as state-of-the-art in their time and remain largely unchanged today. The advances made by Adolphe Sax were soon followed by the [[British brass band]] movement which exclusively adopted the saxhorn family of instruments.<ref name=Herbert2000>T. Herbert, ''The British Brass Band: a Musical and Social History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 4\u20135.</ref> The Jedforest Instrumental Band formed in 1854 and The Hawick Saxhorn Band formed in 1855, within the [[Scottish Borders]], a decade after saxhorn models became available.\n\nThe period around 1840 saw Sax inventing the ''clarinette-bourdon'', an early unsuccessful design of [[contrabass clarinet]]. Around this time he also developed the instrument for which he is best known: the [[saxophone]] which he patented on 28 June 1846. The saxophone was invented for use in both orchestras and military bands. By 1846 Sax had designed (on paper at least) a full range of saxophones (from [[Sopranino saxophone|sopranino]] to [[Subcontrabass saxophone|subcontrabass]]). Composer [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote approvingly of the new instrument in 1842, but despite his support, saxophones never became standard orchestral instruments. However, their ability to play technical passages easily like [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]]s and also project loudly like [[brass instrument]]s led them to be included in [[military band]]s in France and elsewhere. The saxophone was Sax's signature accomplishment and created his reputation more than any other. This helped secure him a job teaching at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatory]] in 1857.<ref name=hemke>[[Frederick Hemke|Fred L. Hemke]], ''The Early History of the Saxophone'', ([[Doctor of Musical Arts]] (DMA) dissertation), University of Wisconsin, 1975, 249\u2013250. {{OCLC|19033726|65652818|164782566}}</ref>\n\nSax continued to make instruments later in life and presided over the new saxophone program at the Paris Conservatory.

In English, aspirated consonants are [[allophone]]s in [[complementary distribution#In phonology|complementary distribution]] with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most [[Languages of India|Indian]] and [[East Asian languages]], the difference is [[Contrastive distribution#Phonology|contrastive]], while in [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], all stops are aspirated.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nTo feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth, and say ''spin'' {{IPA|[sp\u026an]}} and then ''pin'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}}. One should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with ''pin'' that one does not get with ''spin''.\n\n==Transcription==\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for [[voicelessness|voiceless consonants]] followed by the [[Phonetic symbols in Unicode#Spacing Modifier Letters (U+02B0\u201302FF)|aspiration modifier letter]] {{angbr|{{IPA|\u25cc\u02b0}}}}, a [[subscript and superscript|superscript form]] of the symbol for the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{angbr|{{IPA|h}}}}. For instance, {{angbr|{{IPA|p}}}} represents the voiceless [[bilabial stop]], and {{angbr|{{IPA|p\u02b0}}}} represents the aspirated bilabial stop.\n\n[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced consonants]] are seldom actually aspirated. Symbols for [[voice (phonetics)|voiced consonants]] followed by {{angbr|{{IPA|\u25cc\u02b0}}}}, such as {{angbr|{{IPA|b\u02b0}}}}, typically represent consonants with [[murmured voice]]d release (see [[#Breathy-voiced release|below]]). In the [[shiksha|grammatical tradition]] of [[Sanskrit]], aspirated consonants are called '''voiceless aspirated''', and breathy-voiced consonants are called '''voiced aspirated'''.\n\nThere are no dedicated IPA symbols for degrees of aspiration and typically only two degrees are marked: unaspirated {{angbr|{{IPA|k}}}} and aspirated {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u02b0}}}}. [[Obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet|An old symbol]] for light aspiration was {{angbr|{{IPA|\u02bb}}}}, but this is now obsolete. The aspiration modifier letter may be doubled to indicate especially strong or long aspiration. Hence, the two degrees of aspiration in Korean stops are sometimes transcribed {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u02b0 k\u02b0\u02b0}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u02bb}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u02b0}}}}, but they are usually transcribed {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[k\u02b0]}},<ref>{{cite web |editor1-last=Ladefoged |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-link=Peter Ladefoged |editor2=Barbara Blankenship\n|editor3=Russell G.

Voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal folds remain open after a consonant is released. An easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant's [[voice onset time]], as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal folds close.\n\nPhonetically in some languages, such as [[Navajo phonology|Navajo]], aspiration of stops tends to be realised as voiceless velar airflow; aspiration of affricates is realised as an extended length of the frication.\n\nAspirated consonants are not always followed by vowels or other voiced sounds. For example, in [[Eastern Armenian]], aspiration is contrastive even word-finally, and aspirated consonants occur in [[consonant cluster]]s. In [[Wahgi language|Wahgi]], consonants are aspirated only in final position.\n\n===Degree===\nThe degree of aspiration varies: the voice onset time of aspirated stops is longer or shorter depending on the language or the place of articulation.\n\nArmenian and [[Cantonese]] have aspiration that lasts about as long as English aspirated stops, in addition to unaspirated stops. Korean has lightly aspirated stops that fall between the Armenian and Cantonese unaspirated and aspirated stops as well as strongly aspirated stops whose aspiration lasts longer than that of Armenian or Cantonese. (See [[voice onset time]].)\n\nAspiration varies with [[place of articulation]]. The Spanish voiceless stops {{IPA|/p t k/}} have voice onset times (VOTs) of about 5, 10, and 30 milliseconds, whereas English aspirated {{IPA|/p t k/}} have VOTs of about 60, 70, and 80 ms. Voice onset time in Korean has been measured at 20, 25, and 50 ms for {{IPA|/p t k/}} and 90, 95, and 125 for {{IPA|/p\u02b0 t\u02b0 k\u02b0/}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lisker and Abramson|title=A cross-language Study of Voicing in Initial Stops|journal=Word|date=1964|volume=20|pages=384\u2013422}}</ref>\n\n===Doubling===\n{{listen\n| type         = speech\n| help         = no\n| header       = Gemination of aspirated consonants in Eastern Armenian\n| filename     = Hy-EA-\u0544\u0565\u0584\u0584\u0561.ogg\n| title        = Double aspirated ''k\u2019k\u2019''\n| description  = {{wikt-lang|hy|\u0544\u0565\u0584\u0584\u0561}} ''{{transl|hy|ISO|Mek\u2019k\u2019a}}'' \"[[Mecca]]\":<br>{{IPA|/\u02c8mek\u02b0k\u02b0a/}} {{IPA-hy|\u02c8mek\u02d0\u02b0a|}}\n| filename2    = Hy-EA-\u056f\u0565\u0581\u0581\u0565.ogg\n| title2       = Double aspirated ''c\u2019c\u2019''\n| description2 ={{wikt-lang|hy|\u056f\u0565\u0581\u0581\u0565}} ''{{transl|hy|ISO|kec\u2019c\u2019e}}'' \"long live!\":<br>{{IPA|/kets\u02b0\u02c8ts\u02b0e/}} {{IPA-hy|ke\u02c8t\u02d0s\u02b0e|}}}}\nWhen aspirated consonants are doubled or [[gemination|geminated]], the stop is held longer and then has an aspirated release. An aspirated affricate consists of a stop, fricative, and aspirated release. A doubled aspirated affricate has a longer hold in the stop portion and then has a release consisting of the fricative and aspiration.\n\n===Preaspiration===\n[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] have consonants with [[preaspiration]] {{IPA|[\u02b0p \u02b0t \u02b0k]}}, and some scholars{{who|date=April 2017}} interpret them as consonant clusters as well. In Icelandic, preaspirated stops [[Icelandic phonology#Aspiration and length contrasts (medial and final)|contrast with double stops and single stops]]:\n* ''{{lang|is|kapp}}'' {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u0251\u02b0p]}} or {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u0251hp]}} \"zeal\"\n* ''{{lang|is|gabb}}'' {{IPA|[k\u0251pp]}} \"hoax\"\n* ''{{lang|is|gap}}'' {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0p]}} \"opening\"\n\nPreaspirated stops also occur in most [[Sami languages]]. For example, in [[Northern Sami]], the unvoiced stop and affricate phonemes {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are pronounced preaspirated ({{IPA|[\u02b0p]}}, {{IPA|[\u02b0t]}} {{IPA|[\u02b0ts]}}, {{IPA|[\u02b0t\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[\u02b0k]}}) in medial or final position.\n\n===Fricatives and sonorants===\nAlthough most aspirated obstruents in the world's languages are stops and affricates, [[aspirated fricative]]s such as {{IPA|[s\u02b0]}}, {{IPA|[\u0278\u02b7\u02b0]}} or {{IPA|[\u0255\u02b0]}} have been documented in [[Korean language|Korean]], though these are allophones of other phonemes. Similarly, aspirated fricatives and even aspirated nasals, approximants, and trills occur in a few [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], in some [[Oto-Manguean languages]], in the Hmongic language [[Hmu language|Hmu]], and in the Siouan language [[Ofo language|Ofo]]. Some languages, such as [[Choni language|Choni Tibetan]], have as many as four contrastive aspirated fricatives {{IPA|[s\u02b0]}} {{IPA|[\u0255\u02b0]}}, {{IPA|[\u0282\u02b0]}} and {{IPA|[x\u02b0]}}.<ref>[[Guillaume Jacques]] 2011.

After an ''s'' elsewhere in a word they are normally unaspirated as well, except sometimes in compound words. When the consonants in a cluster like ''st'' are analyzed as belonging to different morphemes ([[wikt:heteromorphemic|heteromorphemic]]) the stop is aspirated, but when they are analyzed as belonging to one morpheme the stop is unaspirated.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} For instance, ''distend'' has unaspirated {{IPA|[t]}} since it is not analyzed as two morphemes, but ''distaste'' has an aspirated middle {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} because it is analyzed as ''dis-'' + ''taste'' and the word ''taste'' has an aspirated initial ''t''.\n\nWord-final voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated.\n\nVoiceless stops in [[Pashto]] are slightly aspirated prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\n===Phonemic===\nIn many languages, such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Lakota language|Lakota]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Indo-Aryan languages]], [[Dravidian languages]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Ancient Greek]], and the [[varieties of Chinese]], tenuis and aspirated consonants are [[phoneme|phonemic]]. Unaspirated consonants like {{IPA|[p\u02ed s\u02ed]}} and aspirated consonants like {{IPA|[p\u02b0 \u02b0p s\u02b0]}} are separate phonemes, and words [[distinctive feature|are distinguished]] by whether they have one or the other.\n\n====Consonant cluster====\n[[Alemannic German|Alemannic German dialects]] have unaspirated {{IPA|[p\u02ed t\u02ed k\u02ed]}} as well as aspirated {{IPA|[p\u02b0 t\u02b0 k\u02b0]}}; the latter series are usually viewed as [[consonant cluster]]s.\n\n====Tenseness====\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]] and most southern varieties of [[German language|German]], the [[Fortis and lenis|lenis]] consonants transcribed for historical reasons as {{angbr|{{IPA|b d \u0261}}}} are distinguished from their [[Fortis and lenis|fortis]] counterparts {{angbr|{{IPA|p t k}}}}, mainly in their lack of aspiration.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Absence===\n[[French language|French]],<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The sounds of French: an introduction\n|first=Bernard\n|last=Tranel\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|year=1987\n|ISBN=0-521-31510-7\n|pages=129\u2013130\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17jiE4jm-XUC\n|location=Cambridge, New York\n}}\n</ref> Standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]],<ref>Frans Hinskens, Johan Taeldeman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t8jmBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA106&dq=frisian%20substrate%20dutch&hl=nl&pg=PA66#v=snippet&q Language and space: Dutch]'', Walter de Gruyter 2014. 3110261332, 9783110261332, p.66</ref> [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Greek language|Modern Greek]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] are languages that do not have phonemic aspirated consonants.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Chinese===\n{{Listen\n| type         = speech\n| header       = Aspirated stops and fricatives in Mandarin Chinese\n| filename     = Zh-dan4.ogg\n| title        = Unaspirated ''t''\n| description  = {{transl|zh|ISO|d\u00e0n}} {{IPA-cmn|t\u00e2n|}}\n| filename2    = Zh-tan4.ogg\n| title2       = Aspirated ''t''\n| description2 = {{transl|zh|ISO|t\u00e0n}} {{IPA-cmn|t\u02b0\u00e2n|}}\n| filename3    = Zh-zao3.ogg\n| title3       = Unaspirated ''ts''\n| description3 = {{transl|zh|ISO|z\u01ceo}} {{IPA-cmn|ts\u0251\u028a\u0300|}}\n| filename4    = Zh-c\u01ceo.ogg\n| title4       = Aspirated ''ts''\n| description4 = {{transl|zh|ISO|c\u01ceo}} {{IPA-cmn|ts\u02b0\u0251\u028a\u0300|}}\n}}\n[[Standard Chinese]] (Mandarin) has stops and affricates distinguished by aspiration: for instance, {{IPA|/t t\u02b0/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0361s t\u0361s\u02b0/}}.

Muddy consonants as [[Syllable#Chinese|initial]] cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|''light'' (\u967d ''y\u00e1ng'') tone]].\n\n===Indian languages===\n{{Listen\n| type         = speech\n| filename     = Hi-\u091f\u093e\u0932 \u0920\u093e\u0932 \u0921\u093e\u0932 \u0922\u093e\u0932.ogg\n| title        = Retroflex stops in Hindi\n\n| description  = {{lang|hi|\u091f\u093e\u0932, \u0920\u093e\u0932, \u0921\u093e\u0932}}, {{wikt-lang|hi|\u0922\u093e\u0932}} ''\u1e6d\u0101l \u1e6dh\u0101l \u1e0d\u0101l \u1e0dh\u0101l'' \"postpone, wood shop, branch, shield\" {{IPA-hi|\u0288al \u0288\u02b0al \u0256al \u0256\u02b1al|}}\n\n}}\n{{main|Indo-Aryan languages#Charts|Dravidian languages#Phonology}}\nMany [[Indo-Aryan languages]] have aspirated stops.

Earlier Greek, represented by [[Mycenaean Greek]], likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop {{IPA|/k\u02b7\u02b0/}}, which later became labial, coronal, or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment.\n\nThe other Ancient Greek dialects, [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [[Doric Greek|Doric]], [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], and [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]], likely had the same three-way distinction at one point, but Doric seems to have had a fricative in place of {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} in the Classical period, and the Ionic and Aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration ([[psilosis]]).\n\nLater, during the Koine Greek period, the aspirated and voiced stops {{IPA|/t\u02b0 d/}} of Attic Greek [[Lenition#Opening|lenited]] to voiceless and voiced fricatives, yielding {{IPA|/\u03b8 \u00f0/}} in [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and [[Modern Greek]].\n\n==Other uses==\n\n===Debuccalization===\nThe term ''aspiration'' sometimes refers to the sound change of [[debuccalization]], in which a consonant is [[lenition|lenited]] (weakened) to become a [[glottal stop]] or [[voiceless glottal fricative|fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0294 h \u0266]}}.\n\n===Breathy-voiced release===\n{{main|Murmured voice}}\nSo-called voiced aspirated consonants are nearly always pronounced instead with [[breathy voice]], a type of [[phonation]] or vibration of the [[vocal folds]]. The modifier letter {{angbr|{{IPA|\u25cc\u02b0}}}} after a voiced consonant actually represents a breathy-voiced or murmured dental stop, as with the \"voiced aspirated\" bilabial stop {{angbr|{{IPA|b\u02b0}}}} in the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. This consonant is therefore more accurately transcribed as {{angbr|{{IPA|b\u0324}}}}, with the diacritic for breathy voice, or with the modifier letter {{angbr|{{IPA|b\u02b1}}}}, a superscript form of the symbol for the [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{angbr|{{IPA|\u0266}}}}.\n\nSome linguists restrict the double-dot subscript {{angbr|{{IPA|\u25cc\u0324}}}} to murmured [[sonorant]]s, such as [[vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], which are murmured throughout their duration, and use the superscript hook-aitch {{angbr|{{IPA|\u25cc\u02b1}}}} for the breathy-voiced release of obstruents.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Aspirated h]]\n*[[Breathy voice]]\n*[[Implosive consonant]]\n*[[List of phonetic topics]]\n*[[Phonation]]\n*[[Preaspiration]]\n*[[Rough breathing]]\n*[[Smooth breathing]]\n*[[Tenuis consonant]] (Unaspirated consonant)\n*[[Voice onset time]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Cho, T., & Ladefoged, P., \"Variations and universals in VOT\".

This [[vascular anomaly]] is widely known because of its occurrence in the [[central nervous system]] (usually [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation|cerebral AVM]]), but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems.\n\nAVMs are usually [[congenital]] and belong to the [[RASopathy|RASopathies]].\nThe genetic transmission patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations (for instance in the epithelial line, tumor suppressor PTEN gene) which can lead to an increased occurrence throughout the body.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nSymptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation.

Arteries carry blood away from the heart to the lungs or the rest of the body, where the blood passes through capillaries, and veins return the blood to the heart. An AVM interferes with this process by forming a direct connection of the arteries and veins. AVMs can cause intense pain and lead to serious medical problems. Although AVMs are often associated with the brain and spinal cord, they can develop in any part of the body.\n\nNormally, the arteries in the vascular system carry oxygen-rich blood, except in the case of the pulmonary artery. Structurally, arteries divide and sub-divide repeatedly, eventually forming a sponge-like [[capillary bed]]. Blood moves through the [[Capillary|capillaries]], giving up oxygen and taking up waste products, including {{chem|link=Carbon dioxide|CO|2}}, from the surrounding cells. Capillaries in turn successively join together to form veins that carry blood away. The heart acts to pump blood through arteries and uptake the venous blood.\n\nAs an AVM lacks the dampening effect of capillaries on the blood flow, the AVM can get progressively larger over time as the amount of blood flowing through it increases, forcing the heart to work harder to keep up with the extra blood flow. It also causes the surrounding area to be deprived of the functions of the capillaries\u2014removal of {{CO2}} and delivery of nutrients to the cells. The resulting tangle of blood vessels, often called a ''nidus'' (Latin for \"nest\"), has no capillaries. It can be extremely fragile and prone to bleeding because of the abnormally direct connections between high-pressure arteries and low-pressure veins. The resultant sign, audible via [[stethoscope]], is a rhythmic, whooshing sound caused by excessively rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins. It has been given the term \"bruit\", French for noise. On some occasions, a patient with a brain AVM may become aware of the noise, which can compromise hearing and interfere with sleep in addition to causing psychological distress.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:PleftkidneyAVM1.png|thumb|An arterial venous malformation of the left kidney and a simple cyst of the right kidney]]\n[[File:PleftkidneyAVM2.png|thumb|An arterial venous malformation of the left kidney leading to aneurysmal dilatation of the left renal vein and inferior vena cava]]\nAVMs are diagnosed primarily by the following methods:\n* [[Computerized tomography]] (CT) scan is a noninvasive X-ray to view the anatomical structures within the brain to detect blood in or around the brain. A newer technology called CT angiography involves the injection of contrast into the blood stream to view the arteries of the brain. This type of test provides the best pictures of blood vessels through angiography and soft tissues through CT.\n* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scan is a noninvasive test, which uses a magnetic field and radio-frequency waves to give a detailed view of the soft tissues of the brain. \n* [[Magnetic resonance angiography]] (MRA) \u2013 scans created using magnetic resonance imaging to specifically image the blood vessels and structures of the brain. A magnetic resonance angiogram can be an invasive procedure, involving the introduction of contrast dyes (e.g., gadolinium MR contrast agents) into the vasculature of a patient using a catheter inserted into an artery and passed through the blood vessels to the brain. Once the catheter is in place, the contrast dye is injected into the bloodstream and the MR images are taken.  Additionally or alternatively, flow-dependent or other contrast-free magnetic resonance imaging techniques can be used to determine the location and other properties of the vasculature.\n\nAVMs can occur in various parts of the body:\n* [[human brain|brain]] ([[Cerebral arteriovenous malformation|cerebral AV malformation]])  \n* [[spleen]]<ref name=\"pmid17145440\">{{cite journal |last1=Agrawal |first1=Aditya |last2=Whitehouse |first2=Richard |last3=Johnson |first3=Robert W. |last4=Augustine |first4=Titus |title=Giant splenic artery aneurysm associated with arteriovenous malformation |journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=1345\u20139 |year=2006 |pmid=17145440 |doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2006.06.049 }}</ref>\n* [[human lung|lung]]<ref name=\"pmid18294908\">{{cite journal |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Ujjwal K. |last2=Kothari |first2=Shyam S. |last3=Bishnoi |first3=Arvind K. |last4=Gupta |first4=Ruchika |last5=Mittal |first5=Chander M. |last6=Reddy |first6=Srikrishna |title=Successful Lobectomy for Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation Causing Recurrent Massive Haemoptysis |journal=Heart, Lung and Circulation |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=135\u20139 |year=2009 |pmid=18294908 |doi=10.1016/j.hlc.2007.11.142 }}</ref>\n* [[kidney]]<ref name=\"pmid16794894\">{{cite journal |last1=Barley |first1=Fay L. |last2=Kessel |first2=David |last3=Nicholson |first3=Tony |last4=Robertson |first4=Iain |title=Selective Embolization of Large Symptomatic Iatrogenic Renal Transplant Arteriovenous Fistula |journal=CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=1084\u20137 |year=2006 |pmid=16794894 |doi=10.1007/s00270-005-0265-z }}</ref>\n* [[spinal cord]]<ref name=\"pmid15730991\">{{cite journal |last1=Kishi |first1=K |last2=Shirai |first2=S |last3=Sonomura |first3=T |last4=Sato |first4=M |title=Selective conformal radiotherapy for arteriovenous malformation involving the spinal cord |journal=The British Journal of Radiology |volume=78 |issue=927 |pages=252\u20134 |year=2005 |pmid=15730991 |doi=10.1259/bjr/50653404 }}</ref>\n* [[liver]]<ref name=\"pmid7650340\">{{cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=Tilman |last2=Britton |first2=Peter |last3=Lomas |first3=David |last4=Wight |first4=Derek G.D. |last5=Friend |first5=Peter J. |last6=Alexander |first6=Graeme J.M. |title=Liver transplantation for hepatic arteriovenous malformation in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia |journal=Journal of Hepatology |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=586\u201390 |year=1995 |pmid=7650340 |doi=10.1016/0168-8278(95)80455-2 }}</ref>\n* [[intercostal space]]<ref name=\"pmid17056881\">{{cite journal |last1=Rivera |first1=Peter P. |last2=Kole |first2=Max K. |last3=Pelz |first3=David M. |last4=Gulka |first4=Irene B. |last5=McKenzie |first5=F.

In 1895, Atlanta hosted the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]], which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South's development to the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/06/08/102515577.pdf|title=The South: Vast Resources, Rapid Development, Wonderful Opportunities for Capital and Labor ... |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 8, 1895}}</ref>\n\n===Beginning of the 20th century===\n[[File:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumb|left|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]\n\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta experienced a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs.

The period was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906, which left at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured. In 1913, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish-American factory superintendent, was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial most see as having been deeply tainted by [[anti-Semitism]]. He was hanged in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] by a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] in 1915 after having his death sentence commuted, an event which deeply impacted the Jewish community in Atlanta and across the country, and was part of what sparked the revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Atlanta |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/atlanta |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref><ref>Klapper, Melissa, R., PhD. \"[http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/beyond-the-textbook/25059 20th-Century Jewish Immigration]\".

Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology\u2014Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.</ref>\n\nAxiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of \"right\" and \"good\" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of \"beauty\" and \"harmony.\" '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].\n\n==History==\nBetween the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated70\">Arneson, P.

Nora's husband Torvald is working in his study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts, calling her his \"little squirrel.\" He teases her about how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce. This year Torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. The maid announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's, who has come seeking employment; and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the family, who is let into the study. Kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children. Nora says that things have not been easy for them either: Torvald became sick, and they had to travel to [[Italy]] so he could recover. Kristine explains that when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers, but now that they are grown she feels her life is \"unspeakably empty.\" Nora promises to talk to Torvald about finding her a job. Kristine gently tells Nora that she is like a child. Nora is offended, so she teases the idea that she got money from \"some admirer,\" so they could travel to Italy to improve Torvald's health.  She told Torvald that her father gave her the money, but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldn't do anything economical like signing checks without their husband. Over the years, she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off.\n\nKrogstad, a lower-level employee at Torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the study. Nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. Dr. Rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched, though like everyone he wants to go on living. In contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the study, Krogstad, is \"morally diseased.\"\n\nAfter the meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes out of the study. Nora asks him if he can give Kristine a position at the bank and Torvald is very positive, saying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become available. Torvald, Kristine, and Dr. Rank leave the house, leaving Nora alone. The nanny returns with the children and Nora plays with them for a while until Krogstad creeps into the living room and surprises her. Krogstad tells Nora that Torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to intercede with Torvald to allow him to keep his job. She refuses, and Krogstad threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to Italy; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature. Krogstad leaves and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad. Torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that Krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime: he forged someone's name. Torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man \"poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation.\"\n\n===Act Two===\nKristine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume function that she and Torvald plan to attend the next day. Torvald returns from the bank, and Nora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad, claiming she is worried Krogstad will publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald dismisses her fears and explains that, although Krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is not deferential enough to Torvald in front of other bank personnel. Torvald then retires to his study to work.\n\nDr. Rank, the family friend, arrives. Nora asks him for a favor, but Rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of [[tuberculosis]] of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. She tries clumsily to tell him that she is not in love with him but that she loves him dearly as a friend.\n\nDesperate after being fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora convinces Dr. Rank to go into Torvald's study so he will not see Krogstad. When Krogstad confronts Nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of Nora's loan, but that he will instead preserve the associated [[Bond (finance)|bond]] to blackmail Torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. Nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature of [[surety]] on the bond) and put it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.\n\nNora tells Kristine of her difficult situation. Having had a relationship with Krogstad in the past before her marriage, Kristine says that they are still in love and promises to try to convince him to relent.\n\nTorvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but Nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, feigning anxiety about performing. She dances so badly and acts so childishly that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When the others go to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.\n\n===Act Three===\n\nKristine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits. Krogstad changes his mind and offers to take back his letter to Torvald. However, Kristine decides that Torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.\n\nAfter literally dragging Nora home from the party, Torvald goes to check his mail but is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has followed them. Dr. Rank chats for a while, conveying obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his letters. As he reads them, Nora steels herself to take her life. Torvald confronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that he is now completely in Krogstad's power; he must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. He says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.\n\nA maid enters, delivering a letter to Nora. The letter is from Krogstad, yet Torvald demands to read the letter and takes it from Nora. Torvald exults that he is saved, as Krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which Torvald immediately burns along with Krogstad's letters. He takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves himself more than he does Nora.\n\nTorvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife, it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. He dismisses the fact that Nora had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health, and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation. He preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.\n{{Quotebox\n|style = width:32em; max-width:32%;\n|bgcolor = #c6dbf7\n|quote = '''''We must come to a final settlement, Torvald. During eight whole years. . . we have never exchanged one serious word about serious things.'''''\n|source = Nora, in [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen's]] ''A Doll's House'' (1879)\n|salign = right\n}}\nNora tells Torvald that she is leaving him, and in a confrontational scene expresses her sense of betrayal and disillusionment. She says he has never loved her, they have become strangers to each other. She feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving Krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. She has lost her religion. She says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. Concerned for the family reputation, Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but Nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important, and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.\n\nTorvald is unable to comprehend Nora's point of view, since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life. Furthermore, he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical, and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality. Nora leaves her keys and wedding ring, and as Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened, Nora leaves the house, slamming the door behind her. Whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear.\n\n===Alternative ending===\nIbsen's German agent felt that the original ending would not play well in German theatres. Therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, Ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the German premiere. In this ending, Nora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she collapses, and the curtain is brought down. Ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a \"barbaric outrage\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/id/11111794.0|title=The alternative ending of A Doll's House|publisher=[[National Library of Norway]]|date=30 May 2005|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> Virtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all of the film versions of the play.\n\n==Composition and publication==\n\n===Real-life inspiration===\n''A Doll's House'' was based on the life of [[Laura Kieler]] (maiden name Laura Smith Petersen), a good friend of Ibsen. Much that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband, Victor. Similar to the events in the play, Laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband. She wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's tuberculosis.<ref name=\"The Guardian - 2 May 2009 - Blaming Nora\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/02/ibsen-a-dolls-house|title=Blaming Nora|last=[[A. S. Byatt]]|date=2 May 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref> She wrote to Ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt. At his refusal, she forged a check for the money. At this point she was found out. In real life, when Victor discovered about Laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known Danish author, living to the age of 83.\n\nIbsen wrote ''A Doll's House'' at the point when Laura Kieler had been committed to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. In the play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.\n\nKieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as \"Ibsen's Nora\" years afterwards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/635006762|title=Ibsen: A Doll's House|last=T\u00f6rnqvist|first=Egil|date=1995|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521478663|oclc=635006762|page=2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/610205542|title=The Wadsworth anthology of drama|last=Worthen|first=William B |date=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=9781428288157|oclc=610205542|page=667}}</ref>\n\n===Composition===\nIbsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its [[protagonist]], Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing \"a blue woollen dress\").<ref>Meyer (1967, 463\u2013467, 472).</ref> He outlined his conception of the play as a \"modern [[tragedy]]\" in a note written in Rome on 19 October 1878.<ref>Meyer (1967, 466).</ref> \"A woman cannot be herself in modern society,\" he argues, since it is \"an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.\"<ref name=\"Ibsen 1967\"/>\n\n===Publication===\nIbsen sent a [[Foul papers|fair copy]] of the completed play to his publisher on 15 September 1879.<ref>Meyer (1967, 474).</ref> It was first published in Copenhagen on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880, and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.<ref>Meyer (1967, 475).</ref>\n\n==Production history==\n''A Doll's House'' received its world premiere on 21 December 1879 at the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in Copenhagen, with Betty Hennings as Nora, Emil Poulsen as Torvald, and [[Peter Jerndorff]] as Dr. Rank.<ref>Meyer (1967, 477) and Moi (2006, 227, 230).</ref> Writing for the Norwegian newspaper ''Folkets Avis'', the critic [[Erik B\u00f8gh]] admired Ibsen's originality and technical mastery: \"Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear.\"<ref>Quoted by Meyer (1967, 477).</ref> Every performance of its run was sold out.<ref name=\"Meyer 1967, 480\">Meyer (1967, 480).</ref> Another production opened at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], on 8 January 1880, while productions in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (with Johanne Juell as Nora and Arnoldus Reimers as Torvald) and [[Bergen]] followed shortly after.<ref name=\"Meyer 1967, 479\">Meyer (1967, 479).</ref>\n\nIn Germany, the actress [[Hedwig Raabe|Hedwig Niemann-Raabe]] refused to perform the play as written, declaring, \"''I'' would never leave ''my'' children!\"<ref name=\"Meyer 1967, 480\"/> Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright, Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a \"barbaric outrage\" on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not leave.<ref name=\"Shapiro\" /><ref>Meyer (1967, 480\u2013481).</ref> A production of this version opened in [[Flensburg]] in February 1880.<ref name=m481>Meyer (1967, 481).</ref> This version was also played in [[Hamburg]], [[Dresden]], [[Hanover]], and [[Berlin]], although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-Raabe eventually restored the original ending.<ref name=m481/> Another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March 1880 at the [[Residenz Theatre]] in [[Munich]].<ref name=m481/>\n\nIn Great Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in London was in an adaptation by [[Henry Arthur Jones]] and [[Henry Herman]] called ''Breaking a Butterfly''.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.32000006471181;view=1up;seq=1 text] Jones, Henry Arthur.

Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late 1950s until the 1990s. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]].\n\nThe early Sparrow was intended primarily for use against larger targets and especially bombers, and had numerous operational limitations in other uses. Against smaller targets, the need to receive a strong reflected radar signal made achieving [[Radar lock-on|lock-on]] at the missile's effective range difficult. As the launching aircraft's own radar needed to be pointed at the target throughout the engagement, this meant that in fighter-vs-fighter combat the enemy fighter would often approach within the range of shorter-range [[infrared homing]] missiles while the launching aircraft had to continue flying towards its target. Additionally, early models were only effective against targets at roughly the same or higher altitudes, below which reflections from the ground became a problem.\n\nA number of upgraded Sparrow designs were developed to address these issues. In the early 1970s, the [[RAF]] developed a version with an [[inverse monopulse seeker]] and improved motor known as [[Skyflash]], while the [[Italian Air Force]] introduced the similar [[Aspide]]. Both had the ability to be fired at targets below the launching fighter (\"look-down, shoot down\"), were more resistant to countermeasures, and much more accurate in the terminal phases. This basic concept was then made part of the US Sparrows in the M model (for monopulse) and some of these were later updated as the P model, the last to be produced in the US. Aspides sold to [[China]] resulted in the locally produced [[LY-60 / FD-60 / PL10|PL10]]. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] also employ the Sparrow missile, though it is being phased out and replaced by the [[Mitsubishi AAM-4]].\n\nThe Sparrow was also used as the basis for a [[surface-to-air missile]], the [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow]], which is used by a number of navies for air defense of their ships. Fired at low altitude and flying directly at its target through the lower atmosphere, the range of the missile in this role is greatly reduced. With the retirement of the Sparrow in the air-to-air role, a new version of the Sea Sparrow was produced to address this concern, producing the much larger and more capable [[RIM-162 ESSM]].\n\nNATO pilots use the [[brevity code]] ''[[Fox (code word)|Fox One]]'' in radio communication to signal launch of a Semi-Active Radar Homing Missile such as the Sparrow.<ref name=\"DTIC1\">{{cite journal|date=25 April 1997 |title=Multi-service Air-Air, Air-Surface, Surface-Air brevity codes |publisher=[[Defense Technical Information Center]] (DTIC) |page=14 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/lbrevity.pdf |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209014757/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/lbrevity.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n===Sparrow I===\n[[File:XF3D-1 AAM-N-2 NAN7-54.jpg|thumb|left|Sparrow I's during tests on a [[F3D Skyknight]] in the early 1950s]]\n\n{{nowrap|The Sparrow emerged}} from a late-1940s [[United States Navy]] program to develop a guided rocket weapon for air-to-air use. In 1947 the Navy contracted [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] to build a [[beam riding]] version of a standard {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} [[HVAR]], the standard unguided aerial rocket, under  '''Project Hotshot'''. The weapon was initially dubbed '''KAS-1''', then '''AAM-2''', and, from 1948 on, '''AAM-N-2'''. The airframe was developed by [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The diameter of the HVAR proved to be inadequate for the electronics, leading Douglas to expand the missile's airframe to {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} diameter. The prototype weapon began unpowered flight-tests in 1947, and made its first aerial interception in 1952.<ref name=Designation_Systems/>\n\nAfter a protracted development cycle the initial '''AAM-N-2 ''Sparrow''''' entered limited operational service in 1954 with specially modified [[Skyknight]]s all weather carrier night fighters.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sdwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Pv4YT5SlG5PoggekxISEDA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Guided Missiles Ride Navy Jet.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', November 1954, p. 116.</ref> In 1956, they were joined by the [[F3H Demon|F3H-2M Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]] [[fighter aircraft]]. Compared to the modern versions, the Sparrow I was more [[Streamliner|streamlined]] and featured a bullet-shaped airframe with a long pointed nose.\n\nSparrow I was a limited and rather primitive weapon. The limitations of beam-riding guidance (which was slaved to an optical sight on single seater fighters and a radar with night fighters) restricted the missile to attacks against targets flying a straight course and made it essentially useless against a maneuvering target. Only about 2,000 rounds were produced to this standard.\n\n===Sparrow II===\nAs early as 1950 Douglas examined equipping the Sparrow with an active radar seeker, initially known as '''XAAM-N-2a ''Sparrow II''''', the original retroactively becoming '''''Sparrow I'''''. In 1952 it was given the new code '''AAM-N-3'''. The active radar made the Sparrow II a \"fire and forget\" weapon, allowing several to be fired at separate targets at the same time.\n\nBy 1955 Douglas proposed going ahead with development, intending it to be the primary weapon for the [[F5D Skylancer]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]]. It was later selected, with some controversy, to be the primary weapon for the Canadian [[Avro Arrow]] supersonic interceptor, along with the new Astra fire-control system. For Canadian use and as a second source for US missiles, [[Canadair]] was selected to build the missiles in [[Quebec]].\n\nThe small size of the missile forebody and the K-band AN/APQ-64-radar limited performance, and it was never able to work in testing. After considerable development and test firings in the U.S. and Canada, Douglas abandoned development in 1956. Canadair continued development until the Arrow was cancelled in 1959.\n\n===Sparrow X===\nA subvariant of the Sparrow I armed with the same nuclear warhead as the [[AIR-2 Genie|MB-1 Genie]] was proposed in 1958, but was cancelled shortly thereafter.\n\n===Sparrow III===\n[[File:Sparrow III launch F3H-2M NAN2-59.jpg|thumb|upright|[[F3H Demon]] launching a Sparrow III in 1958]]\n\nConcurrently with the development of the Sparrow I, in 1951, [[Raytheon]] began work on the [[semi-active radar homing]] version of Sparrow family of missiles, the '''AAM-N-6 ''Sparrow III'''''. The first of these weapons entered [[United States Navy]] service in 1958.\n\nThe '''AAM-N-6a''' was similar to the -6, but used a new [[Thiokol]] liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's ''F-110A Spectre'' ([[F-4 Phantom]]) fighters in 1962, known to them as the '''AIM-101'''. It entered production in 1959, with 7500 being built.\n\nAnother upgrade reverted to a Rocketdyne solid-fuel motor for the '''AAM-N-6b''', which started production in 1963. The new motor significantly increased maximum range to {{convert|35|km|mi}} for head-on attacks.\n\nDuring this year the Air Force and Navy agreed on standardized naming conventions for their missiles. The Sparrows became the AIM-7 series. The original Sparrow I and aborted Sparrow II became the '''AIM-7A''' and '''AIM-7B''', despite both being out of service. The -6, -6a and -6B became the '''AIM-7C''', '''AIM-7D''' and '''AIM-7E''' respectively.\n\n25,000 AIM-7Es were produced, and saw extensive use during the [[Vietnam War]], where its performance was generally considered disappointing. The mixed results were a combination of reliability problems (exacerbated by the tropical climate), limited pilot training in fighter-to-fighter combat, and restrictive rules of engagement that generally prohibited BVR (beyond visual range) engagements. The P<sub>k</sub> (kill probability) of the AIM-7E was less than 10%; US fighter pilots shot down 59<ref group=Note>Figure includes probables and bi-planes, which some sources sometime exclude</ref> aircraft out of the 612 Sparrows fired.<ref>Michel III p. 286, 287</ref> Of the 612 AIM-7D/E/E-2 missiles fired, 97 (or 15.8%) hit their targets, resulting in 56 (or 9.2%) kills. Two kills were obtained beyond visual range.<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006psa_winter_roundtable/watts.pdf Barry D. Watts: ''Six Decades of Guided Munitions'', Precision Strike Association, 25 January 2006, p. 5]</ref>\n\nIn 1969 an improved version, the E-2, was introduced with clipped wings and various changes to the fuzing. Considered a \"dogfight Sparrow\", the AIM-7E-2 was intended to be used at shorter ranges where the missile was still travelling at high speeds, and in the head-on aspect, making it much more useful in the visual limitations imposed on the engagements. Even so, its kill rate was only 13% in combat, leading to a practice of ripple-firing all four at once in hopes of increasing kill probability. Its worst tendency was that of detonating prematurely, approximately a thousand feet in front of the launching aircraft, but it also had many motor failures, erratic flights, and fuzing problems. An E-3 version included additional changes to the fuzing, and an E-4 featured a modified seeker for use with the [[F-14 Tomcat]].\n\n===Vietnam War (1965\u20131973) records===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[United States Air Force]] AIM-7 aerial combat kills<ref name=\"McCarthy Jr., p. 148-157\"/>\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"140pt\" |Missile firing aircraft\n!

The '''AIM-7F''', which entered service in 1976, had a dual-stage rocket motor for longer range, [[solid-state electronics]] for greatly improved reliability, and a larger warhead. Even this version had room for improvement, leading [[British Aerospace]] and the Italian firm [[Alenia Aeronautica|Alenia]] to develop advanced versions of Sparrow with better performance and improved electronics as the [[Skyflash|BAe Skyflash]] and [[Alenia Aspide]], respectively.\n\nThe most common version of the Sparrow today, the '''AIM-7M''', entered service in 1982 and featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar [[proximity fuse]], digital controls, improved [[electronic countermeasures|ECM]] resistance, and better low-altitude performance. It was used to good advantage in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills. Of 44 missiles fired, 30 (68.2%) hit their intended targets resulting in 24/26 (54.5%/59.1%) kills. 19 kills were obtained beyond visual range.<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006psa_winter_roundtable/watts.pdf Barry D. Watts: ''Six Decades of Guided Munitions'', Precision Strike Association, 25 January 2006, p. 7]</ref>\n\nThe '''AIM-7P''' is similar in most ways to the M versions, and was primarily an upgrade program for existing M-series missiles. The main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. A follow-on Block II upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. Plans initially called for all M versions to be upgraded, but currently P's are being issued as required to replace M's lost or removed from the inventory.\n\nThe final version of the missile was to have been the '''AIM-7R''', which added an [[infrared homing]] seeker to an otherwise unchanged AIM-7P Block II. A general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997.\n\nSparrow is now being phased out with the availability of the active-radar [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], but is likely to remain in service for several years.\n\n====AIM-7 variants table====\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|title=Raytheon AIM/RIM-7 Sparrow|website=www.designation-systems.net|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''AAM-N-2''' ('''AIM-7A''')\n|'''AAM-N-3''' ('''AIM-7B''')\n|'''AIM-7C'''\n|'''AIM-7E'''\n|'''AIM-7F'''\n|'''AIM-7M/P'''\n|'''RIM-7M/P'''\n|-\n|Length\n|3.74 m (147.3&nbsp;in)\n|3.85 m (151.7&nbsp;in)\n| colspan=\"5\" |3.66 m (144&nbsp;in)\n|-\n|Wingspan\n|0.94 m (37&nbsp;in)\n| colspan=\"6\" |1.02 m (40&nbsp;in)\n|-\n|Finspan\n|0.88 m (34.8&nbsp;in)\n|?\n| colspan=\"4\" |0.81 m (32&nbsp;in)\n|0.62 m (24.3&nbsp;in)\n|-\n|Diameter\n| colspan=\"7\" |0.203 m (8&nbsp;in)\n|-\n|Weight\n|143&nbsp;kg (315&nbsp;lb)\n|176&nbsp;kg (389&nbsp;lb)\n|172&nbsp;kg (380&nbsp;lb)\n|197&nbsp;kg (435&nbsp;lb)\n| colspan=\"3\" |231&nbsp;kg (510&nbsp;lb)\n|-\n|Speed\n| colspan=\"2\" |Mach 2.5\n| colspan=\"5\" |Mach 4\n|-\n|Range\n|10&nbsp;km (5.4&nbsp;nm)\n|7&nbsp;km (4&nbsp;nm)\n|11&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;nm)\n|30&nbsp;km (16&nbsp;nm)\n| colspan=\"2\" |70&nbsp;km (38&nbsp;nm)\n|26&nbsp;km (14&nbsp;nm)\n|-\n|Propulsion\n| colspan=\"3\" |Aerojet [[1.8KS7800]] solid rocket\n|Rocketdyne MK 38/MK 52\nsolid rocket\n| colspan=\"3\" |Hercules MK 58 dual-thrust solid rocket\n|-\n|Warhead\n| colspan=\"2\" |20&nbsp;kg (45&nbsp;lb)\n| colspan=\"2\" |30&nbsp;kg (65&nbsp;lb) MK 38 continuous rod\n|39&nbsp;kg (86&nbsp;lb) MK 71\ncontinuous rod\n| colspan=\"2\" |40&nbsp;kg (88&nbsp;lb) WDU-27/B\nblast-fragmentation\n|}\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Australian F-18A Hornet launches Sparrow missile c1990.jpg|An Australian F-18A Hornet fires an AIM-7 Sparrow missile.\nFile:F-4C 154 FIS AIM-7E AIM-9P 1980.JPEG|AIM-7Es being loaded on a Hawaii ANG F-4C in 1980\nFile:F-4G 37FW AIM-7F AGM-65A AGM-88 1988.JPEG|AIM-7Fs on a 37th TFW F-4G in 1988\nFile:AIM-7 wing install.jpg|Wings being installed on an AIM-7\nFile:Loading AIM-7.jpg|An AIM-7M being loaded\n</gallery>\n\n==Foreign versions==\n===Canada===\n[[File:Canadair Sparrow missile.jpg|thumb|A Sparrow II is tested at a Canadair facility.

After Douglas dropped out of this program, [[Canadair]] continued on with it until the termination of the Arrow project.\n\nThe AAM-N-3 Sparrow II was unique in that it had a fully [[active radar guidance]] system.<ref name=\"forecastinternational.com\"/> This combined both a radar transmitter and receiver in the missile, making it unnecessary for the pilot to keep the aircraft aimed at the target after firing the missile,<ref name=\"Canadair1959\">{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/canadair50otherproducts/1959missiles|title=1959missiles - canadair50otherproducts|website=sites.google.com}}</ref> unlike [[Semi-active radar homing]] (SARH) missiles which require continuous radar-assisted guidance throughout flight. This allowed the aircraft that fired the AAM-N-3 to turn away, prosecute other targets, and/or escape from potential retaliatory missiles fired by the enemy aircraft during the time it takes for the Sparrow to reach its target. Despite the significant advantages of this design over SARH guidance, all subsequent models of the Sparrow use [[semi-active radar homing]].\n\nTo accommodate the active radar guidance system, the AAM-N-3 Sparrow II had a much greater volume than its predecessor. Its size would subsequently set the precedent for all future Sparrow variants.<ref name=\"forecastinternational.com\"/>\n\nIn 1959, Canadair had completed five missiles based on airframes from Douglas, and built two models from scratch, when the program was cancelled with the cancellation of the Arrow.<ref name=\"Canadair1959\"/>\n\n===Greece===\n{{Main article|Skyguard I}}\nSkyguard I is an anti-aircraft system, utilizing ground-based AIM-7 Sparrow launchers.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main article|Alenia Aspide}}\nThe Italian company Finmeccanica (now [[Leonardo S.p.A.]]), Alenia Difesa licensed the AIM-7E Sparrow technology from the US, and produced its own improved version called '''Aspide'''.\n\n===People's Republic of China===\n{{Main article|PL-10}}\nThe LY-60/FD-60/PL-10 is a family of PRC missiles developed by the Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, largely based on the Italian Aspide missile - a version of the Sparrow.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/ly-60.htm |title= LY-60 / PL-10 |website= FAS.org |accessdate= 2014-11-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/chinese-aam-aspirations-may-build-on-alenia-aspide-10158/ |title= Chinese AAM aspirations may build on Alenia Aspide |first= Douglas |last= Barrie |website= FlightGlobal |date= 1996-11-27 }}</ref> There are four versions of the basic design, three of which are surface-to-air and one air-to-air.\n\n===Soviet Union===\nThe Soviet Union acquired an AIM-7 in 1968 and a [[Vympel PTO|Vympel]] team started copying it as the '''K-25'''.

Skyflash used a Marconi XJ521 monopulse Semi-Active seeker together with improvements to the electronics. It was powered by the Aerojet Mk52 mod 2 rocket engine (later by the Rocketdyne Mk38 mod 4). Skyflash entered service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) on their [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG.1/FGR.2]] in 1978, and later on the [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]]. Skyflash was also exported to Sweden for use on their [[Saab 37 Viggen|Viggen]] fighters.\n\nAn upgraded version with active radar seeker, called '''Active Sky Flash''' was proposed by BAe and [[Thomson-CSF]], but did not receive funding because the RAF opted for other missiles.<ref>https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/skyflash.htm</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe Sparrow has four major sections: guidance section, [[warhead]], control, and rocket motor (currently the Hercules MK-58 solid-propellant rocket motor). It has a cylindrical body with four wings at mid-body and four tail fins. Although the external dimensions of the Sparrow remained relatively unchanged from model to model, the internal components of newer missiles represent major improvements, with vastly increased capabilities. The warhead is of the [[continuous-rod warhead|continuous-rod]] type.\n\nAs with other semi-active radar guided missiles, the missile does not generate radar signals, but instead homes in on reflected continuous-wave signals from the launch platform's radar. The receiver also senses the guidance radar to enable comparisons that enhance the missile's resistance to passive jamming.\n\n==Principle of guidance ==\nThe launching aircraft will illuminate the target with its radar. In radars of the 1950s these were single target tracking devices using a [[Nutation|nutating]] horn as part of the antenna. This caused the beam to be swept in a small cone. Signal processing would be applied to determine the direction of maximum illumination and so develop a signal to steer the antenna toward the target. The missile detects the reflected signal from the target with a high gain antenna in a similar fashion and steers the entire missile toward closure with the target. The missile guidance also samples a portion of the illuminating signal via rearward pointing [[waveguide]]s. The comparison of these two signals enabled logic circuits to determine the true target reflection signal, even if the target were to eject radar-reflecting [[chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]].\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:AIM-7 operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with AIM-7 operators in blue]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{flag|Australia}}\n*{{flag|Canada}}\n*{{flag|Egypt}}\n*{{flag|Greece}}\n*{{flag|Iraq}}\n*{{flag|Iran}}\n*{{flag|Israel}}\n*{{flag|Italy}}\n*{{flag|Japan}}\n*{{flag|Jordan}}\n*{{flag|Kuwait}}\n*{{flag|Malaysia}}\n*{{flag|Saudi Arabia}}\n*{{flag|Singapore}}\n*{{flag|Pakistan}}\n*{{flag|South Korea}}\n*{{flag|Spain}}\n*{{flag|Taiwan}}\n*{{flag|Turkey}}\n*{{flag|United Kingdom}}\n*{{flag|United States}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Military of the United States|War}}\n\n* [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]\n* [[AIM-54 Phoenix]]\n* [[Sparoair]]\n* [[Brazo (missile)]]\n* [[Vympel R-27]]\n* [[List of missiles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bonds |first= Ray and David Miller |title= Illustrated Directory of Modern American Weapons |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cfpBbuIlfV0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Illustrated+Directory+of+Modern+American+Weapons#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter= AIM-7 Sparrow |publisher=Zenith Imprint, 2002 |isbn=0-7603-1346-6 |ref={{harvid|Bonds|Miller|2002}}}}\n* McCarthy Jr., Donald J.

With an effective range of about {{convert|12|mi|km}}, it was introduced as a radar [[beam riding|beam-riding]] missile and then it was improved to a [[semi-active radar homing|semiactive radar guided]] missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the [[F3H Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]], but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in its [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and early [[U.S. Air Force]] versions. The F-4 carried up to four AIM-7s in built-in recesses under its belly.\n\nAlthough designed for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, because of poor performance against fighters over North Vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. Together with the short-range, infrared-guided [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], they replaced the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well. A disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching [[fighter plane]] at a time. Also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in [[air-to-air combat]].\n\nAn active-radar variant called the Sparrow II was developed to address these drawbacks, but the U.S. Navy pulled out of the project in 1956.  The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], which took over development in the hopes of using the missile to arm their prospective [[CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor, soon followed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|title=Raytheon AIM/RIM-7 Sparrow|work=designation-systems.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>  The electronics of the time simply could not be miniaturized enough to make Sparrow II a viable working weapon.  It would take decades, and a new generation of digital electronics, to produce an effective active-radar air-to-air missile as compact as the Sparrow.\n\n===AIM-54 Phoenix LRM===\nThe US Navy later developed the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] long-range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It was a large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, Mach 5 missile designed to counter [[cruise missile]]s and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing [[Douglas F6D Missileer]] and then the navalized version of the [[F-111B#F-111B|F-111B]], it finally saw service with the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile. Phoenix was the first US [[fire-and-forget]], multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This, in theory, gave a Tomcat with a six-Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} away\u2014the only US fighter with such capability.\n\nA full load of six Phoenix missiles and its {{convert |2000|lb|kg}} dedicated launcher exceeded a typical Vietnam-era bomb load. Its service in the US Navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive [[rules of engagement]] in conflicts such as Operations [[Desert Storm]], [[Southern Watch]], and [[Iraqi Freedom]]. The US Navy retired the Phoenix in 2004<ref>{{Citation | title = Navy Retires AIM-54 Phoenix Missile | url = http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | place = United States | publisher = Navy}}</ref> in light of availability of the AIM-120 AMRAAM on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and the pending retirement of the F-14 Tomcat from active service in late 2006.\n\n===ACEVAL/AIMVAL===\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974 to 1978 at [[Nellis AFB]] using the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles as the blue force and aggressor F-5E aircraft equipped with [[AIM-9L]] [[all-aspect]] Sidewinders as the red force. This [[joint test and evaluation]] (JT&E) was designated Air Combat Evaluation/Air Intercept Missile Evaluation ([[ACEVAL/AIMVAL]]).{{citation needed| date= July 2010| reason= Dead link removed}} A principal finding was that the necessity to produce illumination for the Sparrow until impact resulted in the red force's being able to launch their all-aspect Sidewinders before impact, resulting in mutual kills. What was needed was Phoenix-type multiple-launch and terminal active capability in a Sparrow-size airframe. This led to a [[memorandum of agreement]] (MOA) with European allies (principally the UK and Germany for development) for the US to develop an advanced, medium-range, air-to-air missile with the USAF as lead service. The MOA also assigned responsibility for development of an advanced, short-range, air-to-air missile to the European team; this would become the British [[ASRAAM]].\n\n===Requirements===\n[[File:CATM 120C AMRAAM p1230119.jpg|thumb|Surface-to-air mounting (shown: CATM-120C captive training variant)]]\n\nBy the 1990s, the reliability of the Sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of Vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]]. But while the USAF had passed on the Phoenix and their own similar [[AIM-47]]/[[YF-12]] to optimize dogfight performance, they still needed a multiple-launch fire-and-forget capability for the F-15 and F-16. AMRAAM would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the F-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the Sparrow on the F-4 Phantom. The European partners needed AMRAAM to be integrated on aircraft as small as the Sea Harrier. The US Navy needed AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons.\n\nThe AMRAAM became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low [[radar cross-section]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:AIM-120 first kill.jpg|thumb|right|First successful test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico 1982]]\n\nAMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the [[Family of Weapons]] MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology. Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile ([[ASRAAM]]). Although Europe initially adopted the AMRAAM, an effort to develop the [[Meteor (missile)|Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM, was begun in Great Britain. Eventually the ASRAAM was developed solely by the British, but using another source for its infrared seeker. After protracted development, the deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September 1991 in US Air Force [[F-15 Eagle]] fighter [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s. The US Navy soon followed (in 1993) in its [[F/A-18 Hornet]] squadrons.\n\nThe eastern counterpart of AMRAAM is the somewhat similar [[Russian Air Force]] [[R-77|AA-12 \"Adder\"]], sometimes referred to in the West as the \"AMRAAMski.\" Likewise, France began its own air-to-air missile development with the [[MICA (missile)|MICA]] concept that used a common airframe for separate radar-guided and infrared-guided versions.\n\n==Operational features summary==\nAMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range (BVR) capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of US and allied aircraft to meet the threat of enemy air-to-air weapons as they existed in 1991. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. An inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.\n\nOnce the missile closes in on the target, its [[active radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, known as \"fire-and-forget\", frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to the targets.\n\nThe missile also features the ability to \"Home on Jamming,\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | title = Military Analysis Network: AIM-120 AMRAAM Slammer | date = April 14, 2000 | publisher= FAS | accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref> giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing \u2013 homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.\n\n==Guidance system overview==\n===Interception course stage===\n[[File:F-14 carrying AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] carrying an AMRAAM during a 1982 test]]\n\nAMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built-in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an [[infra-red search and track]] system, from a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]] from another fighter aircraft, or from an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] aircraft.\n\nAfter launch, if the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates\u2014such as changes in the target's direction and speed\u2014are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to \"catch\" the target aircraft in the ''basket'' (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).\n\nNot all armed services using the AMRAAM have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in beyond visual range (BVR) engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] weapon\u2014the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.\n\n===Terminal stage and impact===\nOnce the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range, within visual range (WVR) or the near BVR, it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly \"fire and forget\". {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Boresight mode===\nApart from the slave mode, there is a free guidance mode, called boresight. This mode is radar guidance-free, the missile just fires and locks onto the first thing it sees. This mode can be used for defensive shot, i.e. when the enemy has numerical superiority.\n\n==Kill probability and tactics==\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}\n\n===General considerations===\nThe [[probability of kill|kill probability]] (P<sub>k</sub>) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. Typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched at close range to the target from an aircraft with an altitude and speed advantage, it will have a good chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target. Operationally, the missile, which was designed for [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond visual range]] combat, has a P<sub>k</sub> of 63.15% (19 missiles for 12 kills, including the Syrian Su-22 downed by a US Navy F/A-18E).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-070109-1.html|title=Coffin Corners for the Joint Strike Fighter|work=ausairpower.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref> The targets included six [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]], two [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22s]], a [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb|Galeb]] and a US Army [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]] that was targeted by mistake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html|title=The Russian Philosophy of Beyond Visual Range Air Combat|author=Dr C Kopp|work=ausairpower.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40322666 \"US coalition downs first Syria government jet.\"] Retrieved 19 June 2017.</ref>\n\n==Variants and upgrades==\n[[File:Aim 120 amraam missile 20040710 145603 1.4.jpg|thumb|An AIM-120 AMRAAM missile on display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum]]\n[[File:F-22 GBU39B AIM-120 m02006120800117.jpg|thumb|right|AIM-120 AMRAAM (right) fitted in a weapons bay of a [[F-22 Raptor]]]]\n\n===Air-to-air missile versions===\nThere are currently four main variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Navy]], and the United States Marine Corps. The '''AIM-120A''' is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor {{anchor|AIM-120B|B}}'''AIM-120B'''. The AIM-120C has smaller \"clipped\" aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the USAF [[F-22 Raptor]]. AIM-120B deliveries began in 1994.\n\nThe {{anchor|AIM-120C|C}}'''AIM-120C''' deliveries began in 1996. The C-variant has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuse (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in 1998 and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being produced for both domestic and foreign customers. It helped the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] replace the [[F-14 Tomcat]]s with [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the loss of the F-14's long-range [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles (already retired) is offset with a longer-range AMRAAM-D.

[[anti-radiation missile]] designed to home in on electronic transmissions coming from surface-to-air [[radar]] systems. It was originally developed by [[Texas Instruments]] as a replacement for the [[AGM-45 Shrike]] and [[AGM-78 Standard ARM]] system. Production was later taken over by [[Raytheon Corporation]] when it purchased the defense production business of Texas Instruments.\n\n==Description==\nThe AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a [[radar antenna]] or [[transmitter]] with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, [[dual-thrust|booster-sustainer]] [[rocket motor]] propels the missile at speeds over [[Mach number|Mach 2.0]]. The HARM missile was a program led by the [[U.S. Navy]], and it was first carried by the [[A-6 Intruder|A-6E]], [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7]], and [[F/A-18]]A/B aircraft, and then it equipped the [[EA-6B]] aircraft. RDT&E for use on the [[F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] aircraft was begun, but not completed. \nThe [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF) put the HARM onto the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4G]] [[Wild Weasel]] aircraft, and later on specialized [[F-16]]s equipped with the [[HARM Targeting System]] (HTS). The HTS pod, used by the USAF, only, allows F-16 to detect and automatically target radars with HARMs instead of relying on the missile's sensors alone.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|Development history is missing and later history is thin on details|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Deployment===\nThe HARM missile was approved for full production in March 1983, obtained initial operating capability (IOC) on the A-7E Corsair II in late 1983 and then deployed in late 1985 with [[Attack Squadron 46 (United States Navy)|VA-46]] aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America'']]. In 1986, the first successful firing of the HARM from an EA-6B was performed by VAQ-131. It was soon used in combat\u2014in March 1986 against a [[Libyan Army (1951\u20132011)|Libyan]] [[S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|SA-5]] site in the [[Gulf of Sidra]], and then during [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|Operation Eldorado Canyon]] in April. HARM was used extensively by the Navy, Marine Corps, and the Air Force in [[Operation Desert Storm]] during the [[Persian Gulf War]] of 1991.\n\nDuring the Gulf War, the HARM was involved in a friendly fire incident when the pilot of an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4G]] Wild Weasel escorting a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber mistook the latter's tail gun radar for an Iraqi [[antiaircraft artillery|AAA]] site. (This was after the tail gunner of the B-52 had targeted the F-4G, mistaking it for an Iraqi [[MiG]].)  The F-4 pilot launched the missile and then saw that the target was the B-52, which was hit.  It survived with shrapnel damage to the tail and no casualties. The B-52 was subsequently renamed ''In HARM's Way''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Jon|title=B-52 Stratofortress Units in Operation Desert Storm|year=2004|publisher=Osprey|location=Oxford|isbn=1-84176-751-4|pages=47\u201348|edition=1}}</ref>\n\n\"Magnum\" is spoken over the radio to announce the launch of an AGM-88.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/usaf/docs/mcm3-1-a1.htm |title=Operational Brevity Words And Terminology |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> During the Gulf War, if an aircraft was illuminated by enemy radar a bogus \"Magnum\" call on the radio was often enough to convince the operators to power down.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lambeth | first = Benjamin | title = The Transformation of American Air Power | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-8014-3816-5 |page=112}}</ref>\nThis technique would also be employed in Serbia during air operations in 1999.\n\nIn 2013 President Obama offered the AGM-88 to Israel for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/07/01/Israel-seeks-50B-in-US-loans-to-buy-arms/UPI-49641372706630/|title=Israel seeks $5B in U.S. loans to buy arms|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===AGM-88E AARGM===\n[[File:AGM-88E HARM p1230047.jpg|left|thumb|AGM-88E]]\n\nThe newest upgrade, the ''AGM-88E Advanced Antiradiation Guided Missile (AARGM),'' features the latest software, enhanced capabilities intended to counter enemy radar shutdown, and passive radar using an additional active millimeter-wave seeker. It was released in November 2010, and it is a joint venture by the US Department of Defense and the Italian Ministry of Defense, produced by [[Orbital ATK]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn November 2005, the Italian Ministry of Defense and the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] signed a Memorandum of Agreement on the joint development of the AGM-88E AARGM missile. Italy was providing $20 million of developmental funding as well as several million dollars worth of material, equipment, and related services. The Italian Air Force was expected to buy up to 250 missiles for its [[Tornado ECR]] aircraft.
