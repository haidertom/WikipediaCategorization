It is the first film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]] and Sh\u014dwa series. The film is directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], with special effects by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]]. The film stars [[Akira Takarada]], [[Momoko K\u014dchi]], [[Akihiko Hirata]], [[Takashi Shimura]], with [[Haruo Nakajima]] and [[Katsumi Tezuka]] as the performers for Godzilla.\n\n''Godzilla'' went into production after a Japanese-Indonesian co-production collapsed. Tsuburaya originally opted for a giant octopus before the filmmakers decided on a dinosaur-inspired creature. ''Godzilla'' pioneered a form of special effects called [[suitmation]], in which a stunt actor wearing a suit crushes a miniature set. Principal photography lasted 51 days and special effects lasted 71 days.\n\n''Godzilla'' was released in [[Nagoya]] on October 27, 1954 and released nationwide on November 3, 1954 and grossed \u00a5183 million during its theatrical run.

A fishing boat from Odo is also destroyed, with one survivor. Fishing catches mysteriously drop to zero, blamed by an elder on the ancient sea creature known as \"[[Godzilla]]\". Reporters arrive on Odo Island to further investigate. A villager tells one of the reporters that \"something large is going crazy down there\", ruining the fishing. That evening, a ritual dance to appease Godzilla is held during which the reporter learns that the locals used to sacrifice young girls to the monster. That night, a large storm strikes the island, destroying the reporters' helicopter, and Godzilla, though very briefly seen, destroys 17 homes, kills nine people and 20 of the villagers' livestock.\n\nOdo residents travel to Tokyo to demand disaster relief.  The villagers' and reporters' evidence describes damage consistent with something large crushing the village. The government sends paleontologist Kyohei Yamane to lead an investigation on the island, where giant radioactive footprints and a [[trilobite]] are discovered. The village alarm bell is rung and Yamane and the villagers rush to see the monster, retreating after seeing that it is a giant [[dinosaur]], which then roars, and returns to the ocean.\n\nYamane presents his findings in Tokyo, estimating that Godzilla is {{convert|50|m|ft|0}} tall and is evolved from an ancient sea creature becoming a terrestrial animal. He concludes that Godzilla has been disturbed from its deep underwater natural habitat by underwater [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]] testing. Debate ensues about notifying the public about the danger of the monster. Meanwhile, 17 ships are lost at sea.\n\nTen [[frigate]]s are dispatched to attempt to kill the monster using [[depth charge]]s. The mission disappoints Yamane who wants Godzilla to be studied. Godzilla survives the attack and appears off-shore. Officials appeal to Yamane for ideas to kill the monster, but Yamane tells them that Godzilla is unkillable, having survived H-bomb testing, and must be studied.\n\nYamane's daughter, Emiko, decides to break off her arranged engagement to Yamane's colleague, Daisuke Serizawa, because of her love for Hideto Ogata, a salvage ship captain. When a reporter arrives and asks to interview Serizawa, Emiko escorts the reporter to Serizawa's lab. After Serizawa refuses to divulge his current work to the reporter, he gives Emiko a demonstration of his recent project on the condition she must keep it a secret. The demonstration horrifies her and she leaves without breaking off the engagement. Shortly after she returns home, the sound of Godzilla's footsteps approaching is heard. Godzilla surfaces from [[Tokyo Bay]] and enters the city, attacking [[Shinagawa]], and scattering residents from its path. A passing [[commuter train]] collides with the monster, who then destroys the train. After further destruction, Godzilla returns to the ocean.\n\nAfter consulting with international experts, the [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces]] construct a {{convert|30|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-tall}}, 50,000 volt electrified fence along the coast and deploy forces to stop and kill Godzilla. Yamane returns home, dismayed that there is no plan to study Godzilla for its resistance to radiation, where Emiko and Ogata await hoping to get his consent for them to wed. When Ogata disagrees with Yamane, arguing the threat Godzilla poses outweighs any potential benefits from studying the monster, Yamane tells him to leave. Godzilla resurfaces and breaks through the fence to Tokyo with its atomic breath, unleashing a more destructive rampage across the city. Further attempts to kill the monster with [[tanks]] and [[jet fighter|fighter jets]] fail and Godzilla once again disappears into the ocean. The [[Wako (retailer)|Wak\u014d Clocktower]], the [[National Diet Building]], and the [[Sumida River|Kachidoki Bridge]] are destroyed and there is a large loss of life. The day after, hospitals and shelters are crowded to overflowing, and a large portion of the population has radiation poisoning.\n\nDistraught by the devastation, Emiko tells Ogata about Serizawa's research, a weapon called the \"Oxygen Destroyer\", which disintegrates [[oxygen]] atoms and the organisms die of a rotting [[asphyxiation]]. Emiko and Ogata go to Serizawa to convince him to use the Oxygen Destroyer but he initially refuses. After watching a program displaying the nation's current tragedy,  Serizawa finally accepts Emiko and Ogata's pleas.\n\nA navy ship takes Ogata and Serizawa to plant the device in Tokyo Bay.  After finding Godzilla, Serizawa unloads the device and cuts off his air support, taking the secrets of the Oxygen Destroyer to his death. The mission proves to be a success and Godzilla is destroyed but many mourn Serizawa's death. Yamane reveals his belief that if [[nuclear weapons testing]] continues, another Godzilla may rise in the future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Akira Takarada]] as Hideto Ogata\n*[[Momoko K\u014dchi]] as Emiko Yamane\n*[[Akihiko Hirata]] as Dr. Daisuke Serizawa\n*[[Takashi Shimura]] as Dr. Kyohei Yamane\n*Fuyuki Murakami as Dr. Tanabe\n*Sachio Sakai as Hagiwara\n*Ren Yamamoto as Masaji Yamada\n*Toyoaki Suzuki as Shinkichi Yamada\n*Toranosuke Ogawa as President of the Nankai Shipping Company\n*Hiroshi Hayashi as Chairman of Diet Committee\n*Seijiro Onda as Oyama, Diet Committee member\n*[[Kin Sugai]] as Ozawa, Diet Committee member\n*[[Kokuten K\u014dd\u014d]] as The Old Fisherman\n*Tadashi Okabe as Assistant of Dr. Tanabe\n*Jiro Mitsuaki as Employee of Nankai Salvage Company\n*Ren Imaizumi as Radio Officer Nankai Salvage Company\n*Sokichi Maki as Chief at Maritime Safety Agency\n*[[Kenji Sahara]] as partygoer \n*[[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]] and a reporter{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=351}}\n*[[Katsumi Tezuka]] as Godzilla & Newspaper deskman{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=351}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn the film, Godzilla symbolizes nuclear holocaust from Japan's perspective and has since been culturally identified as a strong metaphor for nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"Brian\">{{cite web |last=Merchant |first=Brian |date=August 25, 2013|title=A Brief History of Godzilla, Our Never-Ending Nuclear Nightmare |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gd4e3/a-brief-history-of-godzilla-our-never-ending-nuclear-nightmare|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref> Producer [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] stated that, \"The theme of the film, from the beginning, was the terror of the bomb.

They theorized that these viewers saw Godzilla as a victim and felt that the creature's backstory reminded them of their experiences in World War II. These academics have also claimed that as the atomic bomb testing that woke Godzilla was carried out by the United States, the film in a way can be seen to blame the United States for the problems and struggles that Japan experienced after World War II had ended. They also felt that the movie could have served as a cultural coping method to help the people of Japan move on from the events of the war.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Millennial Monsters |last=Allison|first=Anne|publisher=University of California Press|date=June 30, 2006|isbn=9780520245655|location=|pages=45\u201369}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schnellb\u00e4cher |first1=Thomas|title=Has the Empire Sunk Yet?: The Pacific in Japanese Science Fiction|journal=[[Science Fiction Studies]]|date=November 2002 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=382\u2013396}}</ref><ref name=\"footprint\">{{cite journal|last1=Ryfle|first1=Steve|title=Godzilla's Footprint|journal=Virginia Quarterly Review|date=Winter 2005 |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=44\u201368}}</ref>\n\nBrian Merchant from Motherboard called the film \"a bleak, powerful metaphor for nuclear power that still endures today\" and on its themes, he stated: \"It's an unflinchingly bleak, deceptively powerful film about coping with and taking responsibility for incomprehensible, manmade tragedy.

It was a sober allegory of a film with ambitions as large as its thrice-normal budget, designed to shock and horrify an adult audience. Its roster of frightening images \u2014 cities in flames, overstuffed hospitals, irradiated children \u2014 would have been all too familiar to cinemagoers for whom memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were still less than a decade old, while its script posed deliberately inflammatory questions about the balance of postwar power and the development of nuclear energy.\" Martin also noted how the film's themes were omitted in the American version, stating, \"Its thematic preoccupation with nuclear energy proved even less acceptable to the American distributors who, after buying the film, began an extensive reshoot and recut for Western markets.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10788996/Godzilla-why-the-Japanese-original-is-no-joke.html|title=Godzilla: why the Japanese original is no joke|first=Tim|last=Martin|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 1954, [[Toho]] originally planned to produce ''Eiko-no Kagi-ni'' (''In the Shadow of Glory''), a Japanese-Indonesian co-production about the aftermath of the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, however, anti-Japanese sentiment in Indonesia forced political pressure on the government to deny visas for the Japanese filmmakers.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=33}} Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka flew to Jakarta to renegotiate with the Indonesian government but was unsuccessful and on the flight back to Japan, conceived the idea for a giant monster film inspired by the 1953 film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' and the ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'' incident that happened March of that year.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}}\n\nDuring his flight, Tanaka wrote an outline with the working title ''The Giant Monster from 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea'' and pitched it to executive producer Iwao Mori. Mori approved the project in April 1954 after special effects director [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] agreed to do the film's effects and confirmed that the film was financially feasible. Mori also felt the project was a perfect vehicle for Tsuburaya and to test the storyboarding system that he instituted at the time.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}} Mori also approved Tanaka's choice to have Ishir\u014d Honda direct the film and shortened the title of the production to ''Project G'' (G for Giant), as well as giving the production classified status and ordered Tanaka to minimize his attention on other films and mainly focus on ''Project G''.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=21}}\n\n===Writing===\nTsuburaya submitted an outline of his own, written three years before; it featured a giant octopus attacking ships in the Indian ocean.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}} In May 1954, Tanaka hired sci-fi writer Shigeru Kayama to write the story. Only 50 pages long and written in 11 days, Kayama's treatment depicted Dr. Yamane wearing dark shades, a cape and living in a European-style house from which he only emerged at night. Godzilla was portrayed as more animal-like by coming ashore to feed on animals, with an ostensibly gorilla-like interest in females. Kayama's story treatment also featured less destruction and borrowed a scene from ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'' by having Godzilla attack a lighthouse.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=25}}{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}} \n\nTakeo Murata and director Ishiro Honda co-wrote the screenplay in three weeks, confining themselves in a Japanese Inn in Tokyo's Shibuya ward.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=24}} On writing the script, Murata stated, \"Director Honda and I... racked our brains to make Mr. Kayama's original treatment into a full, working vision.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=24}} Murata stated that Tsuburaya and Tanaka also pitched their ideas as well. Tanaka requested that they do not spend too much money while Tsuburaya encouraged them to \"do whatever it takes to make it work\".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=24}}\n\nMurata and Honda redeveloped key characters and elements by adding the Emiko-Ogata-Serizawa love triangle, while in Kayama's treatment, Serizawa was depicted as merely a colleague of Dr. Yamane's.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=24}} In Kayama's treatment, Godzilla's full appearance was to be revealed during the Odo Island hurricane but Honda and Murata instead opted to hold back on revealing Godzilla by simply showing parts of the creature as the film built up to his full reveal.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=25}} Honda and Murata also introduced the characters Hagiwara and Dr. Tanabe in their draft but the role of Shinkichi, who had a substantial role in Kayama's treatment, was cut down.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=25}}\n\n===Creature design===\n[[File:Godzilla '54 design.jpg|thumb|The filmmakers took inspiration from various dinosaurs to shape Godzilla's final iconic design.]]\n\nGodzilla was designed by Teizo Toshimitsu and Akira Watanabe under Eiji Tsuburaya's supervision.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} Early on, Tanaka contemplated on having the monster be gorilla-like or whale-like in design due to the name \"Gojira\" (a combination of the Japanese words for gorilla, ''gorira,'' and whale, ''kujira'') but eventually settled on a dinosaur-like design.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=23}} Kazuyoshi Abe was hired earlier to design Godzilla but his ideas were later rejected due to Godzilla looking too humanoid and mammalian, with a head shaped like a mushroom cloud,{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} however Abe was retained to help draw the film's storyboards.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=38}} Toshimitsu and Watanabe decided to base Godzilla's design on dinosaurs and, by using dinosaur books and magazines as a reference, combined elements of a [[Tyrannosaurus]], [[Iguanodon]] and the dorsal fins of a [[Stegosaurus]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}}\n\nDespite wanting to have utilized [[stop motion]] animation, Tsuburaya reluctantly settled on [[suitmation]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} Toshimitsu sculpted three clay models on which the suit would be based. The first two were rejected but the third was approved by Tsuburaya, Tanaka, and Honda.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}}\n\nThe Godzilla suit was constructed by Kanji Yagi, Koei Yagi, and Eizo Kaimai, who used thin bamboo sticks and wire to build a frame for the interior of the suit and added metal mesh and cushioning over it to bolster its structure and finally applied coats of latex.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} Coats of molten rubber were additionally applied, followed by carved indentations and strips of latex glued onto the surface of the suit to create Godzilla's scaly hide.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} This first version of the suit weighed 100 kilograms (220 pounds). For close-ups, Toshimitsu created a smaller scale, mechanical, hand-operated puppet that sprayed streams of mist from its mouth to act as Godzilla's atomic breath.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=39}}\n\n[[Haruo Nakajima]] and [[Katsumi Tezuka]] were chosen to perform in the Godzilla suit, due to their strength and endurance.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} At the first costume fitting, Nakajima fell down while inside the suit,{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} due to the heavy latex and inflexible materials used to create the suit.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} This first version of the suit was cut in half and used for scenes requiring only partial shots of Godzilla or close-ups, with the lower-half fitted with rope suspenders for Nakajima to wear.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}}{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=39}} \n\nA second identical suit was created for full-body shots, which was made lighter than the first suit but Nakajima was still only able to be inside for three minutes before passing out.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} Nakajima lost 20 pounds during the production of the film.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=42}} Nakajima would go on to portray Godzilla and other monsters until his retirement in 1972.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=178}}\n\nTezuka filmed scenes in the Godzilla suit but due to his older body, he was unable to fully commit to the physical demands required of the role. As a result, few of his scenes made it to the final cut as very few scenes were considered usable.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=17}} Tezuka filled in for Nakajima when he was unavailable or needed relief from the physically demanding role.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=39}}\n\nGodzilla's name was also a source of consternation for the filmmakers. Because the monster had no name, the first draft of the film was not called ''Gojira'' but rather titled '''''G''''', also known as '''''Kaihatsu keikaku G''''' (\"''Development Plan G''\"), the \"G\" of the title stood for \"Giant\", however. Nakajima confirmed that Toho held a contest to name the monster.

He stated \"The first film critics to appreciate ''Godzilla'' were those in the U.S. When ''Godzilla'' was released there as ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' in 1956, the critics said such things as, 'For the start, this film frankly depicts the horrors of the Atomic Bomb.', and by these evaluations, the assessment began to impact critics in Japan and has changed their opinions over the years.\"<ref>''Memories of Ishiro Honda.

In 1984, [[Kinema Junpo]] magazine listed ''Godzilla'' as one of the top 20 Japanese films of all time, while a survey of 370 Japanese movie critics published in ''Nihon Eiga Besuto 150'' (''Best 150 Japanese Films''), had ''Godzilla'' ranked as the 27th best Japanese film ever made.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=38}}\n\nThe film was nominated for two Japanese Movie Association awards.

The characters talk about him not as an enemy but as a force of destiny, a \"god.\" The inescapable subtext is that Japan, in some bizarre way, deserves this hell.

Thompson wrote:<blockquote>\"''A lot of people are likely to be surprised by what they see. The 1954 Japanese cut is shot like a classic [[film noir]], and the buildup to Tokyo's inevitable thrashing is quite slow by today's standards. The echoes of World War II are very strong, and the devastation wrought by Godzilla (played by Haruo Nakajima) is not sugar-coated; it eerily mirrors that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the deaths and injuries are dwelt upon. The monster himself is not fully revealed for quite a while, and even when he finally shows up, he's a malevolent black predator with glistening skin, who stays mostly in the shadows, many times more fearsome than the green-skinned cookie monster who showed up in the various sequels to layeth the smacketh down on the candyasses of numerous alien invaders in ugly leotards.''\"<ref>[http://www.dallasobserver.com/2004-06-17/film/burning-japanese/ Dallas Observer]</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the few recent mixed reviews was written by [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. Ebert admitted the film was \"''an important one''\" and \"''properly decoded, was the [[Fahrenheit 9/11]] of its time,''\" but he also said:<blockquote>\"''In these days of flawless special effects, Godzilla and the city he destroys are equally crude. Godzilla at times looks uncannily like a man in a rubber suit, stomping on cardboard sets, as indeed he was, and did. Other scenes show him as a stuffed, awkward animatronic model. This was not state-of-the-art even at the time; King Kong (1933) was much more convincing. When Dr. Serizawa demonstrates the Oxygen Destroyer to his fiancee, Emiko ''{{sic}}'', the super weapon is somewhat anticlimactic. He drops a pill into a tank of tropical fish, the tank lights up, he shouts, \"stand back!\" the fianc\u00e9e screams, and the fish go belly-up.

As the boat drifts into shore, the island begins to erupt, and a giant monster lifts itself out of the volcano. A few days later, reporter Goro Maki is sailing in the area and finds the vessel intact but deserted. As he explores the vessel, he finds all the crew dead except for one young man called Hiroshi Okumura, who has been badly wounded. Suddenly a giant ''Shockirus'' [[sea louse]] attacks him but he is saved by Okumura.\n\nIn Tokyo, Okumura realizes by looking at pictures that the monster he saw was a new [[Godzilla]]. Maki writes an article about the account, but the news of Godzilla's return is kept secret  and his article is withheld. Maki visits Professor Hayashida, whose parents were lost in the 1954 Godzilla attack. Hayashida describes Godzilla as a living, invincible nuclear weapon able to cause mass destruction. At Hayashida's laboratory, Maki meets Okumura's sister, Naoko, and informs her that her brother is alive and at the police hospital.\n\nA [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarine is destroyed in the Pacific. The Soviets believe the attack was perpetrated by the Americans, and a diplomatic crisis ensues, which threatens to escalate into [[nuclear war]]. The Japanese intervene and reveal that Godzilla was behind the attacks. The [[Cabinet of Japan|Japanese cabinet]] meets to discuss Japan's defence. A new weapon is revealed, the [[Super X]], a specially-armored flying fortress that will defend the capital. The Japanese military is put on alert.\n\nGodzilla attacks the Ihama nuclear power plant. While Godzilla is feeding off the reactor, it is distracted by a flock of birds and leaves the facility. Hayashida believes that Godzilla was distracted instinctively by a homing signal from the birds. Hayashida, together with geologist Minami, propose to the Japanese Cabinet, that Godzilla could be lured back to [[Mount Mihara|Mt. Mihara]] on [[Izu \u014cshima|\u014cshima Island]] by a similar signal, and a volcanic eruption could be started, capturing Godzilla.\n\nPrime Minister Mitamura meets with Soviet and American envoys and declares that nuclear weapons will not be used on Godzilla, even if it were to attack the Japanese mainland. Meanwhile, the Soviets have their own plans to counter the threat posed by Godzilla, and a Soviet control ship disguised as a freighter in Tokyo Harbor prepares to launch a nuclear missile from one of their orbiting satellites should Godzilla attack.\n\nGodzilla is sighted at dawn in Tokyo Bay heading towards Tokyo, causing mass evacuations. The [[Japanese Air Self Defense Force]] attacks Godzilla but fails to stop its advance on the city. Godzilla soon emerges and makes short work of the [[Japanese Self Defense Force|JSDF]] stationed there. The battle causes damage to the Soviet ship and starts a missile launch count-down. The captain dies as he attempts to stop the missile from launching. Godzilla proceeds towards Tokyo's business district, wreaking havoc along the way. There, it is confronted by four laser-armed trucks and the Super X. Because Godzilla's heart is similar to a nuclear reactor, the cadmium shells that are fired into its mouth by the Super X seal and slow down its heart, knocking it unconscious.\n\nThe count-down ends and the Soviet missile is launched. The Americans intervene and fire a counter-missile at the Soviet missile. Hayashida and Okumura are extracted from Tokyo via helicopter and taken to Mt. Mihara to set up the homing device before the two missiles collide above Tokyo. The two missiles collide, producing an electrical storm and an [[Electro-magnetic pulse|EMP]], which revives Godzilla once more and temporarily disables the Super X.\n\nGodzilla and the Super X battle through the streets. Godzilla finally destroys the Super X and continues its rampage, until Hayashida uses the homing device to distract it. Godzilla leaves Tokyo and swims across the Japanese sea, following the homing device to Mt. Mihara. There, Godzilla follows the device and falls into the mouth of the volcano. Okumura activates detonators at the volcano, creating a controlled eruption that traps Godzilla inside.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ken Tanaka (actor)|Ken Tanaka]] as {{nihongo|Goro Maki|\u7267 \u543e\u90ce|Maki Goro}}\n* [[Yasuko Sawaguchi]] as {{nihongo|Naoko Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u5c1a\u5b50| Okumura Naoko}}\n* [[Yosuke Natsuki]] as {{nihongo|Professor Makoto Hayashida|\u6797\u7530 \u4fe1|Hayashida Makoto}}\n* [[Keiju Kobayashi]] as {{nihongo|[[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] Seiki Mitamura|\u4e09\u7530\u6751 \u6e05\u8f1d|Mitamura Seiki}}\n* Shin Takuma as {{nihongo|Hiroshi Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u5b8f|Okumura Hiroshi}}\n* [[Eitaro Ozawa]] as {{nihongo|[[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Minister of Finance]] Taizo Kanzaki|\u5927\u8535|Kanzaki Taizo}}\n* [[Hiroshi Koizumi]] as {{nihongo|Professor Minami|\u5357}}\n* [[Mizuho Suzuki]] as {{nihongo|[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] Seiichi Emori|\u6c5f\u5b88 \u8aa0\u4e00|Emori Seiichi}}\n* [[Taketoshi Naito]] as {{nihongo|Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirotaka Takegami|\u6b66\u4e0a \u5f18\u9686|Takegami Hirotaka}}\n* Junkichi Oritomo as {{nihongo|JSDF Chief of Staff Mori|\u6bdb\u5229}}\n* [[Kei Sat\u014d]] as {{nihongo|Chief Editor Godo|\u4f0d\u5802}}\n* Nobuo Kaneko as {{nihongo|[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)|Minister of Home Affairs]] Isomura|\u78ef\u6751}}\n* Takenori Endo as {{nihongo|Desk Editor Kitagawa|\u559c\u591a\u5ddd}}\n* [[Yoshifumi Tajima]] as {{nihongo|[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Minister of the Environment]] Hidaka|\u65e5\u9ad8}}\n* [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] as [[Godzilla]]{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=362}}\n\n==Development==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''\"We went back to the theme of nuclear weapons, since that was the theme of the original film.

In 1983, American director [[Steve Miner]] proposed directing a ''Godzilla'' film at his own expense. Toho approved of the project, and Miner hired [[Fred Dekker]] to write the screenplay and paleosculptor Steve Czerkas to redesign the monster. The project was however hampered by Miner's insistence on using prohibitively costly [[stop-motion animation]] and shooting the film in [[3D film|3D]], and was thus rejected by major American movie studios. Under pressure from a 10,000-member group of Japanese ''Godzilla'' fans calling themselves the \"Godzilla Resurrection Committee\", Tanaka decided to helm a Japanese film for \"strictly domestic consumption\" to be released jointly alongside Miner's movie.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.1\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Cybot Goji.jpg|thumb|Construction of the hydraulic \"Cybot\" Godzilla]]\nIn an effort to disavow Godzilla's increasingly heroic and anthropomorphic depiction in previous films, Tanaka insisted on making a direct sequel to the original 1954 movie.

At the time, it was rumored that Ifukube refused to participate in the film due to the changes made to Godzilla, stating, \"I do not write music for 80-meter monsters\". However, this quote was later clarified, by Ifukube's biographer Erik Homenick and ''Japanese Giants'' editor Ed Godziszewski, as a joke spread by fans which was later misinterpreted as fact. Ifukube declined to score the film due to his priorities, at the time, teaching composition at the Tokyo College of Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tohokingdom.com/blog/urban-legends-i-do-not-write-music-for-80-meter-monsters/|title=Urban Legends: \"I Do Not Write Music For 80-meter Monsters!\"|first=Patrick|last=Galvan|work=Toho Kingdom|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe special effects were again directed by [[Teruyoshi Nakano]], who had directed the special effects of several previous ''Godzilla'' films. The decision was made by Tanaka to increase the apparent height of Godzilla from {{Convert|50|m|ft}} to {{Convert|80|m|ft}} so that Godzilla would not be dwarfed by the contemporary skyline of Tokyo. This meant that the miniatures had to be built to a {{frac|1|40}}th scale, and this contributed to an increase in the budget of the film to $6.25 million. Tanaka and Nakano supervised suit-maker Noboyuki Yasumaru in constructing a new Godzilla design, incorporating ears and four toes, features not seen since ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]''.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.2\"/> Nakano insisted on infusing elements into the design that suggested sadness, such as downward-facing eyes and sloping shoulders.<ref name=\"nakano2014\"/> \n\nSuit construction took two months, and consisted of separately casting body-part molds with [[Polyurethane|urethane]] on a pre-built, life-size statue of the final design. Yasumaru personally took charge of all phases of suit-building, unlike in previous productions wherein the different stages of suit-production were handled by different craftsmen.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.2\"/> The final suit was constructed to accommodate stuntman Hiroshi Yamawaki, but he declined suddenly, and was replaced by veteran suit actor [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]], who had portrayed [[Hedorah]] and [[Gigan]] in the Showa Era. Because the {{convert|110|kg|abbr=on}} suit wasn't built to his measurements, Satsuma had difficulty performing, being able to last only ten minutes within it, and losing 12 pounds during filming.<ref name=\"kalat2010\"/> Hoping to avoid having Godzilla move in an overly human fashion, Nakano instructed Satsuma to base his actions on [[Noh]], a traditional Japanese dance.<ref name=\"nakano2014\"/>\n\nTaking inspiration from the publicity surrounding the 40-foot tall King Kong model from [[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s [[King Kong (1976 film)|1976 film of the same name]], Toho spent a reported $475,000 on a 16-foot high robotic Godzilla (dubbed \"Cybot\") for use in close-up shots of the creature's head. The Cybot consisted of a [[hydraulics|hydraulically-powered]] mechanical endoskeleton covered in [[Polyurethane|urethane]] skin containing 3,000 computer operated parts which permitted it to tilt its head, and move its lips and arms.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.2\"/> Unlike previous Godzilla suits, whose lower jaws consisted of wire-operated flaps, the Cybot's jaws were hinged like those of an actual animal, and slid back as they opened.<ref name=\"nakano2014\"/> A life-size, crane operated foot was also built for close-up shots of city destruction scenes.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.2\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''The Return of Godzilla'' was released on December 15, 1984 in Japan where it was distributed by [[Toho]].<ref name=\"galbraith\"/> It was a reasonable success in Japan, with attendance figures at approximately 3,200,000 and the box office gross being approximately $11 million (the film's budget was $6.25 million).<ref>{{cite book |title=Godzilla on my mind: fifty years of the king of monsters\n |first=William |last=Tsutsui |year=2004 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |location=New York, New York |page=65 |isbn=1-4039-6474-2 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nDespite its American re-edit receiving negative reviews, the original Japanese cut of the film has been much more well-received by critics and fans.

[[New World Pictures]] acquired ''The Return of Godzilla'' for distribution in North America, and changed the title to ''Godzilla 1985'', bringing back [[Raymond Burr]] in order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters!]]''. Originally, New World reportedly planned to re-write the dialogue in order to turn the film into a tongue-in-cheek comedy starring [[Leslie Nielsen]] (\u00e0 la ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]''), but this plan was reportedly scrapped because Raymond Burr expressed displeasure at the idea, taking the idea of Godzilla as a nuclear metaphor seriously. The only dialogue left over from that script was \"That's quite an urban renewal program they've got going on over there,\" said by Major McDonahue. All of Burr's scenes were filmed in one day to suit his schedule. He was paid US $50,000. The reverse shots, of the actors he was speaking to, were filmed the next day, and the American filming was completed in three days. One of the most controversial changes done on the film was having Soviet Colonel Kashirin deliberately launch the nuclear missile rather than die in attempting to prevent its launch. Director R. J. Kizer later attributed this to New World's management's conservative leanings.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.3\">{{cite book |title=Japan\u2019s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=237\u201341}}</ref>\n\nThe newly edited film also contained numerous [[product placement]]s for [[Dr Pepper]], which had twice used Godzilla in its commercials.

Fichte also wrote works of [[political philosophy]]; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of [[German nationalism]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Origins===\nFichte was born in [[Rammenau]], [[Upper Lusatia]]. The son of a ribbon weaver,<ref name=\"nie\">{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1905}}</ref> he came of peasant stock which had lived in the region for many generations. The family was noted in the neighborhood for its probity and piety. Christian Fichte, Johann Gottlieb's father, married somewhat above his station. It has been suggested that a certain impatience which Fichte himself displayed throughout his life was an inheritance from his mother.<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\nYoung Fichte received the rudiments of his education from his father. He showed remarkable ability from an early age, and it was owing to his reputation among the villagers that he gained the opportunity for a better education than he otherwise would have received. The story runs that the Freiherr von Militz, a country landowner, arrived too late to hear the local pastor preach. He was, however, informed that a lad in the neighborhood would be able to repeat the sermon practically verbatim. As a result, the baron took the lad into his protection, which meant that he paid his tuition.<ref name=\"americana\">{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1920}}</ref>\n\n===Early schooling===\nFichte was placed in the family of Pastor Krebel at [[Niederau]] near [[Meissen]] and there received thorough grounding in the [[classics]]. From this time onward, Fichte saw little of his parents. In October 1774, he was attending the celebrated foundation-school at [[Pforta]] near [[Naumburg]]. This school is associated with the names of [[Novalis]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. The spirit of the institution was semi-monastic and, while the education given was excellent in its way, it is doubtful whether there was enough social life and contact with the world for a pupil of Fichte's temperament and antecedents. Perhaps his education strengthened a tendency toward introspection and independence, characteristics which appear strongly in his doctrines and writings.<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\n===Theological studies and private tutoring===\nIn 1780, he began study at the theology seminary of [[University of Jena]]. He was transferred a year later to study at the [[Leipzig University]]. Fichte seems to have supported himself at this period of bitter poverty and hard struggle.<ref name=\"americana\"/> Freiherr von Militz continued to support him, but when he died in 1784, Fichte had to end his studies prematurely, without completing his degree.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=2}}</ref>\n\nDuring the years 1784 to 1788, he supported himself in a precarious way as tutor in various Saxon families.<ref name=\"nie\"/> In early 1788, he returned to [[Leipzig]] in the hope of finding a better employment, but eventually he had to settle for a much less promising position with the family of an innkeeper in [[Zurich]].<ref>Anthony J.

The situation, however, quickly proved disagreeable and he was released. He then got a chance to see Kant at [[K\u00f6nigsberg]].

This essay, completed in five weeks, was the ''Versuch einer Critik<!--[sic]--> aller Offenbarung'' (''[[Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation]]'', 1792).<ref name=\"americana\"/> In this book, according to Henrich, Fichte investigated the connections between divine revelation and Kant's [[critical philosophy]]. The first edition of the book was published without Kant or Fichte's knowledge, moreover without Fichte's name or signed preface.  It was thus mistakenly thought to be a new work by Kant himself.<ref>Traditionally, it has been assumed that either the omission was an accident or a deliberate attempt by the publisher to move copies.

Stirred by the events and principles of the [[French Revolution]], he wrote and anonymously published two pamphlets which led to him being seen as a devoted defender of liberty of thought and action and an advocate of political changes. In December of the same year, he received an invitation to fill the position of extraordinary professor of philosophy at the [[University of Jena]]. He accepted and began his lectures in May of the next year. With extraordinary zeal, he expounded his system of \"[[transcendental idealism]]\". His success was immediate. He seems to have excelled as a lecturer because of the earnestness and force of his personality. These lectures were later published under the title ''The Vocation of the Scholar'' (''Einige Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Bestimmung des Gelehrten''). He gave himself up to intense production, and a succession of works soon appeared.<ref name=\"nie\"/><ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\n===Atheism Dispute===\n{{main|Atheism Dispute}}\nAfter weathering a couple of academic storms, he was finally dismissed from Jena in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism. He was accused of atheism in 1798 after publishing his essay \"Ueber<!--[sic]--> den Grund unsers<!--[sic]--> Glaubens an eine g\u00f6ttliche Weltregierung\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\"), which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay \"Development of the Concept of Religion\", in his ''Philosophical Journal''. For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: \"The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God. We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\").\n\nFichte's intemperate \"Appeal to the Public\" (\"Appellation an das Publikum\", 1799) provoked [[F. H. Jacobi]] to publish an [[open letter]] to Fichte, in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte's [[transcendental philosophy]] in particular with [[nihilism]].<ref name=SEP/>\n\n===Berlin===\nSince all the German states except Prussia had joined in the cry against him, he was forced to go to Berlin. There he associated himself with the Schlegels, [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]].<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\nIn April 1800, through the introduction of Hungarian writer [[Ignaz Aurelius Fessler]], he was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the Lodge Pythagoras of the Blazing Star where he was elected minor warden. At first Fichte was a warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid him in his proposed Masonic reform. But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among Freemasons.<ref name=\"Mackey\">{{Cite book|journal=Mackey's National Freemason|title=Fichte as a Freemason: October 1872 to September 1873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ip5bF1xtRB0C&pg=PA430|page=430|date=2003|editor=Albert G.

The [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|disaster at Jena]] in 1806, in which [[Napoleon]] completely crushed the Prussian army, drove him to K\u00f6nigsberg for a time, but he returned to Berlin in 1807 and continued his literary activity.<ref name=\"nie\"/><ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\nThe deplorable situation of Germany stirred him to the depths and led him to deliver the famous ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]'' (''Reden an die deutsche Nation'', 1808) which guided the uprising against Napoleon. He became a professor of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|new university at Berlin]] founded in 1810. By the votes of his colleagues Fichte was unanimously elected its rector in the succeeding year. But, once more, his impetuosity and reforming zeal led to friction, and he resigned in 1812. The campaign against Napoleon began, and the hospitals at Berlin were soon full of patients. Fichte's wife devoted herself to nursing and caught a virulent fever. Just as she was recovering, he himself was stricken down. He died of [[typhus]] at the age of 51.<ref name=\"nie\"/><ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\nHis son, [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] (18 July 1796 \u2013 8 August 1879), also made contributions to [[philosophy]].\n\n==Philosophical work==\nIn mimicking Kant's difficult style, his critics argued that Fichte produced works that were barely intelligible. \"He made no hesitation in pluming himself on his great skill in the shadowy and obscure, by often remarking to his pupils, that 'there was only one man in the world who could fully understand his writings; and even he was often at a loss to seize upon his real meaning.'\"<ref>Robert Blakely, ''History of the Philosophy of Mind'', Vol. IV, p. 114, London: Longmans, 1850</ref> On the other hand, Fichte himself acknowledged the difficulty of his writings, but argued that his works were clear and transparent to those who made the effort to think without preconceptions and prejudices.\n\nFichte did not endorse Kant's argument for the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]], of \"things in themselves\", the supra-sensible reality beyond the categories of direct human perception. Fichte saw the rigorous and [[system]]atic separation of \"things in themselves\" ([[noumenon|noumena]]) and things \"as they appear to us\" ([[phenomenon|phenomena]]) as an invitation to [[skepticism]]. Rather than invite such skepticism, Fichte made the radical suggestion that we should throw out the notion of a noumenal world and instead accept the fact that [[consciousness]] does not have a grounding in a so-called \"real world\". In fact, Fichte achieved fame for originating the argument that consciousness is not grounded in ''anything'' outside of itself. The phenomenal world as such, arises from self-consciousness; the activity of the ego; and moral awareness. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], wrote:\n\n{{Quotation|Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, \u00a713}}\n\n[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] was also a student of the writings of Fichte: \n{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by \u2014 to use the words of another author \u2014 Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and Robespierre's attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment \u2014 whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong \u2014 both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.|S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Journals'', \"Our Journalistic Literature\", November 28, 1835<ref>[http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_B.html Journals and Papers of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, 1B]</ref>}}\n\n===Central theory===\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}\nIn his work ''[[Foundations of Natural Right]]'' (1797), Fichte argued that [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] was a social phenomenon \u2014 an important step and perhaps the first clear step taken in this direction by modern philosophy. A necessary condition of every subject's self-awareness, for Fichte, is the existence of other rational subjects. These others call or summon (''fordern auf'') the subject or self out of its unconsciousness and into an awareness of itself as a free individual.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foundations of Natural Right|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/96398724/Fichte-Foundations-of-Natural-Right-1797|website=Scribd|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nFichte's account proceeds from the general principle that the I (''das Ich'') must posit itself as an individual in order to posit (''setzen'') itself at all, and that in order to posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as it were to a calling or summons (''Aufforderung'') by other free individual(s) \u2014 called, moreover, to limit its own freedom out of respect for the freedom of the other. The same condition applied and applies, of course, to the other(s) in its development. Hence, mutual recognition (''gegenseitig anerkennen'') of rational individuals turns out to be a condition necessary for the individual I in general.<ref>Fichte, J. G. (2000), ''Foundations of Natural Right, according to the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre'', ed. F. Neuhouser, trans. M. Baur. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 42.</ref><ref>[[Allen W. Wood]], ''The Free Development of Each: Studies on Reason, Right, and Ethics in Classical German Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 207: \"The whole point of the summons, in fact, is that it is what first makes our individuality possible for us, through presenting us with the concept of our own individual free action in the form of an object of our consciousness.\"</ref> This argument for [[intersubjectivity]] is central to the conception of selfhood developed in the ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]''<ref>Also translated as ''Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge''.</ref> (''Grundlage der gesamten<!--[sic]--> Wissenschaftslehre'', 1794/1795). In Fichte's view consciousness of the self depends upon resistance or a check by something that is understood as not part of the self yet is not immediately ascribable to a particular sensory perception.  In his later 1796\u20131799 lectures (his ''Nova methodo''), Fichte incorporated it into his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system, where the summons takes its place alongside original feeling, which takes the place of the earlier ''Anstoss'' (see below) as both a limit upon the absolute freedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same.\n\nThe I itself posits this situation for itself. To posit does not mean to 'create' the objects of consciousness. The principle in question simply states that the essence of an I lies in the assertion of one's own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness presupposes self-consciousness. Such immediate self-identity, however, cannot be understood as a psychological fact, nor as an act or accident of some previously existing substance or being. It is an action of the I, but one that is identical with the very existence of this same I. In Fichte's technical terminology, the original unity of self-consciousness is to be understood both as an action and as the product of the same I, as a \"fact and/or act\" (''Thathandlung''; [[Modern German]]: ''Tathandlung''), a unity that is presupposed by and contained within every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, although it never appears as such therein.\n\nThe I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit itself only insofar as it posits itself as limited. Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its own limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits. The finite I cannot be the ground of its own passivity. Instead, for Fichte, if the I is to posit itself off at all, it must simply discover itself to be limited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as an \"impulse,\"<ref>Breazeale 2013, p. vii.</ref> \"repulse,\"<ref>Nicholas Adams, George Pattison, Graham Ward (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Theology and Modern European Thought'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 129.</ref> or \"resistance\"<ref>Jeffrey Reid, ''The Anti-Romantic: Hegel Against Ironic Romanticism'', A&C Black, 2014, p. 26.</ref> (''Anstoss''; Modern German: ''[[wikt:Ansto\u00df|Ansto\u00df]]'') to the free practical activity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a limit for the I only insofar as the I posits it out as a limit. The I does this, according to Fichte's analysis, by positing its own limitation, first, as only a feeling, then as a sensation, then as an intuition of a thing, and finally as a summons of another person. The ''Anstoss'' thus provides the essential impetus that first posits in motion the entire complex train of activities that finally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves and others as empirical individuals and of the world around us.\n\nThough ''Anstoss'' plays a similar role as the [[thing in itself]] does in [[Kantian]] philosophy, unlike Kant, Fichte's ''Anstoss'' is not something foreign to the I. Instead, it denotes the original encounter of the I with its own finitude. Rather than claim that the not-I (''das Nicht-Ich'') is the cause or ground of the ''Anstoss'', Fichte argues that not-I is posited by the I precisely in order to explain to itself the ''Anstoss'', that is, in order to become conscious of ''Anstoss''.\n\nThough the ''Wissenschaftslehre'' demonstrates that such an ''Anstoss'' must occur if self-consciousness is to come about, it is quite unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such an ''Anstoss'' \u2014 except as a condition for the possibility of consciousness. Accordingly, there are strict limits to what can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience, and this limitation, for Fichte, equally applies to Kant's transcendental philosophy.\n\nAccording to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain that the world must have space, time, and causality, but it can never explain why objects have the particular sensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate individual rather than another. This is something that the I simply has to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom, and indeed, as a condition for the latter.\n\n[[Dieter Henrich]] (1966) proposed that Fichte was able to move beyond a \"reflective theory of consciousness\". According to Fichte, the self must already have some prior acquaintance with itself, independent of the act of reflection (\"no object comes to consciousness except under the condition that I am aware of myself, the conscious subject [''jedes Object kommt zum Bewusstseyn lediglich unter der Bedingung, dass ich auch meiner selbst, des bewusstseyenden Subjects mir bewusst sey'']\").<ref>Fichte, J. G., ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (1797/1798): II.2; ''Gesamtausgabe'' I/4:274\u2013275.</ref> This idea is what Henrich called [[Fichte's original insight]].<ref name=\"Henrich\">[[Dieter Henrich]], \"Fichte's Original Insight\", ''Contemporary German Philosophy'' 1 (1982 [1966]), ed. by Darrel E. Christensen ''et al.'', pp. 15\u201352 (translation of Henrich, Dieter (1966), \"Fichtes urspr\u00fcngliche Einsicht\", in: ''Subjektivit\u00e4t und Metaphysik. Festschrift f\u00fcr Wolfgang Cramer'' edited by D. Henrich und H. Wagner, Frankfurt/M., pp. 188\u2013232). Henrich's article is an analysis of the following three presentations of the ''[[Gnosology|Wissenschaftslehre]]'': ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge|Grundlage der gesamten<!--[sic]--> Wissenschaftslehre]]'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794/1795), ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''An Attempt a New Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1797/1798), and ''Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1801).</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nFichte also developed a theory of the state based on the idea of self-sufficiency. In his mind, the state should control international relations, the value of money, and remain an [[autarky]].  Because of this necessity to have relations with other rational beings in order to achieve consciousness, Fichte writes that there must be a 'relation of right', in which there is a mutual recognition of rationality by both parties.\n\n===Nationalism===\nBetween December 1807 and March 1808, Fichte gave a series of lectures concerning the \"German nation\" and its culture and language, projecting the kind of national education he hoped would raise it from the humiliation of its defeat at the hands of the French. <ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=25}}</ref> Having been a supporter of Revolutionary France, Fichte became disenchanted by 1804 as Napoleon's armies advanced through Europe, occupying German territories, stripping them of their raw materials and subjugating them to foreign rule. Consequently, Fichte came to believe Germany would be responsible to carry the virtues of the French Revolution into the future. Furthermore, his nationalism was not aroused by Prussian military defeat and humiliation, for these had not yet occurred, but resulted from devotion to his own humanitarian philosophy. Through disappointment in the French he turned to the German nation as the instrument of fulfilling it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Eugene|title=Nationalism and the Culture Crisis in Prussia: 1806-1815|year=1966|publisher=Octagon Press|page=29}}</ref> These lectures, entitled the ''Addresses to the German Nation'', coincided with a period of reform in the Prussian government, under the chancellorship of [[Baron vom Stein]]. The ''Addresses'' display Fichte's interest during that period in language and culture as vehicles of human spiritual development. Fichte built upon the earlier ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and attempted to unite them with his more systematic approach. The aim of the German nation, according to Fichte, was to \"found an empire of spirit and reason, and to annihilate completely the crude physical force that rules of the world.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Fichte|first=Johann Gottlieb|title=Addresses to the German Nation|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=496}}</ref> Like Herder's German nationalism, Fichte's was wholly cultural, and grounded in the aesthetic, literary, and moral.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=25}}</ref>\n\nThe nationalism propounded by Fichte in the ''Addresses'' would be appealed to over a century later by the Nazi Party in Germany, which sought in Fichte a forerunner to its own nationalist ideology. Like [[Nietzsche]], the association of Fichte with the Nazi regime came to colour readings of Fichte's German nationalism in the post-war period.<ref>{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Rohan|title=The Roots of National Socialism|year=1941|publisher=Faber & Faber|page=38\u201339}}</ref> This reading of Fichte was often bolstered through reference to an unpublished letter from 1793, ''Contributions to the Correction of the Public's Judgment concerning the French Revolution'', wherein Fichte expressed anti-semitic sentiments, such as arguing against extending civil rights to Jews and calling them a \"state within a state\" that could \"undermine\" the German nation.<ref name=\"Gesamtausgabe I/1 pp. 292\">''Gesamtausgabe'', I/1, pp.&nbsp;292\u2013293</ref> However, attached to the letter is a footnote in which Fichte provides an impassioned plea for permitting Jews to practice their religion without hindrance.

In ''The Characteristics of the Present Age'' (''Die Grundz\u00fcge des gegenw\u00e4rtigen Zeitalters''), Fichte outlines his theory of different historical and cultural epochs. His mystic work ''The Way Towards the Blessed Life'' (''Die Anweisung zum seligen Leben oder auch die Religionslehre'') gave his fullest thoughts on religion. In 1808 he gave a series of speeches in French-occupied Berlin, ''Addresses to the German Nation''.\n\nIn 1810, the new [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was set up, designed along lines put forward by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].

This designation, however, is not universal. Those living on the shore of Lake Superior often refer to all the other lakes as \"the lower lakes\", because they are farther south. Sailors of bulk freighters transferring cargoes from Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to ports on Lake Erie or Ontario commonly refer to the latter as the lower lakes and Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior as the upper lakes. This corresponds to thinking of Lakes Erie and Ontario as \"down south\" and the others as \"up north\".

An alternate track is via the Illinois River (from Chicago), to the Mississippi, up the Ohio, and then through the [[Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway]] (a combination of a series of rivers and lakes and canals), to [[Mobile Bay]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]].

Even late in winter, the lakes often have no icepack in the middle. The prevailing winds from the west pick up the air and moisture from the lake surface, which is slightly warmer in relation to the cold surface winds above. As the slightly warmer, moist air passes over the colder land surface, the moisture often produces concentrated, heavy snowfall that sets up in bands or \"streamers\". This is similar to the effect of warmer air dropping snow as it passes over mountain ranges. During freezing weather with high winds, the \"snow belts\" receive regular snow fall from this localized weather pattern, especially along the eastern shores of the lakes. [[Snow belt]]s are found in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, United States; and Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe lakes also moderate seasonal temperatures to some degree, but not with as large an influence as do large oceans; they absorb heat and cool the air in summer, then slowly radiate that heat in autumn. They protect against frost during transitional weather, and keep the summertime temperatures cooler than further inland. This effect can be very localized and overridden by offshore wind patterns. This temperature buffering produces areas known as \"[[Fruit Belt|fruit belts]]\", where fruit can be produced that is typically grown much farther south. For instance, [[Western Michigan]] has apple and cherry orchards, and vineyards cultivated adjacent to the lake shore as far north as the [[Grand Traverse Bay]] and [[Nottawasaga Bay]] in central Ontario. The eastern shore of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie have many successful wineries because of the moderating effect, as does the [[Niagara Peninsula]] between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. A similar phenomenon allows wineries to flourish in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of New York, as well as in [[Prince Edward County, Ontario]] on Lake Ontario's northeast shore. Related to the lake effect is the regular occurrence of [[fog]] over medium-sized areas, particularly along the shorelines of the lakes. This is most noticeable along Lake Superior's shores.\n\nThe Great Lakes have been observed to help intensify storms, such as [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954, and the [[2011 Goderich, Ontario tornado]], which moved onshore as a tornadic waterspout. In 1996 a rare tropical or subtropical storm was observed forming in Lake Huron, dubbed the [[1996 Lake Huron cyclone]]. Rather large severe thunderstorms covering wide areas are well known in the Great Lakes during mid-summer; these [[Mesoscale convective complex]]s or MCCs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=m|title=Glossary |publisher= NOAA's National Weather Service}}</ref> can cause damage to wide swaths of forest and shatter glass in city buildings. These storms mainly occur during the night, and the systems sometimes have small embedded tornadoes, but more often straight-line winds accompanied by intense lightning.\n\n==Ecology==\n\n[[File:USGS image cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Generalized schematic of Great Lakes waterline ecosystem]]\n\nHistorically, the Great Lakes, in addition to their [[lake ecology]], were surrounded by various [[forest]] [[ecoregion]]s (except in a relatively small area of southeast Lake Michigan where savanna or prairie occasionally intruded). Logging, urbanization, and agriculture uses have changed that relationship. In the early 21st century, Lake Superior's shores are 91% forested, Lake Huron 68%, Lake Ontario 49%, Lake Michigan 41%, and Lake Erie, where logging and urbanization has been most extensive, 21%. Some of these forests are second or third growth (i.e. they have been logged before, changing their composition). At least 13 wildlife species are documented as becoming extinct since the arrival of Europeans, and many more are threatened or endangered.<ref name=Grady/> Meanwhile, exotic and invasive species have also been introduced.\n\n===Fauna===\n{{see also|Category:Fauna of the Great Lakes region (North America)|Category:Fish of the Great Lakes|Asian carp in North America}}\n[[File:Lakesturgeon public U.S.Fish&Wildlife.jpg|thumb|[[Lake sturgeon]], the largest native fish in the Great Lakes and the subject of extensive commercial fishing in the 19th and 20th centuries is listed as a threatened species<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/sturgeon/biology.htm|title=Great Lakes Lake Sturgeon Web Site|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|work=fws.gov}}</ref>]]\nThe organisms living on the bottom of shallow waters are similar to those found in smaller lakes. The deep waters, however, contain organisms found only in deep, cold lakes of the northern latitudes.  These include the [[delicate opossum shrimp]] (order [[mysida]]), the [[deepwater scud]] (a crustacean of the order [[amphipoda]]), two types of [[copepods]], and the [[deepwater sculpin]] (a spiny, large-headed fish).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Lakes |title=Great Lakes |last1=Beeton  |first1=Alfred  |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  |access-date=January 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Lakes are an important source of [[fishing]]. Early European settlers were astounded by both the variety and quantity of fish; there were 150 different species in the Great Lakes.<ref name=\"Grady\" /> Throughout history, fish populations were the early indicator of the condition of the Lakes and have remained one of the key indicators even in the current era of sophisticated analyses and measuring instruments.

In the early 19th century, the government of [[Upper Canada]] found it necessary to introduce similar legislation prohibiting the use of weirs and nets at the mouths of Lake Ontario's tributaries. Other protective legislation was passed, as well, but enforcement remained difficult.<ref name=\"Bogue2001m\">{{cite book|author=Margaret Beattie Bogue|title=Fishing the Great Lakes: An Environmental History, 1783\u20131933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn7IlRl8DhsC&pg=PA180|date=June 28, 2001|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-16763-9|page=180}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the Canada\u2013United States border, the proliferation of [[dam]]s and impoundments have multiplied, necessitating more regulatory efforts.

Mercury compounds have been used in paper mills to prevent slime from forming during their production, and chemical companies have used mercury to separate chlorine from brine solutions. Studies conducted by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have shown that when the mercury comes in contact with many of the bacteria and compounds in the fresh water, it forms the compound [[Methylmercury|methyl mercury]], which has a much greater impact on human health than elemental mercury due to a higher propensity for absorption. This form of mercury is not detrimental to a majority of fish types, but is very detrimental to people and other wildlife animals who consume the fish. Mercury has been known for health related problems such as birth defects in humans and animals, and the near extinction of eagles in the Great Lakes region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/mercuryspills.htm |title=Mercury Spills |publisher=Idph.state.il.us |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Sewage ====\nThe amount of raw sewage dumped into the waters was the primary focus of both the first [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]] and federal laws passed in both countries during the 1970s.

Many of the larger cities owe their existence to their position on the lakes as a freight destination as well as for being a magnet for immigrants. After railroads and surface roads developed, the freight and passenger businesses dwindled and, except for ferries and a few foreign cruise ships, has now vanished.\nThe immigration routes still have an effect today. Immigrants often formed their own communities and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity, such as Dutch, German, Polish, Finnish, and many others. Since many immigrants settled for a time in New England before moving westward, many areas on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes also have a New England feel, especially in home styles and accent.\n[[File:Eastland Christopher Columbus leaving Chicago ca1912.jpg|thumb|The ''[[SS Eastland|Eastland]]'' leaving Chicago, ca. 1909]]\nSince general freight these days is transported by railroads and trucks, domestic ships mostly move bulk cargoes, such as [[iron ore]], [[coal]] and [[limestone]] for the [[steel]] industry. The domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines. It was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot. Grain exports are also a major cargo on the lakes.\n\nIn the 19th century and early 20th centuries, iron and other ores such as copper were shipped south on (downbound ships), and supplies, food, and coal were shipped north (upbound). Because of the location of the coal fields in Pennsylvania and [[West Virginia]], and the general northeast track of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], railroads naturally developed shipping routes that went due north to ports such as [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] and [[Ashtabula, Ohio]].\n\nBecause the lake maritime community largely developed independently, it has some distinctive vocabulary. Ships, no matter the size, are called ''boats''. When the sailing ships gave way to steamships, they were called ''steamboats''\u2014the same term used on the Mississippi. The ships also have a distinctive design (see [[Lake freighter]]). Ships that primarily trade on the lakes are known as ''[[Lake freighter|lakers]]''. Foreign boats are known as ''salties''.

In the past, people have injured or killed themselves believing that blanks were not dangerous. Therefore, gun safety rules apply even to guns loaded with blanks.\n\n=== Treat firearms as if they are loaded ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:Vybijeci zarizeni.jpg|thumb|Barrel for [[Dry fire|dry firing]], in order to ultimately check the unloaded state of a firearm]]\n\nThis rule is a matter of keeping a vigilant mindset. The purpose is to create safe handling habits, and to discourage presumptive reasoning along the lines of, \"I know my gun is unloaded so certain unsafe practices are OK\".  The proposition \"the gun is ''always'' loaded\" means that, even though it may be known that this is not true of a particular firearm, that knowledge is never trusted or relied upon until definitively proven.  Thus even if the firearm turned out to be loaded when the handler thought it was not, treating it as loaded would avoid an \"unintentional discharge\", and if one should occur anyway, avoiding damage, injury or death.\n\nMany firearm accidents result from the handler mistakenly ''believing'' a firearm is emptied, safetied, or otherwise disarmed when in fact it is ready to be discharged. Such misunderstandings can arise from a number of sources.\n*'''Faulty handling of the firearm.''' A handler may execute the steps of procedures such as loading, firing and emptying in the wrong order or omit steps of the procedures.\n*'''Misunderstandings about a firearm's status.''' For instance, a handler may think the safety is on when it is not.  A round of ammunition may be left in the [[Chamber (weaponry)|chamber]] or in the magazine while the handler thinks it is emptied.  The firearm may have been handled by another individual without the handler's knowledge.  A handler may receive a firearm and assume it is in a certain state without checking whether that assumption is true.  For example, as handlers interact and pass the firearm between them, each avoids over-relying on the \"show clear\" of the other. Person&nbsp;1 may misjudge the status; person&nbsp;2 cannot assume that \"it's OK because person&nbsp;1 already checked it\".\n*'''Mechanical failures.''' Wear, faulty assembly, damage or faulty design of the firearm can cause it not to function as intended. For instance, a safety may have been worn down to a point where it is no longer functioning. Broken or worn parts in the trigger, sear or hammer/striker may have given the firearm a \"hair trigger\" (a very sensitive trigger). A dented or bent body of the firearm may cause jams or premature discharge of ammunition. Sensitivity to impact may cause a firearm to discharge if dropped or struck against another object.\n\nIf a handler always treats firearms as capable of being discharged at any time, the handler is more likely to take precautions to prevent an unintentional discharge and to avoid damage or injury if one does occur.<ref>Gunsmithing Made Easy by Bryce M. Towsley pg 91</ref>\n\n=== Point the muzzle away from non-targets ===\n[[File:Sgt. Ronald H. Payne Tunnel Rat Vietnam War 1967.jpg|thumb|An example of not following the proper trigger discipline (the soldier's finger is on the trigger); the pistol could also be pointed in the direction of non-targets]]\nAlso known as '''muzzle discipline''', this rule is intended to minimize the potential damage caused by an unintended discharge.  While the first rule teaches that a firearm must be assumed to be ready to fire, this second rule goes beyond that and says, \"Since the firearm ''might'' fire, assume that it ''will'' and make sure no harm occurs when it does.\"\n\nA consequence of this rule is that any kind of playing or \"toying\" with firearms is prohibited.  Playfully pointing firearms at people or other non-targets violates this rule and is possibly an extreme endangerment to life and/or property.  To discourage this kind of behavior, the rule is sometimes alternately stated, \"Never point a firearm at anything unless you intend to destroy it.\".\n\nTwo natural \"safe\" directions to point the muzzle are up (at the sky) and down (at the ground). Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Firing at the ground may result in a [[ricochet]] or cause hazardous fragments to be flung at people or objects. Aiming upward eliminates this risk but replaces it with the risk that the bullet may cause damage when it comes down to the ground again. A bullet fired straight up only returns at the [[terminal velocity]] of the bullet.<ref name=straightdope>{{cite web|title=Can a bullet fired into the air kill someone when it comes down? |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1199/can-a-bullet-fired-into-the-air-kill-someone-when-it-comes-down|date=1995-04-14|publisher=The Straight Dope}}</ref>  However, a bullet fired at an angle not perfectly vertical will retain its spin and ballistic stability on the way down and can attain much more lethal speeds.<ref name=mythbusters>{{cite web|title=Mythbusters Episode 50: Bullets Fired Up|url=http://mythbustersresults.com/episode50|date=2006-04-19|publisher=Mythbusters}}</ref>  Several accidents have reportedly been caused by discharging firearms into the air; although the evidence in a few such cases has been disputed,<ref name=straightdope/> a study by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] found 43 likely cases of injury from falling bullets during 2004 [[New Year]] celebrations in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a2.htm|title=New Year's Eve Injuries Caused by Celebratory Gunfire \u2014 Puerto Rico, 2003|date=2004-12-24|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> It is also possible that the muzzle will inadvertently be pointed at a non-target such as someone's head or an aircraft.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Aviation Safety Network Website| url = http://aviation-safety.net/news/newsitem.php?id=1361| publisher = Aviation Safety Network| date = 2005-01-12| accessdate = 2009-05-18}}</ref>\n\nIn cases where the firearm is being handled indoors, up and down may not be safe directions. For example, a bullet fired upward or downward may travel through the ceiling, floor and plenum between adjacent floors of a multi-story building. In indoor areas where firearms will be handled often, a suitably safe direction should be designated. Firing ranges often designate a direction in which it is safe to point a firearm; almost universally this is downrange into a backstop which is designed to contain bullets and eliminate potential ricochets. In armories or other areas where weapons must be handled, a container filled with sand known as a \"clearing barrel\" or \"clearing can\" is often used for this purpose; bullets unintentionally discharged into the barrel will be safely stopped and contained by the sand.\n\n=== Keep fingers off the trigger ===\n[[File:Designated Marksman Rifle 2.jpg|thumb|Finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard]]\nAlso known as '''trigger discipline''', this rule is intended to prevent an undesired discharge.  Normally a firearm is discharged by depressing its trigger. A handler's finger may involuntarily move for any of several reasons: the handler is startled, a lack of full attention on body movements, physiological reasons beyond conscious control such as a spasm, stumbling or falling, or the finger being pushed by something (as when trying to holster a handgun with one's finger on the trigger). Handlers are therefore taught to minimize the harmful effects of such a motion by keeping their finger off and far away from the trigger until the muzzle is pointing at the target and the handler wishes to discharge the firearm.\n\nThe [[trigger guard]] and the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] area above the trigger of a firearm presents a natural point for a handler to keep their finger out straight alongside the weapon, so as not to violate this rule.  Another recommendation is to keep the trigger finger above the trigger guard, so that there is less chance of the finger involuntarily slipping into the guard when startled.<ref>{{cite web | last=Ayoob | first=Massad | title=The subtleties of safe firearms handling |url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html | publisher=Backwoods Home Magazine | date=January\u2013February 2007 | access-date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>  A properly indexed trigger finger also helps remind the person holding the firearm of the direction of the muzzle.\n\nIn [[popular culture]], such as [[Film|movies]] and [[Television|TV shows]], this rule is often violated, even by characters who should be trained in gun safety such as [[Soldier|military personnel]] or [[Police|law enforcement officers]].\n\n=== Be sure of the target and of what is beyond it ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nThis rule is intended to eliminate or minimize [[collateral damage]] to non-targets when a firearm is intentionally discharged.  Unintended damage may occur if a non-target is misidentified as a target, if the target is missed, or if the bullet hits something or someone other than the intended target.\n\nHandlers are taught that they must positively identify and verify their target.  Additionally, they learn that even when firing at a valid target, unintended targets may still be hit, for three reasons:\n\n* The bullet may miss the intended target and hit a non-target around or beyond the target.\n* A non-target may pass in front of the target and be hit with a bullet aimed at the target.\n* The bullet may pass through the intended target and hit a non-target beyond it, so-called \"overpenetration\".\n\nTherefore, this rule requires a handler to \"always be sure of your target; not just the target itself, but above, below, to the left, to the right, in front of, and behind the target\".\n\nThis may create situations that present dilemmas for a handler.  Such situations are for instance a police officer in a riot with bystanders, a civilian facing a possible intruder at night, or a soldier in a confrontation where civilians are near the enemy.  Indecision or misjudgment of the handler's abilities in such a situation may cause undesired outcomes, such as injury to the handler due to hesitation, or the handler violating [[rules of engagement]] and causing unintended damage.\n\nHunters are commonly prohibited from shooting across roads and trails, or after dusk and before dawn, due to the risk of inadvertently hitting an unintended target.  All discharge of firearms is prohibited in some cities, in part due to the possibility of hitting unseen targets.\n\nTraining is used to minimize the risk of such outcomes. Target practice increases the precision with which the handler can discharge the firearm and thus increase the chances that the intended target is hit. Education about [[terminal ballistics]] gives the handler knowledge about the characteristics of a bullet after a target is hit. This knowledge coupled with insight into the handler's own capabilities makes it easier for the handler to make appropriate decisions about whether to discharge or not, even if given little time and/or put under severe stress.\n\nAmmunition can be chosen to reduce the risk of overpenetration; see [[Terminal ballistics]], [[Stopping power]], and [[Hollow point bullet]].\n\n=== Range safety rules ===\nRanges and organized shoots may impose additional safety rules on participants. For example, at its marksmanship clinics, Project Appleseed requires that a range safety officer (RSO) uses a weed trimmer line to check each rifle's bore for obstructions prior to its first use for the day. Six steps are then always followed when a round of shooting is complete and the line is ready to go \"cold\" to allow posting or checking targets, or when a rifle is ready to be removed from the line:  1) magazine out; 2) bolt back; 3) safety on; 4) chamber flag in; 5) ground the rifle; 6) step back; no one touching the rifle.\n\nOpen bolt indicators, or chamber flags, such as the yellow safety flag distributed by the [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]] or the green chamber flag distributed by Project Appleseed may be required to be inserted in the chamber to show the chamber is empty.\n\nRanges may limit the type of ammunition used, such as prohibiting the use of incendiary, tracer, or armor-piercing rounds, or more powerful rounds than a range is equipped to handle.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://myfwc.com/hunting/safety-education/shooting-ranges/safety-rules/ | title=Range Safety Rules | publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission | accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Whiting\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nssf.org/ranges/rangeresources/library/detail.cfm?filename=facility_mngmnt/safety/shooting_range_safety.htm&CAT=Facility%20Management | title=Shooting Range Safety | publisher=National Shooting Sports Foundation | date=1990 | accessdate=12 December 2014 | author=Whiting, Richard C.}}</ref> They may require the use of ear and eye protection.<ref name=\"Whiting\"/> Alcohol is commonly forbidden.

A misfire is when the cartridge does not fire after it is struck by the firing pin. A hangfire is when the firing pin strikes the cartridge, but there is a delay of some seconds before the cartridge finally fires. A squib is when an underpowered round is fired, perhaps with an insufficient amount of powder in the case, and the bullet lodges in the bore.  If the firearm is fired again, the barrel can peel back, severely damaging the weapon and injuring the shooter.\n\nIn each case, the shooter should wait for a period of time, commonly recommended between 25 seconds, up to two minutes, with the firearm pointed in a safe direction, then carefully remove the magazine, extract any mis-fed or misfired cartridge(s), and, with the breech opened carefully, check to ensure there is not a bullet or other obstruction lodged in the bore of the barrel. If there is an obstruction, and a subsequent round is fired, the firearm can fail explosively resulting in serious injury. Misfired rounds should be disposed of properly, usually in a special container for live ammo that failed to fire after ejecting round;  such rounds should not be simply disposed of in the trash.\n\n===Mechanical malfunctions===\n\nMechanical malfunctions of firearms include [[slamfire]]s, jams, accidental release of the firing pin, and failure of the breech or barrel to contain the propellant.\n\nA slam fire is when a cartridge fires immediately upon being chambered, before a trigger squeeze, and is most often caused by a floating firing pin that becomes obstructed by debris, or by an improperly raised primer that is installed on a cartridge case.  A slam fire can also be caused by a softer primer being used than normally recommended.\n\nTypes of jams include failures to feed, extract, or eject a cartridge; failure to fully cycle after firing; and failure of a recoil- or gas-operated firearm to lock back when empty (largely a procedural hazard, as a \"slide lock\" is a visual cue that the firearm's ammunition supply is empty). When a jam occurs, the handler should exercise extreme caution as a cartridge whose primer has been struck and which has been deformed in a jam can discharge unexpectedly (in a \"hang-fire\".) One method of quickly clearing a jammed semi-automatic weapon is [[tap rack bang]].\n\nFirearms may also fire unintentionally for several reasons, including dropping the weapon or when a firearm receives any hard mechanical shocks.  Similarly, unintentional firing may occur due to faulty triggers, or excessive heat buildup in the chamber which leads to the propellant [[cooking off]]. To prevent accidental firing when firearms are dropped or jarred, experts often suggest using modern firearm designs that have safety features such as a transfer bar or a [[firing pin block]] which prevent the firing pin from striking the primer unless the trigger is squeezed.  For older firearms without these features, experts suggest that they should be carried without a round in the chamber, or with the firing pin resting on an empty chamber in the case of revolvers.<ref>[http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html \"The subtleties of safe firearms handling\"] Massad Ayoob, '' Backwoods Home Magazine'', Issue #103, January/February 2007</ref>\n\nFirearms may undergo [[catastrophic failure]] (a \"kaBoom\" or \"kB\") due to various causes, some caused by mishandling and others by poor design, weakened parts or the use of ammunition for which the firearm was not designed, but which will chamber and fire nonetheless.<ref>{{cite book|last1=RCMP-GRC|title=Canadian Firearms Safety Course|date=2008|publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|isbn=978-0-660-19826-2|pages=87\u201390|edition=4th}}</ref> Barrels may become blocked by foreign material, such as dirt, snow, or even water. For that reason, the muzzle should never be allowed to rest on the ground or allowed to accumulate precipitation. Another form of mishandling is the use of a cartridge that generates more pressure than the firearm was designed for. This can occur through faulty [[handloading]], or the use of [[overpressure ammunition]] (+P or +P+) or magnum loads in firearms not rated for them.\n\n== Storage==\n\nProper storage prevents unauthorized use or theft of firearms and ammunition, or damage to them.<ref name=\"safsell\">{{Cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3197/is_11_43/ai_53377562/ |title=Safety sells - safety devices for gun owners and their firearms |publisher=Shooting Industry |author=Carolee Boyles |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Gun safes===\nA '[[gun safe]]' or 'gun cabinet' is commonly used to physically prevent access to a firearm. Local laws may require particular standards for the lock, for the strength and burglar resistance of the cabinet, and may even require guns and ammunition to be stored separately.\n\n===Disassembly===\nAccess to a functioning firearm can be prevented by keeping the firearm disassembled and the parts stored at separate locations. Sometimes, this rule is codified in law. For example, Swedish law requires owners of firearms either to store the entire firearm in a safe or lockable gun rack, or to lock the \"vital piece\" (bolt, etc.) away in a safe place.\n\n===Locks===\n[[File:Trigger lock on a revolver.jpg|thumb|Trigger lock fitted to the trigger of a [[revolver]]]]\nThere are several types of locks that serve to make it difficult to discharge a firearm. Locks are considered less effective than keeping firearms stored in a lockable safe since locks are more easily defeated than approved safes. An unauthorized handler can bypass the locked firearm at their leisure.<ref name=\"safsell\"/>  Some manufacturers, such as [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]], build locks into the firearm itself.\n\nCalifornia effected regulations in 2000 that forced gun locks to be approved by a firearm safety device laboratory via California Penal Code Section 12088.<ref>\n{{cite web| title = Aroner-Scott-Hayden Firearms Safety Act of 1999| url = http://caag.state.ca.us/firearms/dwcl/12087.htm\n| publisher = State of California| year = 1999| accessdate = 2009-05-18}}</ref>  All gun locks under this code must receive extensive tests including saw, pick, pull, and many other tests in order to be approved for the state of California.

Some trigger locks are integrated into the design of the weapon, requiring no external parts besides the key.  Generally, two pieces come together from either side behind the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] and are locked in place, which can be unlocked with a [[key (lock)|key]] or [[combination lock|combination]]. This physically prevents the trigger from being depressed to discharge the weapon.  Other more commercially common types of trigger locks do not go behind the trigger, but encompass the full area within the [[trigger guard]] to making the trigger inaccessible to users.  [[Identilock]] is a gun attachment that completely covers and prevents access to the trigger, which makes it different from other trigger locks.\n\n:There is controversy surrounding manufacturing standards, usage, and legislation of trigger locks. While supporters of trigger locks argue that they will save children from dying in gun accidents, critics point to demonstrations that some models can be removed by children with very little force and common household tools. Many firearms can go off if the gun is dropped. It is important to make sure to look for firearms that fully disengage the hammer when the safety is put on.  A former senior product manager at Master Lock, a trigger lock manufacturer, was quoted as saying \"If you put a trigger lock on any loaded gun, you are making the gun more dangerous.\"<ref name=\"LAT\">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Slater |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/16/news/mn-8512 |title=Hype Over Trigger Locks Provokes Fear of Firearm Accidents |date=February 16, 1999 |accessdate=2009-03-03 |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Critics also point out that a trigger lock will increase the time it takes a gun owner to respond to a self-defense emergency. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court [[District of Columbia v.

They are used to prevent live ammunition from being loaded into a firearm by blocking the chamber with a [[dummy cartridge]] or a chamber plug, which is sometimes wedged into place with the use of a tool, in essence jamming the gun.  Another type is one in which a steel rod locked into the safety cartridge with a key.  As long as the rod and safety cartridge are engaged, the [[dummy round]] cannot eject nor can live ammunition be loaded into the firearm.  Chamber locks work with most firearm types including [[revolver]]s, [[pistol]]s, [[rifles]] and [[shotgun]]s.  They are available in any [[caliber]] and length, and may include such features as unique keying, rapid removal, and rigorous testing and certification by major state departments such as the [[California Department of Justice]].\n:Some [[shooting range]]s require the handler to insert a temporary chamber plug which often has a brightly colored external tag, to signal the chamber being devoid of ammunition and blocked, whenever the gun is being unused.  These are called ''empty chamber indicators'', or simply ''chamber flags''.\n\n*'''Cable locks'''\n:Cable locks are a popular type of lock that usually threads into the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] through the ejection port of repeating firearms.  These locks physically obstruct the movements of the [[bolt (firearms)|bolt]], thereby preventing the cycling of the [[firearm action|action]], and deny the return to \"battery\" and the closure of the breech.  In many designs of pistol and rifle, they also thread through the magazine well of the gun to prevent the proper insertion of a magazine.\n\n*'''[[Smart gun]]s'''\n:Personalized guns, or smart guns, are intended to prevent unauthorized use with built-in locks that are released by RFID chips or other proximity devices, [[fingerprint recognition]], magnetic rings, or a [[Microchip implant (human)|microchip implant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/04/63066/ |title=No Chip in Arm, No Shot From Gun |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>\n\n===Ammunition storage===\nSome experts recommend storing ammunition in secure locations away from firearms.<ref name=\"GAO\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNkBIEjeePEC | title=Accidental Shootings: Many Deaths and Injuries Caused by Firearms Could Be Prevented | author=GAO | year=1991 | pages=35 | isbn=9781568065533}}</ref> Ammunition should be kept in cool, dry conditions free from contaminating vapors to prevent deterioration of the propellant and cartridge. Handloaders must take special precautions for storing primers and loose gunpowder.\n\n==Secondary dangers==\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2011}}\nWhile a firearm's primary danger lies in the discharge of ammunition, there are other ways a firearm may be detrimental to the health of the handler and bystanders.\n\n===Noise===\nWhen a firearm is discharged it emits a very loud noise, typically close to the handler's ears. This can cause temporary or permanent hearing damage such as [[tinnitus]]. Hearing protection such as earplugs (disposable or reusable) and/or earmuffs (including electronic devices that amplify quiet sounds) can be used to reduce the risk of hearing damage.<ref name=\"safsell\"/> Firearms may also be fitted with a Sound [[Suppressor]] which cools the gas emitting from the barrel to make the volume safer for the handler's ears.\n\n===Hot gases and debris===\nA firearm emits hot gases, powder, and other debris when discharged. Some weapons, such as [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] and [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic]] firearms, typically eject spent cartridge casings at high speed. Casings are also dangerously hot when ejected. Revolvers store spent casings in the chamber, but may emit a stream of hot gases and possible fine particulate debris laterally from the interface between the revolving chamber and the gun barrel. Any of these may hurt the handler or bystanders through burning or impact damage. Because eyes are particularly vulnerable to this type of damage, eye protection should be worn to reduce the risk of injury. Prescription lenses and various tints to suit different light conditions are available.<ref name=\"safsell\"/> Some eye protection products are rated to withstand impact from birdshot loads, which offers protection against irresponsible firearms use by other game bird shooters.<ref>{{cite news|author=Roy Huntington |title=Gun safety & safety products |work=Shooting Industry |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3197/is_n11_v39/ai_16467222/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708124844/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3197/is_n11_v39/ai_16467222/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 }}</ref>\n\n===Toxins and pollutants===\nIn recent years the toxic effects of ammunition and firearm cleaning agents have been highlighted.\n\n*Lead ammunition left in nature may become mobilized by [[Acid rain#Soils|acid rain]].\n*Older ammunition may have [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-based primers.\n*Lead accumulates in shooting range backstops.\n\nIndoor ranges require good ventilation to remove pollutants such as powder, smoke, and lead dust from the air around the shooters. Indoor and outdoor ranges typically require extensive decontamination when they are decommissioned to remove all traces of lead, copper, and powder residues from the area.\n\nLead, copper and other metals will also be released when a firearm is cleaned. Highly aggressive solvents and other agents used to remove lead and powder fouling may also present a hazard to health. Installing good ventilation, washing hands after handling firearms, and cleaning the space where the firearm was handled lessens the risk of unnecessary exposure.\n\n== Unsafe users ==\n\n===Impaired users===\nFirearms should never be handled by persons who are under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or any [[drug]]s which may affect their judgment.

General [[theory of relativity|relativity]] generalizes [[special relativity]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]], or [[spacetime]]. In particular, the ''{{vanchor|[[curvature]] of spacetime|Spacetime curvature|curvature of spacetime}}'' is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\nSome predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of [[classical physics]], especially concerning the passage of time, the [[geometry]] of space, the motion of bodies in [[free fall]], and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational lens]]ing, the [[gravitational redshift]] of light, and the [[Shapiro delay|gravitational time delay]]. The predictions of general relativity in relation to classical physics have been [[tests of general relativity|confirmed]] in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity is [[Alternatives to general relativity|not the only relativistic theory of gravity]], it is the [[Occam's razor|simplest theory]] that is consistent with [[experimental data]]. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how ''general relativity'' can be reconciled with the laws of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of [[quantum gravity]].\n\nEinstein's theory has important [[astrophysical]] implications. For example, it implies the existence of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape\u2014as an end-state for [[massive star]]s. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, [[microquasar]]s and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] result from the presence of [[stellar black hole]]s and [[supermassive black hole]]s, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of [[gravitational wave]]s, which have since been [[List of gravitational wave observations|observed directly]] by the physics collaboration [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory|LIGO]]. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of a consistently [[Metric expansion of space|expanding universe]].\n\nWidely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as ''the'' most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of general relativity|Classical theories of gravitation}}\n\nSoon after publishing the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate [[gravity]] into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple [[thought experiment]] involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the [[Prussian Academy of Science]] in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations.<ref>O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.

The publication featuring the field equations is {{Harvnb|Einstein|1915}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 11\u201315}}</ref>\n\nThe Einstein field equations are [[Nonlinear differential equation|nonlinear]] and very difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the [[Schwarzschild metric]]. This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to [[electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], now associated with [[charged black hole|electrically charged black holes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916a}}, {{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916b}} and {{Harvnb|Reissner|1916}} (later complemented in {{Harvnb|Nordstr\u00f6m|1918}})</ref> In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the [[universe]] as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations\u2014the [[cosmological constant]]\u2014to match that observational presumption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Einstein|1917}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 15e}}</ref> By 1929, however, the work of [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]] in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre]] used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the [[Big Bang]] models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state.<ref>Hubble's original article is {{Harvnb|Hubble|1929}}; an accessible overview is given in {{Harvnb|Singh|2004|loc=ch. 2\u20134}}</ref> Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.<ref>As reported in {{Harvnb|Gamow|1970}}. Einstein's condemnation would prove to be premature, cf. the section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]], below</ref>\n\nDuring that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to [[Newtonian gravity]], being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous perihelion advance]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] without any arbitrary parameters (\"[[wikt:fudge factor|fudge factors]]\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|pp=253\u2013254}}</ref> Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]] confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennefick|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Kennefick|2007}}</ref> making Einstein instantly famous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 16}}</ref> Yet the theory entered the mainstream of [[theoretical physics]] and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the [[History of general relativity#More about GR history|golden age of general relativity]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The future of theoretical physics and cosmology: celebrating Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday |first1=Kip |last1=Thorne |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |isbn=0-521-82081-2 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC|ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC&pg=PA74 Extract of page 74]</ref> Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify [[quasar]]s as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987|loc=ch. 7.8\u20137.10}}, {{Harvnb|Thorne|1994|loc=ch. 3\u20139}}</ref> Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power,<ref>Sections [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|Orbital effects and the relativity of direction]], [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]] and [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|Light deflection and gravitational time delay]], and references therein</ref> and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.<ref>Section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]] and references therein; the historical development is in {{Harvnb|Overbye|1999}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, general relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1975|loc=p. 228}} \"...the ''general theory of relativity''...was established by Einstein, and represents probably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=p. 3}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rovelli|2015|loc=pp. 1\u20136}} \"General relativity is not just an extraordinarily beautiful physical theory providing the best description of the gravitational interaction we have so far. It is more.\"</ref>  [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] has noted that at multiple levels, general relativity exhibits what [[Frances Bacon]] has termed, a \"strangeness in the proportion\" (''i.e''. elements that excite wonderment and surprise). It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time ''versus'' matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent. Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1984|loc=p. 6}}</ref> Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity, symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Engler|2002}}</ref>\n\n==From classical mechanics to general relativity==\nGeneral relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.<ref>The following exposition re-traces that of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1}}</ref>\n\n===Geometry of Newtonian gravity<!--'Einstein's elevator experiment' redirects here-->===\n[[File:Elevator gravity.svg|thumb|According to general relativity, objects in a gravitational field behave similarly to objects within an accelerating enclosure. For example, an observer will see a ball fall the same way in a rocket (left) as it does on Earth (right), provided that the acceleration of the rocket is equal to 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth).]]\nAt the base of [[classical mechanics]] is the notion that a [[physical body|body]]'s motion can be described as a combination of free (or [[inertia]]l) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second [[Newton's laws of motion|law of motion]], which states that the net [[force]] acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) [[mass]] multiplied by its [[acceleration]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1989|loc=ch. 1}}</ref> The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard [[frame of reference|reference frames]] of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are [[geodesic]]s, straight [[world lines]] in curved spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=5f}}</ref>\n\nConversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[friction]]), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time [[coordinate]]. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]] and its successors (see [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak [[equivalence principle]], or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a [[test body]] in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 2.4}}, {{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 2}}</ref> A simplified version of this is embodied in '''Einstein's elevator experiment'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}</ref>\n\nGiven the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time\u2014in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] which depends on the [[gradient]] of the [[gravitational potential]]. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. However, space''time'' as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not [[integrable systems|integrable]]. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting [[Newton\u2013Cartan theory]] is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors#Informal usage|covariant]] concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.2}}, {{Harvnb|Havas|1964}}, {{Harvnb|K\u00fcnzle|1972}}. The simple thought experiment in question was first described in {{Harvnb|Heckmann|Sch\u00fccking|1959}}</ref> In this geometric description, [[tidal effect]]s\u2014the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall\u2014are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=10f}}</ref>\n\n===Relativistic generalization===\n[[File:Light cone.svg|thumb|left|upright|[[Light cone]]]]\nAs intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a [[limiting case (philosophy of science)|limiting case]] of (special) relativistic mechanics.<ref>Good introductions are, in order of increasing presupposed knowledge of mathematics, {{Harvnb|Giulini|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005}}, and {{Harvnb|Rindler|1991}}; for accounts of precision experiments, cf. part IV of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|L\u00e4mmerzahl|2006}}</ref> In the language of [[symmetry]]: where gravity can be neglected, physics is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] as in special relativity rather than [[Galilean invariance|Galilei invariant]] as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the [[speed of light]], and with high-energy phenomena.<ref>An in-depth comparison between the two symmetry groups can be found in {{Harvnb|Giulini|2006a}}</ref>\n\nWith Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. They are defined by the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each [[event (relativity)|event]] {{math|A}}, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by {{math|A}} via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event {{math|B}} in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event {{math|C}} in the image). These sets are observer-independent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|1991|loc=sec. 22}}, {{Harvnb|Synge|1972|loc=ch. 1 and 2}}</ref> In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space\u2013time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a [[conformal structure]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 2.3}}</ref> or conformal geometry.\n\nSpecial relativity is defined in the absence of gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global [[inertial frame]]s. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight [[time-like]] lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}}, {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 5.1}}</ref>\n\nA priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold\u2014that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|below]]). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=17ff}}; a derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005|loc=ch. 12}}. For the experimental evidence, cf. the section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]], below</ref> The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the [[Equivalence Principle#The Einstein equivalence principle|Einstein equivalence principle]], a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 1.13}}; for an elementary account, see {{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}; there are, however, some differences between the modern version and Einstein's original concept used in the historical derivation of general relativity, cf. {{Harvnb|Norton|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field\u2014[[proper time]], to give the technical term\u2014does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the [[Minkowski metric]]. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] that defines the geometry\u2014in particular, how lengths and angles are measured\u2014is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or [[pseudo-Riemannian]] metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable [[Local reference frame|locally inertial coordinates]], the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}} for the experimental evidence, see once more section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]]. Choosing a different connection with non-zero [[torsion tensor|torsion]] leads to a modified theory known as [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]]</ref>\n\n===Einstein's equations===\n{{Main|Einstein field equations|Mathematics of general relativity}}\n\nHaving formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the [[energy\u2013momentum tensor]], which includes both [[energy density|energy]] and momentum [[density|densities]] as well as [[stress (physics)|stress]]: [[pressure]] and shear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|p=16}}, {{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.2}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 2.8}}</ref> Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the [[field equation]] for gravity relates this tensor and the [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]], which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, [[conservation of energy]]\u2013momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy\u2013momentum tensor is [[divergence]]-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-[[manifold]] counterparts, [[covariant derivative]]s studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition\u2014the covariant divergence of the energy\u2013momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero\u2014 the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Einstein's field equations'''\n|equation=<math>G_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - {\\textstyle 1 \\over 2}R\\,g_{\\mu\\nu} = {8 \\pi G \\over c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = #50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nOn the left-hand side is the [[Einstein tensor]], a specific divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor <math>R_{\\mu\\nu}</math> and the metric.

All tensors are written in [[abstract index notation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=19\u201322}}; for similar derivations, see sections 1 and 2 of ch. 7 in {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}. The Einstein tensor is the only divergence-free tensor that is a function of the metric coefficients, their first and second derivatives at most, and allows the spacetime of special relativity as a solution in the absence of sources of gravity, cf. {{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}. The tensors on both side are of second rank, that is, they can each be thought of as 4\u00d74 matrices, each of which contains ten independent terms; hence, the above represents ten coupled equations. The fact that, as a consequence of geometric relations known as [[Bianchi identities]], the Einstein tensor satisfies a further four identities reduces these to six independent equations, e.g. {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 8.3}}</ref> Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics, the proportionality constant can be fixed as ''\u03ba'' = 8\u03c0''G''/''c''<sup>4</sup>, with ''G'' the [[gravitational constant]] and ''c'' the speed of light.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.4}}</ref> When there is no matter present, so that the energy\u2013momentum tensor vanishes, the results are the vacuum Einstein equations,\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu}=0.\\,</math>\n\n===Alternatives to general relativity===\n{{Main|Alternatives to general relativity}}\nThere are [[alternatives to general relativity]] built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations.

Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow.<ref>At least approximately, cf. {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}</ref> The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy\u2013momentum of matter.

Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy\u2013momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.<ref>Introductory chapters of {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}</ref>\n\nEinstein's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly.<ref>A review showing Einstein's equation in the broader context of other PDEs with physical significance is {{Harvnb|Geroch|1996}}</ref> Nevertheless, a number of [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] are known, although only a few have direct physical applications.<ref>For background information and a list of solutions, cf. {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}; a more recent review can be found in {{Harvnb|MacCallum|2006}}</ref> The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the [[Schwarzschild solution]], the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution and the [[Kerr metric]], each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3,5,6}}</ref> and the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker]] and [[de Sitter universe]]s, each describing an expanding cosmos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=ch. 4, sec. 3.3}}</ref> Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del universe]] (which opens up the intriguing possibility of [[time travel]] in curved spacetimes), the [[Taub-NUT solution]] (a model universe that is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], but [[anisotropic]]), and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the [[Maldacena conjecture]]).<ref>Brief descriptions of these and further interesting solutions can be found in {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 5}}</ref>\n\nGiven the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by [[numerical integration]] on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of [[numerical relativity]], powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lehner|2002}}</ref> In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as [[naked singularity|naked singularities]].

The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 4.1 and 4.2}}</ref> An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 3.2}}, {{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=ch. 4}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences of Einstein's theory==\nGeneral relativity has a number of physical consequences.

No influence from an event ''A'' can reach any other location ''X'' before light sent out at ''A'' to ''X''. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines ([[Geodesic (general relativity)|null geodesics]]) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using [[Penrose diagram|Penrose\u2013Carter diagrams]] in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk (\"[[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]]\") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard [[spacetime diagram]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frauendiener|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.1}}, {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 6.8, 6.9}}</ref>\n\nAware of the importance of causal structure, [[Roger Penrose]] and others developed what is known as [[global geometry]]. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the [[Raychaudhuri equation]], and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of [[energy conditions]]) are used to derive general results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.2\u20139.4}} and {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 6}}</ref>\n\n===Horizons===\n{{Main|Horizon (general relativity)|No hair theorem|Black hole mechanics}}\nUsing global geometry, some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called [[event horizon|horizons]], which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the [[hoop conjecture]], the relevant length scale is the [[Schwarzschild radius]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Thorne|1972}}; for more recent numerical studies, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's ''horizon'', is not a physical barrier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987}}. A more exact mathematical description distinguishes several kinds of horizon, notably event horizons and [[apparent horizon]]s cf. {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|pp=312\u2013320}} or {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 12.2}}; there are also more intuitive definitions for isolated systems that do not require knowledge of spacetime properties at infinity, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Krishnan|2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|left|The ergosphere of a rotating black hole, which plays a key role when it comes to extracting energy from such a black hole]]\nEarly studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a [[Static spacetime|static]] black hole) and the axisymmetric [[Kerr solution]] (used to describe a rotating, [[Stationary spacetime|stationary]] black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. In the long run, they are rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying energy, [[linear momentum]], [[angular momentum]], location at a specified time and electric charge. This is stated by the [[no hair theorem|black hole uniqueness theorems]]: \"black holes have no hair\", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.<ref>For first steps, cf. {{Harvnb|Israel|1971}}; see {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 9.3}} or {{Harvnb|Heusler|1996|loc=ch. 9 and 10}} for a derivation, and {{Harvnb|Heusler|1998}} as well as {{Harvnb|Beig|Chru\u015bciel|2006}} as overviews of more recent results</ref>\n\nEven more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as [[black hole mechanics]], which is analogous to the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the [[entropy]] of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the [[Penrose process]]).<ref>The laws of black hole mechanics were first described in {{Harvnb|Bardeen|Carter|Hawking|1973}}; a more pedagogical presentation can be found in {{Harvnb|Carter|1979}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 2}}. A thorough, book-length introduction including an introduction to the necessary mathematics {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}. For the Penrose process, see {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}</ref> There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1973}}, {{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1974}}</ref> This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease\u2014as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit [[thermal radiation]]. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in [[Planck's law]]. This radiation is known as [[Hawking radiation]] (cf. the [[General relativity#Quantum field theory in curved spacetime|quantum theory section]], below).<ref>The fact that black holes radiate, quantum mechanically, was first derived in {{Harvnb|Hawking|1975}}; a more thorough derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Wald|1975}}. A review is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\nThere are other types of horizons. In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed (\"[[particle horizon]]\"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon).<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=sec. 4.4.4, 4.4.5}}</ref> Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer ([[Rindler space]]), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as [[Unruh effect|Unruh radiation]].<ref>Horizons: cf. {{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 12.4}}.

Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesics\u2014all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel. But some solutions of Einstein's equations have \"ragged edges\"\u2014regions known as [[spacetime singularity|spacetime singularities]], where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined. In the more interesting cases, these are \"curvature singularities\", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the [[Ricci scalar]], take on infinite values.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 8.1}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.1}}</ref> Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularities\u2014where worldlines end\u2014are the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole,<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 2}}; a more extensive treatment of this solution can be found in {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3}}</ref> or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 4}}; for a more extensive treatment, cf. {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 6}}</ref> The Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities ([[Big Crunch]]) as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellis|Van Elst|1999}}; a closer look at the singularity itself is taken in {{Harvnb|B\u00f6rner|1993|loc=sec. 1.2}}</ref>\n\nGiven that these examples are all highly symmetric\u2014and thus simplified\u2014it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization.<ref>Here one should remind to the well-known fact that the important  \"quasi-optical\" singularities of the so-called [[eikonal approximation]]s of many wave-equations, namely the \"[[caustic (mathematics)|caustics]]\", are resolved into finite peaks beyond that approximation.</ref> The famous [[singularity theorems]], proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage<ref>Namely when there are [[trapped null surface]]s, cf. {{Harvnb|Penrose|1965}}</ref> and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|1966}}</ref> However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the [[BKL singularity|BKL conjecture]]).<ref>The conjecture was made in {{Harvnb|Belinskii|Khalatnikov|Lifschitz|1971}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002}}. An accessible exposition is given by {{Harvnb|Garfinkle|2007}}</ref> The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.<ref>The restriction to future singularities naturally excludes initial singularities such as the big bang singularity, which in principle be visible to observers at later cosmic time. The cosmic censorship conjecture was first presented in {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}; a textbook-level account is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=302\u2013305}}. For numerical results, see the review {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution equations===\n{{Main|Initial value formulation (general relativity)}}\n\nEach solution of Einstein's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe&nbsp;\u2014 it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the [[time evolution]] of the metric tensor.

In Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field\u2014like any physical field\u2014must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a720.4}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system's total mass, either using a hypothetical \"infinitely distant observer\" ([[ADM mass]])<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}</ref> or suitable symmetries ([[Komar mass]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Komar|1959}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}; although defined in a totally different way, it can be shown to be equivalent to the ADM mass for stationary spacetimes, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Magnon-Ashtekar|1979}}</ref> If one excludes from the system's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the [[Mass in general relativity#ADM and Bondi masses in asymptotically flat space-times|Bondi mass]] at null infinity.<ref>For a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}</ref> Just as in [[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical physics]], it can be shown that these masses are positive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|p=295 and refs therein}}; this is important for questions of stability\u2014if there were [[negative mass]] states, then flat, empty Minkowski space, which has mass zero, could evolve into these states</ref> Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 5}}</ref> There have also been a number of attempts to define ''quasi-local'' quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system.

Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records, genetic analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate [[kinship]] and [[Pedigree chart|pedigrees]] of its members. The results are often displayed in charts or written as narratives.\n\nThe pursuit of family history and origins tends to be shaped by several motives, including the desire to carve out a place for one's family in the larger historical picture, a sense of responsibility to preserve the past for future generations, and a sense of self-satisfaction in accurate storytelling.<ref>Ronald Bishop, \"In the Grand Scheme of Things: An Exploration of the Meaning of Genealogical Research,\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 2008 41(3): 393\u2013412.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Family tree indian.jpg|thumb|220px|12 generations patrilineage of a Hindu Lingayat male from central [[Karnataka]] worth over 275 years, depicted in descending order]]\nAmateur genealogists typically pursue their own ancestry and that of their spouses. Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires\u2014or leads to\u2014knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.\n\nGenealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.\n\nGenealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers. Such societies generally serve a specific geographical area. Their members may also index records to make them more accessible, and engage in advocacy and other efforts to preserve public records and cemeteries. Some schools engage students in such projects as a means to reinforce lessons regarding immigration and history.<ref>{{cite news | first=| url=http://www.byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/| title=Teacher's guide for PBS Ancestors series  | publisher=BYU | date=| accessdate=2006-09-05 }}</ref> Other benefits include family medical histories with families with serious medical conditions that are hereditary.\n\nThe terms \"genealogy\" and \"family history\" are often used synonymously, but some offer a slight difference in definition. The [[Society of Genealogists]], while also using the terms interchangeably, describes genealogy as the \"establishment of a Pedigree by extracting evidence, from valid sources, of how one generation is connected to the next\" and family history as \"a biographical study of a genealogically proven family and of the community and country in which they lived\".<ref name=\"sog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/guide-ten/|title=Genealogy or Family History? What\u2019s the Difference?|publisher=Society of Genealogists|accessdate=10 Aug 2013}}</ref> The term \"family history\" may be more popular in Europe, \"genealogy\" more popular in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fgs.org/cstm_memberLocList.php |title=FGS member societies|publisher=Federation of Genealogical Societies| accessdate=11 Jun 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Motivation ==\nIn [[collective identity|communitarian]] societies, one's identity is defined as much by one's kin network as by individual achievement, and the question \"Who are you?\" would be answered by a description of father, mother, and tribe. New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], for example, learn [[whakapapa]] (genealogies) to discover who they are.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFamily history plays a part in the practice of some religious belief systems. For example, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has a doctrine of [[baptism for the dead]], which necessitates that members of that faith engage in family history research.\n\nIn societies such as Australia or the United States, there was by the 20th-century growing pride in the pioneers and nation-builders. Establishing descent from these was, and is, important to such groups as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].\n\nModern family history explores new sources of status, such as celebrating the resilience of families that survived generations of poverty or slavery, or the success of families in integrating across racial or national boundaries. Some family histories even emphasize links to celebrity criminals, such as the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]] in Australia.\n\nThe growing interest in family history in the media coupled with easier access to online records has allowed those who are curious to do so to start investigating their ancestry. This curiosity can be particularly strong among those whose family histories were lost or unknown due to, for example, [[adoption]] or separation from family, perhaps as a result of [[Grief|bereavement]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:P. 63 genealogy and history from Adam and Eve to Asclobitotus (unfinished).jpg|thumb|A Medieval genealogy traced from [[Adam and Eve]]]]\nHistorically, in Western societies the focus of genealogy was on the [[kinship and descent]] of rulers and nobles, often arguing or demonstrating the legitimacy of claims to wealth and power. The term often overlapped with [[heraldry]], in which the ancestry of royalty was reflected in their [[coats of arms]]. Modern scholars consider many claimed noble ancestries to be fabrications, such as the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] that traced the ancestry of several English kings to the god [[Woden]].\n\nSome family trees have been maintained for considerable periods.

He corresponded with other antiquarians in New England, where antiquarianism and genealogy were well established, and became a coordinator, booster, and contributor to the growing movement. In the 1820s, he and fellow antiquarians began to produce genealogical and antiquarian tracts in earnest, slowly gaining a devoted audience among the American people. Though Farmer died in 1839, his efforts led to the creation of the [[New England Historic Genealogical Society]] (NEHGS), one of New England's oldest and most prominent organizations dedicated to the preservation of public records.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Weil, \"John Farmer and the Making of American Genealogy,\" ''New England Quarterly'' 2007 80(3): 408\u2013434.</ref> NEHGS publishes the ''New England Historical and Genealogical Register.''\n\nThe [[Genealogical Society of Utah]], founded in 1894, later became the Family History Department of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS).

Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].<ref>Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)\"</ref>\n\nGenealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships. Source citation is also important when conducting genealogical research.<ref name=\"evidence\">Elizabeth Shown Mills, ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'', (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2007).</ref> To keep track of collected material, family group sheets and [[pedigree chart]]s are used. Formerly handwritten, these can now be generated by genealogical software.\n\n===Genetic analysis===\n{{Main|Genetic genealogy}}\n[[File:D1S80Demo.png|left|thumb|Variations of [[VNTR]] allele lengths in 6 individuals]]\nBecause a person's [[DNA]] contains information that has been passed down relatively unchanged from early ancestors, [[Genetic fingerprinting|analysis of DNA]] is sometimes used for genealogical research. Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.\n\nA [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.\n\n===Collaboration===\nMost [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]]. In that format it can be shared with other genealogists, added to databases, or converted into family web sites. [[Social networking service]] (SNS) websites allow genealogists to share data and build their family trees online. Members can upload their family trees and contact other family historians to fill in gaps in their research.  In addition to the (SNS) websites, there are other resources that encourage genealogists to connect and share information such as http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ and http://rsl.rootsweb.ancestry.com/.\n\n===Volunteerism===\n[[Volunteerism|Volunteer efforts]] figure prominently in genealogy.<ref>{{cite news | date=2004-04-22 | accessdate=2009-01-14 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E3D8163AF931A15757C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print | title= From Shared Resources, Your Personal History | author=[[Peter Wayner]], | work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> These range from the extremely informal to the highly organized.\n\nOn the informal side are the many popular and useful [[Internet forum|message boards]] such as [[Rootschat]] and [[electronic mailing list|mailing lists]] on particular surnames, regions, and other topics. These forums can be used to try to find relatives, request record lookups, obtain research advice, and much more.\n\nMany genealogists participate in loosely organized projects, both online and off. These collaborations take numerous forms. Some projects prepare name indexes for records, such as [[probate]] cases, and publish the indexes, either online or off. These indexes can be used as [[finding aid]]s to locate original records. Other projects transcribe or abstract records. Offering record lookups for particular geographic areas is another common service. Volunteers do record lookups or take photos in their home areas for researchers who are unable to travel.\n\nThose looking for a structured volunteer environment can join one of thousands of [[genealogical societies]] worldwide. Most societies have a unique area of focus, such as a particular surname, [[ethnicity]], geographic area, or [[List of hereditary & lineage organizations|descendancy from participants in a given historical event]]. Genealogical societies are almost exclusively staffed by volunteers and may offer a broad range of services, including maintaining libraries for members' use, publishing newsletters, providing research assistance to the public, offering classes or seminars, and organizing record preservation or transcription projects.\n\n===Software===\n[[File:GRAMPS 3.3.1 edit person screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gramps]] is an example of genealogy software.]]\n{{Main|Genealogy software}}\n[[Genealogy software]] is used to collect, store, sort, and display genealogical data. At a minimum, genealogy software accommodates basic information about individuals, including births, marriages, and deaths. Many programs allow for additional biographical information, including occupation, residence, and notes, and most also offer a method for keeping track of the sources for each piece of evidence.\n\nMost programs can generate basic kinship charts and reports, allow for the import of digital photographs and the export of data in the [[GEDCOM]] format (short for GEnealogical Data COMmunication) so that data can be shared with those using other genealogy software. More advanced features include the ability to restrict the information that is shared, usually by removing information about living people out of [[privacy]] concerns; the import of sound files; the generation of family history books, web pages and other publications; the ability to handle [[same sex marriage]]s and [[Illegitimacy|children born out of wedlock]]; searching the Internet for data; and the provision of research guidance.\n\nPrograms may be geared toward a specific religion, with fields relevant to that religion, or to specific nationalities or ethnic groups, with source types relevant for those groups.\n\n==Records and documentation==\n[[File:Family-bible-births.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A family history page from an [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum era|antebellum era]] family Bible]]\n\nGenealogists use a wide variety of records in their research. To effectively conduct genealogical research, it is important to understand how the records were created, what information is included in them, and how and where to access them.\n\n===List of record types===\nRecords that are used in genealogy research include:\n* [[Vital records]]\n** [[Birth certificate|Birth records]]\n** [[Death certificate|Death records]]\n** [[Marriage license|Marriage]] and [[divorce]] records\n* [[Adoption]] records\n* [[Biographies]] and biographical profiles (e.g. ''[[Marquis Who's Who|Who's Who]]'')\n* Cemetery lists\n* [[Census]] records\n* Religious records\n** [[Baptism]] or [[infant baptism|christening]]\n** [[Brit milah]] or [[Baby naming]] certificates \n** [[Confirmation]]\n** [[Bar mitzvah|Bar]] or [[bat mitzvah]]\n** [[Marriage]]\n** [[Funeral]] or death\n** Membership\n* City directories<ref>Peter R.

In England and Germany, for example, such record keeping started with parish registers in the 16th century.<ref>Thea Miller, \"The German registry: The evolution of a recordkeeping model,\" Archival Science Volume 3, Number 1 / March, 2003 pp 43\u201362; Michael Drake, \"An Elementary Exercise in Parish Register Demography,\" ''Economic History Review'' Vol. 14, No. 3 (1962), pp. 427\u2013445 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2591886 in JSTOR]</ref> As more of the population was recorded, there were sufficient records to follow a family. Major life events, such as births, marriages, and deaths, were often documented with a license, permit, or report. Genealogists locate these records in local, regional or national offices or [[archive]]s and extract information about family relationships and recreate [[Chronology|timelines]] of persons' lives.\n\nIn [[China]], [[India]] and other Asian countries, [[genealogy book]]s are used to record the names, occupations, and other information about family members, with some books dating back hundreds or even thousands of years. In the eastern [[India]]n state of [[Bihar]], there is a written tradition of genealogical records among Maithil Brahmins and Karna Kayasthas called \"[[Panjis]]\", dating to the 12th century CE. Even today these records are consulted prior to marriages.<ref>{{cite book | last=Verma | first=Binod Bihari | authorlink=Binod Bihari Verma | title=[[Maithili Karna Kayasthak Panjik Sarvekshan]] (A Survey of the Panji of the Karan Kayasthas of Mithila) | location=Madhepura | publisher=Kr\u0101nti Bih\u0101r\u012b Varm\u0101 | year=1973 | oclc=20044508}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Carolyn Brown Heinz, | title=Fieldnotes: First lesson of the Genealogist | url=http://www.csuchico.edu/anth/mithila/genealogist2.htm | publisher=Department of Anthropology, California State University, Chico | date= | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329053241/http://www.csuchico.edu/anth/mithila/genealogist2.htm | archive-date=2008-03-29 | dead-url=yes | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=Pranava K Chaudhary | title=Family records of Maithil Brahmins lost | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1848092.cms | work=India Times | date=3 April 2007 | accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]], genealogical records were recorded by professional families of ''senchaidh'' (historians) until as late as the mid-17th century.

Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry<ref>Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed.

J. A. Guth, \"Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10\u201319, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze, | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref> In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.<ref>Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used. In order to protect the patronymics system, in Iceland it is forbidden by law to introduce a new surname.{{cite web | title=L\u00f6g um Mannan\u00f6fn | url=http://www.althingi.is/lagasofn/nuna/1996045.html | language=Icelandic | accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref> In Denmark and Norway patronymics and farm names were generally in use through the 19th century and beyond, though surnames began to come into fashion toward the end of the 19th century in some parts of the country. Not until 1856 in Denmark<ref>An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.</ref> and 1923 in Norway<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> were there laws requiring surnames.\n\nThe transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.<ref>E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580\u20131837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., \"Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?,\" ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221\u2013227</ref> Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.<ref>Marc Picard, \"Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names,\" ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30\u201351</ref>\n\nSurname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n===Given names===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nGenealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.\n\nMiddle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.\n\nHistorically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.\n\nAn example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n{|width=50% |gap=4em\n| '''Child'''\n| '''Namesake'''\n|-\n| 1st son\n| paternal grandfather\n|-\n| 2nd son\n| maternal grandfather\n|-\n| 3rd son\n| father\n|-\n| 4th son\n| father's oldest brother\n|-\n| 1st daughter\n| maternal grandmother\n|-\n| 2nd daughter\n| paternal grandmother\n|-\n| 3rd daughter\n| mother\n|-\n| 4th daughter\n| mother's oldest sister\n|}\n</div>\n\nAnother example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.\n\nPersonal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., \"William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John\".\n\nMany names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).\n\n===Place names===\nWhile the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.\n\nAvailable sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.\n\nMaps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.\n\n===Dates===\nIt is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.<ref name=\"knights\">Peter R. Knights, \"The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79\u201383; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, \"Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census,\" ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563\u2013573.</ref> Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.\n\nPeople sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under \"full age\" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.\n\nAlthough baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.\n\nCalendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.\n\nFor further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need \"translating\" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>\n\n===Occupations===\nOccupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.\n\nIt is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.<ref>Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf \"Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\"], ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111\u2013126.</ref> Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description \"ironer of rabbit burrows\" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, \"shoemaker\" and \"cordwainer\" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.\n\nOccupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.<ref>For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)</ref>\n\n==Reliability of sources==\nInformation found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.\n\nThe quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.<ref name=\"knights\"/><ref>Richard H. Steckel, \"The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda,\" ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579\u2013599.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of the informant===\nThe informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.\n\nWhen the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.\n\nWhen a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.\n\n===Motivation of the informant===\nEven individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.\n\n===The effect of time===\nThe passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event is usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.\n\n===Copying and compiling errors===\nGenealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.\n\nIn addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.\n\n===Primary and secondary sources===\nIn genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Genealogy}}\n{{collist|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Ahnentafel]]\n* [[Cluster genealogy]]\n* [[Descent from antiquity]]\n* [[Family tree]]\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Genealogical numbering systems]]\n* [[International Museum for Family History]]\n* [[Genealogy software]]\n* [[Genealogy tourism]]\n* [[List of genealogy databases]]\n* [[List of Mormon family organizations]]\n* [[Forensic genealogy]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Further reading cleanup|date=July 2015}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Adams |first=Suzanne Russo |title=Finding Your Italian Ancestors: A Beginner's Guide |location=Provo, UT |publisher=Ancestry |date=2008 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ching |first=Frank |title=Ancestors: 900 Years in the Life of a Chinese Family |date=1988 }}{{Publisher missing|date=September 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last=Chorzempa |first=Rosemary A. |title=Polish roots = Korzenie polskie |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co. |date=1993 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Christian |first=Peter |title=The Genealogist's Internet |edition=5th |location=London, England |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-4081-5957-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Durie |first=Bruce |title=Scottish Genealogy |location=Stroud, England |publisher=History Press |date=2009 }}\n* {{cite book |editor1-last=Eales |editor1-first=Anne Bruner |editor2-first=Robert M. |editor2-last=Kvasnicka, |title=Guide to Genealogical Research in the National Archives of the United States |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] |date=2000 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Greenwood |first=Val.

gabonaise}}), is a country  on the west coast of [[Central Africa]]. Located on the [[equator]], Gabon is bordered by [[Equatorial Guinea]] to the northwest, [[Cameroon]] to the north, the [[Republic of the Congo]] on the east and south, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to the west. It has an area of nearly {{convert|270000|sqkm}} and its population is estimated at {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Gabon}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}} million people. Its capital and largest city is [[Libreville]].\n\nSince its independence from France in 1960, the [[sovereign state]] of Gabon has had [[List of heads of state of Gabon|three presidents]]. In the early 1990s, Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions.\n\nAbundant petroleum and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], with the [[List of African countries by Human Development Index|4th highest]] [[Human Development Index|HDI]]<ref name=\"HDI\" /> and the [[List of African countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|fourth highest]] GDP per capita (PPP) (after [[Mauritius]], Equatorial Guinea and [[Seychelles]]) in the region. GDP grew by more than 6% per year from 2010 to 2012. However, because of [[Economic inequality|inequality]] in income distribution, a significant proportion of the population remains poor.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nGabon's name originates from ''gab\u00e3o'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"cloak\", which is roughly the shape of the [[estuary]] of the [[Komo River]] by Libreville.\n\n== History ==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:1670 Ogilby Map of West Africa ( Gold Coast, Slave Coast, Ivory Coast ) - Geographicus - Guinea-ogilby-1670.jpg|thumb|left|A map of [[West Africa]] in 1670]]\n{{main|History of Gabon}}\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Congo Pygmies|Pygmy peoples]]. They were largely replaced and absorbed by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes as [[Bantu expansion|they migrated]].\n\nIn the 15th century, the first Europeans arrived. By the 18th century, a [[Myene language|Myeni]] speaking kingdom known as [[Orungu Kingdom|Orungu]] formed in Gabon.\n\nOn February 10, 1722, [[Bartholomew Roberts]], a Welsh pirate known as Black Bart, died at sea off [[Cape Lopez]]. He raided ships off the Americas and West Africa from 1719 to 1722.\n\nFrench explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] led his first mission to the Gabon-Congo area in 1875. He founded the town of [[Franceville]], and was later colonial governor. Several Bantu groups lived in the area that is now Gabon when France officially occupied it in 1885.\n\nIn 1910, Gabon became one of the four territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13376333|title=Gabon country profile|date=September 24, 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> a federation that survived until 1959. In [[World War II]], the Allies [[Battle of Gabon|invaded]] Gabon in order to overthrow the pro-[[Vichy France]] colonial administration. The territories of French Equatorial Africa became independent on August 17, 1960. The first president of Gabon, elected in 1961, was [[L\u00e9on M'ba]], with [[Omar Bongo Ondimba]] as his vice president.\n\nAfter M'ba's accession to power, the press was suppressed, political demonstrations banned, [[freedom of expression]] curtailed, other political parties gradually excluded from power, and the Constitution changed along French lines to vest power in the Presidency, a post that M'ba assumed himself. However, when M'ba dissolved the [[National Assembly (Gabon)|National Assembly]] in January 1964 to institute one-party rule, an army [[coup]] sought to oust him from power and restore parliamentary democracy. French paratroopers flew in within 24 hours to restore M'ba to power.\n\nAfter a few days of fighting, the coup ended and the opposition was imprisoned, despite widespread protests and riots. French soldiers still remain in the [[Camp de Gaulle]] on the outskirts of Gabon's capital to this day. When M'Ba died in 1967, Bongo replaced him as president.\n\nIn March 1968, Bongo declared Gabon a one-party state by dissolving the BDG and establishing a new party\u2014the [[Parti Democratique Gabonais]] (PDG). He invited all Gabonese, regardless of previous political affiliation, to participate. Bongo sought to forge a single national movement in support of the government's development policies, using the PDG as a tool to submerge the regional and tribal rivalries that had divided Gabonese politics in the past. Bongo was elected President in February 1975; in April 1975, the position of vice president was abolished and replaced by the position of prime minister, who had no right to automatic succession. Bongo was re-elected President in both December 1979 and November 1986 to 7-year terms.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn early 1990 economic discontent and a desire for political liberalization provoked violent demonstrations and strikes by students and workers. In response to grievances by workers, Bongo negotiated with them on a sector-by-sector basis, making significant wage concessions. In addition, he promised to open up the PDG and to organize a national political conference in March\u2013April 1990 to discuss Gabon's future political system. The PDG and 74 political organizations attended the conference. Participants essentially divided into two loose coalitions, the ruling PDG and its allies, and the United Front of Opposition Associations and Parties, consisting of the breakaway Morena Fundamental and the [[Gabonese Progress Party]].<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe April 1990 conference approved sweeping political reforms, including creation of a national [[Senate (Gabon)|Senate]], decentralization of the budgetary process, freedom of assembly and press, and cancellation of an [[exit visa]] requirement. In an attempt to guide the political system's transformation to multiparty democracy, Bongo resigned as PDG chairman and created a transitional government headed by a new Prime Minister, [[Casimir Oye-Mba]]. The Gabonese Social Democratic Grouping (RSDG), as the resulting government was called, was smaller than the previous government and included representatives from several opposition parties in its cabinet. The RSDG drafted a provisional constitution in May 1990 that provided a basic [[bill of rights]] and an independent judiciary but retained strong executive powers for the president. After further review by a constitutional committee and the National Assembly, this document came into force in March 1991.<ref name=bn/>\n\nOpposition to the PDG continued after the April 1990 conference, however, and in September 1990, two [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] attempts were uncovered and aborted. Despite anti-government demonstrations after the untimely death of an opposition leader, the first multiparty National Assembly elections in almost 30 years took place in September\u2013October 1990, with the PDG garnering a large majority.<ref name=bn/>\n\nFollowing President [[Omar Bongo]]'s re-election in December 1993 with 51% of the vote, opposition candidates refused to validate the election results. Serious civil disturbances and violent repression led to an agreement between the government and opposition factions to work toward a political settlement. These talks led to the Paris Accords in November 1994, under which several opposition figures were included in a government of national unity. This arrangement soon broke down, however, and the 1996 and 1997 legislative and municipal elections provided the background for renewed partisan politics. The PDG won a landslide victory in the legislative election, but several major cities, including [[Libreville]], elected opposition mayors during the 1997 local election.<ref name=bn/>\n\nFacing a divided opposition, President Omar Bongo coasted to easy re-election in December 1998, with large majorities of the vote. While Bongo's major opponents rejected the outcome as fraudulent, some international observers characterized the results as representative despite many perceived irregularities, and there were none of the civil disturbances that followed the 1993 election. Peaceful though flawed legislative elections held in 2001\u20132002, which were boycotted by a number of smaller opposition parties and were widely criticized for their administrative weaknesses, produced a National Assembly almost completely dominated by the PDG and allied independents. In November 2005 President Omar Bongo was elected for his sixth term. He won re-election easily, but opponents claim that the balloting process was marred by irregularities. There were some instances of violence following the announcement of his win, but Gabon generally remained peaceful.<ref name=bn/>\n\nNational Assembly elections were held again in December 2006. Several seats contested because of voting irregularities were overturned by the Constitutional Court, but the subsequent run-off elections in early 2007 again yielded a PDG-controlled National Assembly.<ref name=bn/>\n\n[[File:Independence Celebration in Gabon.JPG|thumb|Independence Day celebration in Gabon]]\nOn June 8, 2009, President Omar Bongo died of cardiac arrest at a Spanish hospital in Barcelona, ushering in a new era in Gabonese politics. In accordance with the amended constitution, [[Rose Francine Rogomb\u00e9]], the President of the Senate, became Interim President on June 10, 2009. The first contested elections in Gabon's history that did not include Omar Bongo as a candidate were held on August 30, 2009 with 18 candidates for president. The lead-up to the elections saw some isolated protests, but no significant disturbances. Omar Bongo's son, ruling party leader [[Ali Bongo Ondimba]], was formally declared the winner after a 3-week review by the Constitutional Court; his inauguration took place on October 16, 2009.<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe court's review had been prompted by claims of fraud by the many opposition candidates, with the initial announcement of election results sparking unprecedented violent protests in [[Port-Gentil]], the country's second-largest city and a long-time bastion of opposition to PDG rule. The citizens of Port-Gentil took to the streets, and numerous shops and residences were burned, including the French Consulate and a local prison. Officially, only four deaths occurred during the riots, but opposition and local leaders claim many more. Gendarmes and the military were deployed to Port-Gentil to support the beleaguered police, and a curfew was in effect for more than three months.<ref name=bn/>\n\nA partial legislative by-election was held in June 2010. A newly created coalition of parties, the Union Nationale (UN), participated for the first time. The UN is composed largely of PDG defectors who left the party after [[Omar Bongo]]'s death. Of the five hotly contested seats, the PDG won three and the UN won two; both sides claimed victory.<ref name=bn/>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Ali Bongo Ondimba with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Ali Bongo Ondimba]], President of the Gabonese Republic, his wife Sylvia Bongo Ondimba, US president [[Barack Obama]] and his wife [[Michelle Obama]] in 2014]]\n{{main|Politics of Gabon}}\n\nGabon is a republic with a presidential form of government under the 1961 constitution (revised in 1975, rewritten in 1991, and revised in 2003). The president is elected by universal suffrage for a seven-year term; a 2003 constitutional amendment removed presidential term limits and facilitated a presidency for life. The president can appoint and dismiss the prime minister, the cabinet, and judges of the independent Supreme Court. The president also has other strong powers, such as authority to dissolve the National Assembly, declare a state of siege, delay legislation, and conduct referenda.<ref name=bn/>\n\nGabon has a bicameral legislature with a National Assembly and Senate. The National Assembly has 120 deputies who are popularly elected for a 5-year term. The Senate is composed of 102 members who are elected by municipal councils and regional assemblies and serve for 6 years. The Senate was created in the 1990\u20131991 constitutional revision, although it was not brought into being until after the 1997 local elections. The President of the Senate is next in succession to the President.<ref name=bn/>\n\nDespite the democratic system of government, the ''[[Freedom in the World]]'' report lists Gabon as \"not free\", and elections in 2016 have been disputed.\n\n=== Political culture ===\nIn 1990, the government made major changes to Gabon's political system. A transitional constitution was drafted in May 1990 as an outgrowth of the national political conference in March\u2013April and later revised by a constitutional committee. Among its provisions were a Western-style bill of rights, creation of a National Council of Democracy to oversee the guarantee of those rights, a governmental advisory board on economic and social issues, and an independent judiciary.<ref name=bn/>\n\nAfter approval by the National Assembly, the PDG Central Committee, and the President, the Assembly unanimously adopted the constitution in March 1991. Multiparty legislative elections were held in 1990\u201391, despite the fact that opposition parties had not been declared formally legal. In spite of this, the elections produced the first representative, multiparty National Assembly. In January 1991, the Assembly passed by unanimous vote a law governing the legalization of opposition parties.<ref name=bn/>\n\nAfter President Omar Bongo was re-elected in 1993, in a disputed election where only 51% of votes were cast, social and political disturbances led to the 1994 Paris Conference and Accords. These provided a framework for the next elections. Local and legislative elections were delayed until 1996\u201397. In 1997, constitutional amendments put forward years earlier were adopted to create the Senate and the position of vice president, as well as to extend the president's term to seven years.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn October 2009, newly elected President Ali Bongo Ondimba began efforts to streamline the government. In an effort to reduce corruption and government bloat, he eliminated 17 minister-level positions, abolished the vice presidency and reorganized the portfolios of numerous ministries, bureaus and directorates. In November 2009, President Bongo Ondimba announced a new vision for the modernization of Gabon, called \"Gabon Emergent\". This program contains three pillars: Green Gabon, Service Gabon, and Industrial Gabon. The goals of Gabon Emergent are to diversify the economy so that Gabon becomes less reliant on petroleum, to eliminate corruption, and to modernize the workforce. Under this program, exports of raw timber have been banned, a government-wide census was held, the work day has been changed to eliminate a long midday break, and a national oil company was created.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn provisional results,{{when|date=December 2012}} the ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] (PDG) won 84 out of 120 parliamentary seats.\n\nOn January 25, 2011, opposition leader [[Andr\u00e9 Mba Obame]] claimed the presidency, saying the country should be run by someone the people really wanted. He also selected 19 ministers for his government, and the entire group, along with hundreds of others, spent the night at UN headquarters. On January 26, the government dissolved Mba Obame's party. AU chairman [[Jean Ping]] said that Mba Obame's action \"hurts the integrity of legitimate institutions and also endangers the peace, the security and the stability of Gabon.\"<ref name=Goma>{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_GABON?SITE=NCWIN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=Gabon opposition leader declares himself president |last=Goma |first=Yves Laurent |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 26, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Interior Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ndongou accused Mba Obame and his supporters of [[treason]].<ref name=Goma/> The UN Secretary-General, [[Ban Ki-moon]], said that he recognized Ondimba as the only official Gabonese president.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe [[Gabonese presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] was disputed, with very close official results reported. Protests broke out in the capital and met a brutal repression which culminated in the alleged bombing of opposition party headquarters by the presidential guard. Between 50 and 100 citizens were killed by security forces and 1,000 arrested<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20160906-deaths-gabon-presidential-election-violence-ping-bongo|title=\u2018Between 50 and 100 killed\u2019 in Gabon election violence, presidential challenger tells FRANCE 24 - France 24|date=2016-09-06|work=France 24|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref>. International observers criticized irregularities, including unnaturally high turnout reported for some districts. The country's supreme court threw out some suspect precincts, but a full recount was not possible because ballots had been destroyed. The election was declared in favor of the incumbent Ondimba. European Parliament issued 2 resolutions denouncing the unclear results of the election and calling for an independent investigation on the human rights violations<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&reference=B8-2017-0526&language=EN|title=Motion for a resolution on Gabon, repression of the opposition - B8-0526/2017|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}</ref>.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Gabon}}\n\nSince independence, Gabon has followed a nonaligned policy, advocating dialogue in international affairs and recognizing each side of divided countries. In inter-African affairs, Gabon espouses development by evolution rather than revolution and favors regulated private enterprise as the system most likely to promote rapid economic growth. Gabon played an important leadership role in the stability of Central Africa through involvement in mediation efforts in [[Chad]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Angola]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (D.R.C.), and [[Burundi]].\n\nIn December 1999, through the mediation efforts of President Bongo, a peace accord was signed in the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) between the government and most leaders of an armed rebellion. President Bongo was also involved in the continuing D.R.C. peace process, and played a role in mediating the crisis in [[Ivory Coast]]. Gabonese armed forces were also an integral part of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) mission to the Central African Republic.\n\nGabon is a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and some of its specialized and related agencies, as well as of the [[World Bank]]; the [[IMF]]; the [[African Union]] (AU); the Central African Customs Union/Central African Economic and Monetary Community (UDEAC/CEMAC); EU/ACP association under the [[Lome Convention]]; the [[Communaute Financiere Africaine]] (CFA); the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC); the [[Nonaligned Movement]]; and the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS/CEEAC), among others. In 1995, Gabon withdrew from the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), rejoining in 2016. Gabon was elected to a non-permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]] for January 2010 through December 2011 and held the rotating presidency in March 2010.<ref name=bn/>\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Further|Military of Gabon}}\n\nGabon has a small, professional [[Military of Gabon|military]] of about 5,000 personnel, divided into army, navy, air force, [[gendarmerie]], and police. Gabonese forces are oriented to the defense of the country and have not been trained for an offensive role. A 1,800-member guard provides security for the president.<ref name=bn/>\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Provinces of Gabon Image Map}}\n{{main|Subdivisions of Gabon}}\nGabon is divided into nine provinces, which are further subdivided into 50 [[Departments of Gabon|departments]]. The president appoints the provincial governors, the prefects, and the subprefects.<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe provinces are (capitals in parentheses):\n#[[Estuaire Province|Estuaire]] ([[Libreville]])\n#[[Haut-Ogoou\u00e9]] ([[Franceville]])\n#[[Moyen-Ogoou\u00e9]] ([[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]])\n#[[Ngouni\u00e9]] ([[Mouila]])\n#[[Nyanga Province|Nyanga]] ([[Tchibanga]])\n#[[Ogoou\u00e9-Ivindo]] ([[Makokou]])\n#[[Ogoou\u00e9-Lolo]] ([[Koulamoutou]])\n#[[Ogoou\u00e9-Maritime]] ([[Port-Gentil]])\n#[[Woleu-Ntem]] ([[Oyem]])\n\n== Geography ==\n{{MapLibrary|Gabon_sat.png|Gabon.}}\n{{main|Geography of Gabon|Geology of Gabon}}\n[[File:Gabon map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Gabon map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]\n[[File:Beach scene Libreville 5.JPG|thumb|Beach scene in Gabon]]\nGabon is located on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of central Africa on the [[equator]], between latitudes [[3rd parallel north|3\u00b0N]] and [[4th parallel south|4\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[8th meridian east|8\u00b0]] and [[15th meridian east|15\u00b0E]]. Gabon generally has an [[equatorial climate]] with an extensive system of [[Tropical rainforest|rainforests]] covering 85% of the country.\n\nThere are three distinct regions: the coastal plains (ranging between {{convert|20| and |300|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr|-1}} from the ocean's shore), the mountains (the Cristal Mountains to the northeast of Libreville, the Chaillu Massif in the centre), and the [[savanna]] in the east. The coastal plains form a large section of the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]] and contain patches of [[Central African mangroves]] especially on the [[Muni River]] estuary on the border with [[Equatorial Guinea]].\n\nGeologically, Gabon is primarily ancient [[Archean]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] igneous and metamorphic basement rock, belonging to the stable continental crust of the [[Congo Craton]], a remnant section of extremely old continental crust. Some formations are more than two billion years old. Ancient rock units are overlain by marine [[carbonate]], lacustrine and continental sedimentary rocks as well as unconsolidated sediments and soils that formed in the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. The rifting apart of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] created rift basins that filled with sediments and formed the hydrocarbons which are now a keystone of the Gabonese economy. <ref>{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=110\u2013112}}</ref> Gabon is notable for the Oklo reactor zones, the only known [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] on Earth which was active two billion years ago. The site was discovered during uranium mining in the 1970s to supply the French nuclear power industry. \n\nGabon's largest river is the [[Ogoou\u00e9]] which is {{convert|1200|km|-1}} long. Gabon has three [[Karst topography|karst]] areas where there are hundreds of caves located in the dolomite and limestone rocks. Some of the caves include Grotte du Lastoursville, Grotte du Lebamba, Grotte du Bongolo, and Grotte du Kessipougou. Many caves have not been explored yet. A National Geographic Expedition visited the caves in the summer of 2008 to document them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/gabon-caves|title=Expedition website|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nGabon is also noted for efforts to preserve the natural environment. In 2002, President Omar Bongo Ondimba designated roughly 10% of the nation's territory to be part of its [[List of national parks of Gabon|national park system]] (with 13 parks in total), one of the largest proportions of [[nature park]]land in the world. The [[National Agency for National Parks]] manages Gabon's national park system.\n\nNatural resources include petroleum, magnesium, iron, gold, uranium, and forests.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Gabon Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|A proportional representation of Gabon's exports]]\n{{main|Economy of Gabon}}\n\nGabon's economy is dominated by oil. [[Oil revenue]]s constitute roughly 46% of the government's budget, 43% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and 81% of exports. Oil production is currently declining rapidly from its high point of 370,000 barrels per day in 1997. Some estimates suggest that Gabonese oil will be expended by 2025. In spite of the decreasing oil revenues, planning is only now beginning for an after-oil scenario.<ref name=bn>[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2826.htm Background note: Gabon]. [[U.S. Department of State]] (August 4, 2010).{{PD-notice}}</ref> The Grondin [[Petroleum reservoir|Oil Field]] was discovered in {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} water depths {{convert|40|km|abbr=on|round=5}} offshore, in 1971 and produces from the Batanga [[sandstone]]s of [[Maastrichtian]] age forming an [[anticline]] salt [[structural trap]] which is about {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref>Vidal, J., \"Geology of Grondin Field, 1980\", in ''Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade: 1968\u20131978'', AAPG Memoir 30, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, {{ISBN|0891813063}}, pp. 577\u2013590</ref>\n\nGabonese public expenditures from the years of significant oil revenues were not spent efficiently. Overspending on the [[Trans-Gabon Railway]], the CFA franc devaluation of 1994, and periods of low oil prices caused serious debt problems that still plague the country.<ref name=bn/>\n\nGabon earned a poor reputation with the [[Paris Club]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) over the management of its debt and revenues. Successive IMF missions have criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items (in good years and bad), over-borrowing from the [[Central Bank]], and slipping on the schedule for [[privatization]] and administrative reform. However, in September 2005 Gabon successfully concluded a 15-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. Another 3-year Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF was approved in May 2007. Because of the financial crisis and social developments surrounding the death of President Omar Bongo and the elections, Gabon was unable to meet its economic goals under the Stand-By Arrangement in 2009. Negotiations with the IMF were ongoing.<ref name=bn/>\n\nGabon's oil revenues have given it a per capita GDP of $8,600, unusually high for the region. However, a skewed income distribution and poor social indicators are evident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook//fields/2116.html#gb|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref> The richest 20% of the population earn over 90% of the income while about a third of the Gabonese population lives in poverty.<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe economy is highly dependent on extraction, but primary materials are abundant. Before the discovery of oil, logging was the pillar of the Gabonese economy. Today, logging and manganese mining are the next-most-important income generators. Recent explorations suggest the presence of the world's largest unexploited iron ore deposit. For many who live in rural areas without access to employment opportunity in extractive industries, remittances from family members in urban areas or subsistence activities provide income.<ref name=bn/>\n\nForeign and local observers have lamented the lack of diversity in the Gabonese economy. Various factors have so far limited the development of new industries:\n* the market is small, about a million\n* dependent on imports from France\n* unable to capitalize on regional markets\n* entrepreneurial zeal not always present among the Gabonese\n* a fairly regular stream of oil \"rent\", even if it is diminishing\n\nFurther investment in the agricultural or [[Tourism in Gabon|tourism]] sectors is complicated by poor infrastructure. The small processing and service sectors that do exist are largely dominated by a few prominent local investors.<ref name=bn/>\n\nAt World Bank and IMF insistence, the government embarked in the 1990s on a program of privatization of its state-owned companies and administrative reform, including reducing public sector employment and salary growth, but progress has been slow. The new government has voiced a commitment to work toward an economic transformation of the country but faces significant challenges to realize this goal.<ref name=bn/>\n\n== Society ==\n\n=== Demographics ===\n{{main|Demographics of Gabon}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population in Gabon{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.5\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|1.2\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Gabon}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|}\n[[File:Crowd on Beach in Gabon.JPG|thumb|Crowd on beach in Gabon]]\nGabon has a population of approximately {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Gabon}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} Historical and environmental factors caused Gabon's population to decline between 1900 and 1940.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Gabon has one of the lowest [[Population density|population densities]] of any country in Africa,<ref name=bn/> and the fourth highest [[Human Development Index]] in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name=HDI/>\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nAlmost all Gabonese are of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] origin.

More than 10,000 native French live in Gabon, including an estimated 2,000 dual nationals.<ref name=bn/>\n\nEthnic boundaries are less sharply drawn in Gabon than elsewhere in [[Africa]]. Most ethnicities are spread throughout Gabon, leading to constant contact and interaction among the groups, and there is no ethnic tension. One important reason for this is that intermarriage is extremely common and every Gabonese person is connected by blood to many different tribes. Indeed, intermarriage is often required because among many tribes, marriage within the same tribe is prohibited because it is regarded as incest. This is because those tribes consist of the descendants of a specific ancestor, and therefore all members of the tribe are regarded as close kin to each other (identical to the clan system of [[Scotland]] or the [[Gotra]] system in India). French, the language of its former colonial ruler, is a unifying force. The Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG)'s historical dominance also has served to unite various ethnicities and local interests into a larger whole.\n\n=== Population centres ===\n{{Further|List of cities in Gabon}}\n[[File:Front de mer.jpg|thumb|Libreville]]\n[[File:Park In Gabon.JPG|thumb|People in Libreville]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  \n|-----\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFA500\" | '''Cities of Gabon'''\n|-----\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''Order''' || rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''City''' || colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''Population''' ||  rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''Province'''\n|-----\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''Census 1993''' || align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''2006 (calculated)'''\n|-----\n|align=right | 1. || [[Libreville]] || align=right | 419,596 || align=right | 591,356 || [[Estuaire Province|Estuaire]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 2. || [[Port-Gentil]] || align=right | 79,225 || align=right | 111,655 || [[Ogoou\u00e9-Maritime]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 3. || [[Franceville]] || align=right | 31,183 || align=right | 43,948 || [[Haut-Ogoou\u00e9]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 4. || [[Oyem]] || align=right | 22,404 || align=right | 31,575 || [[Woleu-Ntem]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 5. || [[Moanda]] || align=right | 21,882 || align=right | 30,839 || [[Haut-Ogoou\u00e9]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 6. || [[Mouila]] || align=right | 16,307 || align=right | 22,982 || [[Ngouni\u00e9]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 7. || [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]] || align=right | 15,033 || align=right | 21,187 || [[Moyen-Ogoou\u00e9]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 8. || [[Tchibanga]] || align=right | 14,054 || align=right | 19,807 || [[Nyanga Province|Nyanga]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 9. || [[Koulamoutou]] || align=right | 11,773 || align=right | 16,592 || [[Ogoou\u00e9-Lolo]]\n|-----\n|align=right | 10. || [[Makokou]] || align=right | 9,849 || align=right | 13,881 || [[Ogoou\u00e9-Ivindo]]\n|}\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Further|Languages of Gabon}}\n\nIt is [[African French#note-2007 report|estimated that 80%]] of Gabon's population can speak French, and that 30% of Libreville residents are native speakers of the language.

Gabon's medical infrastructure is considered one of the best in [[West Africa]]{{by whom|date=July 2016}}. By 1985 there were 28 hospitals, 87 medical centers, and 312 infirmaries and dispensaries. {{As of|2004}}, there were an estimated 29 physicians per 100,000 people. Approximately 90% of the population had access to health care services.\n\nIn 2000, 70% of the population had access to safe drinking water and 21% had adequate sanitation. A comprehensive government health program treats such diseases as [[leprosy]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[malaria]], [[filariasis]], [[intestinal worms]], and [[tuberculosis]]. Rates for immunization of children under the age of one were 97% for tuberculosis and 65% for [[polio]]. Immunization rates for [[DPT vaccine|DPT]] and [[measles]] were 37% and 56% respectively. Gabon has a domestic supply of pharmaceuticals from a factory in Libreville.\n\nThe [[total fertility rate]] has decreased from 5.8 in 1960 to 4.2 children per mother during childbearing years in 2000. Ten percent of all births were low birth weight. The [[maternal mortality rate]] was 520 per 100,000 live births as of 1998. In 2005, the [[infant mortality rate]] was 55.35 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy was 55.02 years. As of 2002, the overall mortality rate was estimated at 17.6 per 1,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe [[HIV/AIDS]] [[prevalence]] is estimated to be 5.2% of the adult population (ages 15\u201349).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html?countryName=Lesotho&countryCode=LT&regionCode=af#gb|title=COUNTRY COMPARISON :: HIV/AIDS \u2013 ADULT PREVALENCE RATE |work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref> {{As of|2009}}, approximately 46,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2156rank.html?countryName=Gabon&countryCode=gb&regionCode=afr&rank=59#gb|title=COUNTRY COMPARISON :: HIV/AIDS \u2013 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS|work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref> There were an estimated 2,400 deaths from AIDS in 2009 \u2013 down from 3,000 deaths in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2157rank.html?countryName=Gabon&countryCode=gb&regionCode=afr&rank=52#gb|title=COUNTRY COMPARISON :: HIV/AIDS \u2013 DEATHS| work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in Gabon}}\n\nGabon's education system is regulated by two ministries: the Ministry of Education, in charge of pre-kindergarten through the last high school grade, and the Ministry of Higher Education and Innovative Technologies, in charge of universities, higher education, and professional schools.\n\nEducation is compulsory for children ages 6 to 16 under the Education Act. Most children in Gabon start their school lives by attending nurseries or \"Cr\u00e8che\", then kindergarten known as \"Jardins d'Enfants\". At age 6, they are enrolled in primary school, \"\u00c9cole Primaire\" which is made up of six grades. The next level is \"\u00c9cole Secondaire\", which is made up of seven grades. The planned graduation age is 19 years old. Those who graduate can apply for admission at institutions of higher learning, including engineering schools or business schools. Gabon's literacy rate is 83.2%.<ref name = \"cinnwk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gb.html|title=Gabon|work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref>\n\nThe government has used oil revenue for school construction, paying teachers' salaries, and promoting education, including in rural areas. However, maintenance of school structures, as well as teachers' salaries, has been declining. In 2002 the gross primary enrollment rate was 132 percent, and in 2000 the net primary enrollment rate was 78 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. As of 2001, 69 percent of children who started primary school were likely to reach grade 5. Problems in the education system include poor management and planning, lack of oversight, poorly qualified teachers, and overcrowded classrooms.<ref name=ilab>\"Gabon\".

Each group has its own set of masks used for various reasons. They are mostly used in traditional ceremonies such as marriage, birth and funerals. Traditionalists mainly work with rare local woods and other precious materials.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Further|Music of Gabon}}\n\nGabonese music is lesser-known in comparison with regional giants like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Cameroon]]. The country boasts an array of folk styles, as well as pop stars like [[Patience Dabany]] and [[Annie-Flore Batchiellilys]], a Gabonese singer and renowned live performer. Also known are guitarists like Georges Oyendze, La Rose Mbadou and Sylvain Avara, and the singer [[Oliver N'Goma]].\n\nImported rock and hip hop from the US and UK are popular in Gabon, as are [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], [[makossa]] and [[soukous]]. Gabonese folk instruments include the obala, the {{Interlanguage link multi|ngombi|fr}}, the [[balafon]] and traditional drums.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Further|Media of Gabon}}\n\nRadio-Diffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Gabonaise (RTG), which is owned and operated by the government, broadcasts in [[French language|French]] and indigenous languages. Color television broadcasts have been introduced in major cities. In 1981, a commercial radio station, Africa No. 1, began operations. The most powerful radio station on the continent, it has participation from the French and Gabonese governments and private European media.\n\nIn 2004, the government operated two radio stations and another seven were privately owned. There were also two government television stations and four privately owned. In 2003, there were an estimated 488 radios and 308 television sets for every 1,000 people. About 11.5 of every 1,000 people were cable subscribers. Also in 2003, there were 22.4 personal computers for every 1,000 people and 26 of every 1,000 people had access to the [[Internet]]. The national press service is the Gabonese Press Agency, which publishes a daily paper, ''Gabon-Matin'' (circulation 18,000 as of 2002).\n\n''[[L'Union]]'' in Libreville, the government-controlled daily newspaper, had an average daily circulation of 40,000 in 2002. The weekly ''Gabon d'Aujourdhui'' is published by the Ministry of Communications. There are about nine privately owned periodicals which are either independent or affiliated with political parties. These publish in small numbers and are often delayed by financial constraints. The constitution of Gabon provides for free speech and a free press, and the government supports these rights. Several periodicals actively criticize the government and foreign publications are widely available.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Further|Gabonese cuisine}}\n\nGabonese cuisine is influenced by French cuisine, but [[staple foods]] are also available.<ref name=\"Foster\">Foster, Dean (2002).

[[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrants settled the area beginning in the 14th century. [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers and traders arrived in the area in the late 15th century. The coast subsequently became a center of the [[Slavery|slave trade]] with [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Kingdom of England|English]], and French traders arriving in the 16th century. In 1839 and 1841, [[France]] established a [[protectorate]] over the coast.\n\nIn 1849, captives released from a captured slave ship founded [[Libreville]]. In 1862-1887, France expanded its control to include the interior, and took full sovereignty.\n\nIn 1910 Gabon became part of [[French Equatorial Africa]] and in 1960, Gabon became independent.\n\nAt the time of Gabon's independence, two principal political parties existed: the [[Gabonese Democratic Party|Gabonese Democratic Bloc]] (BDG), led by [[L\u00e9on M'Ba]], and the [[Gabonese Democratic and Social Union]] (UDSG), led by [[Jean-Hilaire Aubame]]. In the [[Gabonese general election, 1961|first post-independence election]], held under a parliamentary system, neither party was able to win a majority; the leaders subsequently agreed against a [[two-party system]] and ran with a single list of candidates. In the [[Gabonese general election, 1961|February 1961 election]], held under the new presidential system, M'Ba became president and Aubame became foreign minister. The single-party solution disintegrated in 1963, and there was a single-day [[bloodless coup]] in 1964. In [[Gabonese general election, 1967|March 1967]], Leon M'Ba and [[Omar Bongo]] were elected president and vice president. M'Ba died later that year. Bongo declared Gabon a [[one-party state]], dissolved the BDG and established the [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] (PDG). Sweeping political reforms in 1990 led to a new constitution, and the PDG garnered a large majority in the country's [[Gabonese legislative election, 1990|first multi-party elections]] in 30 years. Despite discontent from opposition parties, Bongo remained president until his death in 2009.\n\n==Early history==\n\nGabon was settled from the 14th century by [[Bantu peoples]]. Little is known of tribal life before European contact but tribal art suggests a rich cultural heritage.\n\nGabon's first confirmed European visitors were Portuguese explorers and traders who arrived in the late 15th century. The Portuguese settled on the offshore islands of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]], [[Pr\u00edncipe]], and [[Bioko|Fernando P\u00f3]], but were regular visitors to the coast.\n\nThey named the Gabon region after the Portuguese word ''gab\u00e3o'' \u2014 a coat with sleeve and hood resembling the shape of the [[Komo River]] estuary. The coast became a center of the slave trade.\n\nSome Portuguese adventurers established themselves as rulers of areas in Gabon. One such was Ogandaga \u00e9 Butu, son of a Portuguese father and a Gabonese mother. He ruled some islands along the coast, which are still controlled by his descendant Mbourou Eranga Yanelle Prunella.\n\n[[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Kingdom of England|English]], and French traders came in the 16th century.\n\n==French colonial period==\n[[Image:Colonial Gabon natives postcard 1905.jpg|thumb|right|300px|\"''French Congo. Natives from Gabon''\": Colonial postcard c.1905]]\n\nIn 1839 and 1841, France established a [[protectorate]] over the coastal regions of Gabon by treaties with Gabonese coastal chiefs.\n\nAmerican missionaries from [[New England]] established a mission  at the mouth of the [[Komo River]] in 1842. In 1849, the French authorities captured an illegal slave ship and freed the captives on board. The captives were released near the mission station, where they founded a settlement which was called [[Libreville]] (French for \"free town\")\n\nFrench explorers penetrated Gabon's dense jungles between 1862 and 1887. The most famous, [[Savorgnan de Brazza]], used Gabonese bearers and guides in his search for the headwaters of the [[Congo river]]. France occupied Gabon in 1885, but did not administer it until 1903. Gabon's first political party, the [[Jeunesse Gabonais]], was founded around 1922.\n\nIn 1910 Gabon became one of the four territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. On 15 July 1960 France agreed to Gabon becoming fully independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0D16F63D5C1A728DDDAF0994DF405B808AF1D3|title=Gabon Is Granted Sovereignty; Remains in French Community; Debre Hails the 11th African Republic Made Free Under Paris Accords in 1960|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref> On 17 August 1960 Gabon became an independent country.\n\n==Independence==\nAt the time of Gabon's independence in 1960, two principal political parties existed: the [[Gabonese Democratic Party|Gabonese Democratic Bloc]] (BDG), led by [[L\u00e9on M'Ba]], and the [[Gabonese Democratic and Social Union]] (UDSG), led by [[Jean-Hilaire Aubame]]. In the [[Gabonese general election, 1961|first post-independence election]], held under a parliamentary system, neither party was able to win a majority. The BDG obtained support from three of the four independent legislative deputies, and M'Ba was named Prime Minister. Soon after concluding that Gabon had an insufficient number of people for a two-party system, the two party leaders agreed on a single list of candidates. In the [[Gabonese general election, 1961|February 1961 election]], held under the new presidential system, M'Ba became president and Aubame became foreign minister.\n\nThis one-party system appeared to work until February 1963, when the larger BDG element forced the UDSG members to choose between a merger of the parties or resignation. The UDSG cabinet ministers resigned, and M'Ba called an election for February 1964 and a reduced number of National Assembly deputies (from 67 to 47). The UDSG failed to muster a list of candidates able to meet the requirements of the electoral decrees. When the BDG appeared likely to win the election by default, the Gabonese military toppled M'Ba in a bloodless coup on 18 February 1964. French troops re-established his government the next day. [[Gabonese legislative election, 1964|Elections]] were held in April 1964 with many opposition participants. BDG-supported candidates won 31 seats and the opposition 16. Late in 1966, the constitution was revised to provide for automatic succession of the vice president should the president die in office. In March 1967, Leon M'Ba and [[Omar Bongo]] (then known as Albert Bongo) were [[Gabonese general election, 1967|elected]] President and Vice President, with the BDG winning all 47 seats in the National Assembly. M'Ba died later that year, and Omar Bongo became president.\n\nIn March 1968 Bongo declared Gabon a one-party state by dissolving the BDG and establishing a new party: the [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] ''(Parti D\u00e9mocratique Gabonais)'' (PDG). He invited all Gabonese, regardless of previous political affiliation, to participate. Bongo was [[Gabonese general election, 1973|elected]] President in February 1973; in April 1975, the office of vice president was abolished and replaced by the office of prime minister, who had no right to automatic succession. Bongo was re-elected president in [[Gabonese presidential election, 1979|December 1979]] and [[Gabonese presidential election, 1986|November 1986]] to 7-year terms. Using the PDG as a tool to submerge the regional and tribal rivalries that divided Gabonese politics in the past, Bongo sought to forge a single national movement in support of the government's development policies.\n\nEconomic discontent and a desire for political liberalization provoked violent demonstrations and strikes by students and workers in early 1990. In response to worker grievances, Bongo negotiated on a sector-by-sector basis, making significant wage concessions. In addition, he promised to open up the PDG and to organize a national political conference in March\u2013April 1990 to discuss Gabon's future political system. The PDG and 74 political organizations attended the conference. Participants essentially divided into two loose coalitions, the ruling PDG and its allies, and the [[United Front of Opposition Associations and Parties]], consisting of the breakaway [[Morena Fundamental]] and the [[Gabonese Progress Party]].\n\nThe April 1990 conference approved sweeping political reforms, including creation of a national Senate, decentralization of the budgetary process, freedom of assembly and press, and cancellation of the exit visa requirement. In an attempt to guide the political system's transformation to multiparty democracy, Bongo resigned as PDG chairman and created a transitional government headed by a new Prime Minister, [[Casimir Oy\u00e9-Mba]]. The [[Gabonese Social Democratic Grouping]] (RSDG), as the resulting government was called, was smaller than the previous government and included representatives from several opposition parties in its cabinet. The RSDG drafted a provisional constitution in May 1990 that provided a basic bill of rights and an independent judiciary but retained strong executive powers for the president. After further review by a constitutional committee and the National Assembly, this document came into force in March 1991. Under the 1991 constitution, in the event of the president's death, the Prime Minister, the National Assembly president, and the defense minister were to share power until a new election could be held.\n\nOpposition to the PDG continued, however, and in September 1990, two [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] attempts were uncovered and aborted. Despite anti-government demonstrations after the untimely death of an opposition leader, the first multiparty [[Gabonese legislative election, 1990|National Assembly elections]] in almost 30 years took place in September\u2013October 1990, with the PDG garnering a large majority.\n\nFollowing President Bongo's [[Gabonese presidential election, 1993|re-election]] in December 1993 with 51% of the vote, opposition candidates refused to validate the election results. Serious civil disturbances led to an agreement between the government and opposition factions to work toward a political settlement. These talks led to the Paris Accords in November 1994, under which several opposition figures were included in a government of national unity, and constitutional reforms were approved in a [[Gabonese constitutional referendum, 1995|referendum]] in 1995. This arrangement soon broke down, however, and the 1996 and 1997 [[Gabonese legislative election, 1996|legislative]] and municipal elections provided the background for renewed partisan politics. The PDG won a landslide victory in the legislative election, but several major cities, including [[Libreville]], elected opposition mayors during the 1997 local election.\n\n==Modern times==\nPresident Bongo coasted to easy re-elections in [[Gabonese presidential election, 1998|December 1998]] and [[Gabonese presidential election, 2005|November 2005]], with large majorities of the vote against a divided opposition. While Bongo's major opponents rejected the outcome as fraudulent, some international observers characterized the results as representative despite any perceived irregularities. Legislative elections held in 2001-2002, which were boycotted by a number of smaller opposition parties and were widely criticized for their administrative weaknesses, produced a National Assembly almost completely dominated by the PDG and allied independents.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[List of heads of government of Gabon]]\n*[[List of heads of state of Gabon]]\n*[[Politics of Gabon]]\n* Libreville [[Libreville#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Libreville|timeline]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*Petringa, Maria (2006), ''Brazza, A Life for Africa''.\n*Schilling, Heinar (1937), ''Germanisches Leben'', Koehler and Amelang, Leipzig, Germany.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Nnang Ndong|first=L\u00e9on Modeste|title=L'Effort de Guerre de l'Afrique: Le Gabon dans la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre Mondiale, 1939-1947|date=2011|publisher=L'Harmattan|location=Paris|isbn=9782296553903}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://vlib.iue.it/history/africa/gabon.html WWW-VL History Index of Gabon]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111220135318/http://documents.univ-lille3.fr/files/pub/www/recherche/theses/CADET_XAVIER/html/these_body.html A detailed history] {{fr icon}}\n*[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2826.htm Background Note: Gabon]\n\n{{Years in Gabon}}\n{{Gabon topics}}\n{{Former French colonies}}\n{{History of Africa}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Gabon}}\n[[Category:History of Gabon| ]]\n[[Category:History of Central Africa|*]]\n[[Category:History of Africa by country|Gabon]]\n[[Category:French Equatorial Africa]]", "sha1": "8ep6xal3zreimowk0oekp9wytys9h72"}}, {"title": "Geography of Gabon", "ns": "0", "id": "12029", "revision": {"id": "835128712", "parentid": "804692867", "timestamp": "2018-04-06T18:50:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "Trappist the monk", "id": "10289486"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* top */lang fix; using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox country geography\n|name = Gabon<br />{{lang|fr|R\u00e9publique Gabonaise}}\n|map = [[File:Topographic map of Gabon-en.svg|300px]]<br><br>[[File:LocationGabon.svg|240px]]\n|map size = \n|continent = [[Africa]]\n|region = \n|coordinates = {{Coord|1|00|N|11|45|E|type:country}}\n|area ranking = 77th\n|km area = 267,667\n|percent water = 3.7\n|km coastline = 885\n|borders = \n|highest point = [[Mont Bengou\u00e9]], 1070&nbsp;m (not [[Mont Iboundji]] as claimed by some authorities)\n|lowest point = [[Atlantic Ocean]], 0&nbsp;m\n|longest river = [[Ogoou\u00e9 River]]\n|largest lake = \n|climate = [[Tropics|Tropical]]; always hot, humid\n|terrain = narrow coastal plain; hilly interior; savanna in east and south\n|natural resources = [[Petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[diamond]], [[niobium]], [[manganese]], [[uranium]], [[gold]], [[timber]], [[iron ore]], [[hydropower]]\n|natural hazards = \n|environmental issues = [[deforestation]], [[poaching]]\n}}\n[[File:Gabon map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Gabon map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\n{{MapLibrary|Gabon_sat.png|Gabon}}\n'''[[Gabon]]''' is a country in [[West Africa]], lying along the [[Atlantic Ocean]], just south of the [[Bight of Biafra]].\n\n==Borders==\nGabon has a total of 3,261&nbsp;km of international boundaries.

During the remaining months, rainfall is heavy. The excessive rainfall is caused by the condensation of moist air resulting from the meeting, directly off the coast, of the cold Benguela Current from the south and the warm Guinea Current from the north. At Libreville, the average annual rainfall is more than 2540&nbsp;mm. Farther north on the coast, it is 3810&nbsp;mm.\n\n==Terrain==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"clear:none\"\n!

The government is divided into three branches: the [[Executive (management)|Executive]] (headed by the prime minister (although previously grabbed by the president), the [[legislative]] that is formed by the two chambers of parliament. The [[judicial]] branch, like other two branches, is technically independent and equal to other three branches, although in practice, since its judges are appointed by the president, it is beholden to the same president. Since independence the party system is dominated by the conservative [[Gabonese Democratic Party]].\n[[Image:Omar Bongo crop.jpg|thumb|left|Former President [[Omar Bongo]] Ondimba]]In March 1991 a new constitution was adopted. Among its provisions are a Western-style [[bill of rights]], the creation of the National Council of Democracy that also oversees the guarantee of those rights and a governmental advisory board which deals with economic and social issues. Multi-party legislative elections were held in 1990-91 even though opposition parties had not been declared formally legal.\n\n==Political developments==\nUnder the 1961 [[Constitution of Gabon|constitution]] (revised in 1975 and rewritten in 1991), Gabon became a [[republic]] with a [[President of Gabon|presidential]] form of government. The [[National Assembly of Gabon]] has 120 deputies elected for a five-year term. The president is elected by [[universal suffrage]] for a seven-year term. The president appoints the [[Prime Minister of Gabon|prime minister]], the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], and [[judge]]s of the independent [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. The government in 1990 made major changes in the political system. A transitional constitution was drafted in May as an outgrowth of a national political conference in March\u2013April and later revised by a constitutional committee. Among its provisions were a [[Western world#Western thought|Western]]-style [[bill of rights]]; creation of a [[National Council of Democracy]], which oversees the guarantee of those rights; a governmental advisory board on economic and social issues; and an independent [[judiciary]]. After approval by the National Assembly, the PDG Central Committee, and the president, the Assembly unanimously adopted the constitution in March 1991. Multi-party legislative elections were held in 1990-91 although opposition parties had not been declared formally legal.\n\nAfter a peaceful transition, the elections produced the first representative, [[Multi-party system|multi-party]], National Assembly. In January 1991, the Assembly passed by unanimous vote a law governing the legalization of opposition parties. The president was re-elected in a disputed election in 1993 with 51% of votes cast. Social and political disturbances led to the 1994 [[Paris Conference and Accords]], which provided a framework for the next elections. Local and legislative elections were delayed until 1996-1997. In 1997, [[constitutional amendment]]s were adopted to create an appointed [[Senate of Gabon|Senate]], the position of [[Vice President of Gabon|Vice President]], and to extend the president's term to seven years. Facing a divided opposition, President [[Omar Bongo]] was re-elected in December 1998, with 66% of the votes cast. Although the main opposition parties claimed the elections had been manipulated, there was none of the [[Civil disobedience|civil disturbance]] that followed the 1993 election. The president retains strong powers, such as authority to dissolve the National Assembly, declare a state of siege, delay legislation, conduct referendums, and appoint and dismiss the prime minister and cabinet members. For administrative purposes, Gabon is divided into nine [[province]]s, which are further divided into 36 [[prefecture]]s and eight separate [[subprefecture]]s. The president appoints the provincial [[governor]]s, the prefects, and the subprefects.\n\n==Political conditions==\nAt the time of [[History of Gabon|Gabon's independence]] in 1960, two principal political parties existed: the [[Bloc Democratique Gabonais]] (BDG), led by [[Leon M'Ba]], and the [[Union D\u00e9mocratique et Sociale Gabonaise]] (UDSG), led by [[Jean-Hilaire Aubame]]. In the first post-independence election, held under a parliamentary system, neither party was able to win a majority. The BDG obtained support from three of the four independent legislative deputies, and M'Ba was named prime minister. Soon after concluding that Gabon had an insufficient number of people for a [[two-party system]], the two party leaders agreed on a single list of candidates. In the February 1961 election, held under the new presidential system, M'Ba became president and Aubame foreign minister.\n\nThis coalition appeared to work until February 1963, when the larger BDG forced the UDSG members to choose between a merger of the parties or resignation. The UDSG cabinet ministers resigned, and M'Ba called an election for February 1964 and a reduced number of National Assembly deputies (from 67 to 47). The UDSG failed to muster a list of candidates able to meet the requirements of the electoral decrees. When the BDG appeared likely to win the election by default, the [[Military of Gabon|Gabonese military]] toppled M'Ba in a bloodless coup on February 18, 1964. [[Military of France|French troops]] re-established his government the next day. Elections were held in April with many opposition participants. BDG-supported candidates won 31 seats and the opposition 16. Late in 1966, the constitution was revised to provide for automatic succession of the vice president should the president die in office. In March 1967, Leon M'Ba and Omar Bongo (then Albert Bongo) were elected president and vice president. M'Ba died later that year, and Omar Bongo became president.\n\nIn March 1968, Bongo declared Gabon a one-party state by dissolving the BDG and establishing a new party\u2014the [[Gabonese Democratic Party]]. He invited all Gabonese, regardless of previous political affiliation, to participate. Bongo was elected president in February 1975 and re-elected in December 1979 and November 1986 to seven-year terms. In April 1975, the office of vice president was abolished and replaced by the office of prime minister, who has no right to automatic succession. Under the 1991 constitution, in the event of the president's death, the prime minister, the National Assembly president, and the defense minister share power until a new election is held. Using the PDG as a tool to submerge the regional and tribal rivalries that have divided Gabonese politics in the past, Bongo sought to forge a single national movement in support of the government's development policies.\n\nOpposition to the PDG continued, however, and in September 1990, two coup attempts were uncovered and aborted. Economic discontent and a desire for political liberalization provoked violent demonstrations and strikes by students and workers in early 1990. In response to grievances by workers, Bongo negotiated with them on a sector-by-sector basis, making significant wage concessions. In addition, he promised to open up the PDG and to organize a national political conference in March\u2013April 1990 to discuss Gabon's future political system. The PDG and 74 political organizations attended the conference. Participants essentially divided into two loose coalitions, the ruling PDG and its allies and the United Front of Opposition Associations and Parties, consisting of the breakaway Morena Fundamental and the Gabonese Progress Party.\n\nThe April conference approved sweeping political reforms, including creation of a national senate, decentralization of the [[budget]]ary process, freedom of assembly and press, and cancellation of the [[Visa (document)#Exit visas|exit visa]] requirement. In an attempt to guide the political system's transformation to multi-party democracy, Bongo resigned as PDG chairman and created a transitional government headed by a new Prime Minister, Casimir Oye-Mba. The Gabonese Social Democratic Grouping (RSDG), as the resulting government was called, was smaller than the previous government and included representatives from several opposition parties in its cabinet. The RSDG drafted a provisional constitution that provided a basic bill of rights and an independent judiciary but retained strong executive powers for the president. After further review by a constitutional committee and the National Assembly, this document came into force in March 1991.\n\nDespite further anti-government demonstrations after the untimely death of an opposition leader, the first multi-party National Assembly elections in almost 30 years took place in September\u2013October 1990, with the PDG garnering a large majority. Following President Bongo's re-election in December 1993 with 51% of the vote, opposition candidates refused to validate the election results. Serious civil disturbances, which were heavily respressed by the presidential guard, led to an agreement between the government and opposition factions to work toward a political settlement. These talks led to the Paris Accords in November 1994 in which several opposition figures were included in a government of national unity. This arrangement soon broke down, and the 1996 and 1997 legislative and municipal elections provided the background for renewed partisan politics. The PDG won a landslide victory in the legislative election, but several major cities, including [[Libreville]], elected opposition mayors during the 1997 local election. President Bongo coasted to an easy re-election in December 1998 with 66% of the vote against a divided opposition. While Bongo's major opponents rejected the outcome as fraudulent, international observers characterized the result as representative even if the election suffered from serious administrative problems. There was no serious civil disorder or protests following the election in contrast to the 1993 election.\n\nPresident Omar Ali Bongo narrowly beat rival Jean Ping in the official results of the Presidential election in 2016. With results showing a trend of success for Ping, the final province's results were released after significant delays, showing a remarkable 99.5% support for President Bongo in Haut-Ogooue. This was conveniently just enough to push Ali Bongo into first place. An EU Election Observation Mission present in the country declared that observers had incurred problems accessing the process of vote counting. The right to demonstrate or express oneself was described by the mission as 'restrictive'. The electoral regulations benefitted President Bongo, according to the Mission's report.<ref>https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/declaration_preliminaire_29.08.pdf </ref>\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[Heads of State of Gabon|President]]\n|[[Ali Bongo Ondimba]]\n|[[Gabonese Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]\n|16 October 2009\n|-\n|[[Heads of Government of Gabon|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet]]\n|[[Gabonese Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]\n|28 September 2016\n|}\nThe president is elected by popular vote for a seven-year term. He appoints the prime minister. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the prime minister in consultation with the president.\nPresident [[Omar Bongo|El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba]], in power since 1967 and the longest-serving African head of state, was re-elected to another seven-year term according to poll results returned from elections held on November 27, 2005. According to figures provided by Gabon's Interior Ministry, this was achieved with 79.1% of the votes cast. In 2003 the President amended the [[Constitution of Gabon]] to remove any restrictions on the number of terms a president is allowed to serve. The president retains strong powers, such as authority to dissolve the National Assembly, declare a state of siege, delay legislation, conduct referendums, and appoint and dismiss the prime minister and cabinet members.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nThe [[Parliament of Gabon|Parliament]] (''Parlement'') has two [[bicameralism|chambers]].

IMF missions (related to the now lapsed EFF program) have criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items (in good years and bad), over-borrowing from the Central Bank, and slipping on the schedule for privatization and administrative reform.\n\nGabon's oil revenues have given it a per capita GDP of more than $10,000, unusually high for the region.<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2006&ey=2009&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=646&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=37&pr.y=0 Report for Selected Countries and Subjects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On the other hand, a skewed income distribution and poor social indicators are evident. The economy is highly dependent on extraction of abundant primary materials. After oil, timber and manganese mining are the other major sectors. Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and [[uranium]] exports. Foreign and Gabonese observers have consistently lamented the lack of transformation of primary materials in the Gabonese economy. Various factors have so far stymied more diversification: a small market of 1 million people, dependence on French imports, inability to capitalize on regional markets, lack of entrepreneurial zeal among the Gabonese, and the fairly regular stream of oil \"rent\". The small processing and service sectors are largely dominated by just a few prominent local investors.\n\nIn 1992, Gabon failed to settle [[arrears]] on its [[bilateral trade|bilateral]] debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors. [[Devaluation]] of its [[CFA franc]] by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time [[inflation|inflationary surge]], to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] provided a one-year standby arrangement in 1994\u20131995 and a three-year [[Extended Fund Facility]] (EFF) at near-commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate progress in [[privatization]] and [[balanced budget|fiscal discipline]]. [[France]] provided additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items, over-borrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices in 1999 helped growth, but drops in production hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains.\n\n==Animal husbandry==\n[[Animal husbandry]] is limited by the presence of the [[tsetse fly]], though tsetse-resistant cattle have recently been imported from [[Senegal]] to a cattle project. In 2005 there were an estimated 212,000 [[pig|hogs]], 195,000 [[sheep]], 90,000 [[goat]]s, 35,000 head of cattle, and 3.1 million [[chicken]]s. In an effort to reduce Gabon\u2019s reliance on meat imports, the government set aside {{convert|200000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} in Gabon\u2019s unpopulated Savannah region for three ranches at [[Ngouni\u00e9 Province|Ngounie]], [[Nyanga Province|Nyanga]], and [[Lekabi]]. Currently, however, frozen imports are the most important source of beef, costing four times less than locally produced beef. Poultry production satisfies about one-half of Gabon\u2019s consumption demand. Typical annual production of poultry amounts to 3,600 tons.\n\n==Fishing==\nWhile there have been recent improvements in the fishing industry, it is still relatively undeveloped. Traditional fishing accounts for two-thirds of total catch. The waters off the Gabonese coast contain large quantities of fish. Gabonese waters are estimated to be able to support an annual catch of 15,000 tons of [[tuna]] and 12,000 tons of [[sardines]]. The fishing fleet was formerly based chiefly in Libreville. A new fishing port was built at [[Port-Gentil]] in 1979, which is now the center of operations for the industrial fleet. Plans for a cannery, fish-meal factory, and refrigerated storage facilities are underway. The total catch in 2003 was 44,855 tons, 80 percent from the Atlantic. By international agreement and Gabonese law, an exclusive economic zone extends {{convert|200|mi|km}} off the coast, which prohibits any foreign company to fish in this zone without governmental authorization. However, since Gabon has no patrol boats, foreign trawlers (especially French and Spanish) often illegally capture tuna in Gabonese waters.\n\n==Industry==\nGabon\u2019s industry is centered on [[petroleum]], [[manganese]] mining, and [[lumber|timber]] processing. Most industrial establishments are located near Libreville and Port-Gentil. Virtually all industrial enterprises were established with government subsidies in the oil boom years of the 1970s. Timber-related concerns include five veneer plants and a large 50-year-old plywood factory in Port-Gentil, along with two other small plywood factories. Other industries include [[textile]] plants, [[cement]] factories, chemical plants, [[brewery|breweries]], shipyards, and [[cigarette]] factories. Gabonese manufacturing is highly dependent on foreign inputs, and import costs rose significantly in 1994 when the [[CFA franc]] was devalued. Increased costs and oversized capacity have made the manufacturing sector less competitive and it mainly supplies the domestic market. The government has taken steps to privatize parastatal enterprises.\n\nBecause the Gabonese economy is dependent upon oil ([[petroleum|crude oil]] accounts for over 80% of the country\u2019s exports, 43% of GDP, and 65% of state revenue), it is subject to worldwide price fluctuations. Gabon is sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s third-largest crude oil producer and exporter, although there are concerns that proven reserves are declining and production has declined as well. Thus the country has taken steps to diversify the economy, and to engage in further petroleum exploration. The country produced {{convert|240000|oilbbl}} of oil per day in 2014, a decrease of 35% from the 1997 peak. Gabon\u2019s proven oil reserves were estimated at {{convert|2.0|Goilbbl}} in 2015, and its proven natural gas reserves were estimated at {{convert|1.0|e12cuft|km3}}.\n\nThe [[Sogara oil refinery]] at Port-Gentil is the sole refinery in Gabon, built in 1968 by a consortium that included Total, Shell, Mobil, Texaco, Petrofina and Agip.

The second stage, completed in December 1986, linked Boou\u00e9 with [[Franceville]] (357&nbsp;km) via [[Moanda]], thus facilitating exports of [[manganese]] from the southeast and forestry exploitation in the same region. A proposed third stage would continue the line from Boou\u00e9 to [[Belinga]] in the northeast, where there are [[iron ore]] deposits.\n\nIn 2003, the railway began the process of installing a satellite based telecommunications system.<ref>[http://www.cellular.co.za/news_2003/100503-gabon_telecom_selects_hughes_net.htm Railway telecom system 2003]</ref> As of 2004, Gabon State Railways totalled 814&nbsp;km of standard-gauge track.\n\n''total:'' 814&nbsp;km ([[Trans-Gabon Railway|Gabon State Railways]] or OCTRA)<br />''standard gauge:'' 814&nbsp;km 1.435-m gauge; single track (1994)\n\n=== Maps ===\n* [https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/gabon.pdf UN Map - shows line to Franceville]\n* [http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tbl=PUBL&id=441688290 UNHCR map - does not show line to Franceville]\n* [http://www.travelportal.info/go_frames.php?unid=10174&linkid=9179&newlanguage=english TravelPortal map - shows major rivers]\n* [http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Af.nsf/luFullMap/BC0EF176D6BCADE385256C0800474100/$File/wfp_safr_rails0702.pdf?OpenElement UNJLC Rail map of Southern Africa - does not show line to Franceville]\n\n=== Cities served by rail ===\n{{Main|Railway stations in Gabon}}\n\n; Existing\n* [[Libreville]] - capital\n* [[Owendo]] - port\n* [[Sahou\u00e9]] - port\n* [[Franceville]] - [[railhead]]\n* [[Ndjol\u00e9]]\n* [[Lop\u00e9]]\n* [[Boou\u00e9]] - likely junction for branchline to [[Makokou]]\n* [[Lastoursville]]\n* [[Moanda]]\n* [[Ntoum]] - proposed junction for iron ore traffic to [[Santa Clara, Gabon|Santa Clara]]\n* [[Kango]]\n* [[Four-Place]]\n* [[Mounana]] - ?\n\n;Proposed\n* [[Makokou]] - iron ore\n* [[Santa Clara, Gabon|Cape Santa Clara]] - proposed [[list of deep water ports|deep water port]] for [[Makokou]] iron ore.\n* [[B\u00e9linga]] - possible iron ore mine.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n* New rail line from Belinga will go 450&nbsp;km all the way to the coast, rather than to be a branch off an existing line.<ref>[http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3276107 Business Report - China given monopoly to work Gabon's untapped iron ore resources<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Pan-African issues<ref>[http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=1301 Railway Corridors in Africa to be Connected<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717104251/http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=1301 |date=2011-07-17 }}</ref>\n\n=== 2006 ===\n* China signs a deal for an iron ore mine with associated rail and port upgrades from [[Belinga]] to [[Santa Clara, Gabon|Santa Clara]] [http://chinaconfidential.blogspot.com/2006/06/high-iron-ore-prices-push-china-to_12.html]\n[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-162298942.html]\n\n== Road transport ==\nMain roads connect virtually all major communities, but maintenance work is difficult because of heavy rainfall. In 2002, the road network comprised 8,454&nbsp;km, of which 838&nbsp;km\nwere paved, including 30&nbsp;km of expressways. A north-south road runs the length of the country, from [[Bitam]] to [[Ndend\u00e9]]. This main north-south link continues into [[Cameroon]] in the north and the Congo in the south. An east\u2013west road connects Libreville and M\u00e9kambo. Farther south, another road runs from [[Mayumba]] to [[Lastoursville]] and Franceville. In 1995 there were about 23,000 automobiles and 10,000 commercial vehicles in use.\n\n''total:''\n7,670&nbsp;km\n<br />''paved:''\n629&nbsp;km (including 30&nbsp;km of expressways)\n<br />''unpaved:''\n7,041&nbsp;km (1996 est.)\n\nRoads in Gabon link most areas of the country, and many of the main roads are of a reasonable standard.  However, remoter areas along the coast and in the east are often not connected to the road network.  Major roads are denoted national routes and numbered, with a prefix \"N\" (sometimes \"RN\"):\n\n*[[N1 road (Gabon)|N1 road]]: [[Libreville]] \u2013 [[Kougouleu]] \u2013 [[Bifoun]] \u2013 [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]] \u2013 [[Mouila]] \u2013 [[Ndend\u00e9]] \u2013 [[Tchibanga]] - ([[Republic of Congo]])\n*[[N2 road (Gabon)|N2 road]]: [[Bifoun]] \u2013 [[Alembe]] \u2013 [[Viate]] \u2013 [[Mitzic]] \u2013 [[Bibasse]] \u2013 [[Oyem]] \u2013 [[Bitam]] \u2013 [[\u00c9boro]] \u2013 ([[Cameroon]])\n*[[N3 road (Gabon)|N3 road]]: [[Alembe]] \u2013 [[Kazamabika]] \u2013 [[Lastoursville]] \u2013 [[Moanda]] \u2013 [[Franceville]]\n*[[N4 road (Gabon)|N4 road]]: [[Viate]] \u2013 [[Ekonlong]] \u2013 [[Makokou]] \u2013 [[M\u00e9kambo]]\n*[[N5 road (Gabon)|N5 road]]: [[Kougouleu]] \u2013 [[Bibasse]]\n*[[N6 road (Gabon)|N6 road]]: [[Mayumba]] \u2013 [[Tchibanga]] \u2013 [[Ndend\u00e9]] \u2013 [[Lebamba]] - [[Koulamoutou]] \u2013 [[Lastoursville]]\n*[[N7 road (Gabon)|N7 road]]: [[Makokou]] \u2013 [[Bakwaka]] \u2013 [[Okondja]] \u2013 [[L\u00e9kori]] - [[Aki\u00e9ni]] \u2013 [[Ngouoni]] \u2013 [[Franceville]]\n\n==Water transport==\n=== Seaports and harbours ===\nThe busiest ports are [[Port-Gentil]], the center for exports of petroleum products and imports of mining equipment, and [[Owendo]], a new port that opened in 1974 on the [[Ogoou\u00e9 estuary]], 10&nbsp;km north of Libreville. Owendo's capacity, initially 300,000 tons, reached 1.5 million tons in 1979, when the port was enlarged to include timber-handling facilities. The smaller port at Mayumba also handles timber, and a deepwater port is planned for the city.\n\n=== Merchant marine ===\nIn 1998, Gabon's merchant marine owned two vessels totalling {{GRT|13613|link=off}}. As of 2002, there was one merchant marine vessel, with a volume of {{GRT|2,419}}/{{DWT|3,205|metric|disp=long}}.\n\n===Waterways===\nGabon has 1,600&nbsp;km of perennially navigable waterways, including 310&nbsp;km on the [[Ogoou\u00e9 River]].\n\n==Air transport==\nGabon had an estimated 56 airports in 2004, but only 11 of which had paved runways as of 2005. There are three international airports: [[Libreville International Airport|Libreville]], [[Port-Gentil International Airport|Port-Gentil]], and [[M'Vengue El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba International Airport|Franceville]]. Numerous airlines provide international flights. [[Nouvelle Air Affaires Gabon]] handles scheduled domestic service.

Since 1973, the number of countries establishing diplomatic relations with Gabon has doubled. In inter-[[Africa]]n affairs, Gabon espouses development by evolution rather than revolution and favors regulated free enterprise as the system most likely to promote rapid economic growth. Concerned about stability in Central Africa and the potential for intervention, Gabon has been directly involved with mediation efforts in [[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Angola]], and former [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]]. In December 1999, through the mediation efforts of President [[Omar Bongo|Bongo]], a peace accord was signed in the Republic of Congo between the government and most leaders of an armed rebellion. President Bongo has remained involved in the continuing Congolese peace process. Gabon has been a strong proponent of regional stability, and Gabonese armed forces played an important role in the [[United Nations|UN]] Peacekeeping Mission to the Central African Republic ([[MINURCA]]).\n\nGabon is a member of the UN and some of its specialized and related agencies, including the [[World Bank]]; [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU); [[Central African Customs Union]] (UDEAC/CEMAC); EC association under [[Lome Convention]]; [[Communaute Financiere Africaine]] (CFA); [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC); [[Non-Aligned Movement]]; withdrew from the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC).\n\nGabon is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\n== Bilateral relations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Armenia}}||<!--Date started-->9 March 1994||\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 9 March 1994.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Canada}}||<!--Date started-->1963||\n\nCanada established diplomatic relations with Gabon in 1963.\n* Gabon has an embassy in [[Ottawa]]. \n* Canada is accredited to Gabon from its embassy in [[Yaound\u00e9]], [[Cameroon]] and maintains an honorary consulate in [[Libreville]].<ref>[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/cameroon-cameroun/index.aspx?lang=eng Embassy of Canada in Cameroon]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|China}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[China-Gabon relations]]\n\nOn April 20 1974, China established diplomatic relations with Gabon.<ref>http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/focac/183529.htm</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Equatorial Guinea}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\nGabon is involved in a [[maritime boundary]] dispute with [[Equatorial Guinea]] because of disputed sovereignty over islands in Corisco Bay.{{Cn|date=April 2009}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|France}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[France-Gabon relations]]\n\nSince independence, Gabon has been \"one of France's closest allies in Africa\".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssEnergyNews/idUSL0493323920080304 Gabon threatens France with tit-for-tat deportation] by Antoine Lawson, [[Reuters]], 4 March 2008</ref> As of 2008, around 10,000 French nationals lived and worked in Gabon, while the 6th Marine Infantry Battalion of the [[Structure of the French Army#Units permanently deployed overseas|French military]] is also stationed there.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|India}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Gabon\u2013India relations]]\n\n* India has an honorary consulate in [[Libreville]].<ref>[http://mea.gov.in/indian-mission.htm?75/75/0 Indian Honorary Consulate in Gabon]</ref>\n* Gabon maintains an embassy in [[New Delhi]].<ref>[http://www.gabonembassynewdelhi.com/ Gabon Embassy in India]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Republic of Korea}}||<!--Date started-->November 1980||\n\nDiplomatic relations between the [[Republic of Korea|ROK]] and Gabon began in November 1980.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Mexico}}||<!--Date started-->March 1976||\n\n* Gabon is accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.<ref>[http://www.gabonembassyusa.org Embassy of Gabon in the United States]</ref>\n* Mexico is accredited to Gabon from its embassy in [[Abuja]], [[Nigeria]].<ref>[https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/nigeria/index.php/es/ Embassy of Mexico in Nigeria]</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Saint Kitts and Nevis}}||<!--Date started-->January 2018||\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations in January 2018<ref>[http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/death-penalty/st-kitts-nevis-republic-gabonese-establish-diplomatic-relations/]</ref>. \n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United States}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Gabon-United States relations]]\n[[File:Embassy of Gabon in the United States.JPG|thumb|right|Embassy of Gabon in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\n\n\nRelations between the United States and Gabon are excellent. In 1987, President [[Omar Bongo]] made an official visit to Washington, DC.  In September 2002, Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] made a brief but historic visit to Gabon to highlight [[environmental protection]] and conservation in the Central Africa region. This was followed by a visit to the White House by President Bongo in May 2004. The United States imports a considerable percentage of Gabonese [[crude oil]] and [[manganese]], and exports heavy construction equipment, [[aircraft]], and machinery to Gabon. Through a modest International Military Education and Training program, the United States provides military training to members of the Gabonese armed forces each year. Other bilateral assistance includes the funding of small grants for qualified [[democracy]] and [[human right]]s, self-help, and cultural preservation projects. U.S. private capital has been attracted to Gabon since before its independence.\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Gabon]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Gabon]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Africa in topic|Foreign relations of}}\n{{Foreign relations of Gabon}}\n{{Gabon topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foreign Relations Of Gabon}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Gabon]]\n[[Category:Politics of Gabon]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Gabon| ]]", "sha1": "5p4s9yj6tihidxdqy9ggv4l53e9uhvm"}}, {"title": "Gaza Strip", "ns": "0", "id": "12047", "revision": {"id": "866535433", "parentid": "866525175", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T22:56:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Reenem", "id": "7471214"}, "comment": "/* Occupation */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{split|Hamas-ruled Gaza|discuss=talk:Gaza Strip#Split|date=October 2018}}\n{{about|the territory|the city|Gaza City|the government|Gaza Governorate|the 2002 film|Gaza Strip (film)|the favela in Rio de Janeiro known as the Gaza Strip|Complexo do Alem\u00e3o}}\n{{pp-30-500|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Gaza Strip\n|native_name ={{nobold|{{lang|ar|\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u063a\u0632\u0629}}}}<br>''{{Transl|ar|DIN|Qi\u1e6d\u0101\u02bf \u0120azzah}}''\n|linking_name = the Gaza Strip\n|status =  \n*Under the [[Palestinian Authority]] according to the [[Oslo Accords]]<ref name=nyt_mideast-accord>[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/world/mideast-accord-overview-rabin-arafat-sign-accord-ending-israel-s-27-year-hold.html?pagewanted=all \"Mideast accord: the overview; Rabin and Arafat sign accord ending Israel's 27-year hold on Jericho and the Gaza Strip\"].

He consistently refused to  accept the Palestinian unity government brokered by the Saudi government in the Mecca Agreement \"and made his opposition intolerable to Hamas when he refused to subject the security forces under his command, armed and trained by the U.S., to the legitimate Palestinian unity government as agreed between Hamas and Fatah.\"  Alistair Crooke, a former Middle East adviser to the EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, similarly observed, \"Dahlan refused to deal with (the independent interior minister appointed to the  unity government), and put his troops on the streets in defiance of the interior minister. Hamas felt that they had little option but to take control of security away from forces which were in fact creating insecurity.\" Hence, Hamas was not attempting a coup against the government or the Fatah organization as a whole but also against Dahlan's U.S.-funded militia (and individual Fatah loyalists it blamed for the murder of Hamas members).'</ref> and has remained the sole governing power in Gaza since that date.<ref name=\"Deeb\" />\n\n[[File:Gaza closure December 2012.jpg|thumb|Gaza Strip, with Israeli-controlled borders and limited fishing zone]]\n[[File:Gaza City.JPG|thumb|[[Gaza City]] skyline, 2007]]\n[[File:\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0639 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0632\u0629.jpg|thumb|Downtown Gaza, 2012]]\n[[File:20140805 beit hanun7.jpg|thumb|Beit Hanoun region of Gaza, August 2014, after Israeli bombardments]]\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Gaza}}\n\n===Rule over Gaza, overview===\n\nGaza was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], before it was occupied by the United Kingdom (1918\u20131948), Egypt (1948\u20131967), and then Israel, which in 1994 granted the [[Palestinian Authority]] in Gaza limited self-governance through the [[Oslo Accords]].

The [[Philistines]], mentioned frequently in [[The Bible]], were located in the region, and the city was captured by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE during his Egyptian campaign.  Following the death of Alexander, Gaza, along with Egypt, fell under the administration of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], before passing to the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]] after about 200 BCE.  The city of Gaza was destroyed by the [[Hasmonean]] king [[Alexander Jannaeus]] in 96 BCE, and re-established under Roman administration during the 1st century CE.  The Gaza region was moved between different Roman provinces over time, from [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] to [[Syria Palaestina]] to [[Palaestina Prima]].  During the 7th century the territory was passed back and forth between the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) Empire and the Persian ([[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]) Empires before the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] was established during the great Islamic expansions of the 7th century.\n\nDuring the [[Crusades]], the city of Gaza was reported to be mostly abandoned and in ruins; the region was placed under the direct administration of the [[Knights Templar]] during the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; it was traded back and forth several times between Christian and Muslim rule during the 12th century, before the Crusaders were driven out permanently and the land became part of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]]'s lands for a century until the [[Mongol]] ruler [[Hulagu Khan]] destroyed the city.  In the wake of the Mongols, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] established control over Egypt and the eastern Levant, and would control Gaza until the 16th century, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] absorbed the Mamluk territories.  Ottoman rule continued until the years following [[World War I]], when the [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire collapsed]] and the [[League of Nations]] placed Gaza under the British [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]].\n\n===1923\u201348 British Mandate===\n[[File:Gaza War Cemetery 3.jpg|thumb|[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Gaza War Cemetery]]]]\nThe [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] was based on the principles contained in Article 22 of the draft [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] and the [[San Remo conference|San Remo Resolution]] of 25 April 1920 by the principal [[Allies of World War I|Allied and associated powers]] after the First World War.<ref name=cmd5479>[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/88A6BF6F1BD82405852574CD006C457F Palestine Royal Commission Report Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty, July 1937, Cmd. 5479] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127035141/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/88A6BF6F1BD82405852574CD006C457F |date=27 January 2012 }}.

Gaza's agricultural sector was adversely affected as one-third of the Strip was appropriated by Israel, competition for scarce water resources stiffened, and the lucrative cultivation of citrus declined with the advent of Israeli policies, such as prohibitions on planting new trees and taxation that gave breaks to Israeli producers, factors which militated against growth. Gaza's direct exports of these products to Western markets, as opposed to Arab markets, was prohibited except through Israeli marketing vehicles, in order to assist Israeli citrus exports to the same markets. The overall result was that large numbers of farmers were forced out of the agricultural sector. Israel places quotas on all goods exported from Gaza, while abolishing restrictions on the flow of Israeli goods into the Strip.

The Egyptians agreed to keep the Sinai Peninsula demilitarized. The final status of the Gaza Strip, and other relations between Israel and Palestinians, was not dealt with in the treaty. Egypt renounced all territorial claims to territory north of the international border. The Gaza Strip remained under Israeli military administration until 1994.

Even though the majority argues that the Gaza Strip is still occupied, the effective control test at the core of the law of occupation is no longer met and hence Gaza is no longer occupied.\" She disagrees that Israel cannot therefore be held responsible for the situation in Gaza because: \"Nonetheless Israel continues to exercise an important level of control over the Gaza Strip and its population, making it difficult to accept that it would no longer have any obligations with regard to the Strip. ... the absence of occupation does not mean the absence of accountability. This responsibility is however not founded on the law of occupation but on general international humanitarian law, potentially complemented by international human rights law\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cuyckens |first=Hanne|year=2016|title=Is Israel Still an Occupying Power in Gaza? |journal=Netherlands International Law Review |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=275\u2013295 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40802-016-0070-1 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Avi Bell]] argues that Israel does not control the Gaza Strip for the purposes of the law of belligerent occupation or human rights duties - \"The Naletilic decision of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia recited several factors indicating an occupier\u2019s effective control, including that the local authorities must be incapable of functioning publicly, the occupier must have force present on the ground (or at least capable of being projected in a reasonable time to make authority felt) and the occupier must enforce directions to the civilian population. Similarly, as the Nuremberg Tribunal ruled in the case of Wilhelm List and others (the Hostages Case), \u201can occupation indicates the exercise of governmental authority to the exclusion of the established government,\u201d meaning that the local \u201ccivil government [should be] eliminated.\u201d These factors demonstrate that Israel does not have control over Gaza. There is a local independent administration in the Gaza Strip that does not answer to Israel (and in fact, openly and repeatedly carries out belligerent attacks against Israel). Israel does not have troops regularly deployed in Gaza, and it can only deploy such troops through heavy and difficult fighting. The local civilian population does not answer to Israel. Israel has no local administration... It is simply not plausible to argue that Israel exercises effective control over the Gaza Strip.\"<ref>https://euiha41fnsb2lyeld3vkc37i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/israel-may-stop-supplying-water-and-electricity-to-Gaza-updated.pdf</ref>\n\nLikewise, [[Alex Stein]] argued in 2014 that Gaza was not occupied by Israel, and thus Israel's only obligation under international law towards Gaza was to minimize harm to civilians during military operations. In particular, he wrote that Israel was under no legal obligation to provide it with electricity, though it may choose to do so for humanitarian reasons.<ref>https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/newly-appointed-israeli-supreme-court-justice-rapped-high-court-1.5863689</ref> [[Yuval Shany]] also argues that Israel is probably not an occupying power in Gaza under international law, writing that \"it is difficult to continue and regard Israel as the occupying power in Gaza under the traditional law of occupation,\" but that some legal theories might downplay the significance of the lack of an Israeli presence on the ground, and that Israel still continues to exercise some control over Gaza in parallel with the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]. Shany wrote that \"in order to identify the ultimate power of government in Gaza one should engage in a comparative analysis of the degree of effective control exercised by the two competing sources of authority.\"<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=923151</ref>\n\n===Statehood===\n\nSome analysts have argued that the Gaza Strip can be considered a ''[[de facto]]'' state, even if not internationally recognized as such. Israeli Major General [[Giora Eiland]], who headed Israel's [[National Security Council (Israel)|National Security Council]], has argued that after the disengagement, the Gaza Strip became a de facto state for all intents and purposes, writing that \"It has clear borders, an effective government, an independent foreign policy and an army.

It has a central government with an army that\u2019s subordinate to it and that protects a population living in a defined territory. Nevertheless, Gaza is a castrated state. Israel and Egypt control its borders. The Palestinian Authority pays for the salaries of some of its civil servants. And the army doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on armed force, because there are independent militias operating alongside it.\"<ref>https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-strengthen-the-state-of-gaza-1.6358839</ref> [[Moshe Arens]], a former Israeli diplomat who served as Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, likewise wrote that Gaza is a state as \"it has a government, an army, a police force and courts that dispense justice of sorts.\"<ref>https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-gaza-a-failed-palestinian-state-1.5488422</ref>\n\n[[Geoffrey Aronson]] has likewise argued that the Gaza Strip can be considered a [[proto-state]] with some aspects of sovereignty, writing that \"a proto-state already exists in the Gaza Strip, with objective attributes of sovereignty the Ramallah-based Mahmoud Abbas can only dream about. Gaza is a single, contiguous territory with de facto borders, recognised, if not always respected, by friend and foe alike. There are no permanently stationed foreign occupiers and, most importantly, no civilian Israeli settlements.\"<ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/05/era-sovereignty-gaza-150504054233875.html</ref>\n\n===Control over airspace===\nAs agreed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the [[Oslo Accords]], Israel has exclusive control over the airspace. It can interfere with radio and TV transmissions, and the Palestinian Authority cannot engage in independent initiatives for operating a seaport or airport.<ref>[http://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/control_on_air_space_and_territorial_waters 'Israel's control of the airspace and the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip,'  ]  [[B'Tselem]] 1 January 2013.</ref> The Accords also permitted Palestinians to construct an airport, which was duly built and opened in 1998.

This downturn was attributed to Israeli closure policies and, to a lesser extent, corruption and mismanagement by [[Yasser Arafat]]. Economic development has been hindered by Israel refusing to allow the operation of a sea harbour. A [[Gaza Seaport plans|seaport]] was planned to be built in Gaza with help from France and The Netherlands, but the project was bombed by Israel in 2001. Israel said that the reason for bombing was that Israeli settlements were being shot at from the construction site at the harbour. As a result, international transports (both trade and aid) had to go through Israel, which was hindered by the imposition of generalized border closures. These also disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships between Israel and the Strip. A serious negative social effect of this downturn was the emergence of high unemployment.\n\nFor its energy, Gaza is largely dependent on Israel either for import of electricity or fuel for its sole power plant. The [[Oslo Accords]] set limits for the Palestinian production and importation of energy.

In 1998, Israel implemented new policies to ease security procedures and allow somewhat freer movement of Gazan goods and labor into Israel. These changes led to three years of economic recovery in the Gaza Strip, disrupted by the outbreak of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] in the last quarter of 2000.

Conversely, numerous sources place Georgia in Europe such as the [[BBC]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1102477.stm], ''Oxford Reference Online'' [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t186.e21064&srn=1&ssid=416740626#FIRSTHIT], ''[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Georgia Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]'', and [http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/eu.htm www.worldatlas.com].</ref> it is bounded to the west by the [[Black Sea]], to the north by [[Russia]], to the south by [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]], and to the east by [[Azerbaijan]].  Georgia covers an area of {{convert|69,700|km2|sqmi}}.\n\n== Location ==\n\nGeorgia is located in the mountainous [[South Caucasus]] region of [[Eurasia]], straddling [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]<ref name=Eurasia /> between the Black Sea and the [[Caspian Sea]].  Georgia's northern border with [[Russia]] roughly runs along the crest of the [[Greater Caucasus]] mountain range \u2013 a commonly reckoned boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].  In [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]]'s 1730 definition of Europe, which was used by the Russian Tsars and which first set the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] as the eastern border of the continent, the continental border was drawn from the [[Kuma-Manych Depression]] to the Caspian Sea, thereby including all of Georgia (and the whole of the Caucasus) in Asia.\n\nGeorgia's proximity to the bulk of Europe, combined with various cultural and political factors, has led increasingly to the inclusion of Georgia in Europe.  Some sources place the country in that region;<ref name=Eurasia /> as well, Georgia has joined European organizations such as the [[Council of Europe]], and is seeking membership in [[Georgia\u2013NATO relations|NATO]] and accession to the [[Georgia and the European Union|European Union]].\nGeorgia is on the same parallel as Naples, Madrid, Istanbul, New York, Chicago, London, Toronto (Canada), Omaha (USA), Eureka (USA), Odate (Japan), Shenyang (China) and Tirana.\n\n==Topography==\n[[Image:Georgia Topography.png|left|thumb|Topography]]\n[[Image:Satellite image of Georgia in May 2003.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite image of Georgia in late spring]]\nDespite its small area, Georgia has one of the most varied topographies of the former Soviet republics. Georgia lies mostly in the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and its northern boundary is partly defined by the Greater Caucasus range. The Lesser Caucasus range, which runs parallel to the Turkish and Armenian borders, and the Surami and Imereti ranges, which connect the Greater Caucasus and the Lesser Caucasus, create natural barriers that are partly responsible for cultural and linguistic differences among regions. Because of their elevation and a poorly developed transportation infrastructure, many mountain villages are virtually isolated from the outside world during the winter. [[Earthquake]]s and [[landslide]]s in mountainous areas present a significant threat to life and property. Among the most recent natural disasters were massive rock- and mudslides in Ajaria in 1989 that displaced thousands in southwestern Georgia, and two earthquakes in 1991 that destroyed several villages in northcentral Georgia and South Ossetia.\n\nGeorgia has about 25,000 rivers, many of which power small [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] stations. Drainage is into the Black Sea to the west and through Azerbaijan to the Caspian Sea to the east. The largest river is the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]], which flows 1,364&nbsp;km from northeast Turkey across the plains of eastern Georgia, through the capital, Tbilisi, and into the Caspian Sea. The [[Rioni River]], the largest river in western Georgia, rises in the Greater Caucasus and empties into the Black Sea at the port of [[Poti]]. Soviet engineers turned the river lowlands along the Black Sea coast into prime subtropical agricultural land, embanked and straightened many stretches of river, and built an extensive system of canals. Deep mountain gorges form topographical belts within the Greater Caucasus.\n\n==Coastline==\n[[File:Svaneti, georgia.jpg|thumb|[[Svaneti]] region, northwestern Georgia]]\n[[File:Black Sea coast of Georgia (country), with skyline of Batumi on the horizon.jpg|thumb|[[Black Sea]] coast of western Georgia, with the skyline of [[Batumi]] on the horizon.]]\nThe coastline of Georgia is 310&nbsp;km long.

The Greater Caucasus range moderates local climate by serving as a barrier against cold air from the north. Warm, moist air from the Black Sea moves easily into the coastal lowlands from the west. Climatic zones are determined by distance from the Black Sea and by altitude. Along the Black Sea coast, from Abkhazia to the Turkish border, and in the region known as the [[Colchis|Kolkhida Lowlands]] inland from the coast, the dominant subtropical climate features high humidity and heavy precipitation ({{convert|1000|to|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year; the Black Sea port of Batumi receives {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year). Several varieties of [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] grow in these regions, where the midwinter average temperature is {{convert|5|\u00b0C|lk=on}} and the midsummer average is {{convert|22|\u00b0C|1}}.\n\nThe plains of eastern Georgia are shielded from the influence of the Black Sea by mountains that provide a more [[continental climate]]. Summer temperatures average {{convert|20|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1}}, winter temperatures {{convert|2|\u00b0C|1}} to {{convert|4|\u00b0C|1}}. Humidity is lower, and rainfall averages {{convert|500|to|800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] and [[highland (geography)|highland]] regions in the east and west, as well as a [[semi-arid]] region on the [[Iori Plateau]] to the southeast, have distinct microclimates.\n\nAt higher elevations, precipitation is sometimes twice as heavy as in the eastern plains. In the west, the climate is subtropical to about {{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; above that altitude (and to the north and east) is a band of moist and moderately warm weather, then a band of cool and wet conditions. Alpine conditions begin at about {{convert|2100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and above {{convert|3600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} snow and ice are present year-round.\n\n==Environmental issues==\n{{main|Environmental issues in Georgia}}\nBeginning in the 1980s, Black Sea pollution has greatly harmed Georgia's tourist industry. Inadequate sewage treatment is the main cause of that condition. In Batumi, for example, only 18 percent of wastewater is treated before release into the sea.{{when|date=September 2016}} An estimated 70 percent of surface water contains health-endangering bacteria to which Georgia's high rate of intestinal disease is attributed.\n\nThe war in Abkhazia did substantial damage to the ecological habitats unique to that region. In other respects, experts considered Georgia's environmental problems less serious than those of more industrialized former Soviet republics. Solving Georgia's environmental problems was not a high priority of the national government in the post-Soviet years, however; in 1993 the minister for protection of the environment resigned to protest this inactivity. In January 1994, the Cabinet of Ministers announced a new, interdepartmental environmental monitoring system to centralize separate programs under the direction of the Ministry of Protection of the Environment. The system would include a central environmental and information and research agency. The [[Green Party (Georgia)|Green Party]] used its small contingent in the parliament to press environmental issues in 1993.\n\nGeorgia participates in a number of international environmental agreements. It is a party to: [[Air Pollution]], [[Biodiversity]], [[Climate Change]], Climate Change-[[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, [[Law of the Sea]], Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, and Wetlands.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glaciers of Georgia]]\n*[[List of earthquakes in Georgia (country)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2437 \"General Map of Georgia.

Georgia, according to the 2014 census 86.8% of the population. The proportion in 2014 was much higher than in preceding censuses as in 2014 (most parts of) [[Abkhazia]] and (most parts of) [[South Ossetia]] were not under government control and therefore not included. As a result of this the proportion of [[Ossetians]] and [[Abkhazians]] was very low (0.4% and 0.3%, respectively).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n'''Population of Georgia according to ethnic group 1926\u20132014'''\n|-bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ethnic<br />group\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 1926<sup>1</sup>\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 1939<sup>2</sup>\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 1959<sup>3</sup>\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 1970<sup>4</sup>\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 1979<sup>5</sup>\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 1989<sup>6</sup>\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 2002<sup>6</sup>\n! colspan=\"2\" | census 2014<sup>7</sup>\n|-bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

From 2004 to 2012, political power was concentrated in the hands of the president, under a president-parliamentary variant of semi-presidentialism. Only during the period of cohabitation from 2012 to 2013 was the president's authority challenged. In 2010, the Constitution was amended with effect from 2013, reducing the power of the president considerably, arguably in an attempt by term-limited President Saakashvili to secure a political comeback as a powerful prime minister. Under the new premier-presidential Constitution, powers have been much more evenly distributed with each branch of government exercising its Constitutional powers. |postscript=. |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Rose Revolution]] of 2003, the [[National Movement \u2013 Democrats]] dominated the party system. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] became a [[democratic republic]] following the first [[multi-party system|multiparty]], democratic [[parliament]]ary elections of October 28, 1990. The Georgian state is highly centralized, except for the [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] regions of [[Abkhazia]] and [[Adjara]] and the former autonomous region of [[South Ossetia]]. Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which had autonomy within the [[Georgian SSR]] during [[Soviet Union|Soviet rule]], unilaterally seceded from Georgia in the 1990s. While, {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}, the Georgian government recognizes Abkhazia as autonomous within Georgia, it does not recognize South Ossetia as having any special status.\n\nConsideration of replacing Georgia's republic with some form of [[Monarchism in Georgia|constitutional monarchy]] has become part of Georgian political debate since the [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Georgian Orthodox primate]] and other [[leader|leading]] Georgians suggested the idea in 2007.<ref name=\"GeorgiaToday\">Zaza Jgharkava (October 18, 2007).

EurasiaNet Civil Society.</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\n{{further|History of Georgia (country)#Saakashvili presidency (2004)}}\n{{Recentism|section|date=October 2008}}\n\nFollowing a crisis involving allegations of ballot fraud in the 2003 parliamentary elections, [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] resigned as president on November 23, 2003, in the bloodless [[Rose Revolution]]. The interim president was the speaker of the outgoing parliament (whose replacement was annulled), [[Nino Burjanadze]]. On January 4, 2004 [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], leader of the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] won the country's [[Georgian presidential election, 2004|presidential election]] and was inaugurated on January 25.\n\nFresh parliamentary elections were held on March 28, 2004, where the United National Movement's parliamentary faction, the [[National Movement - Democrats]] (NMD), secured the vast majority of the seats (with ca. 75% of the votes).  Only one other party reached the 7% threshold: the [[Rightist Opposition]] with ca. 7.5%. The vote is believed to have been one of the freest ever held in independent Georgia although an upsurge of tension between the central government and the [[Ajaria]]n leader [[Aslan Abashidze]] affected the elections in this region. Despite recognizing progress the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] noted the tendency to misuse state administration resources in favor of the ruling party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78813.htm |title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Georgia |website=State.gov |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}</ref>\n\nTensions between Georgia and separatist authorities in Ajaria increased after the elections, climaxing on May 1, 2004 when Abashidze responded to military maneuvers held by Georgia near the region by having the three bridges connecting Ajaria and the rest of Georgia over the [[Choloki River]] blown up. On May 5, Abashidze was forced to flee Georgia as mass demonstrations in [[Batumi]] called for his resignation and [[Russia]] increased their pressure by deploying Security Council secretary [[Igor Ivanov]]<!-- Can someone explain to me, what this sentence is supposed to mean? Russia increased pressure on who???-->.\n\nOn February 3, 2005, Prime Minister [[Zurab Zhvania]] died of [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning in an apparent gas leak at the home of [[Raul Usupov]], deputy governor of [[Kvemo Kartli]] region. Later, Zhvania's close friend and a long-time ally, Finance Minister [[Zurab Nogaideli]] was appointed for the post by President Saakashvili.\n\n[[Image:Mosque in Tbilisi.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Old Tbilisi]] showing a [[mosque]] and [[minaret]] in the background]]\n\nUnder the Saakasvili administration Georgia has achieved considerable progress in eradicating corruption. In 2008 [[Transparency International]] ranked Georgia [[List of countries by Corruption Perceptions Index|67]]th in its [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], with a score of 3.9 points out of 10 possible.<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table Corruption Perceptions Index 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311002755/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table |date=2009-03-11 }}. [[Transparency International]]. Accessed on September 23, 2008</ref> This represents the best result among the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries and a dramatic improvement on Georgia's score in 2004, when the country was ranked 133rd with 2.0 points.<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2004 Corruption Perceptions Index 2004]. [[Transparency International]]. Accessed on September 23, 2008</ref>\n\nIn January 2006 a new party, [[Georgia's Way]], was created. The movement is led by former Foreign Minister [[Salome Zourabichvili]], and appears to be relatively popular. An opinion poll conducted by the Georgian weekly Kviris Palitra and published on April 10, 2006 suggested that Salome Zourabichvili would garner 23.1% of votes if a presidential election were held today. President Saakashvili ranked first with 33% - an all-time low for the Georgian President - whilst no other individual managed to surpass double-digit levels of support. Georgia's Way has said it intends to have candidates for all the seats in Georgia's upcoming local elections, with Zourabichvili hoping to become Tbilisi Mayor.\n\nOn November 7, 2007, during a period of [[2007 Georgian demonstrations|mass protests]], President Saakashvili declared Tbilisi to be in a [[state of emergency]]. There were massive demonstrations and protests by the civil [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]], demanding the resignation of President Saakashvili. The Georgian police used [[teargas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], water cannons and high tech [[acoustic weapon]]s in the streets of Tbilisi. Later that day, the President declared a state of emergency in the whole country of Georgia. The Russian government denied accusations of being involved or of interfering in the situation. President Saakashvili rejected all demands that he resign his position, but announced early presidential elections to be held in January 2008, effectively cutting his term in office by a year.\n\nOn November 16, 2007, [[Prime Minister of Georgia]] [[Zurab Noghaideli]] announced his resignation due to poor health conditions. Noghaideli underwent heart operation in April 2007 at [[St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital]] in [[Houston, Texas]], which was led by the leading U.S. surgeon Dr. Charles Frazier.\n\nPresident Saakashvili invited [[Lado Gurgenidze|Vladimer (\"Lado\") Gurgenidze]], [[MBA]] holder from [[Emory University]], [[United States]] and former [[business executive]], to succeed Noghaideli on the position of the PM on the same day. Gurgenidze was formally approved on the position and granted the [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] of the [[Parliament of Georgia]] on November 22, 2007. Gurgenidze implemented only two changes in the [[Cabinet of Georgia]] so far, replacing [[Alexandre Lomaia]], the former Minister for Education and Science and new Secretary of [[National Security Council of Georgia|National Security Council]] with Maia Miminoshvili, former Head of the National Assessment and Examination Centre (NAEC).  Prime Minister also invited [[Koba Subeliani]], former Head of Municipal Accomplishment Service to succeed Giorgi Kheviashvili, former [[Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees of Georgia|Minister for Refugees and Accommodation]]. New Prime Minister and two Ministers Koba Subeliani and Maia Miminoshvili were approved on their positions on November 22, 2007 by a [[confidence vote]] of the [[Parliament of Georgia]].\n\n[[Mikheil Saakashvili]] resigned from the position of the [[President of Georgia|President]] on November 25, 2007 as the [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]] requires the president stands down at least 45 days before the next election to be eligible for retaking part him/herself. The [[Speaker of the Parliament of Georgia]] Mrs. [[Nino Burjanadze]] took over the position until the results were announced on January 5, 2008.\n\nTwenty-two people registered for the presidential elections, including the most recent president Mikheil Saakashvili, approved candidate of the united opposition [[Levan Gachechiladze]], influential businessman [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]], Leader of the New Right Party [[David Gamkrelidze]], the Leader of the [[Georgian Labour Party]] [[Shalva Natelashvili]], the Leader of [[Hope Party]] [[Irina Sarishvili-Chanturia]] and Giorgi Maisashvili.\n\n==Monarchist option==\nDebate on the possible installation of a [[Monarchism in Georgia|constitutional monarchy]] in Georgia was revitalized following the 7 October 2007 sermon of [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Catholicos-Patriarch]] [[Ilia II]], the popular head of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. The patriarch said, during his Sunday service at the [[Tbilisi Sameba Cathedral|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]], that restoration of the [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bragrationi royal family]] was a \"desirable dream of the Georgian people\". He also emphasized that if the people of Georgia chose this model of governance, \"a candidate to the crown should be selected among representatives of the royal dynasty, and he should be suitably raised to be king from childhood.\"<ref name=\"GeorgiaToday\"/><ref name=\"Lomsadze\"/>\n\nCompetition arose among the old [[dynasty]]'s princes and supporters, as historians and [[jurisprudence|jurists]] debated which Bagrationi has the strongest hereditary right to a throne that has been vacant for two centuries.<ref name = misha>{{cite magazine|last = Vignanski|first = Misha|date =2009-02-08|title = Primera boda real en dos siglos reagrupa dos ramas de la dinast\u00eda Bagration|periodical = El Confidencial|location=Spain|url = http://www.elconfidencial.com/cache/2009/02/08/93_primera_siglos_reagrupa_ramas_dinastia_bagration.html#|accessdate =2009-02-09}}</ref> Although some [[Monarchism in Georgia|Georgian monarchists]] support the Gruzinsky branch's claim, others support that of the [[repatriation|re-patriated]] Mukhrani branch.

The government aims at [[European Union|EU]]  and [[NATO]] membership, and has created a Ministry for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, which was dissolved on 22 December 2017 after passing [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|constitutional amendments]] by [[Georgian Parliament]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721025918/http://eu-integration.gov.ge/index.php?que=eng%2FO_S_M%2FACTIVITIES]</ref> Within NATO, Georgia is currently in [[Intensified Dialogue]]; [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Georgia|membership in the EU]] is a more distant project.\n\nOn 5 January 2008 alongside [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|Georgian presidential elections]] was held non-binding referendum on joining [[NATO]]. 77% of total number of voters supported integration of Georgia into NATO.\n\n==Political conditions==\nThe Abkhaz separatist dispute absorbs much of the government's attention. While a [[cease-fire]] is in effect about 250,000 [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs) who were driven from their homes during the conflict, constitute a vocal [[Lobbying|lobby]]. The government has offered the region considerable autonomy to encourage a settlement that would allow the IDPs (mainly ethnic Georgians from the [[Gali District, Abkhazia|Gali]] district{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}) to return home, however the Abkhaz side refused to accept it.\n\nCurrently, [[Russia]]n [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110520230050/https://unp.un.org/details.aspx?entry=E03020&title=Regional+Peacekeepers:+The+Paradox+of+Russian+Peacekeeping]</ref> are stationed in Abkhazia under the authority of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], along with [[United Nations]] observers but both groups have recently had to restrict their activities due to increased [[land mine|mining]] and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. So far (by 2007) the negotiations have not resulted in any settlement. [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], Russia and the [[United States]] (who act as the members of the United Nations and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]) continue to encourage a comprehensive settlement consistent with Georgian independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The UN observer force and other organizations are quietly encouraging [[grassroots]] cooperative and confidence-building measures in the region.\n\nThe parliament has instituted wideranging political reforms supportive of higher [[human rights]] standards, because between 1992 and 2003 (before the [[Rose Revolution]] of November 23, 2003) the Georgian human rights situation had been complicated. Despite the reforms by the new government, there are still numerous problems concerning respect for human rights in the country. Prisoners are frequently maltreated, journalists are intimidated by the authorities and much of the mainstream media is owned by government supporters. The police are often accused of planting evidence, beatings and the unnecessary killing of suspects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{see also|List of Georgian rulers}}\nThe head of state is the [[President of Georgia|President]], who is elected for a term of five years.

During that period international financial institutions played a critical role in Georgia's budgetary calculations. Multilateral and bilateral grants and loans totaled 116.4 million lari in 1997; they totaled 182.8 million lari in 1998.\n\nEconomic recovery had been hampered by the separatist disputes in [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], resistance to reform on the part of some corrupt and reactionary factions,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997. Under the [[leadership]] of President [[Eduard Shevardnadze|Shevardnadze]] (in office 1995-2003), the government nonetheless made some progress on basic market reforms: it liberalized all prices and most trade, introduced a stable national currency (the [[Lari (Georgia)|lari]]), and massively downsized government.\n\nDuring the late 1990s more than 10,500 small enterprises had been privatized, and although privatization of medium- and large-sized firms had been slow, more than 1,200 medium - and large-sized companies had been set up as joint stock companies. A law and a decree establishing the legal basis and procedures for state property privatization reduced the number of companies controlled by the state.\n\nThe [[United States]] began assisting Georgia in the process of reform soon after the country gained independence from [[Soviet Union]]. Gradually, the focus shifted from humanitarian to technical and institution-building programs. Provision of legal and technical advisors was complemented by training opportunities for parliamentarians, law enforcement officials, and economic advisers.\n\n==Recent macroeconomic performance==\nOver the last few years Georgian economy has been one of the fastest in the [[Former Soviet Union|FSU]]. Since 2003's [[Rose Revolution]], the new Government of Georgia implemented broad and comprehensive reforms, that touched every aspect of the country's life. Economic reforms were addressed to [[Economic liberalization|liberalization of the economy]] and provision of [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic growth]], based on the [[private sector]] development. Establishment of an attractive business environment led to significant inflow of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] in the country, facilitating high [[economic growth]] rates.\n\nIn 2013, Georgia ranked in the top ten countries internationally in the Emerging Market Energy Security Growth Prosperity Index,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bisignis.org/indexes/ | title=Indexes | website=Bisignis Institute | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210211347/http://www.bisignis.org/indexes/ | archivedate=2014-12-10 | df= }}</ref> according to an article published by ''CISTRAN Finance'' news.

[[Kakha Bendukidze]] (1956-2014) was one of the most notable team members during his governance, coordinating the Ministry of Economical Reforms of Georgia. Implemented institutional reforms created an effective, professional and transparent public sector, motivated to protect the principles of democracy. Due to the economic deregulation policy, number of state regulated spheres sharply decreased, as well as regulation procedures were simplified.\n\nGeorgia succeeded in fighting against corruption, that was the one of the main obstacles for development. Success of Georgia is recognized by different rating agencies. According to the Transparency International, Georgia is the top country in the post-Soviet region in terms of fighting corruption. According to the [[Corruption Perception Index]] published by [[Transparency International]], Georgia ranked 50th in 2014<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results Corruption Perceptions Index 2014].

The number of taxes is decreased from 21 to only 6, tax rates were reduced also. In addition, significant procedural and institutional reforms was implemented - simplified system of tax disputes was established, tax administration system was streamlined and most of taxes currently are paid on-line.\n\nDue to the customs reform customs procedures were dramatically simplified. Customs tariffs reform significantly simplified and sharply reduced the costs connected to the foreign trade. Number of import tariffs was abolished on approximately 90% of products and only 3 tariff rates exist instead of previous 16. Currently 86% of tariff lines are duty-free compared to 26% in 2005. Modern Customs Clearance Zones were established and customs clearness procedures could be made starting from 15 minutes only.\n\nModernization of system of licenses and permits resulted in decrease of number of licenses and permits and simplification of related administrative procedures.\n\nPrivatization of state property \u2013 Starting from 2004, provision of transparent privatization policy was one of the important reforms of the Government of Georgia, that was addressed to denationalization of the remained state property in order to attract foreign investments, increase and develop the private sector and effective use of country's resources.\n\nLiberal labour legislation simplified the relations between employers and employees. As a result of the reform, \u201dHeritage Foundation\u201d and other analytical centers named Georgian Labour Code as one of the most liberal in the world, because it significantly reduced hiring and firing expenses.\n\nGeorgia offers the most simplified procedures for registration of business, property, for getting different documentations via \u201cOne-Stop-Shops\u201d, where the most procedures could be done on-line. [[Ease of doing business index|Doing Business]] 2012 report [[World Bank|(WB)]] places Georgia 16th in terms of [[Ease of doing business index|Ease of Doing Business index]] (up from 112 in 2006), naming Georgia as the top reformer amongst the 174 countries over the last 5 years. Georgia is amongst the leaders in other ratings, namely, registering property \u2013 first place; Dealing Construction Permits - 4th place, Starting a Business - 7th place; Getting Credits - 8th place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2012|title=Doing Business 2012 - Doing Business in a More Transparent World - World Bank Group|work=doingbusiness.org}}</ref>\n\n===Licensing regulation===\n\nDue to the reform of the system of licenses and permits, the number licenses and permits was reduced by 90%. Currently, licenses and permits are only used in the production of highly risky goods and services; also usage of natural resources and specific activities. The procedures of issuing licenses and permits were significantly simplified, the \u201cOne-Stop Shop\u201d and \u201cSilence is Consent\u201d principles were introduced which implies that if person is not notified with argumentation rejection about issuance of license in limited framework, the license is considered as issued from the relevant body.\n\nThe procedures for getting a construction permits was dramatically simplified and it requires just 3 procedures. The time for getting the construction permits was sharply reduced. According to Doing Business 2012 (WB) Georgia is the best performer in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region and places on 4-th position in the world. The number of procedures and days, the cost (% of income per capita) is much more lower, than in ECA region and OECD countries.\n\nThings have changed after new Law on Issuance of [[Licenses]] and Permits was introduced in 2005. The approval process for building a warehouse in Georgia is now more efficient than in all EU countries except Denmark.\n\n===Tax collection===\n\nSince January, 2011 the new Tax Code came into force. It unifies the old Tax and Customs Codes. The new Tax Code increased confidence towards the Georgian tax system and enhanced trust in the Georgian tax authorities, by improving communication between taxpayers and the tax authorities, by protecting the taxpayers\u2019 rights, by making administration more efficient, and by harmonizing the Georgian laws with the best international tax practices and EU directives.\n\nOnly 6 taxes exist in Georgia with law tax rates: Income Tax (personal income tax) 20%; Profit Tax (corporate tax) \u2013 15%; Value Added Tax \u2013 18%; Excise - varies; Property Tax up to 1% of the self-assessed value of property; Customs Tax \u2013 0%; 5%; 12%. In addition, significant procedural and institutional reforms were performed, simplified tax dispute settlement, streamlined tax administration decreased the time and cost of paying taxes. Georgia made paying taxes easier for firms by simplifying the reporting for value added tax and introducing electronic filling and payment of taxes.<ref name=\"Georgia_Pocket_Tax_Book\">[http://mof.ge/common/get_doc.aspx?doc_id=8272 Georgia_Pocket_Tax_Book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520055602/http://www.mof.ge/common/get_doc.aspx?doc_id=8272 |date=2011-05-20 }}, [[Ministry of Finance (Georgia)|Ministry of Finance]]</ref>\n\nNumber of import tariffs was abolished on approximately 90% of products and only 3 tariff rates (0%, 5%, 12%) exist instead of previous 16. Georgia sets Import Taxes on only several kinds of agricultural and manufactured goods . In addition, there are no quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports and exports.<ref name=\"Georgia_Pocket_Tax_Book\"/>\n\n===Labour regulation===\n\nWith unemployment around 16% and many jobs in the [[Informal economy|informal sector]], Georgia undertook a far-reaching reform of labour regulation. The new Labour Code was adopted on 17 December 2010. The new law eases restrictions on the duration of term contracts and the number of overtime hours and discards the premium required for overtime work. It also eliminates the requirement to notify and get permission from the labour union to fire a redundant worker. The new law provides for 1 month's [[severance pay]] at least, replacing complex rules under which required notice periods depended on seniority and the manager had to write long explanations to labor unions and the relevant ministry. In general, new regulation makes Georgian labor market much more flexible.\n\nCoupled with the fact that Georgia also reduced the social security contributions paid on wages by businesses from 31% to 20% in 2005, and abolished them entirely starting January 2008, these changes make Georgia the sixth easiest place to employ workers globally.\n\n=== Judicial procedure ===\n\nReducing corruption in courts was one of the chief priorities of the new government. Since 2004, when the [[Saakashvili]] administration came in, seven judges have been detained for taking bribes and 15 brought before the criminal courts. In 2005 alone the judicial disciplinary council reviewed cases against 99 judges, about 40% of the judiciary, and 12 judges were dismissed. At the same time judges\u2019 salaries were increased fourfold, to reduce dependence on bribe money.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAccording to Global Property Guide index, Georgia currently holds 40 points out of 100.<ref>http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Asia/Georgia/property-rights-index</ref> That stands for \"The court system is highly inefficient, and delays are so long that they deter the use of the court system.

Georgia still has the potential to increase hydro-generated power, through refurbishing existing facilities, as well as constructing new hydropower plants.\n\nOne of the more difficult realities facing many of the former Soviet republics was the loss of Soviet-subsidized fuel and utility transfers. Prior to 2004, Georgia's transmission network was in critical condition, with electricity blackouts being common throughout the country. In response to mounting pressures, the Georgian government initiated a series of legislative reforms in 1998 and 1999 to begin to develop the power sector and electricity markets. While measures were taken to unbundle and liberalize the energy sector, a new law was drafted and Georgia's independent regulatory authority, the [[List of energy regulatory bodies|Georgian National Energy Regulatory Commission (GNERC)]], was formed. In addition to providing government subsidies, the GNERC was able to increase the prices of electricity and natural gas in Georgia to buffer the costs of recovery from the state's reform process.<ref>Revisiting Reform http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/12/3219271/revisiting-reform-energy-sector-lessons-georgia</ref> Following these reforms, distribution has been increasingly more reliable, approaching consistent 24-hour-a-day services.

Natural gas used to be supplied to Georgia by [[Russia]].

During this time approximately 2,600 Georgian soldiers, including a headquarters staff element and 5 tactical units, received training. Another assistance program, the [[Georgia Security and Stability Operations Program]] (Georgia SSOP), was launched in January 2005 as a continuation of the (GTEP) of 2002-2004. [[Georgian Kosovo contingent|Georgian contingents]] were involved in the [[Kosovo Force]] and continue to participate in the operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nThe GAF have been extensively reformed in the recent years to meet Georgia\u2019s aspirations to join NATO and for better response to the existing challenges such as the ongoing tensions in the unresolved separatist conflict areas in [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] as well as to the threats of global terrorism. Georgia also views a large-scale foreign invasion and the spillover of conflicts from Russia\u2019s [[North Caucasus]] as the worst potential near- and long-term scenarios, respectively.<ref>The Strategic Defense Review (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 2008 the Georgian military conducted an operation in Georgia's breakaway region [[South Ossetia]] (see [[2008 South Ossetia War]]). The operation led to an armed conflict with forces from the [[Russian Federation]] and resulted in the defeat and expulsion of Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following the military operations, Russia recognized independence of the regions, declared a decade ago.\n\nThe military budget of Georgia increased more than 50 times over the period from 2002 (US$18 mln.) to 2007 (US$780 mln.), reaching over 7% of Georgia's GDP. The military budget was then\ndoubled to the end of 2008 and currently since February 2009, counts 660 mln lari (US$366 mln.)\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n{{main article|2008 South Ossetia war}}\n\nIn August 2008, following a series of fierce clashes in [[South Ossetia]], Georgia attempted to re-take the separatist territory by force. In the resulting military conflict with [[Russia]], Georgia was driven out of South Ossetia and [[Abkhazia]], and lost parts of its military capabilities. According to Defence Minister [[Davit Kezerashvili]], Georgia lost $400 million of material worth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/205%20South%20Ossetia%20-%20The%20Burden%20of%20Recognition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903235612/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/205%20South%20Ossetia%20-%20The%20Burden%20of%20Recognition.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}</ref> Out of its original 200 [[T-72]] tanks, some 55 were abandoned and captured by the enemy and 10 destroyed in combat. Much of the captured equipment that was not subsequently destroyed got transferred to Russia or given to the separatists. Parts of Georgia's relatively modern artillery and anti-aircraft units were captured and later destroyed. Russian forces sank four Georgian naval vessels in the port of Poti, a coast guard gunboat in a naval skirmish, and hauled away nine rigid-hull inflatable boats. The Georgian Air Force lost two [[L-29]] jet trainers, one [[AN-2]] airplane, and four helicopters, all destroyed on the ground. Despite these mostly non combat losses, President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] claimed that Georgia had lost less than 5% of its military hardware, contradicting figures from the Georgian military itself.<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/5jZjEpcOy?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=33974</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n\nGeorgia immediately began a process of re-armament after the war. The conflict was immediately followed by a very quick replenishment program of the gaps in the single GAF arms components with an additional massive re-equipment and modernization program. Two Georgian naval vessels sunk in [[Poti]] were raised and returned to service, although one had to undergo repairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinsblog/2909836113/sizes/m/in/set-72157607708120897/ |title=Tutte le dimensioni &#124;IMG_0721 &#124; Flickr \u2013 Condivisione di foto! |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>  although their heaviest armaments were 25-30mm cannons.

NATO officially announced the complete support of the country's efforts in establishing the efficient military force that is required to defend the country against any regional threats and agreed on delivering high end sophisticated defense capabilities and boosting the overall quality of the GAF. The package also includes a group of NATO experts monitoring the process in order to control and ensure its successful implementation for the given time period. Further a large training center for joint military drills will be constructed. NATO did not state that it would directly arm the GAF but fully assist in acquiring requested military hardware and that it would lift the general arms embargo on Georgia that was in effect since 2008. After the last major conflict with Russia, Georgia repeatedly was denied the delivery of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons and other heavy equipment despite heavy shortage on said weapons and numerous demands and harsh criticism from both the former and current ruling parties.\n\nAlmost immediately after the summit US defense secretary Chuck Hagel announced during his visit to Georgia that the US will start providing long requested UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters which is an arrangement reportedly outside the NATO package. Russia reacted very critical to the plan of building an international training center in Georgia claiming it would bring instability to the region. The statement was denied by NATO reminding that Georgia is a [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]] member and already provides similar capabilities such as an alpine warfare school for NATO and partner nations.<ref>http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_38988.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/u-s-to-strengthen-its-military-cooperation-with-georgia-34788|title=U.S. to strengthen its military cooperation with Georgia|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-enlargement/nato-to-draw-up-measures-to-bring-georgia-closer-to-alliance-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625|title=NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/20406/eng|title=NATO chief details package to \u201cbring Georgia closer\u201d to Alliance|website=agenda.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.2758750|title=CBC News - U.S., Georgia strengthen defence ties over Russian aggression|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-georgia-nato-idUKKCN0I60SB20141017|title=Defying Russia, Georgia to host NATO training centre - minister|first=|last=|publisher=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27100|title=Civil.Ge - NATO, Georgian FMs Hold Meeting|first=Civil|last=Georgia|website=www.civil.ge}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative to MAP ===\nDespite knowing that there would not be any newcomers announced during the Wales summit, the Georgian government was confident that their country would at least receive the Membership Action Plan, which is the primary precondition for aspirant nations to become NATO member.

Each formation is split into several sub-divisions which are allocated on different Georgian regions, cities and strategically important areas. Most units are composed of veterans of past conflicts including the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]], the wars in Georgia and the [[First Chechen War|insurgency in Chechnya]]. Some soldiers served in former [[Soviet Army]] formations in Russia and the Ukraine.\n\nSince 2001, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has intensified the training of its elite forces in cooperation with [[US Special Forces|American]], [[Commandement des Op\u00e9rations Sp\u00e9ciales|French]], [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British]], [[Sayeret|Israeli]] and other countries' special services. Georgian commandos participated in the [[Iraq War]] from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an [[2008 South Ossetia War|escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia]]. According to independent accounts, a number of Georgian operatives were also deployed prior in Afghanistan to aide US Special Forces in hunting down [[Taliban]] leaders.

The additional operative section of the [[Georgian Land Forces]] currently consists of an unknown amount of planes, transport helicopters, gunships and 3,000 Personnel. The Georgian Air Force lost two helicopters and a number of transport and trainer aircraft on ground during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]],\n\nTwo major airfields are located near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Alekseevka, Georgia|Alekseevka]] and [[Marneuli]].\n\n=== Georgian Coast Guard (Former Naval Force) ===\n{{main article|Georgian Navy}}\nIn 2007 the Strategic Defence Review said the Georgian Navy protects Georgia\u2019s territorial waters and contributes to the collective maritime defence in the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Georgian Navy was abolished in 2009 and was incorporated into the Coast Guard, which is not structurally part of the Georgian Armed Forces, but rather it is a subunit of the Border Guard of Georgia, which is under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  The [[Coast Guard of Georgia]] is responsible for maintenance of the sovereignty of the country and for protection of internal territorial waters and economic zones. The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Poti]].\n\n[[File:Georgian coast guard in the port of Batumi.jpg|thumb|Georgian [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] vessels]]\nThe other, smaller Coast Guard base is in [[Batumi]]. Besides the naval force, the navy also includes a Special Counter-terrorist Detachment force. Georgia is also one of the founding members and a participant of the [[Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group]]. Before the war with Russia, the Georgian navy had 19 naval vessels. 4 of them were sunk during the conflict, and nine rigid-hull inflatables were captured by Russia. The Georgians raised and returned to service two of the sunken vessels, and partially replaced their losses with Turkish-built patrol/fast attack boats. Their heaviest armaments are 25\u221230mm cannons. However, no Georgian navy vessels are armed with ship-to-ship missiles.\n\n=== National Guard of Georgia ===\nThe [[National Guard of Georgia]] was established on December 20, 1990 and was manned mainly by volunteers. It represents the first Georgian armed formation, which became the base of the foundation for modern Georgian Armed Forces. The Guard actively participated in the conflicts that occurred in Georgian territory (Samachablo, Abkhazia).\n\nThe National Guard used to consist of 20,554 personnel, but has now been reduced to 550. The main missions of the National Guard are:\n\n#Support civil government in crisis situations (natural, technological, ecological);\n#Register mobilization resources, study and deliver;\n#Convene, select and man of citizens on the basis of the agreement, for the units, subunits and bases of the Armed Forces;\n#Provide ceremonial activity support;\n#Assisting in training the Reserve Forces.\n\n=== Army Reserve and Territorial Defence Forces ===\n\nThe Army Reserve is a professional reserve force consisting of former regular army personnel only. Due to the amount of experience, the Reserve personnel would be set-in for replacement of losses in the ranks of regular formations and will if needed also operate in the vanguard of a combined mechanized group or an infantry assault.\n\nThe Territorial Defence Forces were established for immediate readiness of the population in crisis events, such as war. Its main goals would be the fortification and defence of all populated and strategically important areas as well as providing quick aid or security for evacuation operations in case of natural catastrophes.\n\nOther than the active army reserve which consists of only ex military personnel, the Territorial Defence Forces are rather sparsely prepared for complex military operations. It instead provides more comfort for the regular forces in case of war. By acting as additional logistical arm and leaving the actual combat to them. With the land forces and reserve army engaged in direct action the Defence Force's most important task would be to construct trenches, bunkers and obstacles around strategically important areas and position themselves on systematically formed defensive lines. The number of conscripts does not exceed 140,000 and is reasonably large, as it is in the strategy's intention to use any possible geographical advantage over the enemy, when professionalism is compensated by that factor.\n\nThe TDF reservist is comparably poorly equipped for modern warfare. The number of combat, protection gear and supplies will be most likely limited in the event of war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare.

From 2004 in Iraq were 300 Georgian troops. From 2005 approximately 850 troops were serving under Coalition Command ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] and [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq|UNAMI]]). On July 2007 Georgia sent an extra 1,400 troops to [[Iraq]]; that brought the total number of troops in Iraq to 2,000. About 300 of these troops were assigned to Taskforce Petro and stationed at COP Cleary outside the town of Wahida near Salman Pak, Iraq. On August 8, 2008 Georgia announced it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq due to rising hostilities with Russia. Their preparedness and training skills are evaluated on highest level by international experts. The entire Iraq contingent has been airlifted back to Georgia.\n\nHence, owing to participation in international [[peacekeeping]] missions the military members are able to obtain practical experience and to show readiness to cooperate with [[NATO]] and with other partner countries' forces.\n\nCurrently there are more than 1,570 Georgian combat troops  deployed in [[Helmand]], [[Afghanistan]] where Georgia has thus far suffered 22 deaths and over a hundred injuries.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23895 Tenth Georgia Soldier Killed in Afghanistan] Retrieved: September 1, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Seth Robson |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-training-a-dual-mission-for-georgians-1.136920 |title=U.S. training a dual mission for Georgians |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> In September 2012, Georgia stated that it would continue its contributions in Afghanistan following the 2014 NATO withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2012_new_army_military_defence_industry/georgia_will_continue_its_contribution_for_nato_mission_in_afghanistan_in_post-2014_period_1009122.html Georgia keeps helping Afghanistan] - Armyrecognition.com, September 10, 2012</ref>\nIn November 2012, Georgia had doubled the number of troops deployed to fight with Nato-led forces in Afghanistan to over 1,500.

More recent developments however have their roots in the Soviet Union. In 1941 Georgia became one of the most important Soviet weapon manufacturing countries during the [[Second World War]]. It was responsible for providing the Soviet Army with all types of aircraft and ammunition. [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]]'s role didn't change after the war. Up until 1990 Georgia was constantly producing various types of fighter aircraft, most notably the [[Su-25]] since it was produced almost exclusively in Georgia, unmanned areal vehicles, missiles, satellite components and orbital satellites. The company lost most of its functionality and production capability when the Soviet Union dissolved, yet was not abandoned. In the late 1990s Georgia's JSC RMP and later the newly established Ministry of Defence section [[STC DELTA|DELTA]] started to work on the development of ballistic equipment using their own ingredients. The advanced research unit had successfully developed a variety of personal protection gear, such as bomb disposal suits and level I-IV body armour using classified mixtures of domestic resource. But these projects never went beyond some prototypes, mainly due to poor attention and financing from the government.\n\nWith foreign support primarily from the United States since 2005, Georgia became able to start building a solid industrial base for the military. From 2001 to 2007, Delta experimented with unmanned aerial vehicles and modified parts for helicopters and Su-25 aircraft until it got involved in the modification of Georgia's T-72 tank fleet. In 2009-10, with enough experience and expertise and the assistance of designer [[Zviad Tsikolia]], Delta created its first prototype of an armored personnel carrier, the [[Didgori Armoured Personnel Carrier|Didgori]]. Early tests were highly successful so that its first production line started already in 2011.  Two versions would initially serve in the armed forces in 2012, followed by different modifications from 2013 on . The [[Lazika]] is Delta's attempt to manufacture a suitable modular infantry fighting vehicle created for multiple tasks. While still under development, some Lazikas are already in active service. Delta considers the Lazika as one of the best vehicles of its class bearing armour technology similar to that of Israel. The remotely operated systems are locally produced as well. Due to \"misdirected financing\" and heavy interfering of former government officials, project Lazika was temporarily cancelled in late 2012, also due to \"sabotage\" and shortcomings in its armour research, but then later continued in early 2013 when a newly elected government took charge. As of 2007 Georgia is domestically producing uniforms for its military personnel. However early products were of cheap quality and such shortcomings were corrected not earlier than 2012. Since then only high quality fabricates are licensed for use. Other main production lines include various types of artillery systems such as [[MLRS]], mortars and corresponding ammunition; anti tank weapons and devices; full uniform sets, ceremonial and for all service branches, those are boots, hats, assault vests, puches and backpacks etc. New kind of ballistic vests and helmets are being developed and produced for military service since 2013. The Georgian production bears techniques based on know-how from aero-space research which methodics differ slightly yet significantly from foreign analogues. Among the first units to use these new items, is the peacekeeping contingent currently stationed in the Central African Republic.\n\n== Bases ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Location\n|-\n|Ministry of Defence Headquarters\n|[[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Vaziani Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Krtsanisi National Training Centre|Krtsanisi Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Akhalkalaki Military Base\n|[[Akhalkalaki]]\n|-\n|Alekseevka Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Marneuli Airbase\n|[[Marneuli]]\n|-\n|Bolnisi Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Gori Military Base\n|[[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]\n|-\n|Senaki Military Base\n|[[Senaki]]\n|-\n|Poti naval base\n|[[Poti]]\n|-\n|Mukhrovani Military Base\n|[[Mukhrovani]]\n|-\n|Kutaisi Military Base\n|[[Kutaisi]]\n|-\n|Khelvachauri Military Base\n|[[Khelvachauri]]\n|-\n|Khoni Military Base\n|[[Khoni]]\n|-\n|Batumi naval base\n|[[Batumi]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Georgia and NATO]]\n*[[Modern equipment of the Georgian Army]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{StateDept}} 2005\n{{CIA World Factbook|year=2005}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Denise Hammick, Country Briefing: Georgia On the Cusp, [[Jane's Defence Weekly]], 2 January 2008\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Military of Georgia}}\n*[http://www.geo-army.ge/ geo-army.ge, an information website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121207132407/http://www.mod.gov.ge/2007/downloads/The_Strategic_Defence_Review(www.mod.gov.ge).pdf Ministry of Defence of Georgia: The Strategic Defence Review 2007.] ''mod.gov.ge''.

Many Ghanaian films are co-produced with [[Cinema of Nigeria|Nollywood]], the Nigerian film industry, and some are distributed by Nigerian marketers. Also, Nigerian filmmakers often feature Ghanaian actors and actresses in their movies and Ghanaian filmmakers feature Nigerian actors and actresses in theirs. [[Nadia Buari]], [[Yvonne Nelson]], [[Lydia Forson]] and [[Jackie Appiah]] all popular Ghanaian actresses and [[Van Vicker]] and [[Majid Michel]] both popular Ghanaian actors, have starred in many Nigerian movies. As a result of these collaborations, Western viewers often confuse Ghanaian movies with Nollywood and count their sales as one; however, they are two independent industries that sometimes share ''Nollywood''. In 2009, [[Unesco]] described Nollywood as the second-biggest film industry in the world after [[Bollywood]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7086248.ece |title=Nollywood success puts Nigeria's film industry in regional spotlight |work=The Times|first=Jonathan|last=Clayton|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media of Ghana}}\n[[File:Ghana Trustworthiness of Media.jpg|thumb|Ghana mass media, [[news]] and information provided by television.]]\n\nThe [[media of Ghana]] are amongst the most free in Africa.

North of this belt, the elevation varies from {{convert|91|to|396|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level and is covered by low bush, park-like [[savanna]], and grassy plains.\n\n'''Irrigated land:'''\n309&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2003)\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:'''\n53.2&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (2011)\n\n==Geographical regions==\n[[File:Ghana map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|A [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] map of Ghana.]]\n[[Image:Ghana Topography.png|thumb|Ghana's topography.]]\nGhana is characterized in general by low physical [[Terrain|relief]]. The [[Precambrian]] rock system that underlies most of the nation has been worn down by erosion almost to a plain. The highest elevation in Ghana, [[Mount Afadja]] in the [[Akwapim-Togo]] Ranges, rises 880 meters above sea level.\n\nThere are four distinct geographical regions. Low plains stretch across the southern part of Ghana. To their north lie three regions\u2014the Ashanti Uplands, the Akwapim-Togo Ranges, and the Volta Basin. The fourth region, the high plains, occupies the northern and northwestern sector of Ghana. Like most West African countries, Ghana has no natural harbors. Because strong surf pounds the shoreline, two artificial harbors were built at [[Takoradi]] and [[Tema]] (the latter completed in 1961) to accommodate Ghana's shipping needs.\n\n===Low plains===\n[[Image:Volta Region Ghana.jpg|thumb|300px|The Akwapim-Togo Ranges.]]\nThe low plains comprise the four subregions of the coastal savanna, the [[Volta Delta]], the [[Accra Plains]], and the [[Akan lowlands or peneplains]]. A narrow strip of grassy and scrubby coast runs from a point near [[Takoradi]] in the west to the [[Togo]] border in the east. This coastal savanna, only about eight kilometers in width at its western end, stretches eastward through the Accra Plains, where it widens to more than eighty kilometers, and terminates at the southeastern corner of the country at the lower end of the Akwapim-Togo Ranges.\n\nAlmost flat and featureless, the Accra Plains descend gradually to the gulf from a height of about 150 meters. The topography east of the city of Accra is marked by a succession of ridges and spoonshaped valleys. The hills and slopes in this area are the favored lands for cultivation. [[Shifting cultivation]] is the usual agricultural practice because of the swampy nature of the very lowlying areas during the rainy seasons and the periodic blocking of the rivers at the coast by sandbars that form lagoons. A plan to irrigate the Accra Plains was announced in 1984. Should this plan come to reality, much of the area could be opened to large-scale cultivation.\n\nTo the west of Accra, the low plains contain wider valleys and rounded low hills, with occasional rocky headlands. In general the land is flat and covered with grass and scrub. Dense groves of coconut palms front the coastline. Several commercial centers, including Winneba, Saltpond, and Cape Coast are located here. Winneba has a small livestock industry and palm tree cultivation is expanding in the area away from the coast, with the predominant occupation of the coastal inhabitants being fishing via dug-out canoe.\n\nThe Volta Delta, which forms a distinct subregion of the low plains, extends into the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the extreme southeast. The delta's rock formation\u2014consisting of thick layers of [[sandstone]], some [[limestone]], and [[silt]] deposits\u2014is flat, featureless, and relatively young. As the delta grew outward over the centuries, sandbars developed across the mouths of the Volta and smaller rivers that empty into the gulf in the same area, forming numerous lagoons, some quite large, making road construction difficult. \n\nTo avoid the lowest-lying areas the road between Accra and Keta makes a detour inland just before reaching Ada, and approaches Keta from the east along the narrow spit on which the town stands. Road links with Keta continue to be a problem. By 1989 it was estimated that more than 3,000 houses in the town had been swallowed by flooding from the lagoon. About 1,500 other houses were destroyed by erosion caused by the powerful waves of the sea.\n\nThis flat, silt-composed delta region with its abundance of water supports [[shallot]], [[maize|corn]], and [[cassava]] cultivation in the region. The sandy soil of the delta gave rise to the [[copra]] industry. [[Salt]]-making, from the plentiful supply in the dried beds of the lagoons, provides additional employment. The main occupation of the delta people is fishing, an industry that supplies dried and salted fish to other parts of the country.\n\nThe largest part of the low plains is the Akan Lowlands. Some experts prefer to classify this region as a subdivision of the [[Ashanti Uplands]] because of the many characteristics they share. Unlike the uplands, the height of the Akan Lowlands is generally between sea level and 150 meters. Some ranges and hills rise to about 300 meters, but few exceed 600 meters. The lowlands that lie to the south of the Ashanti Uplands receive the many rivers that make their way to the sea.\n\nThe Akan Lowlands contain the basins of the [[Densu River]], the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra River]], the [[Ankobra River]], and the [[Tano River]], all of which play important roles in the economy of Ghana. The Densu River Basin, location of the important urban centers of [[Koforidua]] and [[Nsawam]] in the eastern lowlands, has an undulating topography. Many of the hills here have craggy summits, which give a striking appearance to the landscape. The upper section of the Pra River Basin, to the west of the Densu, is relatively flat. The topography of its lower reaches resembles that of the Densu Basin and is a rich cocoa and food-producing region. The valley of the Birim River, one of the main tributaries of the Pra, is Ghana's most important diamond-producing area.\n\nThe Ankobra River Basin and the middle and lower basins of the Tano River to the west of the lowlands form the largest subdivision of the Akan Lowlands. Here annual rainfall between 1,500 and 2,150 millimeters helps assure a dense forest cover. In addition to timber, the area is rich in minerals. The Tarkwa goldfield, the diamond operations of the [[Bonsa Valley]], and high-grade manganese deposits are all found in this area. The middle and lower Tano basins have been intensely explored for oil and natural gas since the mid-1980s. The lower basins of the Pra, Birim, Densu, and Ankobra rivers are also sites for palm tree cultivation.\n\nComprising the Southern Ashanti Uplands and the Kwahu Plateau, the Ashanti Uplands lie just north of the Akan Lowlands and stretch from the Ivory Coast border in the west to the elevated edge of the Volta Basin in the east. Stretching in a northwest-to-southeast direction, the Kwahu Plateau extends 193 kilometers between Koforidua in the east and Wenchi in the northwest. The average elevation of the plateau is about 450 meters, rising to a maximum of 762 meters. The relatively cool temperatures of the plateau were attractive to Europeans, particularly missionaries, who founded many well-known schools and colleges in this region.\n\nThe plateau forms one of the important physical divides in Ghana. From its northeastern slopes, the Afram and Pru Rivers flow into the Volta River, while from the opposite side, the Pra, Birim, Ofin, Tano, and other rivers flow south toward the sea. The plateau also marks the northernmost limit of the forest zone. Although large areas of the forest cover have been destroyed through farming, enough deciduous forest remains to shade the head waters of the rivers that flow from the plateau.\n\nThe Southern Ashanti Uplands, extending from the foot of the Kwahu Plateau in the north to the lowlands in the south, slope gently from an elevation of about 300 meters in the north to about 150 meters in the south. The region contains several hills and ranges as well as several towns of historical and economic importance, including [[Kumasi]], Ghana's second largest city and former capital of the Asante. [[Obuasi]] and [[Konongo, Ghana|Konongo]], two of the country's gold-mining centers, are also located here. The region is Ghana's chief producer of cocoa, and its tropical forests continue to be a vital source of timber for the lumber industry.\n\n===Volta Basin===\n\nTaking the central part of Ghana, the Volta Basin covers about 45 percent of the nation's total land surface. Its northern section, which lies above the upper part of [[Lake Volta]], rises to a height of 150 to 215 meters above sea level. Elevations of the Konkori Scarp to the west and the Gambaga Scarp to the north reach from 300 to 460 meters. To the south and the southwest, the basin is less than 300 meters. The Kwahu Plateau marks the southern end of the basin, and forms a natural part of the Ashanti Uplands.\n\nThe basin is characterized by poor soil, generally of Voltaian [[sandstone]]. Annual rainfall averages between 1,000 and 1,140 millimeters. The most widespread vegetation type is [[savanna]], the woodlands of which, depending on local soil and climatic conditions, may contain such trees as red ironwood and shea.\n\nThe basin's population, principally farmers, is low in density, especially in the central and northwestern areas of the basin, where tsetse flies are common. Archeological finds indicate that the region was once more heavily populated. Periodic burning occurred over extensive areas for perhaps more than a millennium, exposing the soil to excessive drying and erosion, rendering the area less attractive to cultivators.\n\nIn contrast with the rest of the region are the [[Afram Plains]], located in the southeastern corner of the basin. Here the terrain is low, averaging 60 to 150 meters in elevation, and annual rainfall is between 1,140 and about 1,400 millimeters. Near the Afram River, much of the surrounding countryside is flooded or swampy during the rainy seasons. With the creation of Lake Volta (8500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in area) in the mid-1960s, much of the Afram Plains was submerged. Despite the construction of roads to connect communities displaced by the lake, road transportation in the region remains poor. Renewed efforts to improve communications, to enhance agricultural production, and to improve standards of living began in earnest in the mid-1980s.\n\n{{wide image|Volta lake from the Saint Barbara Church.JPG|900px|align-cap=center|[[Panorama]] and [[landscape]] view of Lake Volta in [[Volta Basin]] and [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern Region]] of Ghana.

[[Volta River]] has three main tributaries\u2014the [[Black Volta]], [[White Volta]] and [[Red Volta]].}}\n\n===High plains===\n\nThe general terrain in the northern and northwestern part of Ghana outside the Volta Basin consists of a dissected plateau, which averages between 150 and 300 meters in elevation and, in some places, is even higher. Rainfall averages between 1,000 and 1,150 millimeters annually, although in the northwest it is closer to 1,350 millimeters. Soils in the high plains are more arable than those in the Volta Basin, and the population density is considerably higher. Grain and cattle production are the major economic activities in the high plains of the northern region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghana - The High Plains|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/ghana/ghana-the_high_plains.html|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-1980s, when former United States President Jimmy Carter's Global 2000 program (see Glossary) adopted Ghana as one of a select number of African countries whose local farmers were to be educated and financially supported to improve agricultural production, there has been a dramatic increase in grain production in northern Ghana. The virtual absence of tsetse flies in the region has led to increased livestock raising as a major occupation in the north. The region is Ghana's largest producer of cattle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghana - The High Plains|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/ghana/ghana-the_high_plains.html|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rivers and lakes==\n{{See also|List of rivers of Ghana|l1=Rivers in Ghana}}\n[[Image:Lake Volta Ghana.jpg|thumb|200px|Lake Volta]]\n[[Image:Lake Bosumtwi1, Ghana.jpg|thumb|200px|Lake Bosumtwi]]\n\nGhana is drained by a large number of streams and rivers. In addition, there are a number of coastal lagoons, the huge man-made [[Lake Volta]], and [[Lake Bosumtwi]] created by a [[meteorite]], southeast of [[Kumasi]] and which has no outlet to the sea. In the wetter south and southwest areas of Ghana, the river and stream pattern is denser, but in the area north of the [[Kwahu Plateau]], the pattern is much more open, making access to water more difficult. Several streams and rivers also dry up or experience reduced flow during the dry seasons of the year, while flooding during the rainy seasons is common.\n\nThe major drainage divide runs from the southwest part of the Akwapim-Togo Ranges northwest through the Kwahu Plateau and then irregularly westward to the Ivory Coast border. Almost all the rivers and streams north of this divide form part of the Volta system. Extending about 1,600 kilometers in length and draining an area of about 388,000 square kilometers, of which about 158,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> lie within Ghana, the Volta and its tributaries, such as the [[Afram River]] and the Oti River, drain more than two thirds of Ghana. To the south of the divide are several smaller, independent rivers. The most important of these are the Pra River, the Tano River, the Ankobra River, the [[Birim River]], and the [[Densu River]]. With the exception of smaller streams that dry up in the dry seasons or rivers that empty into inland lakes, all the major rivers in Ghana flow into the Gulf of Guinea directly or as tributaries to other major rivers. The Ankobra and Tano are navigable for considerable distances in their lower reaches.\n\n[[Image:Lake Volta, Ghana.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lake Volta]] is the world's largest artificially created lake.]]\nNavigation on the Volta River has changed significantly since 1964. Construction of the dam at Akosombo, about 80 kilometers upstream from the coast, created the vast Lake Volta and the associated 1020 megawatt hydroelectric project. Arms of the lake extended into the lower-lying areas, forcing the relocation of 78,000 people to newly created townships on the lake's higher banks. The Black Volta River and the White Volta River flow separately into the lake. Before their confluence was submerged, the rivers came together in the middle of Ghana to form the main Volta River. \n\nThe Oti River and the Daka River, the principal tributaries of the Volta in the eastern part of Ghana, and the Pru River, the Sene River, and the Afram River, major tributaries to the north of the Kawhu Plateau, also empty into flooded extensions of the lake in their river valleys. Lake Volta is a rich source of fish, and its potential as a source for irrigation is reflected in an agricultural mechanization agreement signed in the late 1980s to irrigate the Afram Plains. The lake is navigable from Akosombo through Yeji in the middle of Ghana. A 24-meter [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]] was commissioned in 1989 to link the Afram Plains to the west of the lake with the lower Volta region to the east. Hydroelectricity generated from Akosombo supplies Ghana, Togo, and Benin.\n\nOn the other side of the Kwahu Plateau from Lake Volta are several river systems, including the Pra, Ankobra, Tano and Densu. The Pra is the easternmost and the largest of the three principal rivers that drain the area south of the Volta divide. Rising south of the Kwahu Plateau and flowing southward, the Pra enters the Gulf of Guinea east of Takoradi. In the early part of the twentieth century, the Pra was used extensively to float timber to the coast for export. This trade is now carried by road and rail transportation.\n\nThe Ankobra, which flows to the west of the Pra, has a relatively small drainage basin. It rises in the hilly region of [[Bibiani]] and flows in a southerly direction to enter the gulf just west of [[Axim]]. Small craft can navigate approximately eighty kilometers inland from its mouth. At one time, the Ankobra helped transport machinery to the gold-mining areas in the vicinity of [[Tarkwa]]. The Tano, which is the westernmost of the three rivers, rises near [[Techiman]] in the center of the country. It also flows in a southerly direction, and it empties into a lagoon in the southeast corner of Ivory Coast. Navigation by steam launch is possible on the southern sector of the Tano for about 70 kilometers.\n\nA number of rivers are found to the east of the Pra. The two most important are the Densu and Ayensu, both of which rise in the [[Atewa Range]], and which are important as sources of water for [[Accra]] and [[Winneba]] respectively. The country has one large natural lake, Lake Bosumtwi, located about 32 kilometers southeast of Kumasi. It occupies the steep-sided meteoric crater <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/bosumtwi.htm |title=UNB &#124; Planetary and Space Science Centre |publisher=Unb.ca |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> and has an area of about 47 square kilometers. A number of small streams flow into Lake Bosumtwi, but there is no drainage from it. Apart from providing an opportunity for fishing for local inhabitants, the lake serves as a tourist attraction.\n\n== Natural hazards ==\nDry, dusty, [[harmattan]] winds occur from January to March. Ghana is also prone to [[droughts]], and was severely affected by [[floods]] in 2007 and 2009.<ref>Heavy floods caused loss of life and widespread damage in 2007 and 2009.

In 1990 sixty-three persons per square kilometer was the estimate for Ghana's overall population density. These averages did not reflect variations in population distribution. For example, while the Northern Region, one of ten administrative regions, showed a density of seventeen persons per square kilometer in 1984, in the same year Greater Accra Region recorded nine times the national average of fifty-two per square kilometer.<ref name=distribution>Owusa-Ansah, David. \"Population Distribution\". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ghtoc.html A Country Study: Ghana]'' (La Verle Berry, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (November 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]</ref> \n\nAs was the case in the 1960 and 1970 figures, the greatest concentration of population in 1984 was to the south of the [[Kwahu Plateau]]. The highest concentration of habitation continued to be within the Accra-Kumasi-Takoradi triangle, largely because of the economic productivity of the region. All of Ghana's mining centers, timber-producing deciduous forests, and cocoa-growing lands lie to the south of the Kwahu Plateau. The Accra-Kumasi-Takoradi triangle is linked to the coast by rail and road systems\u2014making this area an important magnet for investment and labor.<ref name=distribution>Owusa-Ansah, David. \"Population Distribution\".

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]</ref> \n\nA large part of the [[Volta Basin]] is sparsely populated. The far north is heavily populated. The population density of the Upper East Region is well above the national average. This may be explained in part by the better soil found in some areas.<ref name=distribution/>\n\n===Urban-rural disparities===\n\nLocalities of 5,000 persons and above have been classified as urban since 1960. The 1960 urban population totalled 1,551,174 persons, or 23.1 percent of total population. By 1970 the urban percentage had increased to 28 percent. That percentage rose to 32 in 1984 and was estimated at 33 percent for 1992.<ref name=urd>Owusa-Ansah, David. \"Urban-Rural Disparities\". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ghtoc.html A Country Study: Ghana]'' (La Verle Berry, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (November 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]</ref>\n\nUrban areas in Ghana have customarily been supplied with more amenities than rural locations. Consequently, Kumasi, Accra, and many settlements within the southern economic belt attracted more people than the savanna regions of the north; only Tamale in the north has been an exception. The linkage of the national electricity grid to the northern areas of the country in the late 1980s may help to stabilize the north-to-south flow of internal migration.<ref name=urd/>\n\nGhana has continued to be a nation of rural communities. Rural residency was estimated to be 67 percent of the population in 1992. In the 1970s, 72 percent of Ghana's population lived in rural areas.<ref name=urd/> The \"Rural Manifesto,\" which assessed the causes of rural underdevelopment, was introduced in April 1984. Development strategies were evaluated, and some were implemented to make rural residency more attractive. The Bank of Ghana established more than 120 rural banks to support rural entrepreneurs, and the rural electrification program was intensified in the late 1980s. The government presented its plans for district assemblies as a component of its strategy for rural improvement through decentralized administration.<ref

It carries over 95% of all passenger and freight traffic and reaches most communities, and is classified under three categories of trunk roads, urban roads, and feeder roads.<ref>http://mrt.gov.gh/pages.asp?page_Id=1&expandable=0</ref> The Ghana Highway Authority, established in 1974 is tasked with developing and maintaining the country's trunk road network totaling 13,367&nbsp;km, which makes up 33% of Ghana's total road network of 40,186&nbsp;km.<ref>http://www.highways.gov.gh/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=21&Itemid=28</ref>\n\nTrunk roads in Ghana are classified as National roads, Regional roads, and Inter-regional roads, all of which form the [[Ghana road network]].  National roads, designated with the letter '''N''', link all the major population centers in Ghana.  Regional roads, designated with the letter '''R''', are a mix of primary and secondary routes, which serve as feeder roads to National roads; while Inter-Regional roads, designated with the prefix '''IR''', connect major settlements across regional borders.\n\nWith respect to this mode of transport, many people prefer to use the public means. Many of the town and cities in the country can be reached by the use of urvan buses known as \"trotro\" or taxis. For inter-regional transport bigger buses are normally used.\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = \n| header    = \n| align     = right\n| image1    = Akosombo Township.jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: (140 * 750 / 536) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = <center>[[Dual carriageway|Dual Carriageway]] with a [[Stop sign|Stop Sign]] in [[Akosombo]], Eastern region, Ghana.</center>\n| image2    = Kwame Nkrumah Circle, Accra, Ghana.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: (188 * 750 / 536) round 0}}\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = <center>[[Traffic circle|Traffic Circle]] in Greater Accra, Ghana.</center>\n}}\n\nThe Ghana road network is 64,323&nbsp;km and [[road transportation]] is the most dominant choice of transportation in Ghana.<ref name=\"Commerce Ghana Adequate Transportation\">{{cite web |author = |work= |publisher=''commerceghana.com''|url = http://www.commerceghana.com/why-invest-in-ghana/transportation-in-ghana|title= Commerce Ghana Adequate Transportation|date= |accessdate = 5 June 2013}}</ref> Road transport infrastructure in Ghana can be used throughout to facilitate the exchange of commodities and enable regular school attendance and fast access to health facilities in Ghana.<ref name=\"Commerce Ghana Adequate Transportation\"/> There has been an increased investment and expansion in the road transportation of Ghana, [[Ghana cedi|GH\u20b5]]1 billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]500&nbsp;million) in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |author = |work= chinadaily.com.cn |publisher= [[China Daily]] |url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2012-12/05/content_15986854.htm|title= $500m of Chinese loan used on roads in Ghana, says minister |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate = 5 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere is a Ghanaian [[Bus rapid transit|Bus Rapid Transit]], known as [[Metro mass Transit L.T.D]], and a [[Taxicab]] system connecting the Ghanaian big cities among themselves, and a [[Minibus]]es system, known as [[Tro tro|Tro Tros]], connecting big cities with the country's [[rural area]]s and small towns.<ref name=\"Commerce Ghana Adequate Transportation\"/> The [[Ghana Police Service]]'s [[Motor Transport and Traffic Unit]] (MTTU) and the Ghana Highways Authority is responsible for the maintenance of the [[Road traffic control|Road Traffic Control]] of Ghana and the [[Ghana Road Network]] (Ghana national [[highway]]s and [[motorway]]s).<ref>{{cite web |author = |work= ghanapolice.info |publisher= |url = http://www.ghanapolice.info/mttu/mttu.htm |title=About MTTU|date= |accessdate = 5 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bus Rapid Transit, Tamale.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]] bus rapid transit system]]\n\n===International highways===\nThe [[Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway]], part of the [[Trans-African Highway network]] crosses Ghana along the '''N1''', connecting it to [[Abidjan]], ([[Ivory Coast]]), [[Lom\u00e9]], ([[Togo]]) and to [[Benin]] and [[Nigeria]].

The most important are [[Kotoka International Airport]] at Accra and airports at Sekondi-Takoradi, Kumasi, and Tamale that serve domestic air traffic. In 1990, the government spent US$12 million to improve Accra's facilities. Workmen resurfaced the runway, upgraded the lighting system and built a new freight terminal. Construction crews also extended and upgraded the terminal building at Kumasi. In early 1991, the government announced further plans to improve Accra's international airport. The main runway was upgraded, improvements were made in freight landing and infrastructure, and the terminal building and the airport's navigational aids were upgraded.<ref name=aviation/>\n\n[[File:Ghana Airways DC-10-30 9G-ANE JFK 2004-4-10.png|thumb|<center>[[DC-10]] of the [[Ghana Airways]]</center>]]\n\nThe first Ghanaian [[flag carrier]] was the [[Ghana Airways]] which commenced operations in 1958; then ceased operations in 2005 and was succeeded by the Ghana International Airlines in 2005.

Major General [[Stephen Otu]] is appointed GAF Chief of Defence Staff in September 1961. From 1966, the GAF was extensively involved in politics, mounting several coups. [[Kwame Nkrumah]] had become Ghana's first [[Prime Minister]] when the country became independent in 1957. As Nkrumah's rule wore on, he began to take actions which disquieted the leadership of the armed forces, including the creation and expansion of the [[President's Own Guard Regiment]] (POGR).<ref>La Verle Berry (ed.), 'The National Liberation Council,' in [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ghtoc.html Ghana Country Study], Library of Congress, research completed November 1994</ref>\n\nAs a result, on February 24, 1966, a small number of Army [[military personnel]] and senior police officials, led by Colonel [[Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka|Emmanuel Kotoka]], (commander of the Second Army Brigade at Kumasi), Major [[Akwasi Afrifa]], (staff officer in charge of army training and operations), Lieutenant General (retired) [[Joseph Arthur Ankrah|Joseph Ankrah]], and J.W.K.

Lieutenant Colonel [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong]] (temporary commander of the First Brigade around Accra) led the bloodless [[1972 Ghanaian coup d'\u00e9tat]] that ended the Second Republic in January 1972.<ref>Berry (ed.), 1994</ref> Thus the [[National Redemption Council]] was formed. Acheampong became head of state, and the NRC ruled from 1972 to 1975.\n\nOn October 9, 1975, the NRC was replaced by the [[Supreme Military Council, Ghana|Supreme Military Council]] (SMC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-76830 |title= Ghana |accessdate=2007-03-20 |year=2007 |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}</ref> Council members were Colonel Acheampong, (chairman, who was also promoted straight from [[Colonel]] to [[General]]), Lt. Gen. [[Fred Akuffo]], (the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Ghana)|Chief of Defence Staff]]), and the army, navy, air force and [[Border Guard Unit]] commanders.\n\nIn July 1978, in a sudden move, the other SMC officers forced Acheampong to resign, replacing him with Lt. Gen. Akuffo. The SMC apparently acted in response to continuing pressure to find a solution to the country's economic dilemma; inflation was estimated to be as high as 300% that year. The council was also motivated by Acheampong's failure to dampen rising political pressure for changes. Akuffo, the new SMC chairman, promised publicly to hand over political power to a new government to be elected by 1 July 1979.<ref name=nrc>McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The National Redemption Council Years, 1972-79\".</ref>\n\nThe decree lifting the ban on party politics went into effect on 1 January 1979, as planned. However in June, just before the scheduled resumption of civilian rule, a group of young armed forces officers, led by [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Jerry Rawlings]], mounted the [[1979 Ghanaian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They put in place the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana|Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]], which governed until September 1979. However, in 1981, Rawlings deposed the new civilian government again, in the [[1981 Ghanaian coup d'\u00e9tat]].<ref>Hutchful, Eboe. \"Institutional Decomposition and Junior Ranks\u2019 Political Action in Ghana.\" in Hutchful and Bathilly, ''The military and militarism in Africa'', CODESRIA, (1998): 211-56.</ref> This time Rawlings established the [[Provisional National Defence Council]].

Ghana is active in the [[United Nations]] and many of its specialised agencies, the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), the [[African Union]] (AU) and the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. Generally, it follows the consensus of the Non-aligned Movement and the OAU on economic and political issues not directly affecting its own interests. Ghana has been extremely active in international [[peacekeeping]] activities under UN auspices in [[Lebanon]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Rwanda]], and the [[Balkans]], in addition to an eight-year sub-regional initiative with its ECOWAS partners to develop and then enforce a cease-fire in [[Liberia]]. Ghana is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]].\n\n==Guiding principles and objectives==\n[[Image:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A postage stamp from the [[Soviet Union]] marking the 80th anniversary of Nkrumah]]\nGhana's foreign policy since independence has been characterised by a commitment to the principles and ideals of non-alignment and Pan-Africanism as first enunciated by Kwame Nkrumah in the early 1960s. For Nkrumah, non-alignment meant complete independence from the policies and alliances of both East and West and support for a worldwide union of so-called non-aligned nations as a counter to both East and West power blocs. Pan-Africanism, by contrast, was a specifically African policy that envisioned the independence of Africa from Western colonialism and the eventual economic and political unity of the African continent.<ref name=cs>Owusu, Maxwell. \"Guiding Principles and Objectives\". ''A Country Study: Ghana'' (La Verle Berry, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (November 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]</ref>\n\nThe PNDC, like most of its predecessors, made serious and consistent attempts at the practical application of these ideals and principles, and its successor, the NDC government, promises to follow in the PNDC's footsteps. Under the NDC, Ghana remains committed to the principle of non-alignment in world politics. Ghana is also opposed to interference in the internal affairs of both small and large countries. This is a departure from Nkrumah's foreign policy approach; Nkrumah was frequently accused of subverting African regimes, such as Togo and Ivory Coast, which he considered ideologically conservative. The NDC government, like the PNDC before it, believes in the principle of self-determination, including the right to political independence and the right of people to pursue their economic and social development free from external interference. Another feature of NDC rule carried over from the PNDC era is faithfulness to what a leading scholar of Africa has called \"one of the most successful neoclassical economic reform efforts supported by the IMF and the World Bank.\"<ref name=cs/>\n\n[[File:Nkrumah, his family and Nasser, 1965.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kwame Nkrumah and his family meeting Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] during the 1965 [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]] Summit in Accra.]]\nThe broad objectives of Ghana's foreign policy thus include maintaining friendly relations and cooperation with all countries that desire such cooperation, irrespective of ideological considerations, on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Africa and its liberation and unity are naturally the cornerstones of Ghana's foreign policy. As a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), NDC policy is to adhere faithfully to the OAU Charter.<ref name=cs/>\n\nAnother important principle of Ghana's foreign policy involves the closest possible cooperation with neighbouring countries with which the people of Ghana share cultural history, ties of blood, and economics. The results have included various bilateral trade and economic agreements and permanent joint commissions involving Ghana and its immediate neighbours, sometimes in the face of latent ideological and political differences and mutual suspicion, as well as numerous reciprocal state visits by high-ranking officials. These measures have contributed significantly to subregional cooperation, development, and the reduction of tension.<ref name=cs/>\n\n[[File:Diplomatic missions of Ghana.PNG|thumb|200px|right|[[Diplomatic missions of Ghana]]]]\n\nAs an example of Ghana's interest in regional cooperation, the country enthusiastically endorsed formation of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) in 1975. This organisation was created specifically to foster inter-regional economic and political cooperation. It has served as a useful vehicle for contacts with neighbouring West African governments and for channelling increased Ghanaian exports to regional markets. Since 1990 ECOWAS has been engaged in a peacekeeping mission in Liberia to which Ghana has contributed a large contingent of troops. Ghana has participated in other international peacekeeping efforts as well, sending soldiers to operations of the United Nations (UN) in Cambodia in 1992-93 and Rwanda in 1993-94.<ref name=cs/>\n\nIn August 1994, Rawlings became ECOWAS chairman, a post that had eluded him since the PNDC came to power. He immediately undertook several initiatives to reduce tensions and conflict in West Africa. Notable among them was the Akosombo Accord of September 12, designed to end civil war in Liberia.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n\n===Africa===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Burkina Faso}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Burkina Faso\u2013Ghana relations]]\n\nWith the coming to power of [[Thomas Sankara]] in Burkina Faso in 1983, relations between Ghana and Burkina became both warm and close. Indeed, [[Jerry Rawlings|Rawlings]] and Sankara began discussions about uniting Ghana and Burkina in the manner of the defunct [[Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union]], which Nkrumah had sought unsuccessfully to promote as a foundation for his dream of unified continental government. Political and economic ties between Ghana and Burkina, a poorer country, were strengthened through joint commissions of cooperation and through border demarcation committee meetings. Frequent high-level consultations and joint military exercises, meant to discourage potential dissidents and to protect young \"revolutions\" in each country, were fairly regular features of Ghana-Burkina relations.<ref name=cs3>Owusu, Maxwell. \"Burkina\".

In early 1984, the PNDC government complained that Ivory Coast was allowing Ghanaian dissidents to use its territory as a base from which to carry out acts of [[sabotage]] against Ghana.  Ghana also accused Ivory Coast of granting [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to political agitators wanted for crimes in Ghana. Relations between Ghana and Ivory Coast improved significantly, however, after 1988.  In 1989, after fifteen years of no progress, the Ghana-Ivory Coast border re-demarcation commission finally agreed on the definition of the 640-kilometer border between the two countries. The PNDC thereafter worked to improve the [[transportation]] and [[communication]] links with both Ivory Coast and Togo, despite problems with both countries.<ref name=cs4>Owusu, Maxwell. \"Relations with Immediate African Neighbours\".

After 1945, the [[United Nations]] took over the Togoland mandates.  During the 1950s, when the independence of [[Ghana]] was in sight, demands grew for a separate Ewe state, an idea that [[Kwame Nkrumah]], leader of the Gold Coast independence movement, opposed.  Following a UN plebiscite in May 1956, in which a majority of the Ewe voted for union with Ghana, British Togoland became part of the Gold Coast.<ref name=cs/><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4273845.stm|title=Impressions of Togo after the 'coup'|date=18 February 2005|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>  After Togolese independence in 1960, relations between Togo and Ghana deteriorated, aggravated by political differences and incidents such as [[smuggling]] across their common border.

Following the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], Gibraltar was occupied by the [[Vandals]] and later the [[Goths]] kingdoms. The Vandals did not remain for long although the [[Visigoth]]s remained on the [[Iberian peninsula]] from 414 to 711.

It was here that Gibraltar was named. Coming from the Arabian words Gabal-Al-Tariq (the mountain of Tariq). Little was built during the first four centuries of [[Moorish]] control (see [[Reconquista]]).\n*'''1160''' \u2013 The [[Almohad]] Sultan [[Abd al-Mu'min]] ordered that a permanent settlement, including a [[castle]], be built. It received the name of ''Medinat al-Fath'' (City of the Victory). On completion of the works in the town, the Sultan crossed the Strait to inspect the works and stayed in Gibraltar for two months. The Tower of Homage of the castle remains standing today ([[Moorish Castle]]).\n*'''1231''' \u2013 After the collapse of the Almohad Empire, Gibraltar was taken by [[Ibn Hud]], [[Taifa]] emir of Murcia.\n*'''1237''' \u2013 Following the death of [[Ibn Hud]], his domains were handed over to [[Muhammad I of Granada|Muhammad ibn al-Ahmar]], the founder of the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] [[kingdom of Granada]]. Therefore, Gibraltar changed hands again.\n*'''1274''' \u2013 The second Nasrid king, [[Muhammed II al-Faqih]], gave Gibraltar over to the [[Marinid]]s, as payment for their help against the Christian kingdoms.\n*'''1309''' \u2013 While the King [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] laid [[Siege of Algeciras (1309)|siege on Algeciras]], [[Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n]] (known to the Spanish records as ''Guzm\u00e1n el Bueno'') was sent to capture the town. This was the First Siege of Gibraltar. The Castilians took the Upper Rock from where the town was bombarded. The garrison surrendered after one month. Gibraltar then had about 1,500 inhabitants.\n*'''1310''' 31 January \u2013 Gibraltar was granted its first Charter by the king Ferdinand IV of Castile. Being considered a high risk town, the charter included incentives to settle there such as the offering of freedom from justice to anyone who lived in Gibraltar for one year and one day.\n:This fact marked the establishment of the Gibraltar council.\n*'''1316''' \u2013 Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Nasrid [[qaid|caid]] Yahya (Second Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1333''' June \u2013 A [[Marinid]] army, led by [[Abd al-Malik Abd al-Wahid|Abd al-Malik]], the son of [[Abu Al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman|Abul Hassan]], the Marinid sultan, recovered Gibraltar, after a five-month siege (Third Siege of Gibraltar).\n:King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] attempted to retake Gibraltar aided by the fleet of the Castilian Admiral [[Alonso Jofre Tenorio]]. Even a ditch was dug across the isthmus. While laying the siege, the king was attacked by a Nasrid army from Granada. Therefore, the siege ended in a truce, allowing the Marinids to keep Gibraltar (Fourth Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1344''' March \u2013 After the two-year [[Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344)]], [[Algeciras]] was taken over by the Castilian forces. Therefore, Gibraltar became the main Marinid port in the Iberian Peninsula. During the siege, Gibraltar played a key role as the supply base of the besieged.\n*'''1349''' \u2013 Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Castilian forces led by the king [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]].\n*'''1350''' \u2013 The siege was resumed by Alfonso XI. It was again unsuccessful, mainly due to the arrival of the [[Black Death]], which decimated the besiegers, causing the death of the king (Fifth Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1369''' \u2013 As the [[Castilian Civil War|Civil War in Castile]] came to an end, with the murder of king [[Peter I of Castile|Peter I]] by the pretender Henry (to be known as [[Henry II of Castile|Henry II]]), the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] king of [[kingdom of Granada|Granada]], [[Muhammad V of Granada|Muhammad V]], former ally of Peter, took over Algeciras after the 3-day [[Siege of Algeciras (1369)]]. Ten years later the city was razed out to the ground, and its harbour made unusable. This fact increased again the importance of Gibraltar, yet in Marinid hands, in the strait trade. A subsequent truce was signed between Muhammad and Henry, preventing the Christian kings from attempting to recover the city.\n*'''1374''' \u2013 Following a period of internal instability in the Marinid [[Sultanate of Fez]], [[Abu al-Abbas Ahmad of Fez]], ask for [[Muhammad V of Granada]] help.

He also took over other Nasrid ports such as [[Marbella]] and [[Estepona]].\n*'''1411''' \u2013 The son of Yusuf III of Granada, Ahmad, recovered Marbella and Estepona. Next, it laid siege to Gibraltar (Sixth Siege of Gibraltar) and recovered the city for the kingdom of Granada.\n*'''1436''' \u2013 [[Enrique de Guzm\u00e1n]], second Count of Niebla, with large estates in Southern [[Andalusia]], assaulted Gibraltar. However, his attack was repelled and Castilian forces suffer heavy losses (Seventh Siege of Gibraltar).\n\n==Castilian/Spanish rule==\n*'''1462''' 20 August \u2013 Castilian forces captured Gibraltar (Eighth Siege of Gibraltar). (See [[Reconquista]]). An immediate dispute broke out between the [[House of Medina Sidonia]] (the Guzm\u00e1n family) and the [[House of Arcos]] (the Ponce de Le\u00f3n family) about the possession of the town. Finally, the initiative of Juan Alonso de Guzm\u00e1n, 1st [[Duke of Medina Sidonia]], succeeded and he took possession of the town as personal property. However, the King of Castile, [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]], declared Gibraltar to be Crown property and not the personal property of the Guzman family. Henry IV restored the charter granted to Gibraltar in 1310 and took two additional measures: the lands previously belonging to [[Algeciras]] (destroyed in 1369) were granted to Gibraltar; and the status of [[collegiate church]] was solicited from the pope [[Pius II]] and granted to the parish church of Saint Mary the Crowned ({{lang-es|link=no|iglesia parroquial de Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada}}), now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned]], on the site of the old main Moorish Mosque. [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard of Clairvaux]], whose feast falls on 20 August, became the [[Patron Saint]] of Gibraltar.\n*'''1463''' \u2013 In a tour through Andalusia, Henry IV was the first Christian monarch to visit Gibraltar.\n*'''1467''' July \u2013 In the midst of a nobility revolt against the King, the forces of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, after a 16-month siege, took Gibraltar.

The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Versailles]] which ceded [[Menorca]] and Florida to Spain, reaffirmed previous treaties in the rest of issues, thus not affecting to Gibraltar.\n:In 1782, work on the [[Great Siege Tunnels]] started. The tunnels became a great and complex system of underground fortifications which nowadays criss-crosses the inside of the Rock. Once the Siege was over, the fortifications were rebuilt and, in the following century, the walls were lined with [[Portland limestone]]. Such stone gave the walls their present white appearance.\n:The successful resistance in the Great Siege is attributed to several factors: the improvement in fortifications by Colonel (later General Sir) [[William Green (general)|William Green]] in 1769; the British naval supremacy, which translated into support of the Navy; the competent command by General [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Elliot]]; and an appropriately sized garrison.<ref>''Gibraltar: British or Spanish?'', pg. 8.</ref> As in the early years of the British period, during the Siege the British Government considered to exchange Gibraltar for some Spanish possession.

Several incidents took place during the [[Spanish Civil War]] which affected Gibraltar. In May 1937, [[HMS Arethusa (26)|HMS ''Arethusa'']] had to tow [[HMS Hunter (H35)|HMS ''Hunter'']] into port after ''Hunter'' hit a mine off [[Almeria]] that killed and wounded several [[Royal Navy|British sailors]]. In June 1937, the [[German pocket battleship Deutschland|German pocket battleship ''Deutschland'']] arrived in Gibraltar with dead and wounded after Republican planes bombed it in [[Ibiza]] in retaliation for the [[Condor Legion]]'s bombing of [[Guernica]]. In August 1938, the Republican destroyer ''[[Spanish destroyer Jos\u00e9 Luis D\u00edez|Jose Luis Diez]]'' took refuge in Gibraltar after taking casualties from the guns of the National cruiser ''Canarias''. The one incident that resulted in the death of [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] occurred on 31 January 1938 when the insurgent submarine ''[[Archimede class submarine|General Sanjurjo]]'' sank the SS ''Endymion'', a small Gibraltar-registered freighter taking a cargo of coal to [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], which was chartered by the Republican government.

Initially, in May 1940, 16,700 people went to [[French Morocco]]. However, after the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|French-German Armistice]] and the subsequent [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria]] by the British Navy in July 1940, the French-Moroccan authorities asked all Gibraltarian evacuees to be removed. 12,000 went to Britain, while about 3,000 went to [[Madeira]] or [[Jamaica]], with the rest moving to Spain or [[Tanger]]. Control of Gibraltar gave the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] control of the entry to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (the other side of the Strait being Spanish territory, and thus [[non-belligerent]]). The Rock was a key part of the Allied supply lines to [[Malta]] and North Africa and base of the British Navy [[Force H]], and prior to the war the [[racecourse]] on the isthmus was converted into an [[airbase]] and a concrete runway constructed (1938). The repatriation of the civilians started in 1944 and proceeded until 1951, causing considerable suffering and frustration. However, most of the population had returned by 1946.\n\n*'''1940''' 4 July \u2013 French bombers, based in French Morocco, carried out a retaliatory air raid over Gibraltar as a reprisal for the [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria]], by the Force H (about 1,300 French sailors were killed and about 350 were wounded in the action against the French fleet).\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Germany planned to occupy Gibraltar (and presumably hand it over to Spain{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}) in \"Operation Felix\" which was due to start on 10 January 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adolfhitler.ws/lib/proc/direct18.html |title=Operation Felix.

Straw visited Gibraltar to explain his ideas and was left in no doubt they had no support.\n*2002 \u2013 In November the Government of Gibraltar called [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|Gibraltar's second sovereignty referendum]] on the proposal, it achieved a turnout of 88% of which 98.97% of the electorate did not support the position taken by Mr Straw.\n\n:The actual voting was as follows: 18,176 voted representing 87.9% of the electorate. There were 89 papers spoilt of which 72 were blank 18,087 of which 187 Voted YES, and 17,900 voted NO.\n\n:The Referendum was supervised by a team of international observers headed by the Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]], who certified that it had been held fairly, freely and democratically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gibnet.com/texts/ref02or.pdf |title=Gibraltar Referendum Observers Report |date=December 2002 |accessdate=20 January 2006 |format=PDF |author=Committee of Observers |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060304033325/http://www.gibnet.com/texts/ref02or.pdf |archivedate = 4 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n*2002 \u2013 The [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]] made provision for the renaming of British Dependent Territories as [[British Overseas Territories]], which changed the status of Gibraltar to an Overseas Territory.

Most notably the [[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]] family which runs Gibraltar's largest law firm [[Hassans|Hassans International Law Firm]]<ref>Legal 500, 2009</ref> and the late [[Joshua Hassan|Sir Joshua Hassan]] who served four terms as Chief Minister for a total of 17 years.<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-joshua-hassan-1248542.html |title=Obituary: Sir Joshua Hassan |accessdate=23 November 2009 |last=Nash |first=Elizabeth |date=2 July 1997 |work=The Independent |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lV0KbHCi?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-joshua-hassan-1248542.html |archivedate=23 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Other groups===\nOther groups include:\n*[[Maltese people|Maltese]] were in the same imperial route to the east as Gibraltar.

Parliament at dusk.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Gibraltar Parliament]] Building at ''John Mackintosh Square''.]]\nThe [[Gibraltar Parliament]] (previously the House of Assembly) consists of seventeen elected members, and the Speaker. Under the electoral system of [[Plurality-at-large voting|partial bloc voting]] used since 1969, voters (since [[Gibraltar general election, 2007|2007]]) could choose up to ten candidates, who do not necessarily need to be from the same party (but usually are). The winning candidates are then chosen by simple plurality; consequently, a party seeking to form a government stands ten candidates, and the party that forms the government is usually successful in having all ten of its candidates elected; the remaining seats are usually won by the 'best loser' which then forms the opposition. The last election was held on 26 November 2015.\n\n==Governor==\n[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is represented by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, presently Lieutenant General [[Ed Davis (Royal Marines officer)|Edward Davis]] (sworn in 19 January 2016). After an election, the Governor appoints the leader of the largest party in the [[unicameral]] [[parliament]], as [[Chief Minister]]. The Governor is not involved in the day-to-day administration of Gibraltar, and his role is largely as a ceremonial head of state. The Governor is responsible for matters of defence and security only.\n\n==Political parties and general elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Gibraltar|Elections in Gibraltar}}\nThere are three political parties currently represented in the [[Gibraltar Parliament]]: [[Gibraltar Social Democrats]]; [[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party]]; and [[Gibraltar Liberal Party]].\nAll parties support Gibraltar's right to self-determination, and reject any concessions on the issue of sovereignty.\n\n===2003 election===\n{{Gibraltar legislative election, 2003}}\nSince the 2003 election the Reform Party has dissolved, with the party leader and others now involved in Friends of the Earth (Gibraltar). The Labour Party has merged with the Gibraltar Social Democrats.\n\nA new party, [[New Gibraltar Democracy]], announced it would contest the next election. NGD claimed that the two main parties were \"Out of touch with people's expectations and make up for their lack of ideas through Orwellian style propaganda.\" At the 2007 election one candidate, [[Charles Gomez]], stood for election for the party. It achieved under 1% of the vote and has subsequently ceased any activity.\n\nIn June 2006 the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Gibraltar)|Progressive Democratic Party]] (PDP) was formed and announced it would be presenting a full slate of candidates and had entered the political arena as \"a fresh, positive and modern alternative,\" to both the ruling Gibraltar Social Democrats and the Opposition GSLP/Liberals. However. in the 2007 election it only presented six candidates.\n\n===2007 election===\n{{Gibraltar legislative election, 2007}}\n\n===2011 election===\n{{Gibraltar legislative election, 2011}}\n\n===2013 by-election===\n{{Gibraltar by-election, 2013}}\n\nIn August 2013, the PDP has dissolved after a series of disappointing election results.\n\n===2015 election===\n{{Gibraltar legislative election, 2015}}\n\n==European Parliament elections==\n{{Main article|European Parliament election, 2004 (Gibraltar)|European Parliament election, 2009 (Gibraltar)|European Parliament election, 2014 (Gibraltar)}}\nAlthough part of the EU under the British Treaty of accession, Gibraltar had not voted in elections for the [[European Parliament]] although its membership of the European Union meant it was affected by European Union law. A ten-year campaign to acquire the vote culminated in the case of [[Matthews v. United Kingdom]]. Denise Matthews, a British Citizen resident in Gibraltar, claimed that the exclusion of the Gibraltar electorate from enfranchisement in the European Parliamentary elections was a breach of human rights. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] decided in her favour, ruling that the European Parliament formed a part of Gibraltar's legislature and held that the UK was bound by its conventions to secure the right for the people of Gibraltar to elect the European Parliament.<ref name='Explanatory Notes'>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/en/ukpgaen_20030007_en_1 |title=Explanatory Notes to European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003 |accessdate=2010-02-13 |date=2003-05-13 |publisher=The Office of Public Sector Information |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nV449KnM?url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/en/ukpgaen_20030007_en_1 |archivedate=2010-02-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The UK Government passed the [[European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003|European Parliament (Representation) Act]] in 2003 in order to comply with the ruling.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] took 69.52% of the vote, which has generally been interpreted as a protest against the handling of Gibraltar by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>[http://www.conservatives.gi/election.htm Conservative landslide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526092322/http://www.conservatives.gi/election.htm |date=2011-05-26 }}</ref> The Conservatives also campaigned strongly, with the support of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050926182652/http://www.conservatives.gi/ Gibraltar branch of the party] and a visit from the party leader [[Michael Howard]].\n\nIn 2009, the Conservatives again topped the poll with 54% but in contrast to 2004 the turnout at 35% was much lower, being comparable to other EU states.<ref>[http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=16340 EU election 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610233104/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=16340 |date=2009-06-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat Party]] topped the poll, but the votes cast in South West England resulted in the none of the Liberal Democrat candidates becoming MEPs.

There were some differences between the draft constitution and the one to which the UK agreed, namely that the Governor's title would remain unchanged, and that the Police Authority would remain independent of the Government of Gibraltar.\n\n===2006 Constitution===\n{{Main article|Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006|Gibraltarian constitutional referendum, 2006}}\n\nIn December 2006 Gibraltar was granted a new constitution, providing a modern constitutional relationship between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, not based on colonialism. The constitution does not in any way diminish British sovereignty of Gibraltar, and the United Kingdom retains its full internal responsibility for Gibraltar, including Gibraltar\u2019s external relations and defence, and the Member State responsible for Gibraltar in the European Union.\n\nWriting to the Spanish Foreign Minister, [[Jack Straw]] stated:\n\n: \"My own view [is] that the label \"colonial\" is misleading and anachronistic in this context; regardless of the United Nations dimension. As [[Peter Caruana]] and I said in our joint statement on Monday, the new Constitution provides for \"a modern and mature\" relationship between the UK and Gibraltar. I do not think that this description would apply to any relationship based on colonialism.\"<ref name=\"gibraltar.gi\">http://www.gibraltar.gi/locals/news.php?action=view_article&article=850</ref>\n\nAfter several months of political wrangling, the Gibraltar Government published the draft Constitution Order, which includes the existing preamble promising that there would be no transfer of sovereignty against the wishes of the Gibraltarians and a new addition explaining the status.<ref>http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/constitution.php</ref>\n\n: ''\"Whereas Gibraltar is part of Her Majesty\u2019s dominions and Her Majesty\u2019s Government have given assurances to the people of Gibraltar that Gibraltar will remain part of Her Majesty\u2019s dominions unless and until an Act of Parliament otherwise provides, and furthermore that Her Majesty\u2019s Government will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes:\n\n: ''\"And whereas the people of Gibraltar have in a referendum held on [date] freely approved and accepted the Constitution annexed to this Order which gives the people of Gibraltar that degree of self-government which is compatible with British Sovereignty of Gibraltar and with the fact that the UK remains fully responsible for Gibraltar\u2019s external relations.\n\nThe proposal was put to the people in a [[Gibraltarian constitutional referendum, 2006|referendum]] and approved. The constitution took effect in 2007 and 29 January declared a public holiday in celebration.\n\n===Integration with the UK===\nVarious groups in Gibraltar have campaigned in favour of a far closer relationship with Britain, in the form of devolved integration or incorporation into the Britain itself. This is similar to the offer made to [[Malta]] in 1955, under which Malta would be represented in the [[British House of Commons]] and be placed under the [[Home Office]], while retaining internal self-government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Malta (Round Table Conference) \u2013 HC Deb 26 March 1956 vol 550 cc1778-931|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1956/mar/26/malta-round-table-conference|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> This would be a similar status to [[France]]'s [[overseas department]]s and to [[Spain]]'s [[North Africa]]n [[enclave]]s, [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], claimed by [[Morocco]]. One of Spain's arguments in rejecting comparisons between Gibraltar and these territories is that they are part of Spain, whereas Gibraltar is a [[British overseas territory]] and not part of the UK.<ref>[http://www.panorama.gi/archive/030609/updates.htm Spanish anger at MacShane\u2019s comments], ''[[Panorama (Gibraltar)|Panorama]]'', 9 September 2003</ref>\n\nHowever, the British [[Foreign Office]] rejected the idea in 1976, along with independence, on the grounds that any further constitutional reform or decolonisation would have to take into account the so-called \"Spanish dimension\".<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1976/aug/03/gibraltar ''Hansard'' 3 August 1976 Written Answers (House of Commons) \u2192 Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]</ref> Similarly, this has also been opposed by governments in Gibraltar itself; in its election manifesto in 2003, the [[Gibraltar Social Democrats]] argued that integration would \"necessarily involve the loss of a significant degree of this vital self-government\" and \"would simply hand power over our vital affairs (and therefore our ability to survive) to people in London.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050309163601/http://www.gsd.gi/2003/gsd2003.pdf The 2003 Manifesto], [[Gibraltar Social Democrats]]</ref>\n\nWhile there is still attachment to the idea of Gibraltar being British, some, like leader of the [[Liberal Party of Gibraltar|Liberal Party]], [[Joseph Garcia (Gibraltarian politician)|Joseph Garcia]], see the Rock's future as being within a larger 'Europe of the Regions', rather than as part of one nation state or another.<ref>[http://www.panorama.gi/archive/040413/updates.htm Garcia seeks place for Gibraltar in EU committee of the regions], ''[[Panorama (Gibraltar)|Panorama]]'', 13 April 2004</ref>\n\n===Condominium===\nThe idea of a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]], with sovereignty over Gibraltar shared between the UK and Spain, has been proposed. In 1985, during talks with British Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]], Spanish Foreign Minister [[Fernando Mor\u00e1n (politician)|Fernando Mor\u00e1n]] proposed a condominium or leaseback period of between 15 and 20 years, before Spain regained full sovereignty, but this received no reply from the British government.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Stone in Spain's Shoe: The Search for a Solution to the Problem of Gibraltar |last=Gold |first=Peter |year=1994 |publisher=Liverpool University Press, 1994 |isbn= 978-0-853-23219-3  |pages=66\u2013112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kd4YVPa0lNkC&pg=PA187&dq=Gibraltar+Peter+Gold&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwias5HJuoHLAhVEPxQKHfaYBYcQ6AEIIzAB#v=snippet&q=condominium&f=false |accessdate=2016-02-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the Spanish Prime Minister, [[Felipe Gonzalez]], was reported to have proposed a plan for joint sovereignty, under which Gibraltar would become effectively autonomous, with the British and Spanish monarchs as joint heads of state, but this was rejected by the Government of Gibraltar in July of that year.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C&lpg=PA4466&ots=mTGlFOrxCg&dq=gibraltar%20british%20and%20spanish%20monarchs%20%22as%20joint%20heads%20of%20state%22&pg=PA4466#v=onepage&q=gibraltar%20british%20and%20spanish%20monarchs%20%22as%20joint%20heads%20of%20state%22&f=true ''The Europa World Year: Kazakhstan - Zimbabwe''], Taylor & Francis, 2004, page 4466</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the then Spanish Foreign Minister [[Abel Matutes]] put forward a proposal for joint sovereignty over Gibraltar, which also entailed full Spanish sovereignty after a transitional period, but his British counterpart, [[Robin Cook]], stated that there was \"no question of compromise on sovereignty\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? |last=Gold |first=Peter |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-34795-2 |page=194  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b6SgDQvP3zMC&lpg=PP1&dq=peter%20gold%20gibraltar&pg=PA194#v=onepage&q=matutes%20proposals&f=true |accessdate=2016-02-18}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the co-principality of [[Andorra]], in which the [[President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]] are joint heads of state, has been suggested as a model for Gibraltar, in 2010, its then Chief Minister, Peter Caruana, argued that this was not a case of joint sovereignty between [[Spain]] and [[France]], as under Andorra's 1993 [[Constitution of Andorra|Constitution]], neither country exercised sovereignty over the Principality.<ref>[https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/new/sites/default/files/Press%20archives/Press%20Releases/2010/319-2010.pdf Statement by the Chief Minister, Peter Caruana], 1 December 2010</ref>\n\n==United Nations==\nGibraltar was caught unawares when the whole issue of the relationship between the territory and the UK, as well as the question of Spain was brought before the [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]], otherwise known as the ''Committee of 24'', in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|url=|last=Garcia|first=Dr. Joseph H.|authorlink=Joseph Garcia (Gibraltarian politician)|title=The Modern Political and Constitutional Development of Gibraltar, 1940 - 1988|publisher=University of Hull|year=1991|pages=153}}</ref>\n\nResolution 2231 (XXI), which formed part of the Spanish claim, stated that \"any colonial situation which partially or completely destroys the national unity and territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\"<ref>[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/005/34/IMG/NR000534.pdf?OpenElement Resolution 2231 (XXI).

This day is now celebrated as Gibraltar's National Day. In a referendum organised by the Government of Gibraltar on 7 November 2002, voters overwhelmingly rejected the principle that Spain and the United Kingdom should share sovereignty over Gibraltar, by 17,900 votes to 187 on a turnout of almost 88%.<ref>http://www.electionguide.org/results.php?ID=483</ref>\n\nUnlike most other British territories, Gibraltar has not been offered independence by the UK. It has been suggested that this is on the grounds that the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], under which Spain ceded the territory to the British Crown, states that, if the British Crown should ever wish to dispose of Gibraltar, it must first be offered to Spain. However, the Government of Gibraltar has pointed out at the UN that Article 103 of the UN Charter overrules and annuls this \"reversionary clause\".\n\nNeither the United Kingdom nor Spain seem keen to test the legal status of [[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht]] in court. The remaining parts of the treaty that regulated such things as the [[slave trade]], and the transfer of [[Menorca]] to the British, have become obsolete.\n\nSpain argues that Gibraltar's status is an anachronism, and that it should become an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community of Spain]], similar to [[Catalonia]] or the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. It also argues that the principle of [[territorial integrity]], not [[self-determination]] applies, drawing parallels with the British handover of [[Hong Kong]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997. The ''Junta de Andalucia'' (Andalucia's elected regional government) believes that Gibraltar should be integrated into its regional autonomy.\n\nAt the same time, the British government continues to state that there can be no change in the status of Gibraltar without their democratic consent&nbsp;.<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060327/wmstext/60327m02.htm Statement in the UK Parliament]</ref>\n\nThe Gibraltarian government has asked the UN Committee of 24 to refer the issues to the [[International Court of Justice]] for an advisory opinion, but Spain has lobbied against this. The government of Gibraltar has also invited the Committee to visit the territory, but so far, despite no objection from the United Kingdom, they have not done so.<ref>[https://www.un.org/press/en/2005/gacol3119.doc.htm] GIBRALTAR PETITIONERS TELL DECOLONIZATION COMMITTEE SOVEREIGNTY DISPUTE BETWEEN SPAIN, UK SHOULD NOT DISPLACE RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION, GA/COL/3119, 7 June 2005</ref>\n\nThe [[Gibraltarian constitutional referendum, 2006|2006 constitution]] further increases the level of [[self-governance|self-government]] in the territory, and the colonial status of Gibraltar is now considered to be over.

Executive Summary (page 6)</ref>\n{{quote|<!--Material utilized from this document must be used verbatim, though text may be omitted if clearly marked in accordance with WP:NFC-->\n* The Gibraltar economy has a significant and positive economic impact on the Campo de Gibraltar [[comarca|region]] when considered from the point of view of net recurrent expenditure.\n* In 2007 Gibraltar businesses imported more than \u00a3174m of goods and services from Spain (excluding [[petroleum]] imports).\n* Spanish frontier workers earned almost 243m in 2007 and this money was repatriated and spent in the Campo de Gibraltar region to generate further rounds of economic activity.\n* Other frontier workers (excluding Spanish and Gibraltarian) earned \u00a382.8m from within the economy of Gibraltar.\n* The number of jobs supported by the Gibraltar economy (within Gibraltar) is equivalent to 18% of the total 102,468 jobs recorded in the Campo de Gibraltar region in 2007.\n* Residents of Gibraltar spent almost \u00a330m on shopping, food and other goods and services, in Spain, during 2007.\n* Gibraltarians with second homes in the Campo de Gibraltar spent more than \u00a333.5m in the Spanish economy during 2007.\n* Gibraltar's economy increased the level of output in the Campo de Gibraltar in 2007 by \u00a3301.745m. Total visitor spending in Gibraltar in 2007 was \u00a3230.6m of which \u00a3176m was by visitors across the land frontier. Of this \u00a3176m land frontier visitor expenditure, some \u00a3112.4m was attributable to Campo de Gibraltar residents and a further \u00a321.27m is assumed to be displacement from the Spanish economy, leaving a total net direct output effect of \u00a3168m from recurrent spending (\u00a3302m-\u00a3134m).\n* In 2007 the \u00a3302m direct output effect of the Gibraltar economy on the Campo de Gibraltar economy was responsible for a direct increase in [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) within the Campo de Gibraltar region of \u00a3195m.\n* Using the [[Andalusia]] Regional Input-Output model to estimate the secondary effects of the two economies' interaction, the Gibraltar economy was responsible for a further increase in GDP in the Campo de Gibraltar region of \u00a3125m, resulting in a total increase in GDP of just over \u00a3420m.\n* The Gibraltar economy was responsible for approximately 12.2% of the total GDP in the Campo de Gibraltar in 2007.\n* In terms of a further wealth effect created by the Gibraltar economy, the evidence would seem to suggest that property values within the Campo de Gibraltar region have increased by up to 40% because of the proximity to Gibraltar. With just over 86,000 households in the region and using a conservative property value (at 2007 prices) this could account for an increase in Campo de Gibraltar asset values of somewhere between \u00a31.4 to \u00a35.4 billion. The reason for such large variation is explained partly through the lack of data that are available without undertaking a detailed survey and partly because of the volatility experienced by the Spanish housing market over the past year, where property prices, particularly in some areas, have fallen dramatically. In part this fall in property prices is explained by the general economic downturn being experienced by the global economy and in part by the effect of the falling [[pound sterling]] with respect to the value of the [[euro]] which will have put further downward pressure on property prices in the region.\n* Gibraltar also imported approximately 1.5m tonnes of petroleum products from the Campo de Gibraltar region for bunkering during 2007 and the value of this has not been included in the analyses. If the value of this fuel is included as an import from the Campo de Gibraltar it adds almost another \u00a3300m to the impact of Gibraltar on the region, [using Meyrick and Associates of fuel bunker prices for this period and a GBP to [[United States dollar|USD]] exchange rate of 0.5049 being the mid-point in 2007].\n}}<!--Material must be used verbatim, though text may be omitted if clearly marked in accordance with WP:NFC-->\n\n==Taxation==\n{{main|Taxation in Gibraltar}}\n\n== Various economic indicators by national origin ==\n\nThe average annual earnings of [[Indo-Gibraltarians]] is nearly twice that of the rest of [[Gibraltarian people]] and approximately 1.5 times that of [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|immigrants in the UK]], thus making people of Indian descent by far the most economically affluent [[ethnic group]] in Gibraltar.<ref>[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/ Government of Gibraltar Website]</ref>\n\n{| style=\"background:none;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the 1970s there were three generations of automatic telephone exchange equipment in use with four and five digit numbers. The volume of calls grew and a [[System X (telephony)|System X]] digital exchange was installed.\n\nUntil 1990, all telephone services were operated by the [[Gibraltar Government Telephone Department]]. International circuits were provided by [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]], present in Gibraltar since 1870 as the Falmouth, Malta, Gibraltar Telegraph Company. However, Cable & Wireless left Gibraltar in 1987.<ref>[http://www.slideshare.net/edapress/expansion-2567633 Gibtelecom acaba de lanzar el roaming de prepago con Vodafone], EDA Press (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])</ref> On 1 January 1988, [[British Telecom]] (BT) and the Government of Gibraltar formed a joint venture company called [[Gibraltar Telecommunications International Ltd]] (known by its commercial brand [[Gibtel]]) to operate Gibraltar's international telecommunications services.<ref>[http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/BTsHistory/1984onwards/1988.htm BT Archives: 1988]</ref> Gibtel was subsequently granted a licence to offer mobile telephony introducing a [[GSM frequency bands#GSM-900, GSM-1800 and EGSM/EGSM-900|GSM900]] network.\n\nIn 1990, the Government decided to [[privatise]] its Telephone Department and therefore entered into a joint venture with [[Nynex]] of the [[United States]]. [[Gibraltar Nynex Communications Ltd]] (GNC) became responsible for [[landline|fixed-line telephony]].

Both companies subsequently merged to form [[Gibtelecom]], a joint venture between the Government of Gibraltar and Nynex's successor company, [[Verizon]].

[[Telephone plug|Telephone jack]]s are also [[British Standard]] [[British telephone sockets|BS 6312]], as opposed to the [[RJ11, RJ14, RJ25|RJ11]] versions found in other parts of Europe and the world.\n\n===Numbering plan===\n{{main|Telephone numbers in Gibraltar}}\n\n'''[[List of country calling codes|Calling code]]:''' +350\n\n=== Telecom dispute ===\n{{main|Telecom dispute between Gibraltar and Spain}}\n\n[[Telecommunication]] services in Gibraltar were subject to [[Telecom dispute between Gibraltar and Spain|Spanish restrictions]] until 10 February 2007. Subsequent to the resolution of the dispute, the Gibraltar telephone numbering plan has been increased to eight digits for land lines, adding a prefix of 200 to the existing Gibtelecom five digit numbers which is required to be dialled from October 2008.\n\nGibtelecom was also prevented from having roaming agreements with Spanish [[GSM]] networks so its mobile phones did not operate in Spain. Gibtelecom had roaming arrangements with local GSM networks in most other countries. After the [[C\u00f3rdoba Agreement]], Gibtel (Gibtelecom's mobile service) could roam on Spanish network [[Movistar]] ([[Telefonica]]). As of recent customers can now roam on [[Vodafone Spain|Vodafone]] and [[Yoigo]]. [[Orange Espa\u00f1a|Orange]] still (September 2008) identifies as AMENA and does not allow Gibraltar phones to register.\n\n==Fixed line services==\nIn the 1980s there was a shortage of local line capacity on the existing crossbar exchange, which itself had replaced the relay and [[Strowger switch]] exchanges and a modern digital System/X switch was installed.\n\nCable and Wireless, who provided international circuits installed a satellite earth station which made [[International Subscriber Dialling]] possible.\n\nWhen the frontier with Spain was re-opened, telephone and telex circuits cut by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]] were re-established. Subsequently, fibre links into the [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe|FLAG]] cable system (which had a landing point in [[Estepona]], about 50&nbsp;km from Gibraltar) were established and along with microwave links to [[Morocco]] giving Gibraltar a resilient communications infrastructure.  Gibtelecom is also a partner in the [[EIG (cable system)|EIG]] cable system, which will have a landing point in Gibraltar.\n\nProvision for [[Local Loop Unbundling]] was introduced in Gibraltar, under the 2006 Communications Act, similar to the UK's 2003 Communications Act. Earlier in December 2005, the [[European Commission]] initiated the second stage of infringement proceedings against the [[British Government]] relating to Gibraltar's failure to transpose five [[European Union]] directives on electronic communications, but these were closed after the relevant legislation was passed into law by the then [[Gibraltar Parliament|House of Assembly]] in June 2006.<ref>[http://www.offshore-e-com.com/asp/story/story.asp?storyname=22104 EC Pressures UK Over Gibraltar's Failure To Transpose Telecom Laws]</ref>\n\nFixed line numbers are now eight digits, with Gibtelecom numbers being prefixed with '''200'''.

In 2005 it merged with Broadband Gibraltar Limited to form Sapphire Networks Limited. Sapphire have their own redundant fibre and microwave infrastructure into and around Gibraltar.\n\nSapphire uses the Gibtelecom [[ADSL]] concentrator to reach customers that are outside their own network, and sells high-bandwidth Internet services and Internet connectivity, competing directly with Gibtelecom.\n\n'''GNC Networks''', a wholly owned subsidiary of Gibraltar Nynex Communications, commenced services in 1997. GNC Networks was renamed Gibconnect and the parent company became Gibraltar Telecommunications International Limited, which is referred to as Gibtelecom, in 2002. [[ADSL]] services were introduced in 2002, by 2005, there were several thousand users. The company is co-owned by the Government of Gibraltar and Slovenia Telecom.\n\nIn 2000, the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority issued Ladbrokes, who then operated Gibraltar's biggest call centre, with a licence to establish their own internet services.

In the 1960s it became a weekly newspaper. When the [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|border between Spain and Gibraltar was eventually closed]] by the Spanish dictator in 1969, the newspaper changed its ownership and begun to be published in English.

Gibraltar has ten fuelling stations, and fuel prices are lower than in neighbouring Spain. Some people from Spain even enter Gibraltar for the sole purpose of filling their cars' fuel tanks.\n\nGibraltar's international vehicle registration is GBZ, and [[Gibraltar car number plates]] consist of the letter 'G' followed by up to five digits (1-99999) or four digits (1000-9999) and a single letter. These are as standard, the same shape, type face and colours as those in the UK, however non-standard number plates have been permitted.

There are two companies who provide stage-carriage bus services in Gibraltar: Gibraltar Bus Company Limited and Calypso Transport Limited. The Gibraltar Bus Company is 100% owned by the Government of Gibraltar and operates all but one of the services here. Calypso Transport operates the other, linking the city centre with the airport and the Frontier (border with Spain).\n\nThe Gibraltar Bus Company operates Services 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 & 9 with its distinct fleet of modern, blue buses. The company has a total of 21 vehicles in its [[bus]] fleet, 18 of which are the [[Dennis Dart]] low-floor midibus with Caetano Nimbus bodies and featuring 28 seats and 3 [[Mercedes-Benz]] Sprinter minibuses with Unvi bodies and catering for 15 seated passengers. The Darts entered service the day the company was officially formed, Saturday 10 April 2004, when it took over the operation of private company Rock City Services Limited, who had been unwilling to invest in its fleet. The trio of Sprinters entered service during November 2010 and operate Service 1 to the Moorish Castle Estate in the Upper Town area of the city. This route is well worth travelling in order to see how narrow and winding the roads are in this part of town. The latest timetable is dated 1 September 2012.\n\nCalypso Transport Ltd operates Service 5 between the Frontier (the land border with Spain), the airport and the city centre and tickets between this route and those operated by the Gibraltar Bus Company are not inter-changeable. An adult single fare on either operators' services currently costs \u00a31.00 and an all-day Hoppa ticket costs \u00a31.50.

Many taxis cater specifically for tours of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve and these can be picked up from the frontier or the city centre, however, taxi drivers are also obliged to take standard fares as well as tours.\n\n==Rail==\n\n===Historical===\nThere are no extant railways in Gibraltar. There was formerly an extensive railway within the Gibraltar Dockyard, and neighbouring works and storage facilities. It included tunnels, one of which went through the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], and is still in use today as a road tunnel. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries there was also a temporary industrial railway in Gibraltar. At the period when both railways were operational, it was possible to travel right round the entire coastline of Gibraltar by train.<ref>[http://www.foghs.org.uk/nl/67.pdf Friends of Gibraltar Heritage Society], December 2003, pp 7-8, ptovide full details.</ref> The dockyard railway had a roster of 17 locomotives, distinguished by numbers, but four of which also carried names: ''Gibraltar'', ''[[Catalan Bay|Catalan]]'', ''Rosia'', and ''[[Mons Calpe|Calpe]]''.\n\n===Access to the rail system in Spain===\nWhilst railway track extends to the outskirts of [[La Linea de la Concepcion|La Linea]] from the aborted [[San Roque-La L\u00ednea railway]] line expansion project in the 1970s,<ref>http://www.europasur.es/article/lalinea/835676/la/linea/lleva/mas/ochenta/anos/esperando/pase/primer/tren.html</ref><ref>https://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.175256,-5.359137</ref> the nearest actual railway station (in Spain) is ''\"[[San Roque station|San Roque - La L\u00ednea]]\"'' station on the [[Adif|ADIF]] [[Algeciras-Bobadilla railway]] line Junction via [[Ronda]].\n\nUntil 1969 a ferry from Gibraltar provided convenient access to Algeciras station, which along with the railway line to Ronda was built by a British company known as the [[Algeciras Gibraltar Railway Company]].\n\n===Access to the rail system in Morocco===\nFerries by ''FRS'' running twice a week from Gibraltar to [[Tanger-Med]] port provide access to the [[Rail transport in Morocco|Moroccan railway]] system.<ref>http://goafrica.about.com/od/morocco/a/moroctraveltips_2.htm</ref><ref>http://www.seat61.com/Morocco.htm</ref>\n\n==Sea==\n[[File:Gibraltar navy.jpg|thumb|left|Gibraltar's [[Royal Navy Dockyard|Royal Navy Base]].]]\n[[File:Aurora gib.jpg|thumb|{{MV|Aurora|2000}} at the berthed adjacent to the [[Gibraltar Cruise Terminal]] at the Western Arm of the [[North Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|North Mole]].]]\nBeing a [[peninsula]], the sea has long been vital to Gibraltar's transport links. The [[Royal Navy Dockyard]] was formerly Gibraltar's major employer. There is still a [[Gibraltar Harbour|harbour]] on the [[Gibraltar west|west side]] of the territory. The Gibraltar-registered merchant marine consists of 26 ships of 1000 tonnes and above. There is an irregular direct regular fast [[ferry]] service to [[Tanger-Med]] port, [[Morocco]] but many passengers now travel from [[Algeciras]] or [[Tarifa]] due to a more regular service being present at those ports.\n\nThe ferry between Gibraltar and Algeciras, which existed until 1969, when communications with Spain were severed by the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]], was reopened on 16 December 2009, served by the Spanish company [[Transcoma]],<ref>[http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=17969 New ferry 'repairs 40 year gap' says Spanish Diplomat], ''[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]'', December 17, 2009</ref> which used a [[catamaran]], ''[[Punta Europa Segundo]]'' in memory of the original ferry that served the cross-Bay route in the 1960s. The maritime operations of Transcoma were taken over by [[Grupo Medex]] on 10 November 2010, which announced a higher-capacity new ship for 2011.<ref>[http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=20448 Gib Ferry Company Taken Over], ''[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]'', November 10, 2010</ref>\n\nVarious [[cruise liner]]s visit the [[Port of Gibraltar]] throughout the year, and dock at the [[Gibraltar Cruise Terminal]] on the Western Arm of the [[North Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|North Mole]]. This provides the means of transport for a significant proportion of [[day-tripper]] tourists arriving in the territory.\n\n==Air==\nOne of the first seaplanes ([[Wight Seaplane]]) to come to Gibraltar was during world war 1, which was used to search for submarine.\n\nIn 1931 the seaplane [[Saro Windhover]] Captained by [[Edgar Percival]] for [[GB Airways]] was the first of regular passenger flights from Gibraltar to Morocco. If there was a [[Levant (wind)]], then the seaplane would land on an aerodrome in Morocco instead of Tangier harbour.\n\n[[File:Gibraltar Airport Main Highway.jpg|right|thumb|Gibraltar airfield and border area. Showing runway (Gibraltar) and pier behind (Spain).  Officially, any [[Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain|exact line is still disputed]]]]\nWork began in 1939 to build what is today [[Gibraltar Airport]] and is the territory's only [[airport]]. It is situated very close to the border with Spain. [[Winston Churchill Avenue]] the road which runs from the [[Gibraltar\u2013Spain border]], crosses the runway, requiring the road to be closed each time an aircraft lands or takes off. Scheduled civilian passenger flights are operated by [[EasyJet]], [[British Airways]] and [[Royal Air Maroc]].\n\nFollowing an agreement signed in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] between the Governments of the United Kingdom, Spain and Gibraltar in September 2006, the use of Gibraltar Airport by both Gibraltarian and Spanish services was agreed. Gibraltar Airport will be adapted to have an entrance from Spain (as well as Gibraltar), in a similar manner to Basel and Geneva airports (which are also adjacent to borders).\n\nIberia commenced direct flights between [[Madrid]] and Gibraltar on 16 December 2006 with [[GB Airways]] following on 1 May 2007. However, [[GB Airways]] discontinued their Madrid service on 30 September 2007 and Iberia subsequently considered using smaller aircraft, possibly from its [[Air Nostrum]] regional partner \u2014 indicating that neither operator may have been able to fill their planes with passengers. Iberia eventually withdrew its service in September 2008. In 2009 [[\u00c1ndalus L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas]] started flights between Gibraltar and Madrid. However, on 13 August 2010, the airline ceased operations because the Spanish aviation authorities withdrew their licence.\n\nFollowing the takeover by EasyJet, GB Airways dropped its direct Gibraltar\u2013[[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] service on 28 October 2006<ref>Gibraltar News Online, [http://www.gibraltarnewsonline.com/2006/07/21/gb-airways-drop-gib-heathrow-route-this-winter/ GB Airways drop Gib-Heathrow route this Winter]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> despite apparently remaining popular.  The reason cited by GB Airways was the \"convenience of\" concentrating all its London services onto a single hub at [[Gatwick]].  Later, a sale of several of GB Airways' Heathrow [[landing slots|slots]] is believed to have netted GB Airways with up to \u00a380m.<ref>Gibraltar News, [http://www.gibfocus.gi/details_todaysnews.php?id=3058 GB Airways sells Heathrow slots for \u00a380 million]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> In late 2007 GB Airways was bought by EasyJet (and thus ceased to be a [[British Airways]] franchise partner); all flights were rebranded as EasyJet in 2008.\n\nFlights are available from Gibraltar to [[London Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick]], [[London Luton]] restarting December 2018, [[Bristol Airport|Bristol]], [[Casablanca Airport|Casablanca]], [[Tangier Ibn Battouta Airport|Tangier]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] airports. During 2012 [[bmibaby]] offered a service to [[East Midlands airport]], but the airline ceased operations in September 2012.\n\n==Cable car==\n{{Main|Gibraltar Cable Car}}\n[[File:Gibraltar Cable Car 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Gibraltar's cable car.]]\nA [[aerial tramway|cable car]] runs from just south of the city centre to the [[Gibraltar Barbary Macaques|Ape's Den]] and the Top of the Rock, which despite its name is actually the second highest peak of the Rock.\n\n==Dispute with Spain==\n{{See also|Disputed status of Gibraltar}}\nThe road crossing into Spain was closed by the Spanish authorities in 1969 and only reopened for pedestrians in 1982 and for vehicles in 1985.\n\nA ferry operated between [[Algeciras]] and Gibraltar until 1969. For a few months in 2004 Spain banned cruise ships which had visited Gibraltar from going to Spanish ports on the same journey. In 2003, the land frontier was closed for a day by Spain on the grounds that a visiting cruise liner, the [[MV Aurora|MV ''Aurora'']], was affected by contagious food poisoning.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3237235.stm MV Aurora - Fury over Gibraltar border closure]</ref> No cases in Gibraltar were reported.\n\nThe airport is built on the [[Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain|isthmus]] which the Spanish Government claim not to have been ceded in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], thus the integration of [[Gibraltar Airport]] in the [[Single European Sky]] system has been blocked by Spain. The 1987 agreement for joint control of the airport with Spain was rejected by the then Government of Gibraltar. All successive Governments of Gibraltar have rejected it, although welcoming joint use of the airport (which being next to the border could operate in a similar manner to [[Geneva Airport]] or [[Basel Airport]]). Following the ''[[Cordoba Agreement]]'' (between the UK, Spain and Gibraltar) in 2006, the joint use of the airport was finally agreed.\n\nThe road crossing from Gibraltar into Spain can often be subject to long delays. A loop road is located next to the border to hold cars waiting in the queue to cross into Spain. Motorists (and sometimes pedestrians) crossing the border are randomly subjected to long delays and searches by the Spanish authorities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Transport in Gibraltar}}\n\n{{Gibraltar topics}}\n{{Transport in Europe}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transport In Gibraltar}}\n[[Category:Transport in Gibraltar| ]]\n[[Category:Transport in British Overseas Territories|Gibraltar]]", "sha1": "mm25qeegpeps2e2d5saanm9dklyht39"}}, {"title": "Military of Gibraltar", "ns": "0", "id": "12085", "redirect": {"title": "Gibraltar"}, "revision": {"id": "829459814", "parentid": "731194345", "timestamp": "2018-03-08T19:46:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "Add template to categorize redirect using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Gibraltar#Armed forces]]\n\n{{R to section}}", "sha1": "dyzizd3wt07coqa52d9an0l6jd7hy8w"}}, {"title": "Foreign relations of Gibraltar", "ns": "0", "id": "12086", "redirect": {"title": "Disputed status of Gibraltar"}, "revision": {"id": "61223718", "parentid": "15909794", "timestamp": "2006-06-29T16:57:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "AnonMoos", "id": "21047"}, "comment": "more specific link", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Disputed status of Gibraltar]]", "sha1": "1120v8leje050hzrc58lcueoibmfo3s"}}, {"title": "Glorioso Islands", "ns": "0", "id": "12087", "revision": {"id": "821061583", "parentid": "816925275", "timestamp": "2018-01-18T05:10:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "Gothamscholar", "id": "7738417"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* History */ Verb tense correction.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Glorioso Islands\n|native_name = ''\u00celes Glorieuses''\n|common_name = Archipel des Glorieuses\n|image_flag = Flag of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.svg\n|image_coat =\n|symbol_type = Coat of arms\n|national_motto = ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]''<br />{{small|\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"}}\n|national_anthem = ''[[La Marseillaise]]''\n|image_map = Iles eparses de l'ocean Indien.svg\n|map_caption = Location of the [[Scattered islands in the Indian Ocean]]. <div style=\"text-align:left;margin-left:8.0em;\">{{unbulleted list |1.

In 2012, France founded ''parc naturel marin des Glorieuses'', a [[marine protected area]], to preserve the endangered flora and fauna of the islands. The Glorieuses have an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) of {{Convert|48350|km2|sqmi}}. There are anchorages offshore, and Grande Glorieuse has a {{Convert|1300|m|ft|adj=on}} long [[airstrip]].\n\nThe [[archipelago]] consists of two islands, Grande Glorieuse ({{Coord|11|34|46.54|S|47|17|54.14|E|type:isle|name=Grande Glorieuse}}) and [[\u00cele du Lys]], as well as eight rock islets (''Roches Vertes''): Wreck Rock ({{Coord|11|30|45.19|S|47|22|54.17|E|type:isle|name=Wreck Rock}}), South Rock ({{Coord|11|35|43.76|S|47|18|6.66|E|type:isle|name=South Rock}}) and Verte Rocks ({{Coord|11|34|15.63|S|47|19|54.18|E|type:isle|name=Verte Rocks}}) and three others that are unnamed.

Other major cities around the gulf include [[Helsinki]] and [[Tallinn]]. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Primorsk]]). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:la2-demis-gulf-of-finland.png|thumb|Gulf of Finland|300px]]\n[[File:Record sea ice in Gulf of Finland 2003.jpg|thumb|Satellite image showing the gulf entirely frozen over in January 2003.]]\n\nThe area of the gulf is {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207525/Gulf-of-Finland Gulf of Finland] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> The length (from the [[Hanko Peninsula]] to Saint Petersburg) is {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and the width varies from {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} near the entrance to {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}} on the meridian of [[Moshchny Island]]; in the [[Neva Bay]], it decreases to {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}}. The gulf is relatively shallow with the depth decreasing from the entrance to the gulf to the continent. The sharpest change occurs near [[Narva-J\u00f5esuu]], which is why this place is called Narva wall. The average depth is {{convert|38|m|abbr=on}} with the maximum of {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}}. The depth of the Neva Bay is less than {{Convert|6|m|0}}; therefore, a channel was dug at the bottom for safe navigation. Because of the large influx of fresh water from rivers, especially from the Neva River (two-thirds of the total runoff), the gulf water has very low salinity \u2013 between 0.2 and 5.8 \u2030 at the surface and 0.3\u20138.5 \u2030 near the bottom. The average water temperature is close to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter; in summer, it is {{convert|15|-|17|C|F}} at the surface and {{convert|2|-|3|C|F}} at the bottom. Parts of the gulf can be frozen from late November to late April; the freezing starts in the east and gradually proceeds to the west.

After a Swedish attack in 1256, the Russian army of [[Alexander Nevsky]] crossed the frozen gulf and raided the Swedish territories in the modern Finland. In 1293, the [[Vyborg Castle]] and city of [[Vyborg]] was founded by the Swedish [[marshal]] [[Torkel Knutsson]]. The castle was fought over for decades between Sweden and the [[Novgorod Republic]]. By the [[Treaty of N\u00f6teborg]] in 1323, Vyborg was finally recognized as a part of [[Sweden]].

Gda\u0144sk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the [[Pomerania]] region of Northern Poland.\n\nGda\u0144sk is the capital of [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] and the largest city of [[Kashubia]]. With its origins as a Polish stronghold erected in the 980s by [[Mieszko I of Poland]], the city's history is complex, with periods of Polish rule, periods of [[Prussia|Prussian]] or [[Germany|German]] rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a \"[[City-state|free city]]\". In the early-modern age Gda\u0144sk was a [[Royal city in Poland|royal city of Poland]]. It was considered the wealthiest and the largest city of Poland, prior to the 18th century rapid growth of [[Warsaw]]. Between the world wars, the [[Free City of Danzig]] was in a customs union with Poland and was located between German East Prussia and the so-called [[Polish Corridor]].\n\nGda\u0144sk lies at the mouth of the [[Mot\u0142awa]] River, connected to the [[Leniwka]], a branch in the delta of the nearby [[Vistula|Vistula River]], which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gda\u0144sk with the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]]. Together with the nearby port of [[Gdynia]], Gda\u0144sk is also a notable industrial center. In the late [[Middle Ages]] it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town and, in the 14th and 15th centuries, a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].\n\nIn the [[interwar period]], owing to its multi-ethnic make-up and history, Danzig lay in a disputed region between [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and the [[Weimar Republic]], and later [[Nazi Germany]]. The city's ambiguous [[Free City of Danzig|political status]] was exploited, [[Causes of World War II#Danzig crisis|furthering tension]] between the two countries, which would ultimately culminate in the [[Invasion of Poland]] and the [[Battle of Westerplatte|first clash of the Second World War]] just outside the city limits. In the 1980s it would become the birthplace of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, which played a major role in bringing an end to [[Communism|Communist]] rule in Poland and helped precipitate the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]], the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nGda\u0144sk is home to the [[University of Gda\u0144sk]], [[Gda\u0144sk University of Technology]], the [[National Museum, Gda\u0144sk|National Museum]], the [[Gda\u0144sk Shakespeare Theatre]], the [[Museum of World War II in Gda\u0144sk|Museum of the Second World War]], [[Polish Baltic Philharmonic]] and the [[European Solidarity Centre]].

Instead, in accordance with the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]], it became the [[Free City of Danzig]] (German: Freie Stadt Danzig), an independent quasi-state under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]] with its external affairs largely under Polish control. Poland's rights also included free use of the harbour, a Polish post office, a Polish garrison in Westerplatte district, and customs union with Poland. This led to a considerable tension between the city and the [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]]. The Free City had its own constitution, [[national anthem]], parliament (''[[Volkstag]]''), and government (''Senat''). It issued its own stamps as well as its currency, the [[Danzig gulden]].\n\nIn the early 1930s the local [[Nazi Party]] capitalised on pro-German sentiments and in 1933 garnered 50% of vote in the parliament. Thereafter, the Nazis under [[Gauleiter]] [[Albert Forster]] achieved dominance in the city government, which was still nominally overseen by the League of Nations' [[High Commissioner]]. [[NSDAP|The German government]] officially demanded the return of Danzig to Germany along with an extraterritorial (meaning under German [[jurisdiction]]) highway through the area of the [[Polish Corridor]] for land-based access from the rest of Germany.

Gda\u0144sk's dry winters and the precipitation maximum in summer are indicators of continentality. However seasonal extremes are less pronounced than those in inland Poland.\n\nThe city has moderately cold and cloudy winters with mean temperature in January and February near or below {{convert|0|C|F}} and mild summers with frequent showers and thunderstorms. Average temperatures range from {{convert|-1.0|to|17.2|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and average monthly rainfall varies {{convert|17.9|to|66.7|mm|in|0}} per month with a rather low annual total of {{convert|507.3|mm|in|0}}. In general, it is damp, variable, and mild.\n\nThe seasons are clearly differentiated. Spring starts in March and is initially cold and windy, later becoming pleasantly warm and often very sunny. Summer, which begins in June, is predominantly warm but hot at times with temperature reaching as high as {{convert|30|to|35|C|F|0}} at least once per year with plenty of sunshine interspersed with heavy rain. Gda\u0144sk averages 1,700 hours of sunshine per year. July and August are the warmest months. Autumn comes in September and is at first warm and usually sunny, turning cold, damp, and foggy in November. Winter lasts from December to March and includes periods of snow. January and February are the coldest months with the temperature sometimes dropping as low as {{convert|-15|C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Gda\u0144sk (1971\u20132000)\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan high C = 1.4\n|Feb high C = 2.1\n|Mar high C = 5.5\n|Apr high C = 10.1\n|May high C = 15.6\n|Jun high C = 19.0\n|Jul high C = 21.0\n|Aug high C = 21.3\n|Sep high C = 16.9\n|Oct high C = 12.0\n|Nov high C = 6.0\n|Dec high C = 2.9\n|year high C = 11.2\n|Jan mean C = -1.0\n|Feb mean C = -0.5\n|Mar mean C = 2.5\n|Apr mean C = 6.4\n|May mean C = 11.5\n|Jun mean C = 15.0\n|Jul mean C = 17.2\n|Aug mean C = 17.2\n|Sep mean C = 13.3\n|Oct mean C = 8.9\n|Nov mean C = 3.8\n|Dec mean C = 0.7\n|year mean C = 8.0\n|Jan low C = -3.4\n|Feb low C = -3.0\n|Mar low C = -0.5\n|Apr low C = 2.7\n|May low C = 7.4\n|Jun low C = 11.0\n|Jul low C = 13.3\n|Aug low C = 13.1\n|Sep low C = 9.7\n|Oct low C = 5.8\n|Nov low C = 1.5\n|Dec low C = -1.6\n|year low C = 4.7\n|Jan precipitation mm = 24.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 17.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 22.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 29.5\n|May precipitation mm = 48.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 63.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 66.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 55.8\n|Sep precipitation mm = 54.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 47.4\n|Nov precipitation mm = 42.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 33.7\n|year precipitation mm = 507.3\n|Jan precipitation days = 15\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 13\n|Apr precipitation days = 11\n|May precipitation days = 12\n|Jun precipitation days = 13\n|Jul precipitation days = 13\n|Aug precipitation days = 12\n|Sep precipitation days = 14\n|Oct precipitation days = 14\n|Nov precipitation days = 16\n|Dec precipitation days = 16\n|year precipitation days = 162\n|Jan sun = 39\n|Feb sun = 70\n|Mar sun = 134\n|Apr sun = 163\n|May sun = 244\n|Jun sun = 259\n|Jul sun = 236\n|Aug sun = 225\n|Sep sun = 174\n|Oct sun = 105\n|Nov sun = 45\n|Dec sun = 32\n|year sun = 1726\n|source 1 = World Meteorological Organization<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=25\n| title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Gda\u0144sk\n| publisher=WMO\n| accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>\n|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe industrial sections of the city are dominated by shipbuilding, petrochemical & chemical industries, and food processing.

There is no complete [[quantum field theory]] of gravitons due to an outstanding mathematical problem with [[renormalization]] in [[general relativity]]. In [[string theory]], believed to be a consistent theory of quantum gravity, the graviton is a [[Mass in special relativity|massless]] state of a fundamental string.  \n\nIf it exists, the graviton is expected to be  [[Mass in special relativity|massless]]  because the gravitational force is very long range and appears to propagate at the speed of light.  The graviton must be a [[spin (physics)|spin]]-2 [[boson]] because the source of gravitation is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]], a second-order [[tensor]] (compared with [[electromagnetism]]'s spin-1 photon, the source of which is the [[four-current]], a first-order tensor). Additionally, it can be shown that any massless spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a massless spin-2 field would couple to the stress\u2013energy tensor in the same way that gravitational interactions do. This result suggests that, if a massless spin-2 particle is discovered, it must be the graviton.<ref>For a comparison of the geometric derivation and the (non-geometric) spin-2 field derivation of general relativity, refer to box 18.1 (and also 17.2.5) of {{cite book\n | last=Misner | first=C.

Freeman]]\n | isbn=0-7167-0344-0\n}}</ref>\n\n==Theory==\nApart from gravity, the three other known [[force]]s of nature are thought to be mediated by elementary particles: [[electromagnetism]] by the [[photon]], the [[strong interaction]] by [[gluon]]s, and the [[weak interaction]] by the [[W and Z bosons]].  All three of these forces appear to be accurately described by the [[standard model]] of particle physics.  A hypothesis is that gravitational interactions are mediated by an as yet undiscovered elementary particle, dubbed the ''graviton''. In the [[classical limit]], the theory would reduce to [[general relativity]], which itself reduces to [[Newton's law of gravitation]] in the weak-field limit.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last= Feynman |first=R.

Gal'perin.<ref name=Blokhintsev/>\n\n===Gravitons and renormalization===\nWhen describing graviton interactions, the [[classical theory]] of [[Feynman diagram]]s, and semiclassical corrections such as [[one-loop diagram]]s behave normally. However, [[Feynman diagram]]s with at least two loops lead to [[ultraviolet divergence]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} These infinite results cannot be removed because quantized [[general relativity]] is not [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]] [[renormalizable]], unlike [[quantum electrodynamics]] models such as the [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]]. Therefore, incalculable answers are found from the perturbation method by which physicists calculate the probability of a particle to emit or absorb gravitons, and the theory loses predictive veracity. Those problems and the complementary approximation framework are grounds to show that a theory more unified than quantized general relativity is required to describe the behavior near the [[Planck scale]].\n\n===Comparison with other forces===\nLike the [[force carrier]]s of the [[fundamental interaction|other forces]] (see [[charged black hole]]), gravitation plays a role in [[general relativity]], in defining the [[spacetime]] in which events take place. [[General relativity#Definition and basic applications|In some descriptions]] energy modifies the \"shape\" of [[spacetime]] itself, and gravity is a result of this shape, an idea which at first glance may appear hard to match with the idea of a force acting between particles.<ref>See the other articles on [[General relativity]], [[Gravitational field]], [[Gravitational wave]], etc</ref> Because the [[diffeomorphism]] invariance of the theory does not allow any particular space-time background to be singled out as the \"true\" space-time background, general relativity is said to be [[background-independent]]. In contrast, the [[Standard Model]] is ''not'' background-independent, with [[Minkowski space]] enjoying a special status as the fixed background space-time.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1= Colosi|first1=D.\n |display-authors=etal\n |date=2005\n |title=Background independence in a nutshell: The dynamics of a tetrahedron\n |journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]\n |volume=22 |issue=14 |pages=2971\u20132989\n |arxiv=gr-qc/0408079\n |bibcode=2005CQGra..22.2971C\n |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/22/14/008\n}}</ref> A theory of [[quantum gravity]] is needed in order to reconcile these differences.<ref>\n{{cite arXiv\n |last1=Witten |first1=E.\n |date=1993\n |title=Quantum Background Independence In String Theory\n |arxiv=hep-th/9306122\n}}</ref> Whether this theory should be background-independent is an open question.

A graviton in [[perturbative|perturbative string theory]] is a [[closed string]] in a very particular low-energy vibrational state. The scattering of gravitons in string theory can also be computed from the [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]] in [[conformal field theory]], as dictated by the [[AdS/CFT]] correspondence, or from [[Matrix theory (physics)|matrix theory]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nA feature of gravitons in string theory is that, as closed strings without endpoints, they would not be bound to [[Membrane (M-Theory)|branes]] and could move freely between them. If we live on a brane (as hypothesized by [[Membrane (M-theory)|brane theories]]), this \"leakage\" of gravitons from the brane into higher-dimensional space could explain why gravitation is such a weak force, and gravitons from other branes adjacent to our own could provide a potential explanation for [[dark matter]]. However, if gravitons were to move completely freely between branes, this would dilute gravity too much, causing a violation of Newton's inverse-square law.

However, it was not until the start of the 19th century that Brask's proposals were put into action by [[Baltzar von Platen (1766-1829)|Baltzar von Platen]], a German-born former officer in the [[Swedish Navy]]. He organised the project and obtained the necessary financial and political backing. His plans attracted the enthusiastic backing of the government and the new king, [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]], who saw the canal as a way of kick-starting the modernisation of Sweden.<ref>Litellus Russell Muirhead, ''Sweden'', p. 105. Rand McNally, 1952.</ref> Von Platen himself extolled the modernising virtues of the canal in 1806, claiming that mining, agriculture and other industries would benefit from \"a navigation way through the country.\"<ref>Quoted in Lars Magnusson, ''An Economic History of Sweden'', p. 115. Routledge, 2000. {{ISBN|0-415-18167-4}}</ref>\n\nThe project was inaugurated on 11 April 1810 with a budget of 24 million [[Swedish riksdaler]]s.<ref>R Nisbet Bain, ''Scandinavia: A Political History of Denmark, Norway and Sweden from 1513 to 1900'', p. 432. University Press, Cambridge, 1905</ref> It was by far the greatest civil engineering project ever undertaken in Sweden up to that time, taking 22 years of effort by more than 58,000 workers. Much of the expertise and equipment had to be acquired from abroad, notably from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], whose [[History of the British canal system|canal system]] was the most advanced in the world at that time. The [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[civil engineer]] [[Thomas Telford]] developed the initial plans for the canal and travelled to Sweden in 1810 to oversee some of the early work on the route. Many other British engineers and craftsmen were imported to assist with the project, along with significant quantities of equipment - even apparently mundane items such as pickaxes, spades and wheelbarrows.<ref name=\"svedin\" />\n\nThe G\u00f6ta Canal was officially opened on 26 September 1832 in an event commemorated by the painter [[Johan Christian Berger]] in his work ''The Opening of the G\u00f6ta Canal on 26 September 1832''. Von Platen himself did not live to see the completion of the canal, having died shortly before its opening. However, it was never an economic success. The [[Rail transport in Sweden|arrival of the railways]] in 1855 quickly made it redundant, as trains could carry passengers and goods far more rapidly and did not have to shut down with the arrival of winter, which made the canal impassable for five months of the year.<ref>Neil Kent, ''The Soul of the North: A Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700-1940'', p. 172.

Over the years, Mott became the largest single stockholder in GM, and spent his life with his [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation|Mott Foundation]], which has benefited the city of Flint, his adopted home. GM acquired [[Oldsmobile]] later that year. In 1909, Durant brought in [[Cadillac]], [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore]], [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland]], and several others. Also in 1909, GM acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of [[Owosso, Michigan]], and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of [[Pontiac, Michigan]], the predecessors of [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck]]. Durant, along with [[Samuel McLaughlin|R. S.

Durant regained control of the company after one of the most dramatic [[proxy fight|proxy wars]] in American business history. Durant then reorganized General Motors Company into General Motors Corporation in 1916, merging Chevrolet with GM and merging General Motors of Canada Limited as an ally in 1918. Shortly thereafter, he again lost control, this time for good, after the new vehicle market collapsed. [[Alfred P. Sloan]] was picked to take charge of the corporation, and led it to its post-war global dominance when the seven manufacturing facilities operated by Chevrolet before GM acquired the company began to contribute to GM operations. These facilities were added to the individual factories that were exclusive to Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Oakland, and other companies acquired by GM. This unprecedented growth of GM would last into the early 1980s, when it employed 349,000 workers and operated 150 assembly plants.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Chapter 11 bankruptcy===\n{{Main|General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization}}\n[[File:14 Buick LaCrosse (14344035480).jpg|thumb|[[Buick LaCrosse#Second generation .282010.E2.80.932016.29|2nd generation Buick LaCrosse]], an example of GM's revival following its restructuring in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/reviews/a4429/4325072/|title=2010 Buick LaCrosse Test Drive: Can New 30-MPG Buick Sedan Revive the Brand?|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/buick-big-in-china-seeks-to-recapture-us-glory/|title=Buick, Big in China, Seeks to Recapture U.S. Glory|work=CBS News|date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nOn July 10, 2009, General Motors emerged from government backed [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] reorganization after an initial filing on June 8, 2009.<ref name=\"NYT-Merced-2009-07-10\">{{cite news| last = Vlasic | first = Bill | date=July 10, 2009 | accessdate=September 9, 2012 | title = G.M.

Economy (in some form) always had good demand anywhere, but its definition in the U.S. was long considered different from that in other markets. In this view, \"economy\" in the U.S. did not mean \"small\" in the sense of what qualified as \"small\" outside the U.S. The policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in non-U.S. markets than in the U.S., and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country, either as some variant of [[knock-down kit|knockdown]] or with truly extensive domestic sourcing.<ref name=\"Sloan1964pp313-339\"/> GM's acquisitions of Vauxhall Motors Ltd (UK, 1925)<ref name=\"Sloan1964pp313-339\"/> and Adam Opel AG (Germany, 1929),<ref name=\"Sloan1964pp313-339\"/> rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them, were based on analyses that convinced GM managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision.<ref name=\"Sloan1964pp313-339\"/>\n\nAlthough GM since the 1920s has always offered economy models in the U.S. market (relative to that market's definition in any given decade), and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the U.S. market,<ref name=\"Sloan1964pp440-442\"/> it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the U.S. market in the 1970s through 1990s. GM's response has been that it has always responded to market demands, and that most Americans, despite anything they said to the contrary, did not actually demand (at purchasing-decision time) small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent. Although some U.S. consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose (such as 1973 and 1979), they flocked equally enthusiastically to SUVs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nSince the return of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s, GM's interest in truly small-car programs for the U.S. market has been renewed. As part of General Motors Company development, GM revived one of its idled U.S. factories for the production of a small car in [[Orion, Michigan]], with the creation of 1,200 American jobs. This will be the first time that GM produced a [[sub compact car]] in the United States since the [[Chevrolet Chevette]] ended production in 1986.

GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to [[Wyndham Mortimer]], the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members in secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for [[Buick]]s, [[Pontiac]]s, and [[Oldsmobile]]s, and another in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] that produced [[Chevrolet]] parts.\n\n[[File:Flint Sit-Down Strike National Guard.jpg|thumb|[[US National Guard|National Guardsmen]] with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four.]]\n\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John Nance Garner]] supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. [[John L. Lewis]], President of the [[United Mine Workers]] and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President [[Homer Martin (labor leader)|Homer Martin]] was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW's, so Governor [[Frank Murphy]] acted as courier and [[mediation|intermediary]] between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the [[U.S. National Guard]], not to evict the strikers, but rather to protect them from the police and corporate [[strike-breaker]]s. The two parties finally reached agreement on February 11, 1937 on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees who were members of the union for the next six months.<ref name=\"Bak\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/September-2008/Frank-Murpheys-Law/ |last1=Bak |first1=Richard |title=(Frank) Murphy's Law |journal=Hour Detroit |date=September 2008 |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tool and die strike of 1939===\n{{Main|Tool and die strike of 1939}}\n\nThe [[tool and die strike of 1939]], also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the [[United Auto Workers Union]] (UAW) to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers.

It relates to the first (1960\u20131964) models that had a [[Swing axle|swing-axle suspension]] design which was prone to \"tuck under\" in certain circumstances. In substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar), Corvairs required [[tire]] pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15psi front, 26psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was a dangerous oversteer.<ref>{{cite web|last=CSERE|first=CSABA|title=General Motors Celebrates a 100-Year History of Technological Breakthroughs|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/columns/general-motors-celebrates-a-100-year-history-of-technological-breakthroughs|publisher=Car and Driver|date=September 2008|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', alleged that GM had tried to discredit [[Ralph Nader]], hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |title=Ralph Nader's museum of tort law will include relics from famous lawsuits\u2014if it ever gets built |date=December 2005|publisher=LegalAffairs.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=May 7, 2005 |work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safetyep.htm |title=President Dwight D.

In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of \"[[wireless telegraphy]]\"\u2014i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the [[electric telegraph]]. This was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and optical (light) signalling for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]]. At the time, this radiation was commonly called \"Hertzian\" waves, and is now generally referred to as [[radio waves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec022.htm|title=22. Word Origins|work=earlyradiohistory.us}}</ref>\n\nThere was a great deal of interest in radio waves in the physics community, but this interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method.  Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light that could only travel along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] path, limiting its range to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling.<ref>Regal, Brian (2005) ''Radio: The Life Story of a Technology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 22. {{ISBN|0313331677}}</ref> Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist [[Oliver Lodge]] and an article about Hertz's work by Augusto Righi.

Marconi built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a [[coherer]], an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist [[Edouard Branly]] and used in Lodge's experiments, that [[Electrical resistance and conductance|changed resistance]] when exposed to radio waves.<ref name=\"Brown141\">Brown, Antony. ''Great Ideas in Communications''. D. White Co., 1969, page 141</ref> In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.\n\nLate one night, in December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother, a set-up that made a bell ring on the other side of the room by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench.<ref>[http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/xmarconi.html ''Guglielmo Marconi, padre della radio''].

He never received a response to his letter, which was eventually dismissed by the Minister, who wrote \"to the Longara\" on the document, referring to the insane asylum on Via della Lungara in Rome.<ref>Solari, Luigi (February 1948) \"Guglielmo Marconi e la Marina Militare Italiana\", ''Rivista Marittima''</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Marconi spoke with his family friend Carlo Gardini, Honorary Consul at the United States Consulate in Bologna, about leaving Italy to go to England. Gardini wrote a letter of introduction to the Ambassador of Italy in London, Annibale Ferrero, explaining who Marconi was and about his extraordinary discoveries. In his response, Ambassador Ferrero advised them not to reveal Marconi's results until after a patent was obtained. He also encouraged Marconi to come to England where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert his experiments into practical use.\nFinding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to London in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. (He spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) Marconi arrived at Dover, and the Customs officer opened his case to find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted the Admiralty in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of [[William Preece]], the Chief Electrical Engineer of the British Post Office.\n\n====The British become interested====\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:Post Office Engineers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[British Post Office]] engineers inspect Marconi's radio equipment during a demonstration on [[Flat Holm]] Island, 13 May 1897.

In July 1897, he carried out a series of tests at [[La Spezia]], in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for Lloyds between [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and [[Rathlin Island]], [[Northern Ireland]], was conducted on 6 July 1898. A transmission across the [[English channel]] was accomplished on 27 March 1899, from [[Wimereux]], France to [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], England.  Marconi set up an experimental base at the Haven Hotel, [[Sandbanks]], [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]], where he erected a 100-foot high mast.  He became friends with the van Raaltes, the owners of [[Brownsea Island]] in Poole Harbour, and his sailing boat, the Elettra, was often moored on Brownsea or at the Haven Hotel when he was not conducting experiments at sea.\n\nIn December 1898, the British lightship service authorized the establishment of wireless communication between the [[South Foreland]] lighthouse at [[Dover]] and the East Goodwin [[Lightvessel|lightship]], twelve miles distant. On 17 March 1899, the East Goodwin lightship sent a signal on behalf of the merchant vessel ''Elbe'' which had run aground on [[Goodwin Sands]]. The message was received by the radio operator of the South Foreland lighthouse, who summoned the aid of the [[Ramsgate]] lifeboat.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030656105;view=1up;seq=117 \"Marconi's Wireless Telegraph] by Cleveland Moffett, ''McClure's Magazine'', June 1899, pages 99-112.</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/first-ever-radio-distress-call/ The first-ever radio distress call is made off Kent coast]</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of 1899, the first demonstrations in the United States took place. Marconi had sailed to the U.S. at the invitation of the New York Herald newspaper to cover the [[America's Cup]] international yacht races off Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The transmission was done aboard the SS ''Ponce'', a passenger ship of the ''Porto Rico Line''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Helgesen|first=Henry N.|title=Wireless Goes to Sea: Marconi's Radio and SS Ponce|journal=Sea History|issue=Spring 2008|page=122}}</ref> Marconi left for England on 8 November 1899 on the [[American Line]]'s {{SS|Saint Paul}}, and he and his assistants installed wireless equipment aboard during the voyage.

Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, [[Co. Wexford]] in 1901 to act as a link between [[Poldhu]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]] and [[Clifden]] in [[Co. Galway]], [[Ireland]]. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of Canada) on 12 December 1901, using a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception\u2014signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]]. The distance between the two points was about {{convert|2200|mi|km}}. It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was\u2014and continues to be\u2014considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency \u2248850&nbsp;kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter ''S''. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MAP.2004.1305565|year=2004|journal=IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume=46|issue=2|page=130|title=Marconi and the History of Radio}}</ref><ref>Belrose, John S.

War Wellcome V0003849.jpg|right|thumb|Marconi caricatured by [[Leslie Ward]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1905]]\n\nFeeling challenged by skeptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS ''Philadelphia'' sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced [[Magnetic detector|coherer-tape]] reception up to {{convert|1550|mi|km}}, and audio reception up to {{convert|2100|mi|km}}. The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about {{convert|700|mi|km}}, less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres, despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.\n\nOn 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|South Wellfleet, Massachusetts]] that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.\n\nMarconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}</ref><ref>[http://marconi100.ca/clip/marconi-sydpost19071024.html Second Test of the Marconi Over-Ocean Wireless System Proved Entirely Successful].

After the sinking of the ocean liner on 15 April 1912, survivors were rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] of the [[Cunard Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eaton, John P. and Haas, Charles A.

Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The [[New Street Works]] factory in [[Chelmsford]] was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame [[Nellie Melba]]. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] at [[Great Baddow]], forming the prelude to the [[BBC]], and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with [[Florence Tyzack Parbury]], and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.\n\n===Later years===\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{quote box|align=left|width=33%|quote = Have I done the world good, or have I added a menace?<ref>William John (1972) ''History Of The Marconi Company 1874\u20131965''. p. 296</ref>}}</div>\n\n[[File:Marconi portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Marconi with his wife c. 1910]]\nIn 1914, Marconi was made a Senator in the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy]] and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] in the UK. During [[World War I]], Italy joined the Allied side of the conflict, and Marconi was placed in charge of the Italian military's radio service.

required}}</ref>\n}}\nThe '''G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv''' ({{IPA-sv|\u02c8j\u00f8\u02d0ta \u02c8\u025blv}}, ''River of the [[Geats]]'') is a river that drains lake [[V\u00e4nern]] into the [[Kattegat]], at the city of [[Gothenburg]], on the western coast of Sweden. It was formed at the end of [[Weichselian glaciation|the last glaciation]], as an outflow channel from the [[Baltic Ice Lake]] to the Atlantic Ocean and nowadays it has the largest [[drainage basin]] in [[Scandinavia]].\n\nThe G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv is located in [[G\u00f6taland]], with the river itself being a site of early [[Geats|Geatish]] settlement. Its length is {{cvt|93|km}}. Usually the combination of G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv and [[Klar\u00e4lven]] (a river ending at V\u00e4nern) is considered to be one [[river system]]. This combination is the longest river in the [[Nordic countries]], {{cvt|750|km}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The [[Bohus Fortress]] is located by the river at [[Kung\u00e4lv]]. There the river splits into two, with the northern part being the '''Nordre \u00e4lv''' and the southern part keeping the name G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv.\n\nAt [[Trollh\u00e4ttan]] there is a [[dam]], [[canal lock]]s and a [[hydropower]] station in the river. The locks make the river navigable, even for large cargo vessels ({{cvt|88|m|disp=sqbr}} long). The artificial parts are called [[Trollh\u00e4tte Canal]]. The river and the canal is part of a mostly inland waterway, [[G\u00f6ta Canal]], which spans the width of Sweden to the [[Baltic Sea]] south of [[Stockholm]].\n\nThe power station supplied electric power to the heavy [[steel industry]] concentrated around [[Trollh\u00e4ttan Falls]], contributing to its [[industrial revolution]]. In the summer months the spillway of the dam is opened for a few minutes daily and [[tourist]]s gather to see the water rushing down the river (picture).\n\nThere are concerns about whether the maximum discharge of {{cvt|1000|m3/s}} is enough in a scenario where heavy rain floods the lake V\u00e4nern, causing considerable damage. Previously this was thought not to be possible in reality, but in 2001 the lake was flooded almost {{cvt|1|m|ft|0}} above maximum level (and some upstream lakes like [[Glafsfjorden]] flooded {{cvt|3|m|ft|0|disp=sqbr}}). In this situation, G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv was allowed a discharge of {{cvt|1100|m3/s}} for months causing a big risk of landslides. Now a water tunnel between V\u00e4nersborg and Uddevalla is considered as a rescue solution.\n\nThere is a large risk of landslides along the river and historical records of 15 landslides exist. The largest occurred in the years 1150, 1648, 1950, 1957 and 1977 ([[Tuve landslide]]).\n\n==Name in other languages==\nIn [[Old Norse]] the river was called the ''Gautelfr'';<ref>Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson, <i>An Icelandic-English Dictionary</i>, 2nd edn by William A. Craigie (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1957), s.v. ''Gautar''.</ref> in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] it is ''Gautelfur''; and in Norwegian sometimes rendered as ''G\u00f8telv''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{EB1911

[[Athens]] is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nGreece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Situated on the southern tip of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], it shares land borders with [[Albania]] to the northwest, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the northeast. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of the [[Geography of Greece|mainland]], the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, the [[Sea of Crete|Cretan Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[list of countries by length of coastline|11th longest coastline in the world]] at {{convert|13676|km|0|abbr=on}} in length, featuring a large number of [[List of islands of Greece|islands]], of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with [[Mount Olympus]] being the highest peak at {{convert|2918|m|ft}}. The country consists of nine [[geographic regions of Greece|geographic regions]]: [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Central Greece]], the [[Peloponnese]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], the [[Aegean Islands]] (including the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Cyclades]]), [[western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Crete]], and the [[Ionian Islands]].\n\nGreece is considered the cradle of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]], being the birthplace of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], [[Western philosophy]], [[Western literature]], [[historiography]], [[political science]], major [[History of science in classical antiquity|scientific]] and [[Greek mathematics|mathematical]] principles, and [[Drama|Western drama]], as well as the [[Olympic Games]]. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as ''poleis'' (singular ''[[polis]]''), which spanned the entire [[Mediterranean region]] and the [[Black Sea]]. [[Philip of Macedon]] united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC, with his son [[Alexander the Great]] [[Macedonian Empire|rapidly conquering much of the ancient world]], spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to [[India]]. Greece was [[Roman Greece|annexed]] by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor, the [[Byzantine Empire]], wherein Greek language and culture were dominant. Rooted in the first century A.D., the  [[Greek Orthodox Church]] helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox World]]. Falling under [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman dominion]] in the mid-15th century, the modern [[nation state]] of Greece emerged in 1830 following a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]]. Greece's rich historical legacy is reflected by its 18 [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Greece is a [[unitary parliamentary republic]] and [[developed country]] with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]], a high [[quality of life]], and a very high [[Human Development Index|standard of living]]. A founding member of the [[United Nations]], Greece was the tenth member to join the [[European Communities]] (precursor to the [[European Union]]) and has been part of the [[Eurozone]] since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the [[Council of Europe]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF).

The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Central Greece]], which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.

Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] negotiated with [[Mehmet Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of [[Missolonghi]]\u2014put under siege by the Turks since April 1825\u2014fell in April 1826.

Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called [[Modern Greek|Demotic]]. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\nGovernment documents and newspapers were consequently published in ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the [[New Testament]] was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the ''Evangeliaka''). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.\n\nAll Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the Greek-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire, regardless of the dialect they spoke. Especially in [[Crete]], a [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|prolonged revolt in 1866\u20131869]] had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russia and the Ottomans in 1877]], Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor, and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, [[Thessaly]] and small parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] were ceded to Greece as part of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.\n\nGreeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under [[Prince George of Greece]]. With state coffers empty, fiscal policy came under [[International Financial Control]]. In the next decade, Greek efforts were focused on the [[Macedonian Struggle]], a state-sponsored guerilla campaign against pro-[[Bulgaria]]n [[Komitadji|rebel gangs]] in Ottoman-ruled [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which ended inconclusively with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908.\n\n==== Expansion, disaster, and reconstruction ====\n{{See also|Balkan Wars|National Schism|Asia Minor Campaign|Second Hellenic Republic}}\n\n[[File:Greek Parade Paris 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Greek military formation in the [[World War&nbsp;I]] Victory Parade in [[Arc de Triomphe]], Paris, July 1919.]]\n[[File:Greece in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of Greater Greece after the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], when the ''[[Megali Idea]]'' seemed close to fulfillment, featuring [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] as its supervising genius.]]\n\nAmidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the nation, a group of military officers organised a [[Goudi coup|coup]] in August 1909 and shortly thereafter called to power [[Cretan State|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. After winning [[Greek legislative election, August 1910|two]] [[Greek legislative election, November 1910|elections]] and becoming Prime Minister, Venizelos initiated wide-ranging fiscal, social, and [[Greek Constitution of 1911|constitutional reforms]], reorganised the military, made Greece a member of the [[Balkan League]], and led the country through the [[Balkan Wars]]. By 1913, Greece's territory and population had almost doubled, annexing [[Crete]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. In the following years, the struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic Venizelos over the country's foreign policy on the eve of [[First World War]] dominated the country's political scene, and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]]. During parts of the WW1, Greece had two governments: A royalist [[Central Powers|pro-German]] one in [[Athens]] and a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] one in [[Thessaloniki]]. The two governments were united in 1917, when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the Entente.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, Greece attempted further expansion into [[Asia Minor]], a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]], contributing to a massive flight of [[Ottoman Greeks|Asia Minor Greeks]].<ref name=Gibney>{{cite book |author=Matthew J.

The remaining section of Olympia Odos, connecting Patras with [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]], is under planning.\n\nOther important projects that are currently underway, include the construction of the [[Thessaloniki Metro]].\n\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area in particular is served by some of the most modern and efficient transport infrastructure in Europe, such as the [[Athens International Airport]], the privately run [[Attiki Odos|A6 (Attiki Odos)]] motorway network and the expanded [[Athens Metro]] system.\n\nMost of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines, [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]]. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]].\n\nRailway connections play a somewhat lesser role in Greece than in many other European countries, but they too have also been expanded, with new suburban/[[commuter rail]] connections, serviced by [[Proastiakos]] around Athens, towards its airport, [[Kiato]] and [[Chalcis|Chalkida]]; around Thessaloniki, towards the cities of [[Larissa]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]]; and around Patras. A modern intercity rail connection between Athens and Thessaloniki has also been established, while an upgrade to double lines in many parts of the {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} network is underway. International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe, the Balkans and Turkey.\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\n{{Main|Telecommunications in Greece}}\n[[File:Athens-Kiffisia-aerial.jpg|thumb|[[OTE]] headquarters in Athens]]\n\nModern digital information and communication networks reach all areas.

Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world and beyond during [[Classical Antiquity]], and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the [[Greek language question]], on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic [[Katharevousa]], created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the [[Dimotiki]], the form of the [[Greek language]] which evolved naturally from [[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]] and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.\n\nGreece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group. The [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]] dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the [[Sarakatsani]], traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of [[Greek Macedonia]] and other parts of [[Northern Greece]]. The [[Tsakonian language]], a distinct Greek language deriving from [[Doric Greek]] instead of [[Koine Greek]], is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.\n\n[[File:Greece linguistic minorities.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Regions with a traditional presence of languages other than Greek.

Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.\n\nToday they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece.

Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] or [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as [[panel painting]]s. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Bronze Age]], with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like [[Knossos]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]]. Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as [[polychrome]].\n[[File:Stag hunt mosaic, Pella.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stag Hunt Mosaic]] at the [[Archaeological Museum of Pella]] (3rd BC)]]\n[[File:Hosios Loukas Katholikon (sanctuary vault, conch of the apse) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Byzantine mosaics of [[Hosios Loukas]] (11th century), artistic example of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]]]]\n\n[[Ancient Greek sculpture]] was composed almost entirely of [[marble]] or [[bronze]]; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable. [[Chryselephantine]] sculptures, used for temple [[cult image]]s and luxury works, used [[gold]], most often in [[gold leaf|leaf form]] and [[ivory]] for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] in the late 20th century, that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact.<ref name=Gurewitsch>{{cite journal|last=Gurewitsch |first= Matthew |date=July 2008 |title= True Colors |journal= Smithsonian |pages= 66\u201371 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors.html}}</ref>\n\nThe art production continued also during the Byzantine era. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its \u201cabstract,\u201d or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]]. The [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)]] was the artistic expression of [[Macedonian Renaissance]], a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867\u20131056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into [[Christian art]]work.\n\n[[File:Miaoulissyros.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Andreas Miaoulis]] in [[Ermoupoli]] by [[Georgios Bonanos]]]]\n\nPost Byzantine art schools include the [[Cretan School]] and [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]. The first artistic movement in the [[Greek Kingdom]] can be considered the [[Greek academic art of the 19th century]] (''Munich School''). Notable modern Greek painters include [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], [[Georgios Jakobides]], [[Theodoros Vryzakis]], [[Nikiforos Lytras]], [[Konstantinos Volanakis]], [[Nikos Engonopoulos]] and [[Yannis Tsarouchis]], while some notable sculptors are [[Pavlos Prosalentis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Leonidas Drosis]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Yannoulis Chalepas]].\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{See also|Ancient Greek architecture|Byzantine architecture|Modern Greek architecture}}\n[[File:Vatheia Mani 01.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Towerhouses of [[Mani peninsula]]]]\n\nThe architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (''Hellenes''), whose [[Ancient Greece|culture]] flourished on the Greek mainland, the [[Aegean Islands]] and their [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]], for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], was to have profound effect on [[History of architecture|Western architecture]] of later periods.\n\nByzantine architecture is the [[architecture]] promoted by the [[Byzantine Empire]], also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages. The empire endured for more than a [[millennium]], dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture]] throughout Europe and the Near East, and becoming the primary progenitor of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman architectural]] traditions that followed its collapse.\n[[File:GR-mykonos-little-venice-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Traditional styled white houses in [[Mykonos]], [[Cyclades]]]]\nAfter the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. [[Patras]] was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, [[Stamatis Voulgaris]], a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], who approved it.

Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800&nbsp;BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastorals]], [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigrams]]; dramatic presentations of comedy and [[tragedy]]; [[historiography]], [[rhetorical]] treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]]. The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.\n\nOf the hundreds of [[tragedies]] written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The surviving plays by [[Aristophanes]] are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are two of the most influential historians in this period.

Two Greek authors have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[George Seferis]] in 1963 and [[Odysseas Elytis]] in 1979.\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy|Modern Greek Enlightenment}}\n[[File:\u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, \u0391\u03ba\u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd 6619.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Statue of [[Plato]], Athens. \"The safest general characterisation of the [[Western philosophy|European philosophical tradition]] is that it consists of a series of footnotes to [[Plato]].\" ([[Alfred North Whitehead]], ''[[Process and Reality]]'', 1929).]]\n\nMost western philosophical traditions began in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BC. The first philosophers are called \"Presocratics,\" which designates that they came before [[Socrates]], whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.\n\nA new period of philosophy started with Socrates. Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.\n\n[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/|title=Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher= Internet encyclopedia of philosophy|accessdate= 23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Byzantine philosophy]] refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a [[Christianity|Christian]] world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Neoplatonists]].\n\nOn the eve of the [[Fall of Constantinople]], [[Gemistus Pletho]] tried to restore the use of the term \"Hellene\" and advocated the return to the [[Olympian Gods]] of the ancient world. After 1453 a number of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek Byzantine scholars]] who fled to western Europe contributed to the [[Renaissance]].\n\nIn modern period, [[Modern Greek Enlightenment|Diafotismos]] (Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, \"enlightenment\", \"illumination\") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and its philosophical and political ideas. Some notable representatives were [[Adamantios Korais]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Theophilos Kairis]].\n\nOther modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and [[Christos Yannaras]].\n\n=== Music and dances ===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Music of Greece}}\n[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cretan]] dancers of [[Greek folk music|traditional folk music]]]]\n[[File:Rembetes Karaiskaki 1933.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rebetiko|Rebetes]] in Karaiskaki, [[Piraeus]] (1933). Left [[Markos Vamvakaris]] with [[bouzouki]].]]\n\nGreek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Middle East, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] also had effect on Greek music.\n\nWhile the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.\n\nAlong with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] (''Demotiko'') which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, [[mantinada|mantinades]], wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.\n\n[[File:Mikis2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|[[Mikis Theodorakis]] is one of the most popular and significant Greek songwriters]]\n\nThe [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kant\u00e1dhes]] (\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870\u20131930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revue]], [[operetta]]s and [[nocturne]]s that were dominating Athens' theater scene.\n\n[[Rebetiko]], initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later [[la\u00efk\u00f3]] (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], [[Grigoris Bithikotsis]], [[Stelios Kazantzidis]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Haris Alexiou]] and [[Glykeria]].\n\nRegarding the classical music, it was through the [[Ionian islands]] (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek: ''\u0395\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae''), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]. [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.\n[[File:Maria Callas 1958.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Soprano [[Maria Callas]]]]\n\nIn the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of [[avant garde]] and modern [[classical music]], with figures such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], and [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]], [[Vangelis]] and [[Demis Roussos]] garnered an international following for their music, which include famous [[film score]]s such as [[Zorba the Greek]], [[Serpico]], [[Never on Sunday]], [[America America]], [[Eternity and a Day]], [[Chariots of Fire]], [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]], among others. [[Greek American]] composers known for their film scores include also [[Yanni]] and [[Basil Poledouris]]. Notable Greek [[opera]] singers and [[classical music]]ians of the 20th and 21st century include [[Maria Callas]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Mario Frangoulis]], [[Leonidas Kavakos]], [[Dimitris Sgouros]] and others.\n\nDuring the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|dictatorship of the Colonels]], the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed, internally exiled, and put in a [[concentration camp]],<ref name=\"Hischak2015\">{{cite book|author=Thomas S.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]], Greece won with the song \"[[My Number One]]\", performed by Greek-Swedish singer [[Elena Paparizou]]. The song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Albania, Cyprus, Serbia & Montenegro, Sweden and Germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece.

Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]] (a thick pur\u00e9e of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or ros\u00e9 wine sealed with pine resin) and [[Sesame seed candy|pasteli]] (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled octopus and small fish, [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]] (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and cheese. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish.\n\nSome sweet desserts include [[melomakarona]], [[diples]] and [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of wines including retsina. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], garlic, [[onion]], [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use \"sweet\" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]]s in stews.\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Greek cinema}}\n[[File:\u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 \u039c\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Melina Mercouri]] during the filming of [[Phaedra (film)|Phaedra]] (1962).]]\nCinema first appeared in Greece in 1896, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907 in Athens. In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films began. ''Golfo'' (\u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c6\u03c9), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek [[feature film]], although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''\u0394\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a7\u03bb\u03cc\u03b7''), containing one of the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad.

In women's European competitions, Greek water polo teams ([[NC Vouliagmeni]], [[ANO Glyfada|Glyfada NSC]], [[Olympiacos Women's Water Polo Team|Olympiacos]], [[Ethnikos Piraeus Water Polo Club|Ethnikos Piraeus]]) are amongst the most successful in European water pol\u03bf, having won 4 [[LEN Women's Champions' Cup|LEN Champions Cups]], 3 [[Women's LEN Trophy|LEN Trophies]] and 2 European Supercups.\n\nThe [[Greece men's national volleyball team|Greek men's national volleyball team]] has won two bronze medals, one in the [[Men's European Volleyball Championship|European Volleyball Championship]] and another one in the [[Men's European Volleyball League]], a 5th place in the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and a 6th place in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]]. The Greek league, the [[A1 Ethniki Volleyball|A1 Ethniki]], is considered one of the top volleyball leagues in Europe and the Greek clubs have had significant success in European competitions. [[Olympiacos S.C.|Olympiacos]] is the most successful volleyball club in the country having won the most domestic titles and being the only Greek club to have won European titles; they have won two [[CEV Top Teams Cup|CEV Cups]], they have been [[CEV Champions League]] runners-up twice and they have played in 12 Final Fours in the European competitions, making them one of the most traditional volleyball clubs in Europe. [[Iraklis Thessaloniki V.C.|Iraklis]] have also seen significant success in European competitions, having been three times runners-up of the [[CEV Champions League]].\n\nIn handball, [[AC Diomidis Argous]] is the only Greek club to have won a [[EHF Challenge Cup|European Cup]].\n\nApart from these, [[cricket]] is relatively popular in [[Corfu]].\n\n=== Mythology ===\n{{Main|Greek mythology}}\n[[File:The Chariot of Zeus - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|The Chariot of [[Zeus]] by Alfred Church.]]\nThe numerous gods of the [[ancient Greek religion]] as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek [[epic (genre)|epics]] (''[[The Odyssey]]'' and ''[[The Iliad]]'') and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the [[ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.\n\nThe principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the [[Dodekatheon]], or the ''Twelve Gods'', who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, who was married to [[Hera]], who was also Zeus's sister. The other Greek gods that made up the [[Twelve Olympians]] were [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]] and [[Hermes]]. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as [[nymphs]] and other magical creatures.\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}\n[[File:Virgin Mary procession, Chora of Naxos, 118916.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Procession in honor of the Assumption of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] (15 August)]]\n\nAccording to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late '70s, Saturday also is a non school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (''[[Greek Independence Day]]''), [[Easter Monday]], 15 August (''[[Dormition of the Mother of God|Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin]]''), and 25 December (''[[Christmas]]''). 1 May (''[[Labour Day]]'') and 28 October (''[[Ohi Day]]'') are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.\n\nIn addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a \"Patron Saint\" parallel to \"[[Name days in Greece|Name Days]]\", or a \"Liberation Day\". On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.\n\nNotable festivals, beyond the religious fests, include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|script-title=el:\u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb \u039a\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u2013 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03bb|trans-title=Thessaloniki International Film Festival \u2013 Profile|language=el|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Greece|Ancient Greece}}\n* [[Outline of Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n* [[Index of Greece-related articles]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Main|Bibliography of Greece}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* \"Minorities in Greece&nbsp;\u2013 Historical Issues and New Perspectives\".

The population of Greece was estimated by the United Nations to {{UN_Population|Greece}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}.\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[Greece]] was inhabited as early as the [[Paleolithic]] period. Prior to the [[2nd millennium BC]], the Greek peninsula was inhabited by various pre-Hellenic peoples, the most notable of which were the [[Pelasgians]]. The [[Greek language]] ultimately dominated the peninsula and Greece's mosaic of small city-states became culturally similar. The population estimates on the Greeks during the 4th century BC, is approximately 3.5 million on the Greek peninsula and 4 to 6.5 million in the rest of the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]],<ref>[[Mogens Herman Hansen]], ''The Shotgun Method: The Demography of the Ancient Greek City-State Culture'', [[University of Missouri Press]], 2006. [http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/112.4/br_126.html Book review]</ref> including all colonies such as those in [[Magna Graecia]], [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and the shores of the [[Black Sea]].\n\nDuring the history of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Greek peninsula was occasionally invaded by the foreign peoples like [[Goths]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Normans]], [[Franks]] and other [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speaking peoples who had betrayed the [[Crusades]]. The only group, however, that planned to establish permanent settlements in the region were the Slavs. They settled in isolated valleys of the [[Peloponnese]] and [[Thessaly]], establishing segregated communities that were referred by the Byzantines as [[Sclaveni (military)|Sclaveni]]. Traces of Slavic culture in Greece are very rare and by the 9th century, the Sclaveni in Greece were largely assimilated. However, some Slavic communities managed to survive in rural [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. At the same time a large [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] emigrant community from the [[Iberian peninsula]] established itself in [[Thessaloniki]], while there were population movements of [[Arvanites]] and [[Vlachs]], who established communities in several parts of the Greek peninsula. The Byzantine Empire ultimately fell to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 15th century and as a result Ottoman colonies were established in the [[Balkans]], notably in Macedonia, the Peloponnese and [[Crete]]. Many Greeks either fled to other [[Europe]]an nations or to geographically isolated areas (i.e. mountains and heavily forested territories) in order to escape foreign rule. For those reasons, the population decreased in the plains, while increasing on the mountains. The [[population transfer]]s with [[Bulgaria]] and [[Turkey]] that took place in the early 20th century, added in total some two million Greeks from to the demography of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greek Kingdom]].\n\n==Urbanization==\n{{See also|List of cities in Greece}}\n{{Largest cities of Greece}}\n\n==Population==\n{{Main|Demographic history of Greece}}\n[[File:Population of Greece since 1961.svg|thumb|400px|Population of Greece since 1961.]]\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Hellenic Statistical Authority]]\n|1928 | 6204684\n|1940 | 7344860\n|1951 | 7632801\n|1961 | 8398050\n|1971 | 8831036\n|1981 | 9729350\n|1991 | 10258364\n|2001 | 10964020\n|2011 | 11123392\n|2017 | 10768477\n}}\n\nAccording to the 2001 census the population of Greece was 10,964,020.

A spokesman for the [[European Union]]'s border control agency said that the Greek-Albanian border is \"one of Europe's worst-affected external land borders.\" Migrants across the [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]] region bordering Turkey face land-mines.

During the centuries that Greece was part of the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman Empire]], besides its spiritual mandate, the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Orthodox Church]], based in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]]), also functioned as an official representative of the [[Christianity|Christian]] population of the empire. The Church is often credited with the preservation of the [[Greek language]], values, and national identity during Ottoman times. The Church was also an important rallying point in the war for independence against the Ottoman Empire, although the official Church in Constantinople initially condemned the breakout of the armed struggle in fear of retaliation from the Ottoman side. The [[Church of Greece]] was established shortly after the formation of a Greek national state. Its authority to this day extends only to the areas included in the independent Greek state before the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-1913. There is a [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] concentrated in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] and officially protected by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]].

[[English language|English]] study is compulsory from first grade through high school. University education, including books, is also free, contingent upon the student's ability to meet stiff entrance requirements. A high percentage of the student population seeks higher education. More than 100,000 students are registered at [[List of universities in Greece|Greek universities]], and 15% of the population currently holds a university degree. Admission in a university is determined by state-administered exams, the candidate's grade-point average from high school, and his/her priority choices of major. About one in four candidates gains admission to Greek universities.\n\nGreek law does not currently offer official recognition to the graduates of private universities that operate in the country, except for those that offer a degree valid in another [[European Union]] country, which is automatically recognized by reciprocity. As a result, a large and growing number of students are pursuing higher education abroad. The [[Cabinet of Greece|Greek Government]] decides through an evaluation procedure whether to recognize degrees from specific foreign universities as qualification for public sector hiring. Other students attend private, post-secondary educational institutions in Greece that are not recognized by the Greek Government. At the moment extensive public talk is made for the reform of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] in order to recognize private higher education in Greece as equal with public and to place common regulations for both.\n\nThe number of Greek students studying at [[Europe]]an institutions is increasing along with EU support for educational exchange. In addition, nearly 5,000 Greeks are studying in the [[United States]], about half of whom are in graduate school. Greek per capita student representation in the US (one every 2,200) is among the highest in Europe.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Demographic history of Greece]]\n*[[Turks of Western Thrace]]\n*[[Minorities in Greece]]\n*[[Aging of Europe]]\n*[[Albanian immigrants in Greece]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=fn|refs=\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.statistics.gr/ General Secretariat of National Statistical Service of Greece] {{el icon}} {{en icon}}\n*[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html The World Factbook]\n\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Demographics of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demographics Of Greece}}\n[[Category:Greek society]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Greece]]", "sha1": "q1sqls49tlbhqxa0chut6gnh02ssm0g"}}, {"title": "Politics of Greece", "ns": "0", "id": "12112", "revision": {"id": "862951029", "parentid": "855147885", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T19:29:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Chris the speller", "id": "525927"}, "minor": "", "comment": "replaced: Presidential candidate \u2192 presidential candidate", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Politics of Greece}}\n\nThe '''politics of Greece''' takes place in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[Prime Minister of Greece]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Government of Greece|government]] and the [[Hellenic Parliament]]. Between the [[Metapolitefsi|restoration of democracy]] in 1974 and the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] the party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (\u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u2013 ''Nea Dimokratia'') and the social-democratic [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf \u03a3\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039a\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u2013 ''Panellinio Sosialistiko Kinima'', \u03a0\u0391\u03a3\u039f\u039a/PASOK).\n\nThe [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Greece]], which describes [[Greece]] as a \"presidential parliamentary republic\", includes extensive specific guarantees of [[civil liberties]] and vests the powers of the [[head of state]] in a president elected by parliament. The Greek governmental structure is similar to that found in many other Western [[democracy|democracies]], and has been described as a compromise between the French and German models. The prime minister and cabinet play the central role in the political process, while the president perform some executive and legislative functions in addition to ceremonial duties. Voting in Greece is compulsory but is not enforced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n== Executive branch ==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[President of Greece|President]]\n|[[Prokopis Pavlopoulos]]\n|[[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]\n|13 March 2015\n|-\n|[[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Alexis Tsipras]]\n|[[SYRIZA]]\n|21 September 2015\n|}\n\n[[File:Crown Prince Palace Athens 1909.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|Presidential Mansion]], previously the Crown Prince's palace.]]\n[[File:Papandreou Papademos - Ceremony for the official handover - 11 November 2011 (7).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Maximos Mansion]], the official seat of the [[Prime Minister of Greece]].]]\n\nThe [[Cabinet of Greece]], which is the main organ of the [[Government of Greece|government]], includes the heads of all executive ministries, appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\n=== President ===\n{{Further|President of Greece}}\n\nThe President of the Republic is elected by the Parliament for a five-year term (election last held 13 March 2015), and a maximum of two terms in office. When a presidential term expires, Parliament votes to elect the new President. In the first two votes, a {{frac|2|3}} majority (200 votes) is necessary. The third and final vote requires a {{frac|3|5}} (180 votes) majority.\n\nIf the third vote is fruitless, Parliament is dissolved and elections are proclaimed by the outgoing President within the next 30 days. In the new Parliament, the election for President is repeated immediately with a 3/5 majority required for the initial vote, an absolute majority for the second one (151 votes) and a simple majority for the third and final one. The system is so designed as to promote consensus presidential candidates among the main political parties.\n\nThe president has the power to [[declare war]], to grant [[pardon]] (forgiveness) and to conclude agreements of peace, alliance, and participation in international organizations; upon the request of the government a simple parliamentary majority is required to confirm such actions, agreements, or treaties. An absolute or a three-fifths majority is required in exceptional cases (for example, the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession into the EU]] needed a 3/5 majority).\n\nThe president can also exercise certain emergency powers, which must be countersigned by the appropriate cabinet minister.  The president may not dissolve parliament, dismiss the government, suspend certain articles of the constitution, issue a proclamation or declare a state of siege without countersigning by the prime minister or the appropriate cabinet minister. To call a referendum, he must obtain approval from parliament.\n\n=== Prime minister ===\n{{Further|Prime Minister of Greece}}\n\nThe prime minister is elected by the people and he or she is usually the leader of the party controlling the absolute majority of Parliament members. According to the Constitution, the prime minister safeguards the unity of the government and directs its activities. He or she is the most powerful person of the Greek political system and recommends ministers to the President for appointment or dismissal.\n\n=== Maintaining the support of parliament ===\nGreek parliamentary politics hinge upon the principle of the \"{{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}}\" (pronounced \"dhedhilom'''e'''ni\"), the \"declared confidence\" of Parliament to the Prime Minister and his/her administration. This means that the President of the Republic is bound to appoint, as Prime Minister, a person who will be approved by a majority of the Parliament's members (i.e. 151 votes). With the current electoral system, it is the leader of the party gaining a plurality of the votes in the Parliamentary elections who gets appointed Prime Minister.\n\nAn administration may at any time seek a \"vote of confidence\". Conversely a number of Members of Parliament may ask that a \"vote of reproach\" be taken. Both are rare occurrences with usually predictable outcomes as voting outside the party line happens very seldom.\n\nOn 4 October 2009, [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], president of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] party and son and grandson of Prime Ministers, [[Greek legislative election, 2009|was elected]] as the new [[Prime Minister of Greece]], following five years of government under [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] leader [[Kostas Karamanlis]], the nephew of long-time Prime Minister and President [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]].\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{Further|Hellenic Parliament|Elections in Greece}}\n\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 10 Parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Greek Parliament]] building, which was the [[Old Royal Palace]].]]\n\nGreece elects a legislature by universal suffrage of all citizens over the age of 18. The [[Parliament of Greece|Greek Parliament]] (\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term by a system of reinforced [[proportional representation]] in 48 multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], 8 single-seat constituencies and a single nationwide list. 288 of the 300 seats are determined by constituency voting, and voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking their name on the party ballot. The remaining 12 seats are filled from nationwide party lists on a top-down basis and based on the proportion of the total vote each party received.\n\nGreece uses a complex reinforced proportional representation electoral system which discourages splinter parties and makes a parliamentary majority possible even if the leading party falls short of a majority of the popular vote. Under the current electoral law, any single party must receive at least a 3% nationwide vote tally in order to elect Members of Parliament (the so-called \"3% threshold\"). The largest party gets a 50-seat bonus (out of 300 seats) ostensibly to ensure elections return viable governing majorities.\n\nThe law in its current form favors the [[first past the post]] party to achieve an absolute (151 parliamentary seats) majority, provided it receives a 41%+ nationwide vote. This is touted to enhance governmental stability. The electoral law can be changed by simple parliamentary majority, but a law so changed only becomes enforced in the election following the upcoming one, unless it is voted by the Greek Parliament with a majority of {{frac|2|3}} of the total number of the deputies.\n\n==Judicial branch==\n{{Main article|Judicial system of Greece}}\n[[File:Council of State, Greece, 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|The building of the ''Arsakeion'' in Athens, where the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] is seated.]]\n\nIn Greece the judicial branch is divided into civil, and administrative courts. Civil courts judge civil and penal cases, whereas administrative courts judge administrative cases, namely disputes between the citizens and the State.\n\nThe judicial system of Greece comprises three Supreme Courts: the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)]] (\u0386\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2), the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] (\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) and the [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Chamber of Accounts]] (\u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf). These high courts are composed of professional judges, graduates of the National School of Judges. The way the judges are gradually promoted, until they become members of the Supreme Courts, is defined by the Constitution and the existing laws. The presidents and the vice-presidents of the three Supreme Courts are chosen by the [[Cabinet of Greece]] among the serving members of each of the Supreme Courts.\n\nThe [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] is the supreme civil and penal court, whereas the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] is the supreme administrative court. The [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Chamber of Accounts]] has an [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over certain administrative areas (for example it judges disputes arising from the legislation regulating the pensions of civil servants) and its decisions are irrevocable. This means that they are not judged at second instance by the Council of State.\n\nSometimes, the Supreme Courts take contradictory decisions or they judge differently the constitutionality of a legal provision. These disputes are resolved by the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]], whose composition and jurisdiction is regulated by the Constitution (article 100). As its name reveals, this court is not permanent and it sits when a special case belonging to its jurisdiction arises. When the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]] sits, it comprises eleven members: the Presidents of the three Supreme Courts, four members of the Court of Cassation and four members of the Council of State.\n\nWhen it judges the constitutionality of a law or resolves the disputes between Supreme Courts, its composition comprises two more members: two professors of the Law Schools of Greece. The Supreme Special Court is the only court which can declare an unconstitutional legal provision as \"powerless\" (something like \"null and void\"), while the three Supreme Courts can only declare an unconstitutional legal provision as \"inapplicable\" to that particular case. The Supreme Special Court is also the Supreme Electoral Court, judging pleas against the legality of the legislative elections.\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{Further|Administrative divisions of Greece}}\n{{Update section|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Kallikratis dioikisi.png|thumb|350px|The [[administrative divisions of Greece]], showing regions and municipalities]]\n\nGreece is divided in [[modern regions of Greece|13 regions]], further divided into [[regional units of Greece|74 regional units]]. The prefectures are each headed by a prefect (the \"''Nomarch''\"), who is elected by direct popular vote. The thirteen regional administrative districts ([[Peripheries of Greece|peripheries]]), each including a number of prefectures are headed by a regional governor (the \"''Peripheriarch''\"), appointed by the Minister of the Interior. In northern Greece and in greater [[Athens]], three areas have an additional administrative position between the nomarch and peripheriarch.\n\nThis official, known as the Chair of the prefectural local authorities or \"superprefect\" (the \"''Hypernomarch''\"), is elected by direct popular vote together with the nomarchs she or he supervises. Although municipalities and villages have elected officials, they do not have an adequate independent revenue base and must depend on the central government budget for a large part of their financial needs. Consequently, they are subject to numerous central government controls. This also leads to extremely low municipal taxes (usually around 0.2% or less).\n\nGreece also includes one autonomous region, the [[monastery|Monastic]] Community of the Holy Mountain, [[Mount Athos]].\n\n==Foreign relations==\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Greece}}\n\nAs one of the oldest Euro-Atlantic member states in the region of [[Southeast Europe]], Greece enjoys a prominent geopolitical role, due to its political and geographical proximity to [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]]. Its main allies are [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]], United States, the other [[NATO]] countries like [[Albania]], and the [[European Union]].\n\nGreece also maintains strong diplomatic relations with [[Cyprus]], [[Albania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Armenia]] and [[Israel]], while at the same time focuses at improving further the good relations with [[Egypt]] and the [[Arab World]], [[Caucasus]], and [[China]]. As member of both the EU and the [[Union for the Mediterranean]], Greece is a key player in the eastern Mediterranean region and has encouraged the collaboration between neighbors, as well as promoting the [[Energy Triangle]], for gas exports to Europe. Greece also has the largest economy in the [[Balkans]], where it is an important regional investor.\n\nProminent issues in Hellenic foreign policy include the [[Aegean dispute|claims in the Aegean Sea]] and Eastern Mediterranean by [[Turkey]], the Turkish [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus|occupation of Cyprus]], and the [[Macedonia naming dispute|dispute over the name]] of the [[Republic of Macedonia]]\n\n==Notable politicians of Greece==\n\n===Former===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]]\n* [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]\n* [[Spyridon Trikoupis]]\n* [[Andreas Metaxas]]\n* [[Dimitrios Kallergis]]\n* [[Alexandros Koumoundouros]]\n* [[Ioannis Kolettis]]\n* [[Epameinondas Deligiorgis]]\n* [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]\n* [[Theodoros Deligiannis]]\n* [[Alexandros Rizos Rangavis]]\n* [[Alexandros Zaimis]]\n* [[Georgios Christakis-Zografos]]\n* [[Georgios Theotokis]]\n* [[Ioannis Sfakianakis]]\n* [[Stephanos Dragoumis]]\n* [[Ion Dragoumis]]\n* [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]\n* [[Dimitrios Gounaris]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Ioannis Metaxas]]\n* [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]]\n* [[Themistoklis Sofoulis]]\n* [[Nikos Zachariadis]]\n* [[Sofoklis Venizelos]]\n* [[Georgios Papandreou]]\n* [[Nikolaos Plastiras]]\n* [[Grigoris Lambrakis]]\n* [[Ilias Iliou]]\n* [[Alexandros Panagoulis]]\n* [[Alexandros Papagos]]\n* [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]]\n* [[Spyros Markezinis]]\n* [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]\n* [[Evangelos Averoff]]\n* [[Leonidas Kyrkos]]\n* [[Andreas Papandreou]]\n* [[Georgios Rallis]]\n* [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Current===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]]\n* [[Dora Bakoyannis]]\n* [[Michalis Chrisochoidis]]\n* [[Maria Damanaki]]\n* [[Nikos Dendias]]\n* [[Anna Diamantopoulou]]\n* [[Stavros Dimas]]\n* [[Adonis Georgiades]]\n* [[Pavlos Geroulanos]]\n* [[Kostis Hatzidakis]]\n* [[Kostas Karamanlis]]\n* [[Liana Kanelli]]\n* [[Georgios Karatzaferis]]\n* [[Ilias Kasidiaris]]\n* [[Nikos Konstantopoulos]]\n* [[Dimitris Koutsoumpas]]\n* [[Fotis Kouvelis]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Vasilis Leventis]]\n* [[Stefanos Manos]]\n* [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]]\n* [[Lucas Papademos]]\n* [[George Papandreou]]\n* [[Theodoros Pangalos (politician)|Theodoros Pangalos]]\n* [[Karolos Papoulias]]\n* [[Prokopis Pavlopoulos]]\n* [[Giannis Ragousis]]\n* [[Antonis Samaras]]\n* [[Costas Simitis]]\n* [[Stavros Theodorakis]]\n* [[Alexis Tsipras]]\n* [[Yanis Varoufakis]]\n* [[Evangelos Venizelos]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Political issues ==\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main article|Education in Greece}}\n[[File:Working-class protest in Greece.JPG|thumb|A [[working class]] political protest in Athens, Greece calling for the boycott of a local bookshop after, allegedly, an employee was fired for her political activism]]\n\nUnder the Greek constitution,<ref name=\"GreekConstitution-Education-General\">[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A16 Article 16 of the Constitution of Greece].</ref> education is the responsibility of the state. Most Greeks attend public primary and secondary schools. There are a few private schools, which must meet the standard curriculum of and are supervised by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education oversees and directs every aspect of the public education process at all levels, including hiring all teachers and professors and producing all required textbooks.\n\n====Non-state owned universities====\nA recent issue concerning education in Greece is the institutionalisation of private universities. According to the constitution<ref name=\"GreekConstitution-Education-Universities\">[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A16 Article 16 of the Constitution of Greece], Section 5:  \"Education at university level shall be provided exclusively by institutions which are fully self-governed public law legal persons\".</ref> only state-run universities operate on the land. However, in the recent years many foreign private universities have established branches in Greece, offering [[Bachelor's]] level degrees, thus creating a legal contradiction between the Greek constitution and the EU laws allowing foreign companies to operate anywhere in the Union. Additionally, every year, tens of thousands of Greek students are not accepted to the state-run University system and become \"educational immigrants\" to other countries' Higher Education institutions, where they move to study.\n\nThis has created a chronic problem for Greece, in terms of loss of capital as well as human resources, since many of those students opt to seek employment in the countries they studied, after completing their studies. It is characteristic that in 2006, Greece, with 11.5&nbsp;million inhabitants, was fourth in the world in terms of student export in absolute numbers, with 60,000 students abroad, while the first country in this regard, People's Republic of China of over 1,3&nbsp;billion inhabitants, had 100,000 students abroad. In terms of students abroad as a percent of the general population, Greece is by far the leading country, with 5,250 students per million, compared to second Malaysia's 1,780 students per million inhabitants.\n\nCiting these problems as a result of the state's monopoly on Higher Education, [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) committed to amending the constitution, in order to allow private universities to operate in Greece on a non-profit basis. This proposal was rejected by then-ruling [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in the late nineties, and thus could not muster the support necessary to be put to vote on the constitutional amendment of 2001. However, PASOK has since changed its stance, and now also supports a constitutional provision for the creation of private Universities on a non-profit basis. This proposal continues to encounter the fierce opposition of the Left parties and part of the academic community, both professors and students.\n\nAt the outset of 2006, prime minister [[Kostas Karamanlis]] announced the initiative of his government for a new amendment of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]]. According to his assertion one of the main issues of this amendment (the second within less than 10 years) is going to be the creation of \"non-state owned\" universities.\n\n=== Illegal immigration ===\n{{main article|Immigration to Greece}}\n\nGreece has  problems with illegal immigration, especially from or via Turkey. Greek authorities believe that 90% of illegal immigrants in the EU enter through Greece, many fleeing because of unrest and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.<ref>{{cite news|title= Tensions Rise Over Illegal Immigrants In Greece |work=[[NPR]]|date=|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/14/139613525/tensions-over-illegal-immigrants-in-greece-rises|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Southern Europe's Immigration Test|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2010-02-18|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1964957_1964954_1964953,00.html|accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref>\n\nSeveral European courts have held that Greece is not complying with minimum standards of treatment for asylum seekers, so that illegal migrants who reach other countries cannot be sent back to Greece.<ref>{{cite news|title= On illegal immigration, Greek left, war damages, Klaus Boetig, traffic accidents   |work=[[Ekathimerini]]|date=|url= http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite3_1_30/03/2012_435673|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref>\n\nNumerous solutions have been proposed by the Greek government such as building a fence on the Turkish border and setting up detention camps.<ref>{{cite news|title= Greece to Build Border Fence to Deter Illegal Immigrants |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-02-06|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/world/europe/greece-to-build-fence-on-turkish-border-to-curb-illegal-immigrants.html|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Greece to open new detention centres for illegal migrants  |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-03-29|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/29/greece-detention-centres-migrants?newsfeed=true|accessdate=2012-04-01|location=London|first=Helena|last=Smith}}</ref>\n\n=== Judicial system ===\n{{main article|Judicial system of Greece}}\nOne of the main problems of the system is the long-time process needed, even for a simple case, something that negatively impacts investment, entrepreneurship, social relations, corporate governance, and public governance.<ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/163295/article/ekathimerini/comment/the-greek-judicial-system-in-critical-condition The Greek judicial system in critical condition]</ref><ref>[http://bponline.amcham.gr/?p=2828 The Greek Legal Crisis & Reform Of The Greek Legal System]</ref> Also corruption cases have appeared during the last years, such as the ''[[Paradikastiko]]'' organization scandal.<ref>[http://www.koutipandoras.gr/article/premiera-ths-dikhs-toy-paradikastikoy-kyklwmatos-me-fonto-apeilhtika-shmeiwmata-kai-sfaires \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd]</ref>\n\n====Prisons====\nThere are four distinct prison types in Greece. The first one is a special detention premises for adults called Agricultural Prisons. Agricultural prisons include 3 prisons and a warehouse. The second prison type is a special detention premise for young people, which includes three separate locations. The third prison type is a therapeutic premise, which includes a hospital, a psychiatric area, and a rehab facility. The last of the four prison types is for detention purposes. The total number of detention centers within Greece is twenty-two. Within these centers the percentage of female prisoners is 5.5%, which amounts to around 538 female prisoners. The percentage of juveniles in Greek prison is 2.9%. Greece\u2019s occupancy rate in prisons is 99%, which means that Greece\u2019s prisons are near full capacity. Because of this the Greek Justice Ministry and the European Council want to improve Greek prison conditions. These improvements include training for guards, improving of medical facilities, and better treatment of prisoners. These selected improvements are three human rights that the Greek correctional system would like to tackle.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{main article|Media in Greece}}\nThe Greek media, collectively, is a very influential institution \u2013 usually aggressive, sensationalist. As with many countries, most of the media are owned by businesses with commercial interests in other sectors of the economy. There are often accusations of newspapers, magazines, and radio and television channels being used to promote their commercial enterprises as well as to seek political influence.\n\nIn 1994, the [[Minister for the Press and the Media (Greece)|Ministry of Press and Media]] was established to deal with media and communication issues. [[Ellinik\u00ed Radiofon\u00eda Tile\u00f3rasi|ERT S.A.]], a public corporation supervised by the Minister of Press, operates three national television channels and five national radio channels. The Minister of Press also serves as the primary government spokesperson.\n\nThe Secretary General of Press and Information prepares the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) Bulletin. Along with [[Associated Press|AP]] and [[Reuters]], this is a primary source of information for the Greek press. The Ministry of Press and Information also issues the semi-official Macedonian News Agency (MPE) Bulletin, which is distributed throughout the Balkan region. For international news, [[CNN]] is a particular influence in the Greek market; the major television channels often use it as a source. State and private television stations also use [[European Broadcasting Union|Eurovision]] and [[Visnews]] as sources. While few papers and stations have overseas correspondents, those few correspondents abroad can be very influential.\n\nIn 1988, a new law provided the legal framework for the establishment of private radio stations and, in 1989, private television stations. According to the law, supervision of radio and television is exercised by the National Radio and Television Council. In practice, however, official licensing has been delayed for many years. Because of this, there has been a proliferation of private radio and television stations, as well as European satellite channels, including [[Euronews]]. More than 1,000 radio stations were operating before March 2002, when the government implemented plans to reallocate television frequencies and issue licenses as authorized by the 1993 Media Law, effectively reducing this number.\n\nIn 2011, the government proposed new measures that will restrict the freedom of speech in the internet. According to some proposals, every individual who would like to use free platforms, such like [[Blogspot]] or [[WordPress.com]] will be forced to get officially registered in the courts, as due to tough austerity measures web sites that criticize the government and the political system in general have been multiplied.<ref>[http://www.avgi.gr/ArticleActionshow.action?articleID=634166]</ref>\n\n[[Press freedom]] sharply eroded in Greece during [[Greek government-debt crisis|the economic and financial crisis of 2010\u20132015]], passing from the 35th place in 2009 in [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] to the 99th place in 2014, well below all [[Western Balkans]] countries as well as states with repressive media policies such as [[Gabon]], [[Kuwait]] or [[Liberia]].<ref name=euroscope>Thomas Van Der Heijden, [http://publications.europeintheworld.com/media-landscape-greece-must-reform-quickly-3/ Media landscape in Greece must reform quickly], ''Euroscope'', 28 November 2014</ref> Greece is today the [[EU member state]] \"where journalism and the media face their most acute crisis\".<ref name=OSF>Petros Iosifidis and Dimitris Boucas, [https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/media-policy-independent-journalism-greece-20150511.pdf Media Policy and Independent Journalism in Greece] (PDF), ''[[Open Society Foundation]] report'', 1 May 2015</ref>\n\n=== Military service ===\n{{Main article|Conscription in Greece}}\n\nNine months for all males of 18 years of age; Compulsory with fines and imprisonment if denied, but neither fine nor imprisonment has been imposed since 1994, where the last warrant against a draft-dodger was issued. Members of families with three children serve a reduced time of six months. Military service can also be substituted with a longer public service, which by the standards of Amnesty International, ought to be considered punitive as it is twice as long as the regular tour of duty.\n\nLimited steps have been taken to turn the Greek military into a semi-[[professional army]] in the last years, leading to the gradual reduction of the service from 18 to 12 to 9 months and the inclusion of a greater number of professional military personnel in most vertices of the force. Recent developments, though, within the anti-conscription movement in Greece, such as the high{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} death rate from suicides during service and work-related accidents, such as the [[Manitsa]] incident, combined with a high rate of draft-dodging, have advanced the idea that mandatory conscription should be abolished and an all-professional/all-volunteer army should be put in place.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n==== Military spending ====\nGreece directs approximately 1.7% of its GDP <!--This most probably refers to direct military spending. \"Indirect\" was mentioned.

For more information see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]. Conversely, the foreign relations of Greece as well as many internal policy decisions are largely affected by its arms purchases. The United States, being the major arms seller to Greece has been known to actively intervene in military spending decisions made by the Greek government.<ref name=\"mil_explanation_sources2\">[https://fas.org/asmp/profiles/greece.htm#Arms%20Sales%20Tables US Arms Clients Profiles \u2013 Greece]: \"The Greek publication Elevtherotipia reported that former Ambassador Nicholas Burns had taken part in attempting to dissuade Greek officials from purchasing the Eurofighter in favor of a U.S. military aircraft.\"</ref> The US has at times actively stepped in to help avoid large scale crisis, as in the case of the [[Imia-Kardak crisis]].\n\nThe reduction of military spending has long been an issue in Greek politics. The former prime minister, [[Kostas Karamanlis]] had proposed a reduction to military spending through a \"Defence Eurozone\",<ref name=\"mil_Karam_expo\">[http://www.hri.org/news/greek/eragr/2003/03-09-13_1.eragr.htmlThe Hellenic Radio (ERA): News in Greek, 03-09-13]</ref> referring to the [[European Security and Defence Policy]]. The previous PASOK administration, also planned on reducing military spending<ref name=\"mil_pasok_2001\">[http://www.hri.org/news/grpapers/typos/2001/01-11-15.typos.html Athens News Agency: Press Review in Greek, 01-11-15]</ref> prior to its failure to be re-elected in 2004, while PASOK politicians usually refer to money saved from reducing military spending as a \"peace dividend\" (\"\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\").<ref name=\"mil_pasok_div\">[http://www.mnec.gr/christ_int_211203.aspx Speech of PASOK former finance minister Nikos Christodoulakis]</ref>\n\nSome of the parties on the left, such as the [[Communist Party of Greece]] and [[Synaspismos]], have been vocal in condemning military spending. Regarding the purchase of 30 [[F-16]] and 333 [[Leopard 2|Leopard tank]]s in 2005, both parties criticized the New Democracy administration for spending money on weapons while doing nothing to relieve the lower classes and said that high military spending \"does not correspond to the real needs of the country but is carried out according to [[NATO]] planning and to serve weapon manufacturers and the countries that host them\".<ref name=\"mil_left\">[http://www.hri.org/news/europe/bbc/2005/05-07-19.bbc.html HR-NET index of BBC broadcasts in Greek, 05-07-19 News]</ref>\n\n=== Church-State relations===\n{{main article|Religion in Greece}}\n\nThe [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] is under the protection of the State, which pays the clergy's salaries, and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] is the \"'prevailing\" religion of Greece according to the Constitution. The Greek Orthodox Church is self-governing but under the spiritual guidance of the Ecumenical Patriarch in [[Constantinople]]. Freedom of religious beliefs is guaranteed by the Constitution, but \"[[proselytism]]\" is officially illegal. According to the most recent Eurostat \"Eurobarometer\" poll, in 2005,<ref name=\"Eurostat poll on the social and religious beliefs of Europeans\">Eurobarometer, http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf</ref> 81% of Greek citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 16% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and only 3% that \"they do not believe there is a God, spirit, nor life force\". This would make Greece one of the most religious countries in the European Union of 25 members, after Malta and Cyprus.\n\nThe Muslim minority, concentrated in [[Thrace]], was given legal status by provisions of the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and is Greece's only officially recognized religious minority. There are small Roman Catholic communities on some of the [[Cyclades]] and the Ionian Islands, remnants of the long [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule over the islands. The recent influx of (mostly illegal) immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Third World has an expectedly varied multi-religious profile (Roman Catholic, Muslim, [[Hindu]] etc.).\n\nDuring the 2001 constitutional amendment, complete separation of church and state was proposed, but the two major parties, ND and PASOK, decided not to open this controversial matter, which clashes with both the population and the clergy. For example, numerous protests occurred over the removal of the Religious Denomination entry from the National ID card in 2000.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gpsg.org.uk Greek Politics Specialist Group (GPSG) of the UK's Political Studies Association]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090609065440/http://ekloges.ypes.gr/pages/index.html Official election results], via the Greek Ministry of Internal Affairs\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031222005835/http://www.ekloges.gr/ ekloges.gr] Greek Elections\n* [http://www.primeminister.gr Official website of the Prime Minister of Greece]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013150/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_1_30/03/2006_179002 Greece the first country in the globe in terms of student export]\n* [http://www.politicsgr.com Greek Politics Community Forums]\n*[http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20100628-eurozone-crisis Greece and eurozone in crisis] dossier by Radio France Internationale in English June 2010\n\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Politics of Europe}}\n{{Europe topic|Parliament of}}\n{{Commons category|Politics of Greece}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Politics of Greece| ]]", "sha1": "o992aoonx1kulvvj05yicmd77oxyjqz"}}, {"title": "Economy of Greece", "ns": "0", "id": "12113", "revision": {"id": "866665738", "parentid": "866665621", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T19:20:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "\u0398\u0395\u039f\u0394\u03a9\u03a1\u039f\u03a3", "id": "7816751"}, "comment": "year", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{update|date=August 2018}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country = Greece\n|image = Greece economy collage.png\n|gdp = {{increase}}$200.690&nbsp;billion <small>(nominal, 2017)</small><ref name=\"IMF GDP\" /><br />{{increase}}$299.311&nbsp;billion <small>(PPP, 2017)</small><ref name=\"IMF GDP\" />\n|gdp rank = 51 <small>([[Nominal GDP|nominal]], 2017)</small><ref name=\"World Bank GDP (nominal)\" /><br />56 <small>([[purchasing power parity|PPP]], 2017)</small><ref name=\"World Bank GDP (PPP)\" />\n|caption= Greek agriculture, shipping and tourism\n|currency = 1 [[euro]] (\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce) = 100 cents (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac)<ref name=\"EUprofileGreece\">{{cite web|title=Greece, country profile|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/greece/index_en.htm|publisher=European Union}}</ref>\n|year = [[Calendar year]]<ref name=\"CIAFactBook\">{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook: Greece, country profile|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}</ref>\n|organs = [[European Union|EU]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation|BSEC]]<ref name=\"CIAFactBook\" />\n|per capita = {{increase}}$18,637 <small>(nominal, 2017 est.)</small><ref name=\"IMF GDP\" /><br />{{increase}}$27,796 <small>(PPP, 2017 est.)</small><ref name=\"IMF GDP\" />\n|growth = {{increase}}1.8% <small>(Q2 2018 est., year-on-year)</small><ref>{{cite web|title=QUARTERLY NATIONAL ACCOUNTS 2nd Quarter 2018/2nd Quarter 2017: +1.8%|url=http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/e54994f6-fb09-4279-9e7c-cc7fdfebf55b|publisher=[[Hellenic Statistical Authority]]|accessdate=3 September 2018|location=Piraeus|format=PDF|date=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GDP and main aggregates estimate for the second quarter of 2018|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9102849/2-07092018-AP-EN|publisher=[[Eurostat]]|accessdate=14 September 2018|location=Luxembourg|format=PDF|date=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n|sectors = services: 80%;

After signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]], Greece applied to join the [[eurozone]]. The two main [[euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] were a maximum budget deficit of 3% of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60% of GDP. Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account. On 1 January 2001, Greece joined the eurozone, with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate \u20af340.75 to \u20ac1. However, in 2001 the euro only existed electronically, so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002.

In some harder hit areas of western Greece, the younger generation unemployment rate is more than 60%. When people are out of work for more than two years, they lose their health insurance, further increasing the problems of those in poverty. When younger people are out of work, they rely on the older generations of their families to provide for them to get them through the hard times. However, long term unemployment across the country causes pension funds to decrease because they are getting less money from the working population, so those older generations are getting less money to provide for the younger generations and their entire families, putting more of them in poverty. Many aspects of the economic problems add to the problem. The [[Greeks|Greek]] people have continued job loss and wage cuts, as well as deep cuts in workers compensation and [[social welfare]] benefits. For those who are working, their wages have dropped. From 2008 to 2013, Greeks have become 40% poorer on average, and in 2014 saw their disposable household income drop below 2003 levels.<ref name=\"Reuters\">{{cite web|last1=Georgiopoulos|first1=George|title=Greeks 40 percent poorer than in 2008|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-incomes-idUSBRE99L0I420131022|website=www.reuters.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> The Economic Survey of Greece 2016 shows optimism in a stronger recovery in 2017 by using things like the reforms in place and outside investment in jobs to help change the course of the high levels of poverty.\n\n{{Line chart\n| color_background = white\n| color_secondary_scale = white\n| color_series_1 = red\n| thickness_series1 = 1.5\n| color_series_2 = black\n| thickness_series2 = 1.5\n| width = 400\n| height = 250\n| padding_left = 45\n| padding_right = 20\n| padding_top = 20\n| padding_bottom = 20\n| number_of_series = 2\n| number_of_x-values = 8\n| label_x1 = 2008 | label_x2 = 2009 | label_x3 = 2010 | label_x4 = 2011 | label_x5 = 2012 | label_x6 = 2013 | label_x7 = 2014 | label_x8 = 2015| \n| y_max =  30.0\n| y_min =  5.00\n| scale = yes\n| interval_primary_scale = 2\n| interval_secondary_scale = 1\n            |S01V02=9.4|S01V03=11.8|S01V04=14.6|S01V05=14.8|S01V06=14.3|S01V07=14.1|S01V08=13.9|\n|S02V01=7.76|S02V02=9.6|S02V03=12.8|S02V04=17.9|S02V05=24.5|S02V06=27.5|S02V07=26.5|S02V08=24.7\n| points = yes\n}}\n{{legend|red|IMF projection (%)}}\n{{legend|black|Actual unemployment rate (%)}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Pasiouras, Fotios.

The station owned 3 national television stations, [[ET1 (Greece)|ET-1]], [[New Hellenic Television|NET]] (Nea Elliniki Tileorasi) and [[ERT3|ET-3]] which was based out of [[Thessaloniki]]. In January 2006, ERT launched [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] with 3 channels. By March 2006, at least 65% of the Greek population was able to view Digital TV for free with the use of set-top boxes. ERT also operated 7 national radio stations, including [[ERA 5]], the [[Voice of Greece]], which broadcast internationally via shortwave.  ERT was based in Athens.\n\nAs above, the Greek government announced the closure of ERT on 11 June 2013 with effect from midnight that evening. Since its official closure, employees of ERT have continued broadcasting with their feed being retransmitted online by various websites both inside and outside of Greece notably the CYBC in Cyprus and via the website of the EBU (European Broadcasting Union). The closure of ERT has had political implications in Greece with the smallest party of the Greek coalition government, the Democratic Left withdrawing from government leaving Greece with a New Democracy / PASOK coalition government which has a majority of only three seats.\n\nThe first non-[[pirate radio|pirate]] private radio station to broadcast in Greece was [[Athena 98.4 FM]], in 1987.

[[EOKA-B]] and the [[Turkish Resistance Organization]] (TMT) were responsible for many atrocities which resulted in cementing tensions and led to total isolation of the communities with Turkish Cypriots withdrawn into [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves|enclaves]].\n\nIn 1974 the US-backed Greek junta \u2013 in power since 1967 \u2013 partly in a move to draw attention away from internal turmoil and partly unsatisfied with Makarios' policy in Cyprus, on 15 July attempted a coup to replace him with Nikos Sampson and declare union with Greece. Seven days later, Turkey launched an invasion of Cyprus allegedly to reinstate the constitution but which resulted in blooded conflict, partition of the island and mass ethnic cleansing. The overwhelming Turkish land, naval and air superiority against island's weak defenses led to the bringing of 37% of the land under Turkish control.\n\n170,000 Greek Cypriots were evicted from their homes in the north with 50,000 Turks following the opposite path concluding the de facto division of Cyprus. In 1983 Turkish Cypriots proclaimed independence unilaterally with only Turkey recognizing them. As of today the north is under an embargo as a measure against the illegal partition of the island.\n\nEver since both countries along with the two communities of the island are engages into a [[vicious cycle]] of negotiations which led to little. In 2004 the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus]] was put to vote but whilst it was accepted by the north, it was rejected by the Greek-Cypriots as it meant in their eyes, endorsing a confederal state with a weak central government and considerable local autonomy. The Republic of Cyprus is a constitutional democracy which has reached great levels of prosperity, with a booming economy and good infrastructures, part of the United Nations, [[European Union]] and several others organizations by whom it is recognized as the sole legitimate government of the whole island.\n\nGreece calls for the removal of Turkish troops from Cyprus and the restoration of a unified state. The Republic of Cyprus is receiving strong support from Greece in international forums with the latter maintaining a military contingent on the island, and Greek officers filling key positions in the [[Cypriot National Guard]].\n\n===Aegean claims by Turkey===\n{{Main article|Aegean dispute}}\n\nOther issues dividing Greece and Turkey involve the delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] in the Aegean Sea, territorial waters and airspace. In March 1987 a dispute concerning [[oil drilling]] rights, almost led to war between the countries with Greece advocating the dispute to be decided by the [[International Court of Justice]]. In early 1988, the Turkish and Greek Prime Ministers met at [[Davos, Switzerland]], and later in [[Brussels]]. They agreed on various measures to reduce bilateral tensions and to encourage cooperation.\n\nTensions over the Aegean Sea surfaced again in November 1994, when Greece claimed under the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]], which Turkey has not signed, that it reserved the right to declare an expansion of its [[continental shelf]] from {{convert|6|to(-)|12|nmi|0|lk=in}} around its Aegean islands. Turkey which has itself expanded its continental shelf in the [[Black Sea]] shore, stated that it would consider any such action a cause for war. New technical-level bilateral discussions began in 1994 but soon fizzled-out.\n\nIn January 1996, Greece and Turkey came close to an armed confrontation over the question of which country had sovereignty over an [[Imia-Kardak crisis|islet in the Aegean]]. In July 1997, on the sidelines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) summit in Madrid, Greek and Turkish leaders reached agreement on six principles to govern their bilateral relations. Within a few months, however, the two countries were again at odds over Aegean airspace and sovereignty issues. Tensions remained high for months, although various confidence-building measures were discussed to reduce the risk of military accidents or conflict in the Aegean, under the auspices of the NATO Secretary General.\n\n===Turkey and the EU===\n{{Main article|Accession of Turkey to the European Union}}\n\nGreece has come out in support of Turkey's bid for [[European Union]] membership,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ethesis.net/greece/greece.htm#Conclusion\n|accessdate=14 August 2008\n|title=Greece's Shifting Position on Turkish Accession to the EU Before and After Helsinki (1999)\n|author=Lucas, Dimitrios\n|date=4 January 2006\n|work=MA in European Studies\n|publisher=Catholic University of Leuven\n|quote=[Greece has become] one of Turkey's most ardent supporters within the EU.\n}}</ref> and supports its full integration to the union when conditions for its acceptance are met.

Mesut Y\u0131lmaz's admission sparked political outrage in Greece on Monday, causing Greece's Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras to say that the claims were \"serious and must be investigated,\" adding that Athens was awaiting a briefing from Ankara. Conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]'s shadow foreign minister Panos Panayiotopoulos said the revelations \"cast heavy shadows over Greek-Turkish relations\" and called on Turkey recompense Greece for losses incurred.<ref>[http://www.birgun.net/politics_index.php?news_code=1324643597&year=2011&month=12&day=23 Mesut Yilmaz told BirG\u00fcn about the dark years], BirG\u00fcn, Monday 23 December 2011 (in Turkish)</ref><ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_26/12/2011_419985 Former Turkish PM's arson admission fuels anger], [[Kathimerini]], Tuesday 27 December 2011</ref>\n\nFollowing an official complaint from Greece on 24 December seeking clarification over comments by former Prime Minister Mesut Y\u0131lmaz relating to forest fires in Greece in the mid-1990s, the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers, [[Stavros Dimas]] and [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]], spoke on Wednesday 28 December. Dimas stressed how important it was that Ankara investigate the claims that in the past Turkey's intelligence services paid arsonists to set fire to forests in Greece. In addition to Greek Foreign Ministry meetings with Turkish officials, Greece's Supreme Court prosecutor Yiannis Tentes launched an emergency inquiry on 27 December, ordering the investigations into the mid-1990s wildfires blamed on arson to be reopened with regard to the initial claims reportedly made by Y\u0131lmaz.<ref>[http://www.todayszaman.com/news-267033-greece-demands-official-response-from-ankara-on-forest-fires.html Greece demands official response from Ankara on forest fires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231015756/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-267033-greece-demands-official-response-from-ankara-on-forest-fires.html |date=31 December 2011 }}, ''[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]'', Wednesday 28 December 2011</ref>\n\nFormer head of [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|Greek intelligence service]] [[Leonidas Vasilikopoulos]] said they had received information from their agents in Turkey that Turkish agents or others were involved in the forest fires on Greek islands.<ref>[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/129031/turk-greek-ties-strained-by-arson-row.html Turk-Greek Ties Strained by Arson Row] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105739/http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/129031/turk-greek-ties-strained-by-arson-row.html |date=31 May 2014 }}, ''[[Journal of Turkish Weekly]]'', Friday 30 December 2011</ref> After making the comments in Turkish daily newspaper ''BirG\u00fcn'', Yilmaz said that his words had been distorted and that he was referring to Greek agents causing fires in Turkey.<ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_29/12/2011_420268 Greek, Turkish foreign ministers discuss fire comment], ''[[Kathimerini]]'', Saturday 31 December 2011</ref> However, on Thursday 29, Turkish daily ''Milliyet'' published an article referring to a secret report that seemed to support claims made in the interview by Mesut Y\u0131lmaz that secret agents had caused forest fires in Greece in the 1990s.

It described how the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization of Turkey]] (MIT) had formed two teams: one which carried out bombings at tourist sites on [[Crete]] and other parts of Greece and another which was responsible for starting the wildfires.

Previously, the US helped the reconstruction of post-war Greece through the [[Marshall plan]] and various other aids culminating at about $11.1&nbsp;billion in economic and security assistance since 1946. The current mutual defense cooperation agreement (MDCA) provides for continued U.S. military assistance to Greece and the operation by the U.S. of a military facility at [[Souda Bay]], [[Crete]].\n\nAbout three million Americans are of Greek ancestry.<ref>[[United States Department of State]]: [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3395.htm Background Note: Greece]</ref> [[Greek-American]]s are an established, well-organized community in the U.S. (several notable politicians, including former Vice-President [[Spiro Agnew]], and Senators [[Olympia Snowe]] and [[Paul Sarbanes]] are of Greek ancestry), and they help cultivate close political and cultural ties with Greece. Greece has the seventh-largest population of U.S. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] beneficiaries in the world.\n\nHowever, there is also a strong sentiment against USA policies towards Greece and the Balkans in general. Critics also charge the United States for supporting the 1967\u20131974 military junta in Greece, a fact that was acknowledged by Bill Clinton in his visit to Athens ''\"When the junta took over in 1967 here, the United States allowed its interests in prosecuting the Cold War to prevail over its interests \u2013 I should say its obligation \u2013 to support democracy, which was, after all, the cause for which we fought the Cold War. It is important that we acknowledge that.\"''\n\nThis American support for the military regime led to left-wing terrorist groups, most notably [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November]], attacking US targets such as the killing of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s station chief in Athens, [[Richard Welch]] in 1975. The populist [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] leader [[Andreas Papandreou]] had also a very strong anti-Western rhetoric, fueling the negative sentiments towards USA, even though it wasn't followed by actions.\n\nThe backing of [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] by [[Henry Kissinger]], the [[Operation Allied Force|Kosovo war]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9903/26/kosovo.protests/ | work=CNN | title=Greeks angered by NATO strikes clash with riot police | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> have tarnished the image of the United States in the eyes of their European ally. More recently, the strong support of President [[George W.

Since 1994, Greece has signed defense cooperation agreements with Israel and Egypt and in recent years, Greek leaders have made numerous trips to the region in order to strengthen bilateral ties and encourage the Middle East Peace Process. In July 1997, December 1997, and July 1998 Greece hosted meetings of Israeli and Palestinian politicians to contribute to the peace process.

A significant 300,000 strong Greek community in [[Istanbul]] and a 100,000 Muslim one in [[Western Thrace]] were excluded from the transfer, with each one supposed to be working as counter-weights to any anti-minority policy that either Turkey or Greece may sought to apply in the future, however that counter-weight came to an end before the Cyprus dispute because of the Varlik Vergisi and Istanbul pogrom.\n\nIn 1942 a wealth tax called the [[Varl\u0131k Vergisi]] was imposed on non-Muslims including Greeks, this resulted in financial ruin for many Greeks and another exodus of Greeks from Anatolia once World War II had come to an end. Again in 1955 an anti-Greek [[Istanbul pogrom]] was initiated by Turkish mobs against the Greek community of Istanbul, which led to the final gradual extinction of the Greek community in Anatolia. These two events were a major factor when the [[Cyprus problem]] surfaced as Greece and Turkey nearly came to a full-out war after Turkey's invasion of Cyprus. Similar disputes occurred for the islands of [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]]. Up to late 1990s strained relations almost led to [[Imia crisis|an open war]] in 1974, 1987 and 1996.

During rule of dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] relations were strained because of the part that Albania played during [[World War II]] against Greece and also because of the material help that they provided to Greek communists during the [[Greek civil war]]. In addition there was controversy about the treatment of the Greek minority in southern Albania and the [[Chameria|Cham issue]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Albanian socialist regime in 1991, relations between the two countries got better but soon begun to deteriorate with accusations about mistreatment of minorities vice versa. To the latter problem it was added the widespread phenomenon of waves of illegal immigration from Albania towards Greece. High criminality numbers from one hand and alleged police brutality from the other became familiar subjects on the news of both neighbors, increasing eventually tensions. According to official Greek data around 450,000 Albanian immigrants work in Greece and it is believed the number will almost double if illegal immigrants are accounted too. This is a brand new situation, for both countries as Greece for the first time become a destination country for immigrants and Albanians for the first time got out of their country after the total isolation that the communist regime had imposed.\n\nToday, relations between the two countries are very close and are regarded as excellent, and, at the Albanian Government's request, about 250 [[Military of Greece|Greek military]] personnel are stationed in Albania to assist with the training and restructuring the [[Albanian Armed Forces]]. Albania's economy is overdependent to the money immigrants from Greece sent back home, while Greece is the second larger trading partner, with more than US$400&nbsp;million worth of investments. Moreover, Greek products account for 21% of Albania's imports, with Greece absorbing 12% of its neighboring country's exports.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/Albania/ Bilateral Relations Between Greece And Albania<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At the same time, low cost labor from Albania propelled the growth of the Greek economy, especially in the construction and agriculture sectors.

It does still retain an honorary consulate general in Athens.\n\nOn the level of political cooperation, the two countries have a like-minded approach to international crises and current issues of international interest. There is particularly close cooperation in offering mutual support within international organizations, such as the Human Rights Commission, the Universal Postal Union, etc. New Zealand also supported Greece's candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council.\n\nThe prevailing climate in political relations between Greece and New Zealand was demonstrated in 2002 by the visit of the President of the Hellenic Republic to Wellington, which confirmed the excellent state of relations between the two countries.\n\n|--valign=\"top\"\n| {{flagu|Samoa}}||<!-- date relations started-->3 April 1981||\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on April 3, 1981<ref>[http://www.mfat.gov.ws/embassies/countries-with-established-diplomatic-relations-with-samoa/]</ref><ref>[https://www.mfa.gr/en/blog/greece-bilateral-relations/samoa/]</ref>. \n\n|--valign=\"top\"\n| {{flagu|Solomon Islands}}||<!-- date relations started-->||\n*Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1987.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gr/en/blog/greece-bilateral-relations/solomon-islands/]</ref> \n*Greece is represented in the Solomon Islands via parallel accreditation of its embassy in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].<ref>[http://www.mfa.gr/en/blog/greece-bilateral-relations/solomon-islands/]</ref> \n|--valign=\"top\"\n| {{flagu|Tonga}}||<!-- date relations started--> 1984<ref name=\"Greece\u2019s Bilateral Relations tonga\">[http://www.mfa.gr/en/blog/greece-bilateral-relations/tonga/ Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece]</ref>\n|\n* Diplomatic relations were established in 1984.<ref name=\"Greece\u2019s Bilateral Relations tonga\" />\n* Greece is represented in Tonga through its embassy in [[Wellington]], New Zealand.<ref name=\"Greece\u2019s Bilateral Relations tonga\" />\n|}\n\n==Terms==\n\n===Northern Epirus===\n{{Main article|Northern Epirus}}\n[[Image:Albania minorities.png|thumb|A map of the traditional Greek presence in [[Northern Epirus]] (in blue).]]\n\nNorthern Epirus is the name used generally by Greeks to refer to the southern part of Albania, home to a Greek minority<ref>Country Studies US: [http://countrystudies.us/albania/49.htm Greeks and Other Minorities]</ref> which after 1989 keeps reducing due to immigration to Greece. The Greek minority was subject to oppression and harassment during [[Enver Hoxha]]'s communist rule and along with the rest of Albanians was hit hardly by the isolation that the regime imposed and from the economic hardship that followed the [[fall of communism]] as well. The treatment of the minority by the Albanian government is strongly linked with the status of Greco-Albanian relations.\n\nThe Greek minority is organized under the [[Unity for Human Rights Party]] which is the continuation of the former banned party called \"Omonoia\" (Unity in Greek) and has since 1997 joined the [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist coalition]]. At the last elections the Greek minority party received 4.1% of the vote and two seats in parliament. The party leader is Vangjel Dule, while party member Vasilis Bolanos is the current mayor of the town of Himara. The party is represented in the ELDR group in the Council of Europe. Strong Greek presence exists in [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] (Argyrocastro), [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] (Korytsa), [[Sarand\u00eb]] (Ag.Saranta), [[Himara]] (Xeimara) and the nearby areas. The former CIA director [[George J. Tenet]], [[Pyrros Dimas]], [[Sotiris Ninis]] and former Greek president [[Kostis Stefanopoulos]] have ancestral links to the Greek minority.\n\n===Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople===\n{{See also|Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Halki seminary}}\n[[Image:Stgeorgeistanbul3.JPG|thumb|The entrance of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchal]] Cathedral of St. George in the Phanar district.]]\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, protected under the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|treaty of Lausanne]] is a point of controversy between Greece and Turkey as the latter refuses to recognize the Ecumenical character of the Patriarchate thus requiring the Patriarch himself to be a Turkish citizen. Moreover, the biggest part of the Patriarchate's property \u2013 known as Vakoufia \u2013 had been confiscated by Turkish authorities and the [[Halki seminary|Theological school of Halki]] which is the traditional school out of which the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], draws its clergy is closed since 1971. To no avail numerous Greek, European Union and USA officials have criticized Turkey's attitude and even president [[Bill Clinton]] during his visit in Greece asked for the theological school to open. During Greek prime-minister's [[Kostas Karamanlis]] historic visit to Turkey in 2007, [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] promised to reconsider his country's stance on the matter.\n\n===Black Sea===\nThe [[Black Sea]] is a region heavily colonized by Greeks throughout history. It used to have a [[Pontic Greeks|significant presence of Greeks]] up until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. Nowadays there remains Greek presence on the shores of Black Sea mainly in [[Mariupol]] (Ukraine), [[Crimea]], Russia and Georgia despite emigration to Greece during and after the dissolution of [[Soviet Union]]. Today Greeks in the region are estimated to be around 215,000 according to official [[Greek diaspora]] figures.

To strengthen trading and power, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became Danish in 1814, and was fully integrated in the Danish state in 1953 under the [[Constitution of Denmark]].\n\nIn 1973, Greenland joined the [[European Economic Community]] with Denmark. However, in a [[Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum, 1982|referendum]] in 1982, a majority of the population voted for Greenland to withdraw from the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], which was effected in 1985. Greenland contains the world's largest and most northerly [[national park]], [[Northeast Greenland National Park]] (''Kalaallit Nunaanni nuna eqqissisimatitaq''). Established in 1974, and expanded to its present size in 1988, it protects {{convert|972001|km2|}} of the interior and northeastern coast of Greenland and is bigger than all but twenty-nine countries in the world.

In 1721, a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary [[Hans Egede]] was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there.

After 15&nbsp;years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son [[Paul Egede]] in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary.

''Inside the Third Reich,'' 1971</ref>\n\nGreenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] had maintained a strict monopoly of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenlandic trade]], allowing only small scale [[troaking]] with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the [[Landsr\u00e5dene]], recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern [[welfare state]] with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953 Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom.

Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation\u2014or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies \"succeeded\" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity.

The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small bushes, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]'') along with gray-leaf willow (''[[Salix glauca]]''), rowans (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common junipers (''[[Juniperus communis]]'') and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\n\nGreenland's flora comprises about 500 species of higher plants, i.e. [[flowering plant]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[lycopodiophyta]]. Of the other groups, the [[lichen]]s are the largest with about 950 species; of major fungal species are known 600\u2013700; [[moss]]es and [[algae]] anything less. Most of Greenland's higher plants are widespread, particularly in arctic and alpine regions, and only a dozen species of particular [[saxifrage]] and [[hawkweed]] is endemic. A few species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as [[Vicia cracca|cow vetch]].\n\nThe animals of Greenland include the [[Greenland dog]], which was introduced by the [[Inuit]], as well as [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]-introduced species such as [[Greenlandic sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[cattle]], [[reindeer]], [[horse]], [[chicken]] and [[sheepdog]], all descendants of animals imported by Europeans.

While the [[Greenlandic parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]] saw the unionist\u2014and largely Danish\u2014[[Democrats (Greenland)|Democrat]] Party (2&nbsp;MPs) decline greatly, the [[Greenlandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 election]] consolidated the power of the two main parties at the expense of the smaller groups, and saw the [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialist]] [[Inuit Party]]  elected to the [[Parliament of Greenland|Parliament]] for the first time. The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap [[Greenlandic general election, 2014|2014]] elections, and [[Greenlandic general election, 2018|2018]] elections.\n\nThe non-binding [[Greenlandic self-government referendum, 2008|2008 referendum on self-governance]] favoured increased self-governance 21,355 votes to 6,663.\n\nIn 1985, [[Greenland\u2013European Union relations|Greenland left the European Economic Community]] (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member. The EEC later became the [[European Union]] (EU, renamed and expanded in scope in 1992). Greenland retains some ties with the EU via Denmark. However, EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade.  Greenland is a member state of the [[Council of Europe]].<ref name=\"47 Member States\">{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/47-members-states|title=47 Member States|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Government===\n{{Main|Politics of Greenland}}\n[[File:Greenland-municipalities-2018.svg|thumb|upright|Municipalities of Greenland]]\n\nGreenland's [[head of state]] is [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe&nbsp;II]], [[Queen regnant]] of Denmark. The Queen's [[politics of Denmark|government in Denmark]] appoints a [[List of Danish High Commissioners in Greenland|High Commissioner]] (''Rigsombudsmand'') to represent it on the island. The commissioner is [[Mikaela Engell]].\n\nGreenlanders elect two representatives to the [[Folketing]], Denmark's parliament, out of a total of 179. The representatives are [[Aleqa Hammond]] of the [[Siumut]] Party and [[Aaja Chemnitz Larsen]] of the [[Inuit Community]] Party.<ref>[http://www.ft.dk/ Folketinget \u2013 Folketinget.dk]. Ft.dk. Retrieved on 21 June 2016.</ref>\n\nGreenland also has its own [[Parliament of Greenland|Parliament]], which has 31&nbsp;members. The government is the [[Naalakkersuisut]] whose members are appointed by the Premier. The [[head of government]] is the [[List of Premiers of Greenland|Premier]], usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament. The Premier is [[Kim Kielsen]] of the Siumut Party.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of Greenland}}\n\nFormerly consisting of three counties comprising a total of 18 municipalities, Greenland abolished these in 2009 and has since been divided into large territories known as \"municipalities\" ({{lang-kl|kommuneqarfiit}}, {{lang-da|kommuner}}): ''[[Sermersooq]]'' (\"Much Ice\") around the capital [[Nuuk]] and also including all [[Tunu|East Coast]] communities; ''[[Kujalleq]]'' (\"South\") around [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]]; ''[[Qeqqata]]'' (\"Centre\") north of the capital along the [[Davis Strait]]; ''[[Qeqertalik]]'' (\"The one with islands\") surrounding [[Disko Bay]]; and ''[[Avannaata]]'' (\"Northern\") in the northwest; the latter two having come into being as a result of the [[Qaasuitsup]] municipality, one of the original four, being partitioned in 2018. The northeast of the island composes the unincorporated ''[[Northeast Greenland National Park]]''. ''[[Thule Air Base]]'' is also unincorporated, an enclave within Avannaata municipality administered by the [[United States Air Force]]. During its construction, there were as many as 12,000 American residents but in recent years the number has been below 1,000.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Tasiilaq.jpg|left|thumb|Tasiilaq is a town in the [[Sermersooq]] municipality in southeastern Greenland]]\n[[File:Akamalik-royal-greenland-sisimiut-port.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Greenland]] fishing vessel \"Akamalik\", anchored at [[Sisimiut]]]]\n[[File:Greenland Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Greenland's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories]]\n{{Main|Economy of Greenland}}\n\nThe Greenlandic economy is highly dependent on fishing.

Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, [[uranium]], aluminium, nickel, [[platinum]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium]], and copper. Despite resumption{{when|date=January 2014}} of several [[hydrocarbon]] and mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before hydrocarbon production can materialize. The state oil company [[Nunaoil]] was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007.\n\nElectricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential [[hydropower]]. There is a programme to build hydro power plants. The first, and still the largest, is [[Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant]].\n\nThere are also plans to build a large aluminium smelter, using hydropower to create an exportable product. It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title      = Greenland's red hot labour market\n  |url        = http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2011/boom-for-nordic-mining-industry/article.2011-10-12.8124853746\n  |journal    = [[Nordic Labour Journal]]\n  |date       = 12 October 2011\n  |accessdate = 10 February 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[European Union]] has urged Greenland to restrict People's Republic of China development of [[rare-earth]] projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. In early 2013, the Greenland government said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-10/chinese-workers-in-greenland ''Chinese Workers\u2014in Greenland?''] 10 February 2013 ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.</ref>\n\nThe public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.\n\nGreenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and [[zinc]] mine that year. More recently,{{when|date=January 2014}} new sources of [[ruby]] in Greenland have been discovered, promising to bring new industry and a new export to the country. (See [[Gemstone industry in Greenland]]).\n\n===Economics and business===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\nAbout half of public spending on Greenland is funded by block grants from Denmark which in 2007 totalled over 3.2&nbsp;billion kr. Additional proceeds from the sale of fishing licences and the annual compensation from the EU represents 280&nbsp;million DKK per year. Greenland's economy is based on a narrow professional basis with the fishing industry as the dominant sector with some 90% of its exports. In a few years, quarrying and tourism could complement the fisheries that depend on the changing prices of fish and fishing opportunities. The long distances and lack of roads divides the domestic market into many small units that have high operating costs. Most of the [[Fish factory|fish factories]] are owned by [[Royal Greenland]].\n\n===Transportation===\n{{Main|Transport in Greenland|List of airports in Greenland}}\n[[File:AirGreenland Airbus (11832722805).jpg|thumb|left|[[Air Greenland]] Airbus [[A330-200]] in-flight]]\n\nAir transportation exists both within Greenland and between the island and other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of 3 miles length between [[Kangilinnguit]] and the now abandoned former [[cryolite]] mining town of [[Ivittuut]].<ref name=\"iExplore\">[https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/north-america/greenland/transportation Article about transportation in Greenland on iExplore.com, retrieved October 10, 2018]</ref> In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few countryside roads have been built.\n\nAll civil aviation matters are handled by the [[Danish Transport Authority]]. Most airports including [[Nuuk Airport]] have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]] around {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} inland from the west coast is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to [[Copenhagen]]. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and any city in Greenland requires a plane change.\n\n[[Air Iceland]] operates flights from [[Reykjav\u00edk]] to a number of airports in Greenland, and the company promotes the service as a day-trip option from Iceland for tourists.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perrin|first1=Wendy|title=Greenland Day Trip from Iceland: Is it Worth It?|url=http://www.wendyperrin.com/greenland-day-trip-from-iceland-is-it-worth-it/|website=Wendy Perrin|accessdate=25 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are no direct flights to the United States or Canada, although there have been flights Kangerlussuaq \u2013 [[Baltimore]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/news/news_archive/historical_maiden_flight_us-greenland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006075245/http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/news/news_archive/historical_maiden_flight_us-greenland |archivedate=6 October 2008 |title=Historical Maiden Flight US-Greenland \u2013 Official national guide by Greenland Tourism and Business Council |publisher=Greenland.com |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}</ref> and Nuuk \u2013 [[Iqaluit]].,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2012/06/07/north-greenland-first-air.html |title=Air Greenland teams with First Air for Iqaluit flights|work=CBC News|date= 7 June 2012|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> which were cancelled because of too few passengers and financial losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airgreenland.com/nyhed/?newsid=666 |title=The Baltimore route is to close |work=Air Greenland |date=12 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518074701/http://www.airgreenland.com/nyhed/?newsid=666 |archivedate=18 May 2013}}</ref> An alternative between Greenland and the United States/Canada is Air Iceland/[[Icelandair]] with a plane change in Iceland.<ref>{{cite web|title=4 Ways to Get to Greenland|url=https://www.fodors.com/news/4-ways-to-get-to-greenland-7070|website=Fodor's|accessdate=25 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nSea [[passenger]] and [[Cargo|freight]] transport is served by the coastal ferries operated by [[Arctic Umiaq Line]].

It is spoken by about 50,000 people, making it the most populous of the Eskimo\u2013Aleut language family, spoken by more people than all the other languages of the family combined.\n\nKalaallisut is the Greenlandic dialect of West Greenland, which has long been the most populous area of the island. This has led to its de&nbsp;facto status as the official \"Greenlandic\" language, although the northern dialect [[Inuktun]] remains spoken by 1,000 or so people around [[Qaanaaq]], and the eastern dialect [[Tunumiit dialect|Tunumiisut]] by around 3,000.<ref>Mennecier, Philippe (1978).

While Greenlandic is dominant in all smaller settlements, a part of the population of Inuit or mixed ancestry, especially in towns, speaks Danish. Most of the Inuit population speaks Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk and in the higher social strata, this is still a large group. While one strategy aims at promoting Greenlandic in public life and education, developing its vocabulary and suitability for all complex contexts, there are opponents of this.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nEnglish is another important language for Greenland, taught in schools from the first school year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eu.nanoq.gl/Emner/About%20Greenland/Travelling%20in%20Greenland.aspx |title=Travelling in Greenland |publisher=Greenland Representation to the EU, Greenland Home Rule Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516025948/http://eu.nanoq.gl/Emner/About%20Greenland/Travelling%20in%20Greenland.aspx |archivedate=16 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Greenland}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Greenland (2010)<ref name=\"ARDA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_94_1.asp |title=Greenland, Religion and Social Profile &#124; National Profiles &#124; International Data |website=Thearda.com |date=2009-06-21 |accessdate=2016-06-18}}</ref><ref>http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-as-percentages-of-total-population-by-country/</ref>\n</big>\n|label1 = [[Protestantism]]\n|value1 = 95.5\n|color1 = DodgerBlue\n|label2 = [[Roman Catholicism]]\n|value2 = 0.2\n|color2 = DarkOrchid\n|label3 = Other [[Christianity|Christian]]\n|value3 = 0.4\n|color3 = Turquoise\n|label4 = [[Inuit spiritual beliefs]]\n|value4 = 0.8\n|color4 = Red\n|label5 = [[Agnostic]]\n|value5 = 2.3\n|color5 = Honeydew\n|label6 = [[Atheist]]\n|value6 = 0.2\n|color6 = Grey\n|label7 = Other Religion\n|value7 = 0.6\n|color7 = Yellow\n}}\n[[File:Nanortalik church.jpg|thumb|left|Most Greenlandic villages, including [[Nanortalik]], have their own church.]]\n\nThe nomadic [[Inuit people]] were traditionally [[shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanistic]], with a well-developed [[Inuit mythology|mythology]] primarily concerned with appeasing a vengeful and [[Sedna (mythology)|fingerless sea goddess]] who controlled the success of the [[seal hunting|seal]] and [[whaling|whale hunts]].\n\nThe first [[Norse colonization of Greenland|Norse colonists]] worshipped the [[Norse religion|Norse gods]], but [[Erik the Red]]'s son [[Leif Ericson|Leif]] was converted to Christianity by [[List of Norwegian monarchs|King]] [[Olaf Trygvesson]] on a trip to Norway in 999 and sent missionaries back to Greenland.

Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called ''[[tupilak]]'' or a \"spirit object.\" Traditional art-making practices thrive in the ''Ammassalik''.<ref name=ingo20>[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 20</ref> [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.<ref>[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 21</ref>\n\nGreenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] bands and artists include [[Sume (band)|Sume]] (classic rock), [[Chilly Friday]] (rock), [[Nanook]] (rock), [[Siissisoq]] (rock), [[Nuuk Posse]] (hip hop) and [[Rasmus Lyberth]] (folk), who performed in the [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979|Danish Eurovision Song Contest 1979]], performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter [[Simon Lynge]] is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional [[Inuit music]], largely revolving around singing and drums.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Main|Sport in Greenland}}\nSport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 109</ref>\n\nPopular sports include [[association football]], [[track and field]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[skiing]]. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,<ref name=handball>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 110</ref> and [[Greenland national handball team|Greenland's men's national team]] was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001.\n\nGreenland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public.

The ice is so massive that its weight presses the bedrock of Greenland below sea level and is so all-concealing that not until recently did scientists discover [[Greenland's Grand Canyon]] or the possibility that Greenland might actually be three islands.<ref name=\"latimes2006-06-25\">Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2006, [http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/25/science/sci-greenland25 \"Greenland's Ice Sheet Is Slip-Sliding Away\"]</ref>\n\nIf the ice melted, the interior bedrock below sea level would be covered by water. It is not clear whether this water would be at sea level or a lake above sea level. If it would be at sea level it could connect to the sea at [[Ilulissat Icefjord]], in [[Baffin Bay]] and near [[Nordostrundingen]], creating three large islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cejournal.net/?p=4225|title=Is the world\u2019s fastest-moving glacier set to speed up even more?|publisher=}}</ref> But it is most likely that it would be a lake with one drain.\n\nIt is thought that before the [[Ice Age]] Greenland had mountainous edges, and a lowland (and probably very dry) center which drained to the sea by one big river flowing out westwards past where [[Disko Island]] is now.\n\nThere is concern about [[sea level rise]] caused by ice loss (melt and glaciers falling into the sea) on Greenland. Between 1997 and 2003 ice loss was {{convert|68|-|92|km3/a|cumi/a|0|abbr=on}}, compared to about {{convert|60|km3/a|cumi/a|abbr=on}} for 1993/4-1998/9. Half of the increase was from higher summer melting, with the rest caused by velocities of some glaciers exceeding those needed to [[Glacier mass balance|balance upstream snow accumulation]] (Krabill et al., L24402, GRL 2004). A complete loss of ice on Greenland would cause a [[sea level rise]] of as much as {{convert|6.40|m|ft|sp=us}}.\n\nResearchers at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and the [[University of Kansas]] reported in February 2006 that the glaciers are melting twice as fast as they were five years ago. By 2005, Greenland was beginning to lose more ice volume than anyone expected \u2013 an annual loss of up to {{convert|52|cumi|km3|0|disp=or}} per year, according to more recent satellite gravity measurements released by JPL. The increased ice loss may be partially offset by increased snow accumulation due to increased precipitation.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2006, monitoring of the weather at one location (Swiss Camp) found that the average winter temperature had risen almost {{convert|10|F-change|1|lk=on}}.\n\nRecently, Greenland's three largest outlet glaciers have started moving faster, satellite data show.

In March 2006, researchers at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] at [[Columbia University]] reported that the glaciers now generate swarms of earthquakes up to magnitude 5.0.<ref name=\"latimes2006-06-25\" />\n\nThe retreat of Greenland's ice is revealing islands that were thought to be part of the mainland. In September 2005 [[Dennis Schmitt]] discovered an island {{convert|400|mi|km|0}} north of the Arctic Circle in eastern Greenland which he named [[Uunartoq Qeqertaq]], [[Inuit language|Inuit]] for \"warming island\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/science/earth/16gree.html?ex=1326603600&en=b018c85a1b03d90f&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss The Warming of Greenland], ''New York Times'', January 16, 2007</ref>\n\n== Future projections ==\nIn the [[Arctic]], temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else in the world. Greenland is losing 200 billion tonnes of ice per year. Research suggests that this could increase the [[sea levels]] to rise by 30 centimeters by the end of the century. These projections have the possibility of changing as satellite data only traces back to 40 years ago. This means that researchers must view old photographs of [[glaciers]] and compare them to ones taken today to determine the future of Greenland's ice.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/180-000-forgotten-photos-reveal-the-future-of-greenland-s-ice-1.20335, \"Nature\", July 27, 2016]</ref>\n\n==Extreme points==\nThis is a list of the extreme points of [[Greenland]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n===Territory of Greenland===\n\n* Northernmost Point \u2014 [[Kaffeklubben Island]] (83\u00b040'N) \u2013 the [[Extreme points of Earth|northernmost]] permanent land in the world.

The Inuit population makes up approximately 85%-90% of the total (2009 est.).\n\n==Languages==\nThe only official language of [[Greenland]] is [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/GL/languages Ethnolgue]</ref> The number of speakers of [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] is estimated at 50,000 (85-90% of the total population), divided in three main dialects, [[Kalaallisut]] (West-Greenlandic, 44,000 speakers and the dialect that is used as official language), [[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit]] (East-Greenlandic, 3,000 speakers) and [[Inuktun language|Inuktun]] (North-Greenlandic, 800 speakers).  The remainder of the population mainly speaks [[Danish language|Danish]]; [[Greenlandic Sign Language]] is the language of the deaf community.\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Religion in Greenland}}\n[[File:Nanortalik church.jpg|thumb|right|Most Greenlandic villages, including [[Nanortalik]], have their own church.]]\n\nThe nomadic [[Inuit people]] were traditionally [[shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanistic]], with a well-developed [[Inuit mythology|mythology]] primarily concerned with propitiating a vengeful and [[Sedna (mythology)|fingerless sea goddess]] who controlled the success of the [[seal hunting|seal]] and [[whaling|whale hunts]].\n\nThe first [[Norse colonization of Greenland|Norse colonists]] were [[Norse religion|pagan]], but [[Erik the Red]]'s son [[Leif Ericson|Leif]] was converted to Catholic Christianity by [[List of Norwegian monarchs|King]] [[Olaf Trygvesson]] on a trip to Norway in 990 and sent missionaries back to Greenland. These swiftly established sixteen parishes, some monasteries, and a bishopric at [[Gar\u00f0ar, Greenland|Gar\u00f0ar]].\n\nRediscovering these colonists and spreading the [[Danish Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] among them was one of the primary reasons for the [[Danish colonization of Greenland|Danish recolonization]] in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the [[Royal Mission College]] in Copenhagen, Norwegian and Danish [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran]]s and German [[Moravian missions in Greenland|Moravian missionaries]] searched for the missing Norse settlements and began converting the Inuit. The principal figures in the [[Christianization]] of Greenland were [[Hans Egede|Hans]] and [[Poul Egede]] and [[Matthias Stach]]. The [[New Testament]] was translated piecemeal from the time of the very first settlement on Kangeq Island, but the first translation of the whole Bible was not completed until 1900. An improved translation using the [[Kalaallisut orthography|modern orthography]] was completed in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Leif Kiil S\u00f8rensen |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/225350:Kirke---tro--Groenlandsk-bibel-praesenteret |title=Gr\u00f8nlandsk bibel pr\u00e6senteret &#124; Kristeligt Dagblad |publisher=Kristeligt-dagblad.dk |date=29 November 2000 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nToday, the major religion is [[Protestant Christianity]], mostly members of the Lutheran [[Church of Denmark]].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament ''[[Parliament of Greenland|Inatsisartut]]''. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Greenland has full autonomy on most matters, except on policies and decisions affecting the region including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the [[Folketing]] ({{lang-en|Parliament of Denmark}}).\n\n== Executive power ==\n{{further|Monarchy of Denmark|Naalakkersuisut}}\n{{office-table}}\n|[[Monarchy of Denmark|Queen]]\n|[[Margrethe  II of Denmark]] \n|\n|14 January 1972\n|-\n|[[List of Danish High Commissioners in Greenland|High Commissioner]]\n|[[Mikaela Engell]]\n|\n|April 1, 2011\n|-\n|[[Prime Minister of Greenland|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Kim Kielsen]]\n|[[Siumut|Forward (Siumut) (S)]]\n|December 10, 2014\n|}\nExecutive power rests with a high commissioner, and a [[Prime Minister of Greenland|prime minister]] heads the Cabinet. The [[High_commissioner#Kingdom of Denmark|high commissioner of Greenland]] is appointed by the [[Monarchy of Denmark|monarch]] (on from 2011: [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]), and the prime minister is elected indirectly by parliament elections results for four-year terms.\n\nThe High Commissioner has a seat in the Inatsisartut, he or she is allowed to speak in the Inatsisartut regarding common Danish/Greenlandic affairs, but he or she is not allowed to vote.<ref>[http://www.stm.dk/_a_1673.html Stm.dk, the website of the High Commissioner of Greenland, as part of the Danish Prime Minister's Office]</ref> Following legislative elections, the leader of the party that wins the most seats is usually given the initiative to establish a new coalition by the Greenlandic Parliament, unless the current [[Naalakkersuisut Siulittaasuat]] (''Prime Minister'' in English) is still in power. However, if he/she fails, the Chairman of the parliament asks all chairmen of the parties elected to the parliament, and asks them to point to another chairman who they feel can rightly form a new coalition. The chairman with the most votes is then handed the initiative. After forming the coalition, the [[Naalakkersuisut Siulittaasuat]] leads the [[Naalakkersuisut]]. The Naalakkersuisut will often consist of around 9 members. The coalition parties divide the various ministries among themselves and after this, the parties elect their representative to these ministries. Any other member of the cabinet is called a ''[[Naalakkersuisoq]]''.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nLegislative power is shared by the government and the legislature. The legislature '''[[Inatsisartut|Greenlandic Parliament]]''' ({{lang-kl|Inatsisartut}}) is made up of 31 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve four-year terms by [[proportional representation]]. Election of 2 seats to the [[Danish Parliament]] ({{lang-da|Folketing}}) was last held on June 18, 2015. The current composition is shown below\n\n{{Further|Greenlandic general election, 2018}}\n{{Greenlandic parliamentary election, 2018}}\n{{Further|Danish general election, 2015}}\n{{Danish parliamentary election, 2015 (Greenland)}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\nGreenland's judicial system is based on the Danish civil law system, operates independently of the legislature and the executive. It has two court of first instance: the District Courts and the [[Court of Greenland]] depending on the type of case, whereas the [[High Court of Greenland]] hears cases as the second instance. Decisions made by the High Court of Greenland may be brought before the Supreme Court subject to the permission of the Appeals Permission Board. Appeals may be submitted to the [[\u00d8stre Landsret]] and the [[Supreme Court of Denmark]] (H\u00f8jesteret).\n\n== Political parties and elections ==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Greenland|Elections in Greenland}}\nGreenland has a [[multi-party]] system (disputing independence versus unionism as well as [[left-wing politics|left]] versus [[right-wing politics|right]]).

Historically the major means of transportation has been by boat around the coast in summer and by [[dog sled]] in winter, particularly in the north and east.\n\n==Air transport==\n{{main article|List of airports in Greenland}}\nWhile [[Germany]] occupied [[Denmark]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]], the [[United States]] controlled Greenland and built bases and [[airport]]s. The airports were codenamed as [[Bluie West One]] through to [[Bluie West Eight]] on the west of the island and [[Bluie]] East One to Bluie East Four on the eastern side (some had only sea plane access, some no air access). The largest of those airports, [[Bluie West Eight]], now renamed [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]], remains the international hub for travel to Greenland, as it is the only airport that has a long enough runway to service [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]]. American authorities at one time entertained the idea of building a road from Kangerlussuaq to the second-largest airport, in Narsarsuaq, several hundred kilometres to the south. The idea was abandoned after feasibility studies failed to prove it was possible. These airbases are generally not located near settlements, so travellers need an air transfer by helicopter (small plane from Kangerlussuaq) to reach settlements. All civil aviation matters are handled by the [[Civil Aviation Administration Denmark]] or the [[Greenland Airport Authority]].\n\nGreenland now has 18 airstrips, 14 of which are paved. Some are based on US airbases, but most are built by the Greenlandic government. All domestic flights are operated by [[Air Greenland]]. The name was [[anglicisation|anglicized]] in 2002 from the [[Danish language|Danish]] Gr\u00f8nlandsfly ([[Greenlandair]] in English). International flights are limited to four weekly flights from [[Copenhagen]] to Kangerlussuaq, and to Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\n[[Air Iceland]] flies from [[Reykjav\u00edk]] to Narsarsuaq. It offers also \"day trips to the wilderness\" from Reykjav\u00edk to [[Kulusuk]] on the east coast. Air Iceland flies to [[Ittoqqortoormiit]] over [[Kulusuk]] once or twice a week throughout the year. Flights from Reykjavik are flown throughout the year. Also, year-round flights from Reykjavik to [[Ilulissat]] will be offered after April 2011. From 2012 Air Greenland operates a route from [[Iqaluit]] in Canada to Nuuk during summer.\n\nAir cargo is very important for Greenland. Most perishable foodstuff is imported from Denmark by air. It uses the Air Greenland Copenhagen\u2013Kangerlussuaq passenger aircraft, and this is a reason why such a large aircraft is used. The air containers are then transported to the other airports by the small planes that can use the small runways. Some air cargo is transported by boat from Kangerlussuaq, but not in the winter when the [[Kangerlussuaq Fjord]] freezes (one of the reasons to build the Sisimiut\u2013Kangerlussuaq road).\n\n==Roads==\nThere are no roads between settlements, only within them and around them.\nThere are 150&nbsp;km (90&nbsp;mi) of roads in the whole country; 60&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) of the roads are paved. The roads are primary or local roads, there are no highways in Greenland.\n\nSpeed limit ranges from {{convert|50|kph|mph}} for local roads to {{convert|80|kph|mph}} on primary roads.\n\nSome farms in the south have fairly extensive very simple roads for terrain vehicles (not included in above figure), used for sheep farming and hay collection. There are plans for a {{convert|170|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} road between [[Sisimiut]] and [[Kangerlussuaq]], discussed for several years but still not decided (as of 2013).\n\n==Water transport==\nThere are ports at [[Ilulissat]], [[Kangerlussuaq]] (also known by its Danish name S\u00f8ndre Str\u00f8mfjord), [[Qaqortoq]], [[Narsaq]], [[Nuuk]] (Godth\u00e5b), [[Aasiaat]] and [[Sisimiut]]. Several other towns have also small ports. The only two users of the harbors are [[Royal Arctic Line]] and [[Arctic Umiaq Line]]. Royal Arctic Line organises freight ships, for example container ships, with regular sailings from Denmark. Arctic Umiaq Line runs a passenger ship which also carries freight. The distance from Denmark to Nuuk by ship is 3,800 kilometres (2,400&nbsp;mi/2,000 nmi/4 days at 20 knot), so more perishable foodstuff is imported by air.\n\nThere are no [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferries]] in Greenland or to Greenland.

First settled by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], by the time of European contact it was inhabited by the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. [[British colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] drove most of the Caribs off the island and established [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s on the island, eventually importing [[African slave trade|African slaves]] to work on the sugar plantations.\n\nControl of the island was disputed by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and France in the 18th century, with the British ultimately prevailing. In 1795, [[F\u00e9don's Rebellion]], inspired by the [[Haitian Revolution]], very nearly succeeded, and was crushed with significant military intervention. Slavery was abolished in the 1830s. In 1885, the island became the capital of the [[British Windward Islands]].\n\n[[Grenada]] achieved independence from Britain in 1974. Following a coup by the Marxist [[New Jewel Movement]] in 1983, the island [[Invasion of Grenada|was invaded]] by [[United States]] troops and the government overthrown. The island's major crop, [[nutmeg]], was significantly damaged by [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004.\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:1632 Cardona Descripcion Indias (27).jpg|thumbnail|Spanish ships and Carib boats in Granada, in a report by Nicol\u00e1s de Cardona, 1632.]]\nAbout 2 million years ago, [[Grenada]] was formed as an underwater volcano. Before the arrival of Europeans, Grenada was inhabited by [[Arawaks]] and, subsequently, [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted Grenada in 1498 during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] to the new world. He named the island \"Concepci\u00f3n.\" The origin of the name \"Grenada\" is obscure, but it is likely that [[Spain|Spanish]] sailors renamed the island for the city of [[Granada]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gs4ntEW202sC&pg=PA6&dq=grenada+name#v=onepage&q=grenada%20name&f=false|title=Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique|last=Crask|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|year=|isbn=9781841622743|location=|pages=5|language=en}}</ref> By the beginning of the 18th century, the name \"Grenada\", or \"la Grenade\" in [[French language|French]], was in common use.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qfqwcul7MPMC&pg=PT11&dq=grenada+name#v=onepage&q=grenada%20name&f=false|title=Grenada Uncovered: An Uncommon View of the Island's Geocultural Beauty|last=Viechweg|first=Raymond D.|date=2017-04-05|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=|isbn=9781426926051|location=|pages=11|language=en}}</ref> Partly because of the Caribs, Grenada remained uncolonized for more than one hundred years after being sighted by Columbus.\n\n==17th century==\n\n===English attempted settlement===\nIn June 1609, the first attempt at settlement by Europeans was made by an English expedition of 24 colonizers led by Mossis Goldfry, Hall, Lull, and Robincon, who arrived in the ships ''Diana'', the ''Penelope'', and the ''Endeavour''.

F\u00e9don was clearly influenced by the ideas emerging from the [[French Revolution]], especially the [[National Convention|Convention]]'s abolition of slavery in 1794: he stated that he intended to make Grenada a \"Black Republic just like [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]]\". F\u00e9don and his troops controlled all of Grenada except the parish of St George's, the seat of government, between March 1795 and June 1796. During those insurgent months 14,000 of Grenada's 28,000 slaves joined the revolutionary forces in order to write their own emancipation and transform themselves into \"citizens\"; some 7,000 of these self-liberated slaves would perish in the name of freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigdrumnation.org/notes/fedonrebellion.html |title=The Fedon Rebellion |publisher=BigDrumNation.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> The British defeated F\u00e9don's forces in late 1796, but they never caught F\u00e9don himself, and his fate is unknown.\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Early 19th century===\nIn 1833, Grenada became part of the [[British Windward Islands Administration]] and remained so until 1958.

In 1885, after [[Barbados]] left the British Windward Islands, the capital of the colonial confederation was moved from [[Bridgetown]] to St. George on Grenada. From 1889\u20131894 the 340 foot [[Sendall Tunnel]] was built for horse carriages.\n\n==Last colonial years 1900\u20131974==\n\n===Early 20th century===\nThe 1901 census showed that the population of the colony was 63,438. In 1917 [[Theophilus A. Marryshow]] founded the Representative Government Association (RGA) to agitate for a new and participative constitutional dispensation for the Grenadian people. Partly as a result of Marryshow's lobbying the Wood Commission of 1921\u20131922 concluded that Grenada was ready for constitutional reform in the form of a 'modified' Crown Colony government. This modification granted Grenadians from 1925 the right to elect 5 of the 15 members of the Legislative Council, on a restricted property franchise enabling the wealthiest 4% of Grenadian adults to vote.<ref name=bigdrum/> In 1928 electricity was installed in St. George's.<ref name=hisfacts/> In 1943 [[Pearls Airport]] was opened.<ref name=hisfacts/> On 5 August 1944 the ''Island Queen'' schooner disappeared with the loss of all 56 passengers and 11 crew.<ref name=hisfacts/>\n\n===Towards independence:1950\u20131974===\nIn 1950, Grenada had its constitution amended to increase the number of elected seats on the Legislative Council from 5 to 8, to be elected by full adult franchise at the 1951 election. In 1950 [[Eric Gairy]] founded the [[Grenada United Labour Party]], initially as a [[trade union]], which led the 1951 [[general strike]] for better working conditions. This sparked great unrest \u2013 so many buildings were set ablaze that the disturbances became known as the 'red sky' days \u2013 and the British authorities had to call in military reinforcements to help regain control of the situation. On 10 October 1951 Grenada held its first general elections on the basis of universal adult suffrage.<ref name=bigdrum2>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigdrumnation.org/comments/1stgeneralelection.html |title=1951 and Coming of General Elections |publisher=BigDrumNation.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> United Labour won 6 of the 8 elected seats on the Legislative Council in both the 1951 and 1954 elections.<ref name=bigdrum2/> However the Legislative Council had few powers at this time, with government remaining fully in the hands of the colonial authorities.\n\nOn 22 September 1955, [[Hurricane Janet]] hit Grenada, killing 500 people and destroying 75% of the nutmeg trees. A new political party, the [[Grenada National Party]] led by [[Herbert Blaize]], contested the 1957 general election and with the cooperation of elected independent members took control of the Legislative Council from the [[Grenada United Labour Party]]. In 1958, the Windward Islands Administration was dissolved, and Grenada joined the [[Federation of the West Indies]].\n\nIn 1960, another constitutional evolution established the post of Chief Minister, making the leader of the majority party in the Legislative Council, which at that time was [[Herbert Blaize]], effective head of government. In March 1961 the [[Grenada United Labour Party]] won the general election and [[George E.D. Clyne]] became chief minister until [[Eric Gairy]] was elected in a by-election and took the role in August 1961. Also in 1961 the [[cruise liner]] {{MV|Bianca C|2}} sank off Point Salines, although thankfully there was only a single fatality. In April 1962 Grenada's [[List of colonial heads of Grenada|Administrator]], the Queens representative on the island, James Lloyd suspended the constitution, dissolved the Legislative Council, and removed [[Eric Gairy]] as Chief Minister, following allegations concerning the Gairy's financial impropriety. At the 1962 general election the [[Grenada National Party]] won a majority and [[Herbert Blaize]] became Chief Minister for the second time.\n\nAfter the [[Federation of the West Indies]] collapsed in 1962, the British government tried to form a small federation out of its remaining dependencies in the Eastern Caribbean. Following the failure of this second effort, the British and the islanders developed the concept of \"[[associated state]]hood\". Under the Associated Statehood Act on 3 March 1967 Grenada was granted full autonomy over its internal affairs. [[Herbert Blaize]] was the first Premier of the Associated State of Grenada from March to August 1967. [[Eric Gairy]] served as Premier from August 1967 until February 1974, as the [[Grenada United Labour Party]] won majorities in both the 1967 and 1972 general elections.\n\n==Independence, Revolution and US invasion: 1974\u20131983==\n\n===Independence===\nOn 7 February 1974, Grenada became a fully independent state. Grenada continued to practise a modified [[Westminster parliamentary system]] based on the British model with a governor general appointed by and representing the British monarch (head of state) and a prime minister who is both leader of the majority party and the head of government. [[Eric Gairy]] was independent Grenada's first prime minister serving from 1974 until his overthrow in 1979. Gairy won re-election in Grenada's first general election as an independent state in 1976; however, the opposition [[New Jewel Movement]] refused to recognize the result, claiming the poll was fraudulent, and so began working towards the overthrow of the Gairy regime by revolutionary means. In 1976 [[St. George's University]] was established.\n\n===The 1979 coup and revolutionary government===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0610-101, Berlin, Besuch Regierungsdelegation Grenada, Bootsfahrt.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Maurice Bishop]] visiting Germany, 1982.]]\n\nOn March 13, 1979, the New Jewel Movement launched an armed revolution which removed Gairy, suspended the constitution, and established a [[People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]] who declared himself prime minister. His [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] government established close ties with [[Cuba]], Nicaragua, and other [[communist bloc]] countries. All political parties except for the New Jewel Movement were banned and no elections were held during the four years of PRG rule.\n\n===The 1983 coups===\nOn 14 October 1983, a power struggle within the government resulted in the house arrest of Bishop at the order of his Deputy Prime Minister, [[Bernard Coard]] who became Head of Government. This coup resulted in demonstrations in various parts of the island which eventually led to Bishop being freed from arrest briefly, before being recaptured by the army and executed along with seven others, including members of the cabinet on 19 October 1983.\n\nOn 19 October 1983, the military under [[Hudson Austin]] took power in a second coup and formed a military government to run the country. A four-day total curfew was declared under which any civilian outside their home was subject to summary execution.\n\n===Invasion===\n{{Main|Invasion of Grenada}}\nA U.S.\u2013Caribbean force invaded Grenada on October 25, 1983, in an action called [[Operation Urgent Fury]], and swiftly defeated the Grenadan forces and their Cuban allies. During the fighting 45 Grenadians, 25 Cubans, and 19 Americans were killed. This action was taken in response to an appeal obtained from the governor general and to a request for assistance from the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]], without consulting the island's head of state, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] institutions or other usual diplomatic channels (as had been done in [[Anguilla]]). Furthermore, United States government military strategists feared that Soviet use of the island would enable the Soviet Union to project tactical power over the entire Caribbean region. U.S. citizens were evacuated, and constitutional government was resumed.\n\nSeventeen members of the PRG and the PRA were convicted by a court. Fourteen were [[sentenced to death]] for actions related to the overthrow of the Bishop government and the murder of several people including [[Maurice Bishop]]. The sentences were eventually commuted to [[life imprisonment]] after an international campaign. Another three were sentenced to forty five years in prison. These seventeen have become known as the [[Grenada 17]], and are the subject of an ongoing international campaign for their release. In October 2003 [[Amnesty International]] issued a report which stated that their trial had been a [[miscarriage of justice]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The seventeen have protested their sentences consistently since 1983. The United States gave $48.4 million in economic assistance to Grenada in 1984.\n\n==Democracy restored: 1983 to present day==\n\n===Post liberation politics===\nWhen US troops withdrew from Grenada in December 1983, [[Nicholas Braithwaite]] was appointed Prime Minister of an interim administration by the Governor General Sir [[Paul Scoon]] until elections could be organized.\n\nOn 28 October 1984, the new [[Point Salines International Airport]] was opened, which enabled Grenada to receive large commercial jets for the first time.\n\nThe first democratic elections since 1976 were held in December 1984 and were won by the [[Grenada National Party]] under [[Herbert Blaize]] who won 14 out of 15 seats in elections and served as Prime Minister until his death in December 1989. The NNP continued in power until 1989 but with a reduced majority. Five NNP parliamentary members, including two cabinet ministers, left the party in 1986\u201387 and formed the National Democratic Congress (NDC) which became the official opposition. In August 1989, Prime Minister Blaize broke with the GNP to form another new party, [[The National Party]] (TNP), from the ranks of the NNP. This split in the NNP resulted in the formation of a minority government until constitutionally scheduled elections in March 1990. Prime Minister Blaize died in December 1989 and was succeeded as prime minister by Ben Jones until after the 1990 elections.\n\nThe [[National Democratic Congress (Grenada)|National Democratic Congress]] emerged from the 1990 elections as the strongest party, winning 7 of the fifteen available seats. [[Nicholas Brathwaite]] added 2 TNP members and 1 member of the [[Grenada United Labor Party]] (GULP) to create a 10-seat majority coalition. The governor general appointed him to be prime minister for a second time. Braithwaite resigned in Feb 1995 and was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[George Brizan]] who served until the Jun 1995 election.\n\nIn parliamentary elections on 20 June 1995, the NNP won 8 of the 15 seats and formed a government headed by [[Keith Mitchell]]. The NNP maintained and affirmed its hold on power when it took all 15 parliamentary seats in the January 1999 elections. Mitchell went on to win the 2003 elections with a reduced majority of 8 of the 15 seats and served as Prime Minister for a record 13 years until his defeat in 2008.\n\nThe 2001 census showed that the population of Grenada was 100,895.\n\nThe 2008 election was won by the [[National Democratic Congress (Grenada)|National Democratic Congress]] under [[Tillman Thomas]] with 11 of the 15 seats.<ref name=\"IHT\">{{cite web\n  | title = New Grenada prime minister vows to boost economy, lower cost of living\n  |publisher=Associated Press via ''International Herald Tribune'' |date=July 9, 2008\n  | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/09/news/CB-POL-Grenada-Elections.php\n  | accessdate = 2011-07-31\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804055052/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/09/news/CB-POL-Grenada-Elections.php\n  | archivedate = 2008-08-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Point Salines International Airport was renamed [[Maurice Bishop International Airport]] in tribute to the former Prime Minister.\n\n===Truth and reconciliation commission===\nIn 2000\u201302, much of the controversy of the late 1970s and early 1980s was once again brought into the public consciousness with the opening of the truth and reconciliation commission. The commission was chaired by a Catholic priest, [[Mark Haynes (priest)|Father Mark Haynes]], and was tasked with uncovering injustices arising from the PRA, Bishop's regime, and before. It held a number of hearings around the country. The commission was formed because of a school project. [[Robert Fanovich|Brother Robert Fanovich]], head of Presentation Brothers' College (PBC) in St. George's tasked some of his senior students with conducting a research project into the era and specifically into the fact that Maurice Bishop's body was never discovered. Their project attracted a great deal of attention, including from the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' and the final report was published in a book written by the boys called ''Big Sky, Little Bullet''. It also uncovered that there was still a lot of resentment in Grenadian society resulting from the era, and a feeling that there were many injustices still unaddressed. The commission began shortly after the boys concluded their project.\n\n===Hurricane Ivan===\nOn September 7, 2004, Grenada was hit directly by category four [[Hurricane Ivan]]. The hurricane destroyed about 85% of the structures on the island, including the prison and the [[Prime Minister of Grenada|prime minister]]'s residence, killed thirty-nine people, and destroyed most of the [[nutmeg]] crop, Grenada's [[Economy of Grenada|economic]] mainstay. Grenada's economy was set back several years by Hurricane Ivan's impact. [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] ravaged the island's north end in June 2005.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of governors of the Windward Islands]]\n*[[List of heads of government of Grenada]]\n*[[Politics of Grenada]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[West Indies Federation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Grenade, Wendy C. ed.''

It is located at {{coord|12|07|N|61|40|W|}}.  There are no large inland bodies of water on the island, which consists entirely of the state of Grenada.  The coastline is 121&nbsp;km long.\n\nThe island has 15 constituencies and speaks English. It is volcanic in origin and its topography/landscape is mountainous.\n\n[[Natural resource]]s include [[timber]], tropical [[fruit]] and deepwater [[harbor]]s.\n\nGrenada and its largely uninhabited outlying territories are the most southerly of the Windward Islands. The Grenadine Islands chain consists of some 600 islets; those south of the [[Martinique Channel]] belong to Grenada, while those north of the channel are part of the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Located about 160 kilometers north of Venezuela, at approximately 12\u00b0 north latitude and 61\u00b0 west longitude, Grenada and its territories occupy a small area of 433 square kilometers. Grenada, known as the Spice Isle because of its production of nutmeg and mace, is the largest at 310 square kilometers, or about the size of Detroit. The island is oval shaped and framed by a jagged southern coastline; its maximum width is thirty-four kilometers, and its maximum length is nineteen kilometers. [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital and the nation's most important harbor, is favorably situated near a lagoon on the southwestern coast. Of all the islands belonging to Grenada, only two are of consequence: Carriacou, with a population of a few thousand, and its neighbor Petit Martinique, roughly 40 kilometers northeast of Grenada and populated by some 700 inhabitants.\n\nPart of the volcanic chain in the Lesser Antilles arc, Grenada and its possessions generally vary in elevation from under 300 meters to over 600 meters above sea level. Grenada is more rugged and densely foliated than its outlying possessions, but other geographical conditions are more similar. Grenada's landmass rises from a narrow, coastal plain in a generally north-south trending axis of ridges and narrow valleys. [[Mount Saint Catherine (Grenada)|Mount St. Catherine]] is the highest peak at 840 meters.\n\nAlthough many of the rocks and soils are of volcanic origin, the volcanic cones dotting Grenada are long dormant. The only known active volcano in the area is [[Kick 'em Jenny]], just north between Grenada and Carriacou. Some of the drainage features on Grenada remain from its volcanic past. There are a few crater lakes, the largest of which is Grand Etang. The swift upper reaches of rivers, which occasionally overflow and cause flooding and landslides, generally cut deeply into the conic slopes. By contrast, many of the water courses in the lowlands tend to be sluggish and meandering.\n\n==Table of Islands==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #CCC;\"| Nr!! style=\"background: #CCC;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Island !!style=\"background: #CCC;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Capital !!style=\"background: #CCC;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Other Cities !!style=\"background: #CCC;\"| Area&nbsp;(km\u00b2) !!style=\"background: #CCC;\"| Population{{efn| 1 = The Islands area and population data retrieved from the 2012 census}}\n|-style=\"background:#CEE0F2;\"\n|1 ||[[Calivigny Island]] || Port Calivigny south ||||align=\"right\"| 0.28 ||align=\"right\"| 20\n|-style=\"background:#CEE0F2;\"\n|2 ||[[Grenadines|Grenadines (Southern)]] ||[[Hillsborough, Grenada|Hillsborough]]|| Grand Bay ||align=\"right\"| 37.77 ||align=\"right\"| 8150 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|2.1 ||[[Carriacou]] ||[[Hillsborough, Grenada|Hillsborough]] || Lauriston, Grand Bay, ||align=\"right\"|34 ||align=\"right\"|7200 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|2.2 ||[[Saline Island|Frigate Island]] || ||||align=\"right\"|0.39 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|2.3 ||[[Large Island]] || || ||align=\"right\"|0.5 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|2.4 ||[[Petit Martinique]] ||North beach ||Piton hill, southwest beach ||align=\"right\"|2.37 ||align=\"right\"|950 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|2.5 ||[[Saline Island]] ||John Family mansion || ||align=\"right\"|0.28 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|2.6 ||[[Grenadines|White Island]] ||Limekiln Bay || ||align=\"right\"|0.05 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|2.7 ||More Islands || Petit Dominica || Mabouya, Sandy, little Tobago ||align=\"right\"|0.18 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#CEE0F2;\"\n|4 ||[[Glover Island, Grenada|Glover Island]] || Degra Bay ||||align=\"right\"| 0.06 ||align=\"right\"| 0 \n|-style=\"background:#CEE0F2;\"\n|3 ||[[Grenada|Grenada Island]] ||[[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]|| St. David\u2019s, Grenville, Sauteurs, Victoria, Gouyave,||align=\"right\"|306.00 ||align=\"right\"| 100930 \n|-style=\"background:#CEE0F2;\"\n|5 ||[[Saint Patrick Parish, Grenada|Saint Patrick Parish Islands]]|| [[Ronde Island|Sugarloaf Island]]||[[Ronde Island]]||align=\"right\"| 4.28 ||align=\"right\"| 2 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.1 ||[[Bird Island, Grenada|Bird Island]] || || ||align=\"right\"|0.03 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.2 ||[[Caille Island]] ||West beach ||Whale bay||align=\"right\"|0.70 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.3 ||[[Diamond Island (Grenadines)|Diamond Island]] ||southwest point || ||align=\"right\"|0.22 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.4 ||[[Green Island, Grenada|Green Island]] || || ||align=\"right\"|0.14 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.5 ||[[Les Tantes]] ||Grand Tantes || Petit Tantes||align=\"right\"|0.3 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.6 ||[[Ronde Island]] ||South dock ||Corn Store Bay ||align=\"right\"|2.70 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.7 ||[[Sandy Island, Grenada|Sandy Island]] ||west beach || ||align=\"right\"|0.11 ||align=\"right\"|0 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|5.8 ||[[Ronde Island|Sugarloaf Island]] ||Southwest point mansion || ||align=\"right\"|0.08 ||align=\"right\"|2 \n|-style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n|6 ||Other|| Hog Island||||align=\"right\"| 0.11 ||align=\"right\"| 0 \n|-style=\"background:#F2E0CE;\" | class=\"sortbottom\"\n|&nbsp; || [[Grenada|Grenada and the Grenadines]]||[[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]|| St. David\u2019s, Grenville, Sauteurs, Gouyave, Hillsborough, ||align=\"right\"|348.5||align=\"right\"|109100 \n|}\n\n== Climate == \n \nThe Grenadan climate is tropical, tempered by northeast [[trade winds]].  The land is [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin with [[mountain]]s in the interior.  The lowest point is at [[sea level]], and the highest is {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on [[Mount Saint Catherine, Grenada|Mount Saint Catherine]].\n \nThe abundance of water is primarily caused by the tropical, wet climate. Yearly precipitation, largely generated by the warm and moisture-laden northeasterly trade winds, varies from more than {{convert|3500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} on the windward mountainsides to less than {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in the lowlands. The greatest monthly totals are recorded throughout Grenada from June through November, the months when tropical storms and hurricanes are most likely to occur. Rainfall is less pronounced from December through May, when the equatorial low-pressure system moves south. Similarly, the highest humidities, usually close to 80 percent, are recorded during the rainy months, and values from 68 to 78 percent are registered during the drier period. Temperatures averaging {{convert|29|\u00b0C|1}} are constant throughout the year, however, with slightly higher readings in the lowlands.

According to the 2001 census there are only 125 Caribs remaining (0.12% of the total population).\n\n==Languages==\nApart from a 114-year period of French occupancy (1649-1763) English has been the country's official language.  However, over time the minority of the population use a colloquial spoken language considered to be either [[English-based creole languages]] or ([[Grenadian Creole English]]) and which is said reflects the African, European and Indian heritage of the nation.<ref>Alleyne, Mervyn C. \"A Linguistic Perspective on the Caribbean\", Latin American Program, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, 1985</ref> \n\nThe Grenadian creoles originally influenced by [[French language|French]], now contain elements from a variety of Grenadian Creole and a little of the African languages. [[Grenadian Creole|Grenadian Creole French]] is mainly spoken in smaller rural areas, but today it can only be heard in a few small pockets of the society. Grenadian Creole French is mainly known as ''[[Patois]]'' and may have similarities to the [[Saint Lucian Creole French]].\n\nIt is believed that the one-time native or indigenous languages were [[I\u00f1eri language|I\u00f1eri]] and [[Karina language|Karina]].\n\n==Religion==\nHistorically the religious makeup of the islands of Grenada covers the period from first European occupation in the 17th century.  This has always been predominantly Christian and largely Roman Catholic (due to the first occupants being French) and from the 1891 census we get a snapshot of the population and its religious proclivities - over half were Roman Catholic (55%), a third were Church of England (36%), others listed were Wesleyan (6%) and Presbyterian (0.88%).\n\nMore recently, according to the 2001 census, 89.1% percent of the population of Grenada is considered [[Christianity|Christian]], 1.5% is non-Christian and 3.6% has no religion or stated \"other\" (5.7%).<ref name=\"2001 census\"/>\n\nRoughly one half of Christians are [[Roman Catholics]] (44.6% of the total population), a reflection of early French influence on the island, and one half are [[Protestant]]. [[Anglicanism]] constitutes the largest Protestant group, with 11.5% of the population. [[Pentecostals]] are the second largest group (11.3%), followed by [[Seventh-day Adventists]] (10.5% of the population).  Other [[Christianity|Christians]] include [[Baptists]] (2.9%), Church of God (2.6%), [[Methodists#Caribbean|Methodists]] (1.8%), [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] (1.6%) [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1.1%), and [[Brethren Christian]] (0.5%).\n\nThe number of non-Christians is small. These religious groups include the [[Rastafarian Movement]] (1.1% of the population), [[Hinduism in the West Indies|Hinduism]] (0.2%) and [[Muslims]] (0.3%).\n\n== The World Factbook demographic statistics ==\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from [[The World Factbook]], unless otherwise indicated  <ref name=\"CIATONGA\">{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gj.html|title= Central America and Caribbean :: GRENADA|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}</ref>\n===Nationality===\n*noun:  Grenadian(s)\n*adjective:  Grenadian\n===Population===\n*110,694\n===Languages===\n*[[English language|English]] (official)\n*[[Patois|French patois]]\n===Ethnic groups===\n*[[Afro-Grenadian|African descent]] 89.4%\n*Mixed 8.2%\n*[[Indo-Grenadians|Indian]] 1.6%\n*Other 0.9% (includes indigenous)\n\n===Religions===\n*[[Roman Catholic]] 44.6%\n*[[Protestantism|Protestant]] 43.5%\n**[[Anglicanism|Anglican]] 11.5%\n**[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] 11.3%\n**[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh Day Adventist]] 10.5%\n**[[Baptists|Baptist]] 2.9%\n**[[Church of God in Christ|Church of God]] 2.6%\n**[[Methodist]] 1.8%\n**[[Evangelical]] 1.6%\n*Other 1.3%\n*[[Jehovah's Witness]] 1.1%\n*[[Rastafarianism|Rastafarian]] 1.1%\n*Other 6.2%\n*None 3.6%\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{North America in topic|Demographics of}}\n\n[[Category:Demographics of Grenada]]\n[[Category:Grenadian society]]", "sha1": "0lal3kc6r1216zhtrz2aln3kapv5x4i"}}, {"title": "Politics of Grenada", "ns": "0", "id": "12132", "revision": {"id": "846995086", "parentid": "840130558", "timestamp": "2018-06-22T05:18:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "KolbertBot", "id": "31691822"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: [[User:KolbertBot|HTTP\u2192HTTPS]] (v485)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe '''politics of [[Grenada]]''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of Prime Ministers of Grenada|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. Grenada is an independent [[Commonwealth realm]]. It is governed under a [[multi-party system|multi-party]] parliamentary system whose political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom; it has a prime minister and a cabinet, and a bicameral [[Parliament of Grenada|Parliament]] with an elected [[House of Representatives of Grenada|House of Representatives]] and an appointed [[Senate of Grenada|Senate]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, motion, and association. Grenada is a member of the eastern Caribbean court system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English common law.\n\nCitizens enjoy a wide range of [[civil and political rights]] guaranteed by the constitution. Grenada's constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully. Citizens exercise this right through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.\n\nGrenada has two significant political parties, both moderate: the [[National Democratic Congress (Grenada)|National Democratic Congress]] (liberal) and the [[New National Party of Grenada|New National Party]] (conservative). Minor parties include the left-of-center [[Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement]] (MBPM, organized by the [[Maurice Bishop|pro-Bishop]] survivors of the October 1983 anti-Bishop coup) and the populist GULP of former Prime Minister Gairy.\n\nAt the [[Grenadian general election, 2008|July 2008]], election the NDC won a comfortable 7 seat majority over the government of former Prime Minister [[Keith Mitchell]].  New Prime Minister [[Tillman Thomas]] formed a government after narrowly losing by one seat to Mitchell's NNP in the [[Grenada parliamentary election, 2003|November 2003]] election. In elections held on February 19, 2013, Keith Mitchell's NNP swept all fifteen parliamentary seats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grenada opposition wins clean sweep in general election|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21526209|website=BBC|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>  This historic victory was a repeat of the 1999 elections in which the NNP also swept all 15 seats.  Prime Minister Mitchell has the distinction as being the only Caribbean politician to sweep all seats on two separate occasions.  Constitutionally, this development means that there is no official opposition in Parliament.  As such, Governor General Carlye Glean, who is the titular head of state, will appoint 5 Senators to the Upper House, who will serve as the de facto opposition.\n\nSecurity in Grenada is maintained by the 650 members of the Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF), which included an 80-member paramilitary special services unit (SSU) and a 30-member coast guard. The U.S. Army and the U.S. Coast Guard provide periodic training and material support for the SSU and the coast guard.\n\n==Executive branch==\nAs head of state, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is represented in Grenada by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet. The leader of the majority party serves as Prime Minister and head of government. The cabinet consists of members, including the [[Prime Minister]] and ministers of executive departments. They answer politically to the House of Assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/grenada/government|title=Grenada: Government >> globalEDGE: Your source for Global Business Knowledge|website=globaledge.msu.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-11}}</ref> The Governor General appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.

Over the past two decades, the economy has shifted from one of agriculture-dominant into that of services-dominant, with tourism serving as the leading foreign [[currency]] earning sector. The country's principal export crops are the spices [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]] (Grenada is the world\u2019s second largest producer of nutmeg after Indonesia). Other crops for export include cocoa, citrus fruits, bananas, cloves, and cinnamon. Manufacturing industries in Grenada operate mostly on a small scale, including production of beverages and other foodstuffs, textiles, and the assembly of electronic components for export.\n\nEconomic growth picked up in the late 1990s following slow growth and domestic [[fiscal adjustment]] in early years of the decade. Despite an expansionary fiscal policy, the public debt remained moderate at around 50 percent of GDP as deficits were financed partly by privatization receipts. Since 2001, economic growth declined caused by adverse shocks such as a slowdown in the global economy and natural disasters. To deal with the shocks, fiscal policy became more expansionary while privatization receipts declined. As a result, public debt increased sharply to near 110 percent of GDP in 2003. Economic conditions worsened when Hurricane Ivan hit the country in September 2004; progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded as government revenues fell and policy priority was shifted to post-hurricane relief.\n\nAlthough reconstruction has proceeded quickly with significant aid from the international community, tourism and agricultural activities remain weak and nearly offset the stimulus from the reconstruction boom. The country is still facing the difficult task of reconstruction and recovery, while public debt is unsustainable and the government faces large financing gaps. In the years ahead, reinvigorating growth will be a high priority, and continued efforts are needed to address vulnerabilities.\n\n===Economic Performance===\n\nAfter experiencing GDP growth averaging nearly six percent a year in the late 1990s, economic growth declined considerably after 2001 as a result of  a decline in the tourism industry following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and damages caused by several hurricanes.\n\nThe economy of Grenada was brought to a near standstill in September 2004 by Hurricane Ivan, which damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the country's buildings, including some tourist facilities. In July 2005 Hurricane Emily struck Grenada again as the country was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Ivan. Besides the negative impacts to the tourism industry, the two devastating hurricanes destroyed or significantly damaged a large percentage of Grenada\u2019s tree crops, which may take years to recover.\n\nAs the damage of Hurricane Ivan to the economy exceeded 200 percent of GDP, economic growth registered a negative growth of three percent in 2004, compared with a positive growth rate of 5.8 percent in 2003. Although signs of recovery have been seen in Grenada after the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Ivan and Emily, economic conditions remain difficult; GDP is projected at a growth rate of only one percent for 2005.\n\nWith the absence of sustained growth, the fiscal situation started to deteriorate after 2001 reflecting a continued expansionary policy with sharp increase in spending on social sectors, the wage bill, and goods and services. As a result, the fiscal deficit rose to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2001 from 3.2 percent in 2000. The fiscal situation remained shaky in 2002 with the deficit widening to 19.2 percent of GDP due to dampened output from Tropical Storm Lili. As the economic began to recover in 2003, the government began to take steps for fiscal consolidation, and the fiscal deficit fell to 4.8 percent of GDP. But progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded in 2004 as the government policy changed abruptly to post-hurricane relief.  Meanwhile, government revenues decreased as a result of the impact of the hurricanes on the economy.\n\nWhile economic growth has declined since 2001 due to adverse shocks, including slowdown in the global economy and natural disasters, fiscal policy became more expansionary when privatization receipts declined. As a result, public debt has increased sharply to over 100 percent of GDP since 2002; it remained as high as near 130 percent of GDP in 2004.\n\nGrenada is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages monetary policy and issues a common currency for all the member countries. Inflation has remained low and stable within the framework of the currency board arrangement, with inflation averaging at two percent over the past 15 years.\n\n===Balance of Payments===\n\nGrenada's current account balance has remained in large deficit due to its heavy dependence on import of most consumer goods and domestic investment. Following an average deficit of around 44 percent of GDP from 1997 to 2000, the current account deficit has increased to over 35 percent of GDP since 2001 due to higher import demand combined with lower receipts from tourism and nutmeg exports. The current account deficits are financed by inflows of foreign direct investment, official grants and loans, and commercial borrowing by the private sector.\nGrenada\u2019s economy is vulnerable to external shocks considering its high dependence on tourism, exports, and imports of most of the goods that are consumed or invested domestically. It is also prone to other adverse shocks such as natural disasters.\n\n===Regional Situation===\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricanes Ivan and Emily, the priority now for Grenada is to continue the recovery process necessary to restore the infrastructure that was devastated by the hurricanes. The international community has disbursed significant amounts of aid, including financial help under the International Monetary Fund's emergency assistance policy for natural disasters and assistance from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank.\n\nIn the context of regional economic development, further integration into the Eastern Caribbean regional economy will help enhance Grenada\u2019s competitiveness and increase its scale of economy in production, marketing and distribution.\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Grenada Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|Grenada Export Treemap]]\n'''[[GDP]]:'''\n[[purchasing power parity]] - $1.401 billion (2015 est.)\n\n'''GDP - [[real growth rate]]:'''\n4.6% (2015 est.)\n\n'''GDP - [[per capita]]:'''\npurchasing power parity - $13,100 (2015 est.)\n\n'''GDP - composition by sector:'''\n''agriculture:'' 6.2%\n''industry:'' 14.3%\n''services:'' 79.5% (2015 est.)\n\n'''Population below poverty line:'''\n38% (2008 est.)\n\n'''Household income or consumption by percentage share:'''\n''lowest 10%:'' NA%\n''highest 10%:'' NA%\n\n'''Inflation rate (consumer prices):'''\n1.3% (2015)\n\n'''Labor force:'''\n59,900 (2013)\n\n'''Labor force - by occupation:'''\nservices 69%, agriculture 11%, industry 20% (2008 est.)\n\n'''Unemployment rate:'''\n33.5% (2013)\n\n'''Budget:'''\n''revenues:'' $191.8 million\n''expenditures:'' $230.9 million (2012 est)\n\n'''Industries:'''\nfood and beverages, textiles, light assembly operations, tourism, construction\n\n'''Industrial production growth rate:'''\n-1% (2015 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - production:'''\n193 GWh (2012 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - production by source:'''\n''fossil fuel:'' 98.2%\n''hydro:'' 0%\n''nuclear:'' 0%\n''other:'' 1.4% (2012 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - consumption:'''\n178 GWh (2012 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - exports:'''\n0 kWh (2013 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - imports:'''\n0 kWh (2013 est.)\n\n'''Agriculture - products:'''\n[[banana]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[nutmeg]], [[Mace (spice)|mace]], [[citrus]], [[avocado]]s, root crops, [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], vegetables\n\n'''Exports:'''\n$43.8 million (2015 est.)\n\n'''Exports - commodities:'''\nnutmeg, bananas, cocoa, fruit and vegetables, clothing, mace\n\n'''Exports - partners:'''\n[[Nigeria]] 44.7%, [[Saint Lucia|St. Lucia]] 10.8%, [[Antigua and Barbuda]] 7.3%, [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|St. Kitts and Nevis]] 6.6%, [[Dominica]] 6.6%, [[United States]] 5.8% (2015)\n\n'''Imports:'''\n$310.4 million (2015 est.)\n\n'''Imports - commodities:'''\nfood, manufactured goods, machinery, chemicals, fuel\n\n'''Imports - partners:'''\n[[Trinidad and Tobago]] 49.6%, [[United States]] 16.4% (2015)\n\n'''Debt - external:'''\n$679 million (2013 est.)\n\n'''[[Economic aid]] - recipient:'''\n$8.3 million (1995)\n\n'''Currency:'''\n1 [[East Caribbean dollar]] (EC$) = 100 cents\n\n'''Exchange rates:'''\nEast Caribbean dollars (EC$) per US$1 \u2013 2.7000 (fixed rate since 1976)\n\n'''[[Fiscal year]]:'''\ncalendar year\n\n==References==\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n{{Caribbean in topic|Economy of}}\n{{Americas topic|Economy of}}\n\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Grenada]]\n[[Category:Economy of Grenada| ]]", "sha1": "3g1xkc72crwu2l0d8lpdnyha2oigg21"}}, {"title": "Transport in Grenada", "ns": "0", "id": "12135", "revision": {"id": "560863044", "parentid": "551902060", "timestamp": "2013-06-21T07:39:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "Magioladitis", "id": "1862829"}, "minor": "", "comment": "clean up using [[Project:AWB|AWB]] (9276)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{CIA}}\n[[Grenada]] has no [[merchant marine]].\n\nThere is one industrial railway, used by a rum distillery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sinfin.net/railways/world/grenada.html|accessdate=2010-12-19|title=Railways in Grenada}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Highway]]s:'''\n<br>''total:''\n1,127&nbsp;km\n<br>''paved:''\n687&nbsp;km<br>\nDrivers in Grenada drive on the left hand side of the road.
