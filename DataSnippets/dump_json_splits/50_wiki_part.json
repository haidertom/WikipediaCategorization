He is known for his 1967 book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'', and for his television programmes such as ''Zoo Time''.\n\n==Early life==\nMorris was born in [[Purton]], [[Wiltshire]], to Marjorie (n\u00e9e Hunt) and children's fiction author Harry Morris. In 1933, the Morrises moved to [[Swindon]] where Desmond developed an interest in [[natural history]] and writing. He was educated at [[Dauntsey's School]], a boarding school in Wiltshire.<ref name=\"dmbiography\">{{cite web| author=Williams, D. |title=Desmond Morris Biography| url=http://www.desmond-morris.com/biography.php| publisher=Desmond-morris.com| accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>  \n\nIn 1946, he joined the [[British Army]] for two years of [[national service]], becoming a lecturer in [[fine arts]] at the [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Army College]]. After being demobilised in 1948, he held his first one-man show of his own paintings at the [[Swindon Arts Centre]], and studied [[zoology]] at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1950 he held a surrealist art exhibition with [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] at the London Gallery. He held many other exhibitions in later years<ref name=\"dmbiography\"/>. Also in 1950, Desmond Morris wrote and directed two surrealist films, ''Time Flower'' and ''The Butterfly and the Pin''. In 1951 he began a doctorate at the [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford]] in [[animal behaviour]].<ref name=\"dmbiography\"/> In 1954, he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] for his work on the reproductive behaviour of the ten-spined [[stickleback]].\n\n==Career==\nMorris stayed at Oxford, researching the reproductive behaviour of birds. In 1956 he moved to London as Head of the [[Granada TV]] and Film Unit for the [[Zoological Society of London]], and studied the picture-making abilities of apes<ref name=\"dmbiography\"/>. The work included creating programmes for film and television on animal behaviour and other zoology topics. He hosted Granada TV's weekly ''[[Zoo Time]]'' programme until 1959, scripting and hosting 500 programmes, and 100 episodes of the show ''Life in the Animal World'' for [[BBC Two|BBC2]]<ref name=\"dmbiography\"/>. In 1957 he organised an exhibition at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London, showing paintings and drawings composed by [[chimpanzee]]s. In 1958 he co-organised an exhibition, ''The Lost Image'', which compared pictures by infants, human adults, and apes, at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London. In 1959 he left ''[[Zoo Time]]'' to become the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]'s Curator of Mammals<ref name=\"dmbiography\"/>. In 1964 he delivered the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''Animal Behaviour''. In 1967 he spent a year as executive director of the London [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]].<ref name=\"dmbiography\"/>\n\nMorris's books include ''[[The Naked Ape|The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal]]'',<ref>Morris, D. (1967). ''The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal'' (1st American ed.). New York: [[McGraw-Hill]].</ref> published in 1967. The book sold well enough for Morris to move to [[Malta]] in 1968 to write a sequel and other books. In 1973 he returned to Oxford to work for the ethologist [[Niko Tinbergen]].<ref>[[Horace Romano Harr\u00e9|Harr\u00e9, R.]] (2006). \"Chapter 5: The Biopsychologists\".

He was a prominent figure during the [[Age of the Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nDiderot began his education by obtaining a Master of Arts degree in philosophy at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college in 1732. He considered working in the church clergy before briefly studying law. When he decided to become a writer in 1734, his father disowned him for not entering one of the [[Profession|learned profession]]s. He lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] existence for the next decade. He befriended philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in 1742.\n\nThough his work was broad as well as rigorous, it did not bring Diderot riches. He secured none of the posts that were occasionally given to needy men of letters; he could not even obtain the bare official recognition of merit that was implied by being chosen a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]. He saw no alternative to selling his library to provide a [[dowry]] for his daughter. Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II of Russia]] heard of his financial troubles and commissioned an agent in Paris to buy the library. She then requested that the philosopher retain the books in Paris until she required them, and act as her librarian with a yearly salary.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Diderot, Denis |volume=8 |pages=204-06 |first=John |last=Morley|authorlink=John Morley}}</ref> Between October 1773 and March 1774, the sick Diderot spent a few months at the empress's court in [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name=\"Arthur Wilson 1972\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Verzaal|first=Elly|url=http://blog.kb.nl/diderot-op-de-kneuterdijk-1|title=Diderot op de Kneuterdijk (1)|trans-title=Diderot on Kneuterdijk (1)|language=nl|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands]]|date=25 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021144239/http://blog.kb.nl/diderot-op-de-kneuterdijk-1|archivedate=21 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nDiderot died of [[Pulmonary embolism|pulmonary thrombosis]] in Paris on 31 July 1784, and was buried in the city's [[Saint-Roch, Paris|\u00c9glise Saint-Roch]].

His parents were [[Didier Diderot]] (1685\u20131759) a [[Cutlery|cutler]], ''ma\u00eetre coutelier'', and his wife Ang\u00e9lique Vigneron (1677\u20131748). Three of five siblings survived to adulthood, Denise Diderot (1715\u20131797) and their youngest brother Pierre-Didier Diderot (1722\u20131787), and finally their sister Ang\u00e9lique Diderot (1720\u20131749). According to Arthur McCandless Wilson, Denis Diderot greatly admired his sister Denise, sometimes referring to her as \"a female [[Socrates]]\".<ref>Arthur M. Wilson.

He then entered the [[Coll\u00e8ge d'Harcourt]] of the [[University of Paris]]. He abandoned the idea of entering the clergy and decided to study at the [[Paris Law Faculty]]. His study of law was short-lived however and in 1734, he decided to become a writer. Because of his refusal to enter one of the [[Profession|learned profession]]s, he was disowned by his father, and for the next ten years he lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] existence.<ref name=\"Arthur Wilson 1972\">Arthur Wilson, ''Diderot'' (New York: Oxford, 1972).</ref>\n\nIn 1742, he befriended [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. In 1743, he further alienated his father by marrying [[Anne-Antoinette Diderot|Antoinette Champion]] (1710\u20131796), a devout Roman Catholic. The match was considered inappropriate due to Champion's low social standing, poor education, fatherless status, and lack of a dowry. She was about three years older than Diderot. The marriage, in October 1743, produced one surviving child, a girl. Her name was Ang\u00e9lique, named after both Diderot's dead mother and sister. The death of his sister, a nun, in her convent may have affected Diderot's opinion of religion. She is assumed to have been the inspiration for his novel about a nun, ''[[La Religieuse (novel)|La Religieuse]]'', in which he depicts a woman who is forced to enter a convent where she suffers at the hands of the other nuns in the community.<ref name=\"Arthur Wilson 1972\"/>\n\nDiderot had affairs with Mlle.

He had become a father through his wife, and his mistress [[Madeleine de Puisieux|Mme. de Puisieux]] was making financial demands from him. At this time, Diderot had stated to Mme. de Puisieux that writing a novel was a trivial task, whereupon she challenged him to write a novel. In response, Diderot wrote his novel ''[[The Indiscreet Jewels]]'' (French:''Les bijoux indiscrets''). The book is about the magical ring of a Sultan which induces any woman's \"discreet jewels\"<ref name=\"Furbank 1992 44\">{{cite book|title=Diderot:A Critical Biography|author=P.N.

The book proved to be lucrative for Diderot even though it could only be sold clandestinely.

The scientific work of which he was most proud was ''Memoires sur differents sujets de mathematique'' (1748). This work contains original ideas on [[acoustics]], tension, [[air resistance]], and \"a project for a new organ\" which could be played by all. Some of Diderot's scientific works were applauded by contemporary publications of his time like ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', the ''Journal des savants''; and the Jesuit publication ''Journal de Trevoux,'' which invited more such work: \"on the part of a man as clever and able as M. Diderot seems to be, of whom we should also observe that his style is as elegant, trenchant, and unaffected as it is lively and ingenious.\"<ref name = \"Age of Voltaire 627\"/>\n\n===''Letter on the Blind''===\nDiderot's celebrated ''[[Letter on the Blind]]'' (''Lettre sur les aveugles \u00e0 l'usage de ceux qui voient'') (1749) introduced him to the world as an original thinker.{{sfn|Morley|1911}} The subject is a discussion of the interrelation between man's reason and the [[knowledge]] acquired through perception (the [[sense|five senses]]). The title of his book also evoked some ironic doubt about who exactly were \"the blind\" under discussion. In the essay, blind English mathematician [[Nicholas Saunderson]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stephens |first1=Mitchell |title=Imagine there's no heaven: how atheism helped create the modern world |date=2014 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9781137002600 |oclc=852658386 |pages=123\u201324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WN-dAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=9781137002600&pg=PA123#v=onepage |accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref> argues that, since knowledge derives from the senses, mathematics is the only form of knowledge that both he and a sighted person can agree on. It is suggested that the blind could be taught to read through their sense of touch. (A later essay, ''Lettre sur les sourds et muets'', considered the case of a similar deprivation in the [[deaf]] and [[speech disorder|mute]].) According to [[Jonathan Israel]], what makes the ''Lettre sur les aveugles'' so remarkable, however, is its distinct, if undeveloped, presentation of the theory of [[Genetic variability|variation]] and [[natural selection]].<ref>Diderot's contemporary, also a Frenchman, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]\u2014who in 1745 was named Head of the Prussian Academy of Science under [[Frederic the Great]]\u2014was developing similar ideas. These proto-evolutionary theories were by no means as thought out and systematic as those of [[Charles Darwin]] a hundred years later.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This powerful essay, for which [[La Mettrie]] expressed warm appreciation in 1751, revolves around a remarkable deathbed scene in which a dying blind philosopher, Saunderson, rejects the arguments of a [[Deism|deist]] clergyman who endeavours to win him round to a belief in a [[Divine Providence|providential]] God during his last hours. Saunderson's arguments are those of a neo-[[Spinoza|Spinozist]] [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalist]] and [[fatalist]], using a sophisticated notion of the [[Spontaneous generation|self-generation]] and natural evolution of species without Creation or supernatural intervention. The notion of [[Materialism|\"thinking matter\"]] is upheld and the \"[[argument from design]]\" discarded (following La Mettrie) as hollow and unconvincing. The work appeared anonymously in Paris in June 1749, and was vigorously suppressed by the authorities. Diderot, who had been under police surveillance since 1747, was swiftly identified as the author, had his manuscripts confiscated, and was imprisoned for some months, under a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'', on the outskirts of Paris, in the dungeons at [[Vincennes]] where he was visited almost daily by [[Rousseau]], at the time his closest and most assiduous ally.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650\u20131750.'' ([[Oxford University Press]]. 2001, 2002), p. 710</ref></blockquote>\n\nVoltaire wrote an enthusiastic letter to Diderot commending the ''Lettre'' and stating that he had held Diderot in high regard for a long time to which Diderot had sent a warm response. Soon after this, Diderot was arrested.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|pages=629\u201330|year=1965}}</ref>\n\nScience historian [[Conway Zirkle]] has written that Diderot was an [[History of evolutionary thought|early evolutionary thinker]] and noted that his passage that described natural selection was \"so clear and accurate that it almost seems that we would be forced to accept his conclusions as a logical necessity even in the absence of the evidence collected since his time.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71\u2013123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}</ref>\n\n==Incarceration and release==\nAngered by public resentment over the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]], the government started incarcerating many of its critics. It was decided at this time to rein in Diderot. On 23 July 1749, the governor of the [[Vincennes]] fortress instructed the police to incarcerate Diderot, and the next day he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in the Vincennes. He had been permitted to retain one book that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest, ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', which he read during his incarceration. He wrote notes and annotations on the book, using a toothpick as a pen, and ink that he made by scraping slate from the walls and mixing it with wine.<ref name = 'Age of Voltaire 630'>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=630|year=1965}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1749, [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet|Mme du Chatelet]], presumably at [[Voltaire]]'s behest, wrote to the governor of Vincennes, who was her kinsman, pleading that Diderot be lodged more comfortably while jailed. The governor then offered Diderot access to the great halls of the Vincennes castle and the freedom to receive books and visitors providing he would write a document of submission.<ref name = 'Age of Voltaire 630'/> On 13 August 1749, Diderot wrote to the governor:\n\n{{quote|I admit to you...that the ''Pensees'', the ''Bijoux'', and the ''Lettre sur les aveugles'' are debaucheries of the mind that escaped from me; but I can...promise you on my honor (and I do have honor) that they will be the last, and that they are the only ones...As for those who have taken part in the publication of these works, nothing will be hidden from you.

On 23 August, Diderot signed another letter promising to never leave the Vincennes without permission.<ref name = \"Age of Voltaire 631\"/> On 3 November 1749, Diderot was released from the Vincennes.<ref name=\"Will Durant 1965 632\">{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=632|year=1965}}</ref> Subsequently, in 1750, he released the prospectus for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers|Encyclop\u00e9die]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=633|year=1965}}</ref>\n\n== Encyclop\u00e9die ==\n{{Main|Encyclop\u00e9die}}\n\n===Genesis===\n[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|Title page of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'']]\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 le Breton]], a bookseller and printer, approached Diderot with a project for the publication of a translation of [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' into French, first undertaken by the Englishman [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]], and followed by the German [[Gottfried Sellius]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Diderot accepted the proposal, and transformed it. He persuaded Le Breton to publish a new work, which would consolidate ideas and knowledge from the [[Republic of Letters]]. The publishers found capital for a larger enterprise than they had first planned. [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] was persuaded to become Diderot's colleague, and permission was procured from the government.\n\nIn 1750 an elaborate prospectus announced the project, and in 1751 the first volume was published.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This work was unorthodox and advanced for the time. Diderot stated that \"An encyclopedia ought to make good the failure to execute such a project hitherto, and should encompass not only the fields already covered by the academies, but each and every branch of human knowledge.\" Comprehensive knowledge will give \"the power to change men's common way of thinking.\"<ref>Examples are Diderot's articles on Asian philosophy and religion; see [[Urs App]]. ''The Birth of Orientalism''. Philadelphia: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2010 ({{ISBN|978-0-8122-4261-4}}), pp. 133\u201387.</ref> The work combined scholarship with information on trades. Diderot emphasized the abundance of knowledge within each subject area. Everyone would benefit from these insights.\n\n===Controversies===\nDiderot's work, however, was mired in controversy from the beginning; the project was suspended by the courts in 1752. Just as the second volume was completed accusations arose regarding seditious content, concerning the editor's entries on religion and natural law. Diderot was detained and his house was searched for manuscripts for subsequent articles: but the search proved fruitless as no manuscripts could be found. They were hidden in the house of an unlikely confederate\u2014[[Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Chretien de Lamoignon Malesherbes]], who originally ordered the search. Although Malesherbes was a staunch absolutist, and loyal to the monarchy - he was sympathetic to the literary project. Along with his support, and that of other well-placed influential confederates, the project resumed. Diderot returned to his efforts only to be constantly embroiled in controversy.\n\nThese twenty years were to Diderot not merely a time of incessant drudgery, but harassing persecution and desertion of friends. The ecclesiastical party detested the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'', in which they saw a rising stronghold for their philosophic enemies. By 1757 they could endure it no longer - the subscribers had grown from 2,000 to 4,000, a measure of the growth of the work in popular influence and power.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Diderot wanted the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' to give all the knowledge of the world to the people of France. However, the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' threatened the governing social classes of France (aristocracy) because it took for granted the justice of [[religious tolerance]], [[freedom of thought]], and the value of science and industry.<ref>Lyons, Martyn. \"Books: A Living History\". Getty Publishing, 2011, p. 107.</ref> It asserted the doctrine that the main concern of the nation's government ought to be the nation's common people. It was believed that the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' was the work of an organized band of conspirators against society, and that the dangerous ideas they held were made truly formidable by their open publication. In 1759, the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' was formally suppressed.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The decree did not stop the work, which went on, but its difficulties increased by the necessity of being clandestine. [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] withdrew from the enterprise and other powerful colleagues, including [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], declined to contribute further to a book which had acquired a bad reputation.{{sfn|Morley|1911}}\n\n===Diderot's contribution===\nDiderot was left to finish the task as best he could. He wrote several hundred articles, some very slight, but many of them laborious, comprehensive, and long. He damaged his eyesight correcting proofs and editing the manuscripts of less competent contributors. He spent his days at workshops, mastering manufacturing processes, and his nights writing what he had learned during the day. He was incessantly harassed by threats of police raids. The last copies of the first volume were issued in 1765.\n\nIn 1764, when his immense work was drawing to an end, he encountered a crowning mortification: he discovered that the bookseller, Le Breton, fearing the government's displeasure, had struck out from the proof sheets, after they had left Diderot's hands, all passages that he considered too dangerous. \"He and his printing-house overseer,\" writes Furbank, \"had worked in complete secrecy, and had moreover deliberately destroyed the author's original manuscript so that the damage could not be repaired.\"<ref>P.

According to Nicholas Cronk, ''Rameau's Nephew'' is \"arguably the greatest work of the French Enlightenment's greatest writer.\"<ref>Nicholas Cronk, \"Introduction\", in ''Rameau's Nephew and First Satire'', Oxford: Oxford UP, 2006 (pp. vii\u2013xxv), p. vii.</ref>\n\nDiderot's intention in writing the dialogue\u2014whether as a satire on contemporary manners, a reduction of the theory of [[Individualism|self-interest]] to an absurdity, the application of [[irony]] to the ethics of ordinary convention, a mere setting for a discussion about music, or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a parasite and a human original\u2014is disputed. In political terms it explores \"the bipolarisation of the social classes under absolute monarchy,\" and insofar as its protagonist demonstrates how the servant often manipulates the master, ''[[Le Neveu de Rameau]]'' can be seen to anticipate Hegel's [[master\u2013slave dialectic]].<ref>Jean Varloot, \"Pr\u00e9face\", in: Jean Varloot, ed.

The nephew composes and teaches music with some success but feels disadvantaged by his name and is jealous of his uncle. Eventually he sinks into an indolent and debauched state. After his wife's death, he loses all self-esteem and his brusque manners result in him being ostracized by former friends. A character profile of the nephew is now sketched by Diderot: a man who was once wealthy and comfortable with a pretty wife, who is now living in poverty and decadence, shunned by his friends. And yet this man retains enough of his past to analyze his despondency philosophically and maintains his sense of humor. Essentially he believes in nothing\u2014not in religion, nor in morality; nor in the  Roussean view about nature being better than civilization since in his opinion every species in nature consumes one another.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=660|year=1965}}</ref>  He views the same process at work in the economic world where men consume each other through the legal system.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|pages=660\u201301|year=1965}}</ref> The wise man, according to the nephew, will consequently practice hedonism: \n\n{{Quote|Hurrah for wisdom and philosophy!--the wisdom of Solomon: to drink good wines, gorge on choice foods, tumble pretty women, sleep on downy beds; outside of that, all is vanity.<ref name = \"Age of Voltaire 661\">{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=661|year=1965}}</ref>}}\n\nThe dialogue ends with Diderot calling the nephew a wastrel, a coward, and a glutton devoid of spiritual values to which the nephew replies: \"I believe you are right.\"<ref name = \"Age of Voltaire 661\"/>\n\nThe publication history of the ''Nephew'' is circuitous. Written in 1761, Diderot never saw the work through to publication during his lifetime, and apparently did not even share it with his friends.

This pattern ensures that, in a diatonic scale spanning more than one octave, all the half steps are [[Maximal evenness|maximally separated]] from each other (i.e. separated by at least two whole steps). \n\nThe seven [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of any diatonic scale can also be obtained by using a [[Interval cycle|chain]] of six [[perfect fifth]]s. For instance, the seven [[natural (music)|natural]] pitches that form the C-[[major scale]] can be obtained from a stack of perfect fifths starting from F:\n:F\u2014C\u2014G\u2014D\u2014A\u2014E\u2014B\n\nAny sequence of seven successive [[natural note]]s, such as C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B, and any [[Transposition (music)|transposition]] thereof, is a diatonic scale. Modern [[musical keyboard]]s are designed so that the white notes form a diatonic scale, though transpositions of this diatonic scale require one or more black keys. A diatonic scale can be also described as two [[tetrachord]]s separated by a [[whole tone]].\n\nThe term ''[[diatonic]]'' originally referred to the [[diatonic genus]], one of the three [[genus (music)|genera]] of the ancient Greeks. In [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]], [[Allen Forte]] classifies diatonic scales as [[set form]] 7\u201335.\n\nThis article does not concern alternative seven-note [[diatonic and chromatic#Diatonic scales|diatonic scales]] such as the [[harmonic minor]] or the [[melodic minor]].\n\n==History==\nWestern music from the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] until the [[Romantic music|late 19th century]] (see [[common practice period]]) is based on the diatonic scale and the unique [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] relationships created by this system of organizing seven notes.\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{main article|Music of Mesopotamia}}\nThere is one claim that the 45,000-year-old [[Divje Babe Flute]] uses a diatonic scale, but there is no proof or consensus it is even a musical instrument.<ref>\"Random Samples\", ''Science'' April 1997, vol 276 no 5310 pp 203\u2013205 ([http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/276/5310/203g available online]).</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that the [[Sumer]]ians and [[Babylonia]]ns used some version of the diatonic scale.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kilmer |first=Anne Draffkorn |date=1998 |title=The Musical Instruments from Ur and Ancient Mesopotamian Music |url=http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/?p=5425 |journal=Expedition Magazine |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=12\u201319 |access-date=2015-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Crickmore |first=Leon |chapter=New Light on the Babylonian Tonal System |title=ICONEA 2008: Proceedings of the International Conference of Near Eastern Archaeomusicology |editor-first1=Richard |editor-last1=Dumbrill |editor-first2=Irving |editor-last2=Finkel |publisher=Iconea Publications |location=London |chapter-url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/10599417/281241773/name/Crickmore-Iconea2008.pdf |volume=24 |pages=11\u201322 |year=2010 |access-date=2015-12-29}}</ref> This derives from surviving inscriptions that contain a tuning system and musical composition. Despite the conjectural nature of reconstructions of the piece known as the [[Hurrian songs]] from the surviving score, the evidence that it used the diatonic scale is much more soundly based. This is because instructions for tuning the scale involve tuning a chain of six fifths, so that the corresponding circle of seven [[major third|major]] and [[Minor third|minor]] thirds are all consonant-sounding, and this is a recipe for tuning a diatonic scale.\n\n9,000-year-old [[Gudi (instrument)|flutes]] found in [[Jiahu]], China indicate the evolution, over a period of 1,200 years, of flutes having 4, 5 and 6 holes to having 7 and 8 holes, the latter exhibiting striking similarity to diatonic hole spacings and sounds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Juzhong |last2=Harbottle |first2=Garman |last3=Wang |first3=Changsui |last4=Kong |first4=Zhaochen |date=23 September 1999 |title=Oldest playable musical instruments found at Jiahu early Neolithic site in China |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6751/full/401366a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=401 |pages=366\u2013368}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe scales corresponding to the medieval [[church modes]] were diatonic. Depending on which of the seven notes of the diatonic scale you use as the beginning, the positions of the intervals fall at different distances from the starting tone (the \"reference note\"), producing seven different scales. One of these, the one starting on B, has no pure fifth above its reference note (B\u2013F is a [[diminished fifth]]): it is probably for this reason that it was not used. Of the six remaining scales, two were described as corresponding to two others with a B{{music|b}} instead of a B{{music|natural}}: \n\n# A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A was described as D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B{{music|b}}\u2013C\u2013D (the modern A and D [[Aeolian scale]]s, respectively)\n# C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C was described as F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B{{music|b}}\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F (the modern C and F [[Ionian Scale|Ionian (major) scales]], respectively)\n\nAs a result, medieval theory described the church modes as corresponding to four diatonic scales only (two of which had the variable B{{music|natural}}/{{music|b}}).\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[Heinrich Glarean]] considered that the modal scales including a B{{music|b}} had to be the result of a transposition. In his ''[[Dodecachordon]]'', he not only described six \"natural\" diatonic scales (still neglecting the seventh one with a diminished fifth above the reference note), but also six \"transposed\" ones, each including a B{{music|b}}, resulting in the total of twelve scales that justified the title of his treatise.\n\n===Modern===\nBy the beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, the notion of musical [[key (music)|key]] was established, describing additional possible transpositions of the diatonic scale. [[Major scale|Major]] and [[Minor scale|minor scales]] came to dominate until at least the start of the 20th century, partly because their intervallic patterns are suited to the reinforcement of a central [[Triad (music)|triad]]. Some church modes survived into the early 18th century, as well as appearing in [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[20th-century music]], and [[jazz]] (see [[chord-scale system]]).\n\n==Theory==\n[[File:Piano-keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The modern [[piano keyboard]] is based on the interval patterns of the diatonic scale. Any sequence of seven successive white keys plays a diatonic scale.]]\nOf Glarean's six natural scales, three are major scales (those with a major third/triad: [[Ionian mode|Ionian]], [[Lydian mode|Lydian]], and [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]]), three are minor (those with a minor third/triad: [[Dorian mode|Dorian]], [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]], and [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]]). To these may be added the seventh diatonic scale, with a diminished fifth above the reference note, the [[Locrian mode|Locrian]] scale. These could be transposed not only to include one flat in the signature (as described by Glarean), but to all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], resulting in a total of eighty-four diatonic scales.\n\nThe modern [[musical keyboard]] originated as a diatonic keyboard with only white keys.<ref>Mee\u00f9s, N.

With this abbreviation,  major scale, for instance, can be represented as\n\n:T\u2013T\u2013S\u2013T\u2013T\u2013T\u2013S\n\n===Major scale===\n{{Main article|Major scale}}\nThe [[major scale]] or [[Ionian mode|Ionian]] scale is one of the diatonic scales. It is made up of seven distinct [[Musical note|note]]s, plus an eighth that duplicates the first an [[octave]] higher. The pattern of seven intervals separating the eight notes is T\u2013T\u2013S\u2013T\u2013T\u2013T\u2013S. In [[solfege]], the syllables used to name each [[Degree (music)|degree]] of the scale are ''Do\u2013Re\u2013Mi\u2013Fa\u2013Sol\u2013La\u2013Ti\u2013Do''. A sequence of successive [[natural note]]s starting from C is an example of major scale, called [[C-major]] scale.\n\n{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|-\n| &nbsp; || Notes in C major: || C || &nbsp; || D || &nbsp; || E || &nbsp; || F || &nbsp; || G || &nbsp; || A || &nbsp; || B || &nbsp; || C\n|-\n| &nbsp; || Degrees in solfege: || ''Do'' || &nbsp; || ''Re'' || &nbsp; || ''Mi'' || &nbsp; || ''Fa'' || &nbsp; || ''Sol'' || &nbsp; || ''La'' || &nbsp; || ''Ti'' || &nbsp; || ''Do''\n|-\n| &nbsp; || Interval sequence: || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || S || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || S || &nbsp;\n|}\nThe eight degrees of the scale are also known by traditional names, especially when used in a tonal context:\n:*1st \u2013 [[Tonic (music)|Tonic]] (key note)\n:*2nd \u2013 [[Supertonic]]\n:*3rd \u2013 [[Mediant]]\n:*4th \u2013 [[Subdominant]]\n:*5th \u2013 [[Dominant (music)|Dominant]]\n:*6th \u2013 [[Submediant]]\n:*7th \u2013 [[Leading-tone|Leading tone]]\n:*8th \u2013 [[Tonic (music)|Tonic]] ([[Octave]])\n\n===Natural minor scale===\n{{Main article|Minor scale}}\nFor each major scale, there is a corresponding [[minor scale#Natural minor scale|natural minor scale]], sometimes called its [[relative key|relative minor]]. It uses the same sequence of notes as the corresponding major scale but starts from a different note. That is, it begins on the sixth degree of the major scale and proceeds step-by-step to the first octave of the sixth degree. A sequence of successive [[natural note]]s starting from A is an example of a [[natural minor scale]], called the A natural minor scale.\n\n{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|-\n| &nbsp; || Notes in A minor: || A || &nbsp; || B || &nbsp; || C || &nbsp; || D || &nbsp; || E || &nbsp; || F || &nbsp; || G || &nbsp; || A\n|-\n| &nbsp; || Interval sequence: || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || S || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || S || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp; || T || &nbsp;\n|}\nThe degrees of the natural minor scale, especially in a tonal context, have the same names as those of the major scale, except the seventh degree, which is known as the [[subtonic]] because it is a whole step below the tonic. The term [[leading tone]] is generally reserved for seventh degrees that are a ''half step'' (semitone) below the tonic, as is the case in the major scale.\n\nBesides the natural minor scale, five other kinds of scales can be obtained from the notes of a major scale, by simply choosing a different note as the starting note. All these scales meet the definition of diatonic scale.\n\n===Modes===\n{{Main article|Mode (music)}}\nThe whole collection of diatonic scales as defined above can be divided into seven different scales.\n\nAs explained above, all [[major scale]]s use the same interval sequence T\u2013T\u2013S\u2013T\u2013T\u2013T\u2013S. This interval sequence was called the ''Ionian mode'' by Glarean. It is one of the seven modern modes. From any major scale, a new scale is obtained by taking a different [[degree (music)|degree]] as the tonic. With this method it is possible to generate six other scales or modes from each major scale. Another way to describe the same result would be to consider that, behind the diatonic scales, there exists an underlying \"diatonic system\" which is the series of diatonic notes without a reference note; assigning the reference note in turn to each of the seven notes in each octave of the system produces seven diatonic scales, each characterized by a different interval sequence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n!

However, any [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of each of these scales (or of the system underlying them) is a valid example of the corresponding mode. In other words, transposition preserves mode.\n\nThe whole set of diatonic scales is commonly defined as the set composed of these seven natural-note scales, together with all of their possible transpositions. As discussed [[diatonic and chromatic#Diatonic scales|elsewhere]], different definitions of this set are sometimes adopted in the literature.\n\n[[File:Modes.svg|thumb|center|700px|[[Pitch constellation]]s of the modern musical modes]]\n\n===Diatonic scales and tetrachords===\nA diatonic scale can be also described as two [[tetrachord#Romantic era|tetrachords]] separated by a [[whole tone]]. For example, under this view the two tetrachord structures of C&nbsp;major would be:\n:[C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F] \u2013 [G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C]\nand the natural minor of A would be:\n:[A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D] \u2013 [E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A].\nThe set of intervals within each tetrachord comprises two tones and a semitone.\n\n==Properties==\nThe diatonic scale as defined above has specific properties that make it unique among seven-note scales. Many of these properties are embedded in Western musical theory and notation, which were conceived at a time when Western music was mainly diatonic. These properties include:\n\n* The diatonic scale is obtained from a [[interval cycle|chain]] of six successive [[perfect fifth|fifth]]s. For instance, the seven [[natural (music)|natural]] pitches that form the C-[[major scale]] can be obtained from a chain of fifths starting from F (F\u2014C\u2014G\u2014D\u2014A\u2014E\u2014B).\n* It is either a sequence of successive [[natural note]]s (such as the C-[[major scale]], C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B, or the A-[[minor scale]], A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G) or a [[transposition (music)|transposition]] thereof.\n* It can be written using seven consecutive notes without [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] on a [[staff (music)|staff]] with  no [[key signature]] or, when transposed, with a conventional [[key signature]] or with accidentals.\n\n[[David Rothenberg]] generalized properties of the diatonic scale to other scales in what he called \"propriety\": see [[Rothenberg propriety]]. Around the same time [[Gerald Balzano]] independently came up with the same definition in the more limited context of equal temperaments, calling it \"coherence\". The generation of the diatonic scale by iterations of a single generator, the fifth, has also been generalized by [[Erv Wilson]], in what is sometimes called a [[MOS scale]]. See also [[Diatonic set theory]] for a discussion of other properties that transcend the diatonic scale properly speaking.\n\n==Tuning==\nDiatonic scales can be tuned variously, either by iteration of a perfect or tempered fifth, or by a combination of perfect fifths and perfect thirds ([[Just intonation]]), or possibly by a combination of fifths and thirds of various sizes, as in [[well temperament]].\n\n===Iteration of the fifth===\n====Pythagorean tuning====\n{{main|Pythagorean tuning}}\nIf the scale is produced by the iteration of six perfect fifths, for instance F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E\u2013B, the result is [[Pythagorean tuning]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | note\n| style=\"width: 60px;\" | F\n| style=\"width: 60px;\" | C\n| style=\"width: 60px;\" | G\n| style=\"width: 60px;\" | D\n| style=\"width: 60px;\" | A\n| style=\"width: 60px;\" | E\n| style=\"width: 60px;\" | B ||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | pitch \n| {{frac|2|3}} || {{frac|1|1}} || {{frac|3|2}} || {{frac|9|4}} || {{frac|27|8}} || {{frac|81|16}} || {{frac|243|32}} ||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | bring into main octave\n| {{frac|4|3}} || {{frac|1|1}} || {{frac|3|2}} || {{frac|9|8}} || {{frac|27|16}} || {{frac|81|64}} || {{frac|243|128}} ||\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | sort into note order\n|C||D||E||F||G||A||B|| style=\"width:6em;\" |C' \n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | pitch\n| {{frac|1|1}} || {{frac|9|8}} || {{frac|81|64}} || {{frac|4|3}} || {{frac|3|2}} || {{frac|27|16}} || {{frac|243|128}} || {{frac|2|1}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | interval between notes\n| || {{frac|9|8}} || {{frac|9|8}} || {{frac|32|27}} || {{frac|9|8}} || {{frac|9|8}} || {{frac|9|8}} || {{frac|256|243}}\n|}\n\nSix of the \"fifth\" intervals (C\u2013G, D\u2013A, E\u2013B, F\u2013C', G\u2013D', A\u2013E') are all {{frac|3|2}} = 1.5, but B\u2013F' is the discordant [[tritone]], here {{frac|729|512}} \u2248 1.423828125.\n\nExtending the series of fifths to eleven fifths would result into the Pythagorean [[Chromatic scale]]. It would add pitches for the five \"piano black key\" notes, for instance A{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E\u2013B\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013C{{music|sharp}}\u2013G{{music|sharp}}. A{{music|flat}} and G{{music|sharp}} are commonly thought of as being the same note, but as worked out in this way, G{{music|sharp}} is higher pitch than A{{music|flat}} by about 1.01364 ({{frac|1.5<sup>12</sup>|128}}, the [[Pythagorean comma]], about 24% of a semitone, {{frac|3<sup>12</sup>|2<sup>19</sup>}} = {{frac|531,441|524,288}}). Depending on whether one chooses A{{music|flat}} or G{{music|sharp}}, one would convert one of the perfect fifths into a dissonant chord called a [[wolf fifth]], either C{{music|sharp}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} or G{{music|sharp}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}, a Pythagorean comma narrower than a perfect fifth.\n\n====Equal temperament====\n{{main|Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament}}\nTo cure this and other effects, in the modern [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|twelve-tone equal temperament]] as used for [[piano]]s and other instruments, the fifths are \"[[Musical temperament|tempered]]\" by {{frac|1|12}} of a Pythagorean comma each, so that the last fifth is the same as the previous ones. The frequency ratio of the semitone then becomes the [[twelfth root of two]] ({{radic|2|12}} \u2248 1.059463). If ''S'', the ratio of the semitone, is {{radic|2|12}}, the ratios for the other intervals become:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;text-align:center\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| notes\n| style=\"width:3em;\" | C \n| style=\"width:3em;\" | D \n| style=\"width:3em;\" | E \n| style=\"width:3em;\" | F \n| style=\"width:3em;\" | G \n| style=\"width:3em;\" | A \n| style=\"width:3em;\" | B \n| style=\"width:3em;\" | C'\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | pitch\n| 1 || ''S''<sup>2</sup> || ''S''<sup>4</sup> || ''S''<sup>5</sup> || ''S''<sup>7</sup> || ''S''<sup>9</sup> || ''S''<sup>11</sup> || ''S''<sup>12</sup>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| interval between notes \n|  || ''S''<sup>2</sup> || ''S''<sup>2</sup> || ''S'' || ''S''<sup>2</sup>|| ''S''<sup>2</sup> || ''S''<sup>2</sup>|| ''S''\n|}\nwith the exponents denoting the number of semitones. The (tempered) fifth intervals (C\u2013G, D\u2013A, E\u2013B; F\u2013C'; G\u2013D'; A\u2013E') are all ''S''<sup>7</sup> \u2248 1.4983, i.e. made of 7 (tempered) semitones, but B\u2013F' (the [[tritone]]) is ''S''<sup>6</sup> = {{radic|2}} (about 1.4142, 6 semitones).\n\n====Meantone temperament====\n{{main|Meantone temperament}}\nThe fifths could be tempered more than in equal temperament, in order to produce better thirds. See [[quarter-comma meantone]] for a meantone temperament commonly used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and sometimes after, which produces perfect major thirds.\n\n===Just intonation===\n{{main|Just intonation}}\nJust intonation often is represented using Euler's [[Tonnetz]], with the horizontal axis showing the perfect fifths and the vertical axis the perfect major thirds. In the Tonnetz, the diatonic scale in just intonation appears as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;text-align:center\"\n| A || E || B ||\n|-\n| style=\"width:2em;\" | F \n| style=\"width:2em;\" | C \n| style=\"width:2em;\" | G \n| style=\"width:2em;\" | D\n|}\n\nF\u2013A, C\u2013E and G\u2013B, aligned vertically, are perfect major thirds; A\u2013E\u2013B and F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D are two series of perfect fifths.

In [[East Germany]], the national anthem was \"[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]\" (\"Risen from Ruins\") between 1949 and 1990.\n\nSince [[World War II]] and the fall of [[Nazi Germany]], only the third [[stanza]] has been used as the national anthem. The stanza's beginning, \"{{Lang|de|[[Wikt:Einigkeit|Einigkeit]] und [[Wikt:Recht|Recht]] und [[Wikt:Freiheit|Freiheit]]|italic=no}}\" (\"Unity and Justice and Freedom\") is considered the unofficial [[national motto]] of Germany,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y85XAAAAYAAJ&q=einigkeit+und+recht+und+freiheit+motto+federal+republic&dq=einigkeit+und+recht+und+freiheit+motto+federal+republic&hl=de&sa=X&ei=tHSeUt_UCMXbswan34HwCA&ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg ''The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems'', James Minahan, Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is inscribed on modern German Army belt buckles and the rims of some [[German coins]].\n\nThe music is the hymn \"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]\", written in 1797 by the Austrian composer [[Joseph Haydn]] as an anthem for the birthday of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. In 1841, the German linguist and poet [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben]] wrote the lyrics of \"{{Lang|de|Das Lied der Deutschen|italic=no}}\" as a new text for that music, counterposing the national unification of Germany to the eulogy of a monarch, lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time. Along with the [[flag of Germany]], which first appeared in [[Flag of Germany#Principality of Reuss-Greiz|its essentially \"modern\" form in 1778]]; it was one of the symbols of the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|March Revolution of 1848]].\n\nIn order to endorse its republican and liberal tradition, the song was chosen as the national anthem of Germany in 1922, during the [[Weimar Republic]]. [[West Germany]] adopted the \"{{Lang|de|Deutschlandlied|italic=no}}\" as its official national anthem in 1952 for similar reasons, with only the third stanza sung on official occasions. Upon [[German reunification]] in 1990, only the third stanza was confirmed as the national anthem.\n\n==Title==\nThe song is also well known by the beginning and refrain of the first stanza, \"{{lang|de|Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles|italic=no}}\" (\"Germany, Germany above all else\"), but this has never been its title. The line \"Germany, Germany above all else\" meant that the most important goal of 19th-century German liberal revolutionaries should be a unified Germany which would overcome loyalties to the local kingdoms, principalities, duchies and palatines (''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'') of then-fragmented Germany.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Toeche-Mittler |first1=Joachim |last2=Probst |first2=Werner |year=2013 |editor1-last=Dean |editor1-first=Antony |editor2-last=Mantle |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Murray |editor3-first=David |editor4-last=Smart |editor4-first=David |translator-last1=Dean |translator-first1=Antony |translator-last2=Mantle |translator-first2=Robert |translator-last3=Murray |translator-first3=David |translator-last4=Smart |translator-first4=David |title=Tunes of Blood & Iron: German Regimental and Parade Marches from the Age of Frederick the Great to the Present Day |volume=1 |publisher=Helion & Company Limited |location=Solihull, England |page=16 |isbn=978-1-909384-23-1}}</ref>\n\n== Melody ==\n[[File:Haydn portrait by Thomas Hardy (small).jpg|upright|thumb|left|Portrait of Haydn by [[Thomas Hardy (English painter)|Thomas Hardy]], 1792]]\n\nThe melody of the \"{{Lang|de|Deutschlandlied|italic=no}}\" was written by [[Joseph Haydn]] in 1797 to provide music to the poem \"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]\" (\"God save Franz the Emperor\") by [[Lorenz Leopold Haschka]]. The song was a birthday anthem honouring [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] (1768\u20131835), Habsburg emperor, and was intended as a parallel to Great Britain's \"[[God Save the King]]\". Haydn's work is sometimes called the \"Emperor's Hymn.\"\n\nIt has been conjectured that Haydn took the first four measures of the melody from a Croatian folk song.<ref>[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/hadow3.html Excerpt from] ''Notes Toward the Study of Joseph Haydn'' by Sir [[William Henry Hadow|William H. Hadow]], London (1897, reprinted New York, 1971)</ref> This hypothesis has never achieved unanimous agreement; the alternative theory reverses the direction of transmission, positing that Haydn's melody was adapted as a folk tune. For further discussion see [[Haydn and folk music]].\n\nHaydn later used the hymn as the basis for the second [[Movement (music)|movement]] (''poco adagio cantabile'') of his [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76, No. 3|Opus 76 No. 3]], a [[string quartet]], often called the \"Emperor\" or \"Kaiser\" quartet.\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{Main article|Unification of Germany}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]], stemming from the [[Middle Ages]], was already disintegrating when the [[French Revolution]] and the ensuing [[Napoleonic Wars]] altered the political map of Central Europe. However, hopes for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], human rights and [[republican government]] after [[Napoleon]]'s defeat in 1815 were dashed when the [[Congress of Vienna]] reinstated many small German principalities. In addition, with the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] of 1819, Austrian Chancellor [[Klemens von Metternich]] and his secret police enforced censorship, mainly in universities, to keep a watch on the activities of teachers and students, whom he held responsible for the spread of [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[liberalism|liberalist]] ideas. Since reactionaries among the monarchs were the main adversaries, demands for [[freedom of the press]] and other liberal rights were most often uttered in connection with the demand for a united Germany, even though many revolutionaries-to-be had different opinions about whether a republic or a [[constitutional monarchy]] would be the best solution for Germany.\n\nThe [[German Confederation]] ''(Deutscher Bund'' 1815\u20131866) was a loose federation of 35 monarchical states and four republican free cities, with a [[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Federal Assembly]] in Frankfurt. They began to remove internal customs barriers during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the German Customs Union (''[[Zollverein]]'') was formed among the majority of the states in 1834. In 1840 Hoffmann wrote a song about the ''Zollverein'', also to Haydn's melody, in which he praised the free trade of German goods which brought Germans and Germany closer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.von-fallersleben.de/text252.html|title=Schwefelh\u00f6lzer, Fenchel, Bricken (Der deutsche Zollverein)|work=www.von-fallersleben.de|accessdate=27 June 2010|language=German}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1848 March Revolution, the German Confederation handed over its authority to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]]. For a short period in the late 1840s, Germany was economically united with the borders described in the anthem, and a democratic constitution was being drafted, and with the [[Flag of Germany#Revolution and the Frankfurt Parliament|black-red-gold flag]] representing it. However, after 1849 the two largest German monarchies, Prussia and Austria, put an end to this liberal movement toward national unification.\n\n== Hoffmann's lyrics ==\n[[File:August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben.jpg|thumb|upright| August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben in 1841]]\n[[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben]] wrote the text in 1841 on holiday on the [[North Sea]] island of [[Heligoland]], then a possession of the United Kingdom (now part of Germany)<ref>''Heligoland'' (2017) J. R\u00fcger p. 37</ref>.\n\nHoffmann von Fallersleben intended \"{{Lang|de|Das Lied der Deutschen|italic=no}}\" to be sung to Haydn's tune, as the first publication of the poem included the music. The first line, \"{{Lang|de|Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles, \u00fcber alles in der Welt|italic=no}}\" (usually translated into English as \"Germany, Germany above all else, above all else in the world\"), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a united Germany a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for \"{{Lang|de|Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit|italic=no}}\" (unity and justice and freedom), Hoffmann expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the [[rule of law]], not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bundestag.de/blickpunkt/103_Parlament/0502/0502014.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906081233/http://www.bundestag.de/blickpunkt/103_Parlament/0502/0502014.html |archivedate=6 September 2011 |title=Staatssymbole Zeichen politischer Gemeinschaft |first=Nadja |last=Bareth |work=[[Bundestag|Blickpunt Bundestag]] |date=February 2005 |accessdate=1 December 2009 |language=German}}</ref>\n\nIn the era after the [[Congress of Vienna]], influenced by Metternich and his [[secret police]], Hoffmann's text had a distinctly revolutionary and at the same time liberal connotation, since the appeal for a united Germany was most often made in connection with demands for [[freedom of the press]] and other [[civil rights]]. Its implication that loyalty to a larger Germany should replace loyalty to one's local sovereign was then a revolutionary idea.\n\nThe year after he wrote \"Das Deutschlandlied\", Hoffmann lost his job as a librarian and professor in Breslau, Prussia (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland), because of this and other revolutionary works, and was forced into hiding until being pardoned after the revolutions of 1848 in the German states.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!German\n!English translation\n|-\n|<poem lang=\"de\">Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles,\n\u00dcber alles in der Welt,\nWenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze\nBr\u00fcderlich zusammenh\u00e4lt.\nVon der Maas bis an die Memel,\nVon der Etsch bis an den Belt,\n&nbsp;[[Repeat sign|{{!}}:]] Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles,\n&nbsp; \u00dcber alles in der Welt! :{{!}}</poem>\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|<poem>Germany, Germany above all,\nAbove all in the world,\nWhen, for protection and defense, \nIt always stands brotherly together.\nFrom the [[Meuse]] to the [[Neman]],\nFrom the [[Adige]] to the [[Fehmarn Belt|Belt]],\n&nbsp;|: Germany, Germany above all,\n&nbsp; Above all in the world! :|</poem>\n|-\n|<poem lang=\"de\">Deutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue,\nDeutscher Wein und deutscher Sang\nSollen in der Welt behalten\nIhren alten sch\u00f6nen Klang,\nUns zu edler Tat begeistern\nUnser ganzes Leben lang.\n&nbsp;{{!}}: Deutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue,\n&nbsp; Deutscher Wein und deutscher Sang! :{{!}}</poem>\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|<poem>[[Women in Germany|German women]], German loyalty,\n[[German wine]] and [[Music of Germany|German song]]\nShall retain in the world\nTheir old beautiful chime\nAnd inspire us to noble deeds\nDuring all of our life.\n&nbsp;|: German women, German loyalty,\n&nbsp; German wine and German song! :|</poem>\n|-\n|style=\"font-weight:bold;\"|<poem lang=\"de\">Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\nF\u00fcr das deutsche Vaterland!\nDanach lasst uns alle streben\nBr\u00fcderlich mit Herz und Hand!\nEinigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\nSind des Gl\u00fcckes Unterpfand;\n&nbsp;{{!}}: Bl\u00fch' im Glanze dieses Gl\u00fcckes,\n&nbsp; Bl\u00fche, deutsches Vaterland! :{{!}}</poem>\n| style=\"font-weight:bold; padding-left:2em;\"|<poem>Unity and justice and freedom\nFor the German fatherland!\nTowards these let us all strive\nBrotherly with heart and hand!\nUnity and justice and freedom\nAre the foundation of happiness;\n&nbsp;|: Flourish in the radiance of this happiness,\n&nbsp; Flourish, German fatherland! :|</poem>\n|}\n\n== Use before 1922 ==\nThe melody of the \"Deutschlandlied\" was originally written by Joseph Haydn in 1797 to provide music to the poem \"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]\" (\"God save Franz the Emperor\") by Lorenz Leopold Haschka. The song was a birthday anthem to Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Habsburg, and was intended to rival in merit the British \"[[God Save the King]]\".\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, \"{{Lang|de|Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser|italic=no}}\" became the official anthem of the emperor of the [[Austrian Empire]]. After the death of Francis II new lyrics were composed in 1854, ''Gott erhalte, Gott besch\u00fctze'', that mentioned the Emperor, but not by name. With those new lyrics, the song continued to be the anthem of Imperial Austria and later of Austria-Hungary. Austrian monarchists continued to use this anthem after 1918 in the hope of restoring the monarchy. The adoption of the Austrian anthem's melody by Germany in 1922 was not opposed by Austria.\n\n\"{{Lang|de|Das Lied der Deutschen|italic=no}}\" was not played at an official ceremony until Germany and the United Kingdom had agreed on the [[Heligoland\u2013Zanzibar Treaty]] in 1890, when it appeared only appropriate to sing it at the ceremony on the now officially German island of [[Heligoland]]. During the time of the German Empire it became one of the most widely known patriotic songs.\n\nThe song became very popular after the [[First Battle of Ypres#Battle of Langemarck|1914 Battle of Langemarck]] during [[World War I]], when, supposedly, several German regiments, consisting mostly of students no older than 20, attacked the British lines on the Western front singing the song, suffering heavy casualties. They are buried in the [[Langemark German war cemetery]] in Belgium. The official report of the army embellished the event as one of young German soldiers heroically sacrificing their lives for the Fatherland. In reality the untrained troops were sent out to attack the British trenches and were mown down by machine guns and rifle fire. This report, also known as the \"Langemarck Myth\", was printed on the first page in newspapers all over Germany. It is doubtful whether the soldiers would have sung the song in the first place: carrying heavy equipment, they might have found it difficult to run at high speed toward enemy lines while singing the slow song. Nonetheless, the story was widely repeated.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mosse|first=George L.|title=Fallen Soldiers: Reshaping the Memory of the World Wars|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|pages=70\u201373|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JwzIUz8aIk4C&pg=PA70|isbn=978-0-19-507139-9|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Official adoption ==\nThe melody used by the \"Deutschlandlied\" was still in use as the anthem of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] until its demise in 1918. On 11 August 1922, German President [[Friedrich Ebert]], a Social Democrat, made the ''Deutschlandlied'' the official German national anthem. In 1919 the black, red and gold tricolour, the colours of the 19th century liberal revolutionaries advocated by the political left and centre, was adopted (rather than the previous black, white and red of Imperial Germany). Thus, in a political trade-off, the conservative right was granted a nationalistic anthem \u2013 though Ebert advocated using only the anthem's third stanza (which was done after World War II).<ref name=Geisler70>{{Cite book|last=Geisler|first=Michael E.|title=National symbols, fractured identities: Contesting the national narrative|publisher=UPNE|year=2005|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLVaSxt-sV0C&pg=PA70|isbn=978-1-58465-437-7|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era, only the first stanza was used, followed by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] song \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\".<ref>Geisler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CLVaSxt-sV0C&pg=PA71 p.71.]</ref> It was played at occasions of great national significance such as the opening of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin when [[Hitler]] and his entourage, along with Olympic officials, walked into the stadium amid a chorus of three thousand Germans singing \"{{Lang|de|Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles|italic=no}}\". In this way, the first verse of the song became closely identified with the Nazi regime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/triumph/tr-olympics.htm|title=The Triumph of Hitler|work=The History Place|year=2001|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Use after World War II ==\n\nAfter its founding in 1949, [[West Germany]] did not have a national anthem for official events for some years, despite the growing need for the purpose of diplomatic procedures. In lieu of an official national anthem, popular German songs such as the ''[[Wir sind die Eingeborenen von Trizonesien|Trizonesien-Song]]'', a [[German carnival|carnival]] song mocking the occupying Allied powers, were used at some sporting events. Different musical compositions were discussed or used, such as the fourth movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], which is a musical setting of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s poem \"An die Freude\" (\"[[Ode to Joy]]\"). Though the black, red and gold colours of the national flag had been incorporated into Article 22 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|(West) German constitution]], a national anthem was not specified. On 29 April 1952, Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] asked President [[Theodor Heuss]] in a letter to accept \"{{Lang|de|Das Lied der Deutschen|italic=no}}\" as the national anthem, with only the third stanza being sung on official occasions. President Heuss agreed to this on 2 May 1952. This exchange of letters was published in the Bulletin of the Federal Government. Since it was viewed as the traditional right of the President as head of state to set the symbols of the state, the \"{{Lang|de|Deutschlandlied|italic=no}}\" thus became the national anthem.<ref name=briefwechsel1952 />\n\nMeanwhile, [[East Germany]] adopted its own national anthem, \"[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]\" (\"Risen from Ruins\").

The [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], for instance, attempted twice (in 1985 and 1986) to require German high school students to study all three stanzas, and in 1989 CDU politician {{ill|Christean Wagner|de}} decreed that all high school students in [[Hesse]] were to memorise the three stanzas.<ref>Geisler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CLVaSxt-sV0C&pg=PA72 p. 72.]</ref>\n\nOn 7 March 1990, months before [[German reunification|reunification]], the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] declared only the third stanza of Hoffmann's poem to be legally protected as a national anthem under German penitential law; Section 90a of the Criminal Code (''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'') makes defamation of the national anthem a crime \u2013 but does not specify what the national anthem is.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/law/academics/centers/transnational/work_new/german/case.php?id=631|title=Case: BVerfGE 81, 298 1 BvR 1215/87 German National Anthem \u2013 decision|date=7 March 1990|accessdate=18 January 2015|website=Institute for Transnational Law \u2013 Foreign Law Translations|publisher=[[University of Texas School of Law]] / Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft}}</ref> (This did not mean that stanzas one and two were not \u2013 at that time \u2013 part of the anthem at all, but that their peculiar status as \"part of the anthem but unsung\" disqualified them for penal law protection because the penal law must be interpreted in the narrowest manner possible, and was not explicit in their regard.)\n\nIn November 1991, President [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]] and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] agreed in an exchange of letters to declare the third stanza alone to be the national anthem of the reunified republic.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Amt-und-Aufgaben/Wirken-im-Inland/Repraesentation-und-Integration/repraesentation-und-integration-node.html| title = Repr\u00e4sentation und Integration | author = Bundespr\u00e4sidialamt | authorlink = Bundespr\u00e4sidialamt | language = German | accessdate = 24 May 2013 | quote = Nach Herstellung der staatlichen Einheit Deutschlands bestimmte Bundespr\u00e4sident von Weizs\u00e4cker in einem Briefwechsel mit Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl im Jahr 1991 die dritte Strophe zur Nationalhymne f\u00fcr das deutsche Volk. }}</ref> Hence, effective since then, the national anthem of Germany is unmistakably the third stanza of the Deutschlandlied, and only this stanza, with Haydn's music.\n\n[[File:2-EUR-Muenze-de-freiheit.png|thumb|The word \"FREIHEIT\" (freedom) on Germany's 2-Euro coin]]\nThe opening line of the third stanza, \"{{Lang|de|Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit|italic=no}}\" (\"Unity and Justice and Freedom\"), is widely considered to be the national motto of Germany, although it was never officially proclaimed as such. It appears on [[Bundeswehr]] soldiers' belt buckles (replacing the earlier \"[[Gott mit uns]]\" (\"God with Us\") of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] and the Nazi-era [[Wehrmacht]]). \"{{Lang|de|Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit|italic=no}}\" appeared on the rim of 2 and 5 [[Deutsche Mark]] coins and is present on 2 [[Euro coins]] minted in Germany.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n===Geographical===\n[[File:Maas memel etsch belt.svg|thumb|320px|German linguistic area (green) and political boundaries around 1841 (grey) in comparison to the text\u2019s geographic references (bold blue)]]\n\nThe first verse, which is no longer part of the national anthem and is ''not'' sung on official occasions, names three rivers and one strait \u2013 the [[Meuse]] (''Maas'' in German), [[Adige]] (''Etsch'') and [[Neman]] (''Memel'') Rivers and the [[Little Belt]] strait \u2013 as the boundaries of the German ''[[Sprachbund]]''. As the song was written before German unification, there was never an intention to deliniate borders of Germany as a nation-state. Nevertheless, these geographical references have been variously criticized as [[irredentism|irredentist]] or misleading.<ref>''A History of Modern Germany: 1800 to the Present'' (2011) M. Kitchen.</ref> Of these the Meuse and the Adige were parts of the [[German Confederation]] during the time when the song was composed. The Belt (strait) and the Neman later became actual boundaries of Germany (the Belt until 1920, the Neman until 1945), whereas the Meuse and Adige were not parts of the [[German Reich]] as of 1871. Today, no part of any of the four places mentioned in the \"{{Lang|de|Deutschlandlied|italic=no}}\" lies in Germany.\n\nIn an ethnic sense, none of these places formed a distinct ethnic border. The [[Duchy of Schleswig]] (to which the Belt refers) was inhabited by both Germans and Danes, with the Danes forming a clear majority near the strait. Around the Adige there was a mix of German, [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Gallo-Italian]] speakers, and the area around the Neman was not homogeneously German, but also accommodated [[Lithuanians]]. The Meuse (if taken as referencing the [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u201367)|Duchy of Limburg]], nominally part of the [[German Confederation]] for 28 years due to the political consequences of the [[Belgian Revolution]]), was ethnically Dutch with few Germans.\n\nNevertheless, such nationalistic rhetoric was relatively common in 19th-century public discourse. For example: [[Georg Herwegh]] in his poem \"The German Fleet\" (1841),<ref>[http://gedichte.xbib.de/Herwegh_gedicht_Die+deutsche+Flotte.htm \"Die deutsche Flotte\" (1841), ''Ein Volk vom Po gehorchet bis zum Sunde'']</ref> gives the Germans as the people \"between the [[Po (river)|Po]] and the Sund ([[\u00d8resund]]),\" and in 1832 Philipp Jakob Siebenpfeiffer, a noted journalist, declared at the [[Hambach Festival]] that he considered all \"between the [[Alps]] and the [[North Sea]]\" to be ''Deutschtum''.<ref>''Music and German National Identity'' (2002) by C. Applegate. pp. 254</ref>\n\n===Textual===\nDespite the text and tune of the song being quite peaceful compared to some other national anthems, the song has frequently been criticised for its generally nationalistic tone, the immodest geographic definition of Germany given in the first stanza, and the alleged male-chauvinistic attitude in the second stanza.<ref name=\"malzahn\">{{Cite news|last=Malzahn|first=Claus Christian|title=Deutsche Nationalhymne: 'Die bl\u00f6dsinnigste Parole der Welt'|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|date=24 June 2006|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/0,1518,422419,00.html|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2065774,00.html?maca=en-tagesschau_englisch-335-rdf-mp|title=Germans Stop Humming, Start Singing National Anthem|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=24 June 2006|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> A relatively early critic was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who called the grandiose claim in the first stanza (\"{{Lang|de|Deutschland \u00fcber alles\") \"die bl\u00f6dsinnigste Parole der Welt|italic=no}}\" (the most idiotic slogan in the world), and in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' said, \"{{Lang|de|Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles|italic=no}} \u2013 I fear that was the end of German philosophy.\"<ref name=\"malzahn\" /> The pacifist [[Kurt Tucholsky]] was also negative about the song, and in 1929 published a photo book sarcastically titled ''Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles'', criticising right-wing groups in Germany.\n\nGerman grammar distinguishes between {{Lang|de|\u00fcber alles}}, i.e. above all else [for me], and {{Lang|de|\u00fcber allen}}, meaning \"above everyone else.\" However, the latter misleading translation was chosen by the Allies during both World Wars for propaganda purposes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Falsehood in War Time: Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War (Chapter 11)|first=Arthur|last=Ponsonby|isbn=1162798653|publisher=George Allen and Unwin, London|year=1928}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern use of the first stanza ===\nGerman president [[Theodor Heuss]], upon request from chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], declared the ''Lied der Deutschen'' the national anthem of the German Federal Republic in May 1952, along with the provision that only the third verse was to be sung at official occasions.<ref name=briefwechsel1952>{{cite web|url=http://www.protokoll-inland.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/PI/DE/Allgemeines/briefwechsel1952.html|title=Briefwechsel zur Nationalhymne von 1952, Abdruck aus dem Bulletin der Bundesregierung Nr.&nbsp;51/S. 537 vom 6.&nbsp;Mai 1952|language=German|publisher=[[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Bundesministerium des Innern]]|date=6 May 1952|trans-title=Exchange of letters from 1952 regarding the national anthem, as published in the bulletin of the federal government, Nr.&nbsp;51/p. 537, 6 May 1952}}</ref> The declaration was a compromise between Heuss, who wanted to retain only the third verse, and the [[Cabinet of Germany|Cabinet]]'s wish to keep the first two verses.

He was the [[paramount leader]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1978 until his retirement in 1989. After [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976, Deng led his country through far-reaching market-economy reforms. While Deng never held office as the [[List of Presidents of the People's Republic of China|head of state]], [[List of premiers of the People's Republic of China|head of government]] or [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (that is, the [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|leader]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]), he nonetheless was responsible for economic reforms and an opening to the global economy. During his paramount leadership, his official state positions were [[Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] from 1978\u20131983 and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] of the People's Republic of China from 1983\u20131990, while his official party positions were [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from 1977\u20131982 and Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China from 1981\u20131989.\n\nBorn into a peasant background in [[Guang'an]], Sichuan province, Deng studied and worked in France in the 1920s, where he became a follower of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1923. Upon his return to China he joined the party organization in Shanghai, then was a political commissar for the Red Army in rural regions and by the late 1930s was considered a \"revolutionary veteran\" because he participated in the [[Long March]].<ref>{{Cite book|author = Cheng Li|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUcNg8xYHtEC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=China's leaders |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year = 2001}}</ref> Following the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Deng worked in [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] and the southwest region to consolidate Communist control.\n\nAs the party's [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretary General]] in the 1950s, Deng presided over anti-rightist campaigns and became instrumental in China's economic reconstruction following the [[Great Leap Forward]] of 1957\u20131960. However, his economic policies caused him to fall out of favor with Mao, and he was purged twice during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Following Mao's death in 1976, Deng outmanoeuvred the late chairman's chosen successor [[Hua Guofeng]] in December 1978.

His second wife, Jin Weiying, left him after Deng came under political attack in 1933. His third wife [[Zhuo Lin]] was the daughter of an industrialist in [[Yunnan]] Province. She became a member of the Communist Party in 1938, and married Deng a year later in front of Mao's cave dwelling in [[Yan'an]]. They had five children: three daughters (Deng Lin, [[Deng Nan]] and [[Deng Rong]]) and two sons ([[Deng Pufang]] and Deng Zhifang).\n\n=== Education and early career ===\n[[File:Deng xxixian.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Deng's name is spelled \"Teng Hi Hien\" on this employment card from the Hutchinson shoe factory in [[Ch\u00e2lette-sur-Loing]], France.

Page 5. {{ISBN|0-14-013945-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1919, Deng Xiaoping graduated from the [[Chongqing]] School. He and 80 schoolmates travelled by ship to France (travelling [[Steerage (deck)|steerage]]) to participate in the [[Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement]], a work-study program in which 4,001 Chinese would participate by 1927. Deng, the youngest of all the Chinese students in the group, had just turned 15.<ref>Spence 1999, 310</ref> Wu Yuzhang, the local leader of the Movement in Chongqing, enrolled Deng and his paternal uncle, Deng Shaosheng, in the program. Deng's father strongly supported his son's participation in the work-study abroad program.{{sfnb|Vogel|2011| p= 18\u201320}} The night before his departure, Deng's father took his son aside and asked him what he hoped to learn in France. He repeated the words he had learned from his teachers: \"To learn knowledge and truth from the West in order to save China.\" Deng was aware that China was suffering greatly, and that the Chinese people must have a modern education to save their country.<ref>Stewart, Whitney, Deng Xiaoping: Leader in a Changing China, 2001</ref>\n\nIn December 1920 a French packet ship, the ''Andr\u00e9 Lyon'', sailed into [[Marseille]] with 210 Chinese students aboard including Deng. The sixteen-year-old Deng briefly attended middle schools in [[Bayeux]] and [[Ch\u00e2tillon, Hauts-de-Seine|Ch\u00e2tillon]], but he spent most of his time in France working. His first job was as a fitter at the Le Creusot Iron and Steel Plant in La Garenne-Colombes, a south-western suburb of Paris where he moved in April 1921. Coincidentally, when Deng Xiaoping's later political fortunes were down and he was sent to work in a tractor factory in 1974 he found himself a fitter again and proved to still be a master of the skill.<ref name=\"sacu.org\">[http://www.sacu.org/dengfrance.html], Wang Song. \"Chinese Revolutionaries in France\".</ref>\n\nIn La Garenne-Colombes Deng met [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Cai Hesen]], [[Zhao Shiyan]] and Li Wenhai.<ref name=\"sacu.org\" /> Under the influence of these older Chinese students in France, Deng began to study [[Marxism]] and engaged in political dissemination work. In 1921 he joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in Europe. In the second half of 1924, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and became one of the leading members of the General Branch of the Youth League in Europe. In 1926 Deng traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] and studied at [[Moscow Sun Yat-sen University]], where one of his classmates was [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], the son of [[Chiang Kai-shek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=167965&sectioncode=22 |title=Exiled son who saved the state |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=22 March 2002|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Return to China ===\nIn late 1927, Deng left Moscow to return to China, where he joined the army of [[Feng Yuxiang]], a military leader in northwest China, who had requested assistance from the Soviet Union in his struggle with other local leaders in the region. At that time, the Soviet Union, through the [[Comintern]], an international organization supporting the communist movements, supported the Communists' alliance with the Nationalists of the Kuomintang (KMT) party founded by [[Sun Yat-sen]].\n\nHe arrived in [[Xi'an]], the stronghold of Feng Yuxiang, in March 1927. He was part of the [[Fengtian clique]]'s attempt to prevent the break of the alliance between the KMT and the Communists. This split resulted in part from [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s forcing them to flee areas controlled by the KMT. After the breakup of the alliance between communists and nationalists, Feng Yuxiang stood on the side of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists who participated in their army, such as Deng Xiaoping, were forced to flee. In 1929 Deng led the [[Baise Uprising]] in Guangxi province against the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government. The uprising failed and Deng went to the Central Soviet Area in [[Jiangxi]] province.\n\n== Political rise ==\nAlthough Deng got involved in the Marxist revolutionary movement in China, the historian Mobo Gao has argued that \"Deng Xiaoping and many like him [in the Chinese Communist Party] were not really Marxists, but basically revolutionary nationalists who wanted to see China standing on equal terms with the great global powers. They were primarily nationalists and they participated in the Communist revolution because that was the only viable route they could find Chinese nationalism.\"<ref>[[#Gao08|Gao 2008]]. p. 46.</ref>\n\n=== Activism in Shanghai and Wuhan ===\nAfter leaving the army of Feng Yuxiang in the northwest, Deng ended up in the city of [[Wuhan]], where the Communists at that time had their headquarters. At that time, he began using the nickname \"Xiaoping\" and occupied prominent positions in the party apparatus. He participated in the historic emergency session on 7 August 1927 in which, by Soviet instruction, the Party dismissed its founder [[Chen Duxiu]], and [[Qu Qiubai]] became the secretary general. In Wuhan, Deng first established contact with Mao Zedong, who was then little valued by militant pro-Soviet leaders of the party.\n\nBetween 1927 and 1929, Deng lived in Shanghai, where he helped organize protests that would be harshly persecuted by the Kuomintang authorities. The death of many Communist militants in those years led to a decrease in the number of members of the Communist Party, which enabled Deng to quickly move up the ranks. During this stage in Shanghai, Deng married a woman he met in Moscow, Zhang Xiyuan.\n\n=== Military campaign in Guangxi ===\nBeginning in 1929, he participated in the struggle against the Kuomintang in [[Guangxi]]. The superiority of the forces of Chiang Kai-shek caused a huge number of casualties in the Communist ranks. The confrontational strategy of the party leadership was a failure that killed many militants. The response to this defeat catalyzed one of the most confusing episodes in the biography of Deng: in March 1931, he left the Communist Army seventh battalion to appear sometime later in Shanghai.\n\nHis official biography states that Deng had been charged by his superiors with deserting from the battle zone before fleeing to Shanghai, where there were leaders of the underground Communist Party. Although he was not punished in Shanghai, this episode in his biography remains unclear and would be used against him to question his devotion to the Communist Party during the [[Cultural Revolution]] era.\n\n=== At the Jiangxi Soviet ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\n\nAfter returning to Shanghai, Deng discovered that his wife and daughter had died during childbirth. In addition, he discovered that many of his former comrades had died as a result of the Kuomintang's crackdown against the Communists.\n\nThe campaigns against the Communists in the cities represented a setback for the party and in particular to the Comintern Soviet advisers, who saw the mobilization of the urban proletariat as the force for the advancement of communism. Contrary to the urban vision of the revolution, based on the Soviet experience, the Communist leader Mao Zedong saw the rural peasants as the revolutionary force in China. In a mountainous area of Jiangxi province, where Mao went to establish a communist system, there developed the embryo of a future state of China under communism, which adopted the official name of the Chinese Soviet Republic, but was better known as the \"[[Jiangxi Soviet]]\".\n\nIn one of the most important cities in the Soviet zone, [[Ruijin]], Deng took over as secretary of the Party Committee in the summer of 1931. In the winter of 1932, Deng went on to play the same position in the nearby district of [[Huichang County|Huichang]]. In 1933 he became director of the propaganda department of the Provincial Party Committee in Jiangxi. It was then that he married a young woman he had met in Shanghai named Jin Weiying.\n\nThe successes of the Soviet in Jiangxi made the party leaders decide to move to Jiangxi from Shanghai. The confrontation among Mao, the party leaders, and their Soviet advisers was increasingly tense and the struggle for power between the two factions led to the removal of Deng, who favored the ideas of Mao, from his position in the propaganda department. Despite the strife within the party, the Jiangxi Soviet became the first successful experiment of communist rule in rural China. It even issued stamps and paper money under the letterhead of the Soviet Republic of China, and the army of Chiang Kai-shek finally decided to attack the communist area.\n\n=== The Long March ===\n{{Main|Long March}}\n[[File:1937 Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform, 1937]]\nSurrounded by the more powerful army of the Republic of China, the Communists fled Jiangxi in October 1934. Thus began the epic movement that would mark a turning point in the development of Chinese communism. The evacuation was difficult because the Army of the Republic had taken positions in all areas occupied by the Communists. Advancing through remote and mountainous terrain, some 100,000 men managed to escape Jiangxi, starting a long strategic retreat through the interior of China, which ended one year later when between 8,000 and 9,000 survivors reached the northern province of [[Shaanxi]].\n\nDuring the [[Zunyi Conference]] at the beginning of the Long March, the so-called 28 Bolsheviks, led by [[Bo Gu]] and [[Wang Ming]], were ousted from power and Mao Zedong, to the dismay of the Soviet Union, had become the new leader of the Communist Party of China. The pro-Soviet Communist Party of China had ended and a new rural-inspired party emerged under the leadership of Mao. Deng had once again become a leading figure in the party when the north ended up winning the civil war against the Kuomintang.\n\nThe confrontation between the two parties was temporarily interrupted, however, by the Japanese invasion, forcing the Kuomintang to form an alliance for the second time with the Communists to defend the nation against external aggression.\n\n=== Japanese Invasion ===\nThe invasion of Japanese troops in 1937 marked the beginning of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. During the invasion, Deng remained in the area controlled by the Communists in the north, where he assumed the role of deputy political director of the three divisions of the restructured Communist army. From September 1937 until January 1938, he lived in Buddhist monasteries and temples in the [[Wutai Mountains]]. In January 1938, he was appointed as Political Commissar of the 129th division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] commanded by [[Liu Bocheng]], starting a long-lasting partnership with Liu.\n\nDeng stayed for most of the conflict with the Japanese in the war front in the area bordering the provinces of [[Shanxi]], Henan and [[Hebei]], then traveled several times to the city of [[Yan'an]], where Mao had established the basis for Communist Party leadership. In one of his trips to Yan'an in 1939, he married, for the third and last time in his life, Zhuo Lin, a young native of [[Kunming]], who, like other young idealists of the time, had traveled to Yan'an to join the Communists.\n\n=== Resumed war against the Nationalists ===\n[[File:Liudeng.jpg|thumb|Deng with [[Liu Bocheng]] (right)]]\n\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, Deng traveled to Chongqing, the city in which Chiang Kai-shek established his government during the Japanese invasion, to participate in peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The results of those negotiations were not positive and military confrontation between the two antagonistic parties resumed shortly after the meeting in Chongqing.\n\nWhile Chiang Kai-shek re-established the government in Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China, the Communists were fighting for control in the field. Following up with guerrilla tactics from their positions in rural areas against cities under the control of the government of Chiang and their supply lines, the Communists were increasing the territory under their control, and incorporating more and more soldiers who had deserted the Nationalist army.\n\nIn the final phase of the war, Deng again exercised a key role as political leader and propaganda master as Political Commissar of the [[2nd Field Army]] commanded by [[Liu Bocheng]]. He also participated in disseminating the ideas of Mao Zedong, which turned into the ideological foundation of the Communist Party. His political and ideological work, along with his status as a veteran of the Long March, placed him in a privileged position within the party to occupy positions of power after the Communist Party managed to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and founded the People's Republic of China.\n\n== Political career under Mao ==\n{{Communism sidebar}}\n\n=== As Mayor of Chongqing ===\nOn 1 October 1949, Deng attended the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. At that time, the Communist Party controlled the entire north, but there were still parts of the south held by the Kuomintang regime. He became responsible for leading the annexation of southwest China, in his capacity as the first secretary of the Department of the Southwest. This organization had the task of managing the final takeover of that part of the country still held by the Kuomintang; Tibet remained independent for another year.\n\nThe Kuomintang government was being forced to leave [[Guangzhou]], and established [[Chongqing]] as a new provisional capital. There, Chiang Kai-shek and his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], a former classmate of Deng in Moscow, wanted to stop the advance of the Communist Party forces.\n\nUnder the political control of Deng, the Communist army took over Chongqing in late November 1949 and entered Chengdu, the last bastion of power of Chiang Kai-shek, a few days later. At that time Deng became mayor of Chongqing, while he simultaneously was the leader of the Communist Party in the southwest, where the Communist army, now proclaiming itself the [[People's Liberation Army]], suppressed resistance loyal to the old Kuomintang regime. In 1950, the Communist Party-ruled state also seized control over Tibet.\n\nDeng Xiaoping would spend three years in Chongqing, the city where he had studied in his teenage years before going to France. In 1952 he moved to Beijing, where he occupied different positions in the central government.\n\n=== Political rise in Beijing ===\n{{Main|Anti-Rightist Movement|Great Leap Forward}}\n[[File:Dalai-dengxiaoping1954.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping (far left) met with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] (third from left) in 1954.]]\n\nIn July 1952, Deng came to Beijing to assume the posts of Vice Premier and Deputy Chair of the Committee on Finance. Soon after, he took the posts of Minister of Finance and Director of the Office of Communications. In 1954, he was removed from all these positions, holding only the post of Deputy Premier. In 1956, he became Head of the Communist Party's Organization Department and member of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]].\n\nAfter officially supporting Mao Zedong in his [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] of 1957, Deng acted as [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Secretary General of the Secretariat]] and ran the country's daily affairs with President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Deng and Liu's policies emphasized economics over ideological dogma, an implicit departure from the mass hysteria of the Great Leap Forward.\n\nBoth Liu and Deng supported Mao in the mass campaigns of the 1950s, in which they attacked the bourgeois and capitalists, and promoted Mao's ideology. However, the economic failure of the Great Leap Forward was seen as an indictment on the ability of Mao to manage the economy. [[Peng Dehuai]] openly criticized Mao, while Liu Shaoqi and Deng, though more cautious, began to take charge of economic policy, leaving Mao out of day-to-day affairs of the party and state. Mao agreed to cede the presidency of the People's Republic of China (China's ''de jure'' [[head of state]] position) to Liu Shaoqi, while retaining his positions as leader of the party and the army.\n\nIn 1963, Deng traveled to Moscow to lead a meeting of the Chinese delegation with Stalin's successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Relations between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union had worsened since the death of Stalin. After this meeting, no agreement was reached and the [[Sino\u2013Soviet split]] was consummated; there was an almost total suspension of relations between the two major communist powers of the time.\n\nLiu and Deng's economic reforms of the early 1960s were generally popular and restored many of the economic institutions previously dismantled during the Great Leap Forward. Mao, sensing his loss of prestige, took action to regain control of the state. Appealing to his revolutionary spirit, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which encouraged the masses to root out the right-wing capitalists who have \"infiltrated the party\". Deng was labelled the second-in-command of the \"capitalist-roaders\" faction (''Zouzipai'').\n\n=== Target of two purges ===\n{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}\n\n==== Cultural Revolution ====\n[[File:Zhou Li Deng.jpg|thumb|left|Deng Xiaoping (left) with future president [[Li Xiannian]] (center) and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1963.]]\nMao feared that the [[reformist]] economic policies of Deng and Liu could lead to restoration of capitalism and end the Chinese Revolution.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news | author=Minqi Li | title=Socialism, capitalism, and class struggle: The Political economy of Modern china | work = Economic & Political Weekly | date=December 2008}}</ref> For this and other reasons, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1966, during which Deng fell out of favor and was forced to retire from all his positions.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, he and his family were targeted by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], who imprisoned Deng's eldest son, [[Deng Pufang]]. Deng Pufang was tortured and jumped out, or was thrown out, of the window of a four-story building in 1968, becoming a [[paraplegic]]. In October 1969 Deng Xiaoping was sent to the Xinjian County Tractor Factory in rural Jiangxi province to work as a regular worker.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/10/content_6142550_5.htm |title= Deng Xiaoping \u2212 The Years of Hardship and Danger | publisher=People.com.cn | date=10 July 2007}}</ref> In his four years there,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.newsgd.com/specials/deng100thbirthanniversary/newspictures/200407280046.htm | title=Film makers flock to tractor factory to shoot Deng's stories | publisher=News Guandong | date=26 July 2004}}</ref> Deng spent his spare time writing. He was purged nationally, but to a lesser scale than President [[Liu Shaoqi]].\n\nAfter [[Lin Biao]] was killed in an air crash (according to official reports he was trying to flee from China after unsuccessfully trying to stage a coup against Mao), Deng Xiaoping (who had been political commissar of the 2nd Field Army during the civil war) became the most influential of the remaining army leaders.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> When Premier Zhou Enlai fell ill with cancer, Deng became Zhou's choice as successor, and Zhou was able to convince Mao to bring Deng back into politics in 1974 as First Vice-Premier, in practice running daily affairs. Deng focused on reconstructing the country's economy and stressed unity as the first step by raising production.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He remained careful, however, to avoid contradicting Maoist ideology, at least on paper.\n\n[[File:Gerald and Betty Ford meet with Deng Xiaoping, 1975 A7598-20A.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping (centre) with U.S. president [[Gerald Ford]] (left), 1975.]]\n\nDuring his brief-ascendency, Deng established the Political Research Office, headed by intellectuals [[Hu Qiaomu]], [[Yu Guangyuan]] and [[Hu Sheng]], delegated to explore approaches to political and economic reforms. He led the group himself and managed the project within the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], in order to avoid rousing the suspicions of the [[Gang of Four]].\n\nThe Cultural Revolution was not yet over, and a radical leftist political group known as the [[Gang of Four]], led by Mao's wife [[Jiang Qing]], competed for power within the Party. The Gang saw Deng as their greatest challenge to power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4910.html |title=Deng Rong's Memoirs: Chpt 49 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227130702/http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4910.html |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}</ref> Mao, too, was suspicious that Deng would destroy the positive reputation of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao considered one of his greatest policy initiatives. Beginning in late 1975, Deng was asked to draw up a series of [[self-criticism]]s. Although he admitted to having taken an \"inappropriate ideological perspective\" while dealing with state and party affairs, he was reluctant to admit that his policies were wrong in essence. His antagonism with the Gang of Four became increasingly clear, and Mao seemed to sway in the Gang's favour. Mao refused to accept Deng's self-criticisms and asked the party's Central Committee to \"discuss Deng's mistakes thoroughly\".\n\n==== 'Criticize Deng' campaign ====\nZhou Enlai died in January 1976, to an outpouring of national grief. Zhou was a very important figure in Deng's political life, and his death eroded his remaining support within the Party's Central Committee. After delivering Zhou's official eulogy at the state funeral, the Gang of Four, with Mao's permission, began the so-called ''Criticize Deng and Oppose the Rehabilitation of Right-leaning Elements'' campaign. [[Hua Guofeng]], not Deng, was selected to become Zhou's successor.\n\nOn 2 February 1976, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] issued a Top-Priority Directive, officially transferring Deng to work on \"external affairs\" and thus removing Deng from the party's power apparatus. Deng stayed at home for several months, awaiting his fate. The Political Research Office was promptly dissolved, and Deng's advisers such as [[Yu Guangyuan]] suspended. As a result, the political turmoil halted the economic progress Deng had laboured for in the past year.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} On 3 March, Mao issued a directive reaffirming the legitimacy of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and specifically pointed to Deng as an internal, rather than external, problem.

Furthermore, the Gang deemed Deng the mastermind behind the incident, and Mao himself wrote that \"the nature of things has changed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4916.html |title=Deng Rong's Memoirs: Chapter 53 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227130647/http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4916.html |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}</ref> This prompted Mao to remove Deng from all leadership positions, although he retained his party membership.\n\n== Re-emergence post-Cultural Revolution ==\nFollowing Mao's death on 9 September 1976 and the purge of the [[Gang of Four]] in October 1976, Deng gradually emerged as the ''de facto'' leader of China.

In contrast to previous leadership changes, Deng allowed Hua to retain membership in the Central Committee and quietly retire, helping to set the precedent that losing a high-level leadership struggle would not result in physical harm.\n\nDeng repudiated the Cultural Revolution and, in 1977, launched the \"[[Beijing Spring]]\", which allowed open criticism of the excesses and suffering that had occurred during the period. Meanwhile, he was the impetus for the abolition of the class background system. Under this system, the CPC removed employment barriers to Chinese deemed to be associated with the former landlord class; its removal allowed a faction favoring the restoration of the private market to enter the Communist Party.\n\nDeng gradually outmaneuvered his political opponents. By encouraging public criticism of the Cultural Revolution, he weakened the position of those who owed their political positions to that event, while strengthening the position of those like himself who had been purged during that time. Deng also received a great deal of popular support. As Deng gradually consolidated control over the CPC, Hua was replaced by [[Zhao Ziyang]] as premier in 1980, and by [[Hu Yaobang]] as party chief in 1981, despite the fact that Hua was Mao Zedong's designated successor as the \"paramount leader\" of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China.\n\nImportant decisions were always taken in Deng's home with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called \"[[Eight Elders]]\", especially with [[Chen Yun]] and [[Li Xiannian]]. Deng ruled as \"paramount leader\" although he never held the top title of the party, and was able to successively remove three party leaders, including Hu Yaobang.<ref name=scmp20120420xiang>Xiang, Lanxin (20 April 2012). \"Bo Xilai probe shows up China's outdated system of government\". ''South China Morning Post''</ref> Deng remained the most influential of the CPC cadre, although after 1987 his only official posts were as chairman of the state and Communist Party Central Military Commissions.\n\nDeng's elevation to China's new number-one figure meant that the historical and ideological questions around Mao Zedong had to be addressed properly. Because Deng wished to pursue deep reforms, it was not possible for him to continue Mao's hard-line \"class struggle\" policies and mass public campaigns. In 1982 the Central Committee of the Communist Party released a document entitled ''On the Various Historical Issues since the Founding of the People's Republic of China''. Mao retained his status as a \"great Marxist, proletarian revolutionary, militarist, and general\", and the undisputed founder and pioneer of the country and the [[People's Liberation Army]]. \"His accomplishments must be considered before his mistakes\", the document declared. Deng personally commented that Mao was \"seven parts good, three parts bad.\" The document also steered the prime responsibility of the Cultural Revolution away from Mao (although it did state that \"Mao mistakenly began the Cultural Revolution\") to the \"counter-revolutionary cliques\" of the Gang of Four and [[Lin Biao]].\n\n=== Opening up ===\n[[File:Visit of Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping to Johnson Space Center - GPN-2002-000077.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping (left) and his wife Zhuo Lin (right) are briefed by [[Johnson Space Center]] director [[Christopher C.

Deng was very impressed with Singapore's economic development, greenery and housing, and later sent tens of thousands of Chinese to Singapore and countries around the world to learn from their experiences and bring back their knowledge. Lee, on the other hand, advised Deng to stop exporting Communist ideologies to Southeast Asia, advice that Deng later followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://app.mfa.gov.sg/2006/press/view_press_print.asp?post_id=1538 |title=MFA, Singapore Press Release |publisher=App.mfa.gov.sg |date=29 December 2005|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Lee Kuan Yew, ''From Third World to First: The Singapore Story, 1965\u20132000, Volume 2'', (HarperCollins: 2000), pp. 595\u2013603</ref>\n\nThanks to the support of other party leaders who had already recovered their official positions, in 1978 the rise to power of Deng was inevitable. Even though Hua Guofeng formally monopolized the top positions in the People's Republic, his position, with little support, was becoming increasingly difficult. In December 1978, during the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee Congress of the Communist Party of China]], Deng took over the reins of power.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Guangyuan|title=Deng Xiaoping Shakes the World: An Eyewitness Account of China's Party Work Conference and the Third Plenum (November-December 1978)|date=2004|publisher=EastBridge|isbn=978-1891936531}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1979, the economic reforms accelerated the market model, while the leaders maintained old Communist-style rhetoric. The commune system was gradually dismantled and the peasants began to have more freedom to manage the land they cultivated and sell their products on the market. At the same time, China's economy opened up to foreign trade. On January 1, 1979, the United States recognized the People's Republic of China, leaving the (Taiwan) Republic of China's nationalist government to one side, and business contacts between China and the West began to grow. In late 1978, the aerospace company [[Boeing]] announced the sale of [[Boeing 747|747 aircraft]] to various airlines in the PRC, and the beverage company [[Coca-Cola]] made public their intention to open a production plant in Shanghai.\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony for the Vice Premier of China. - NARA - 183157-restored.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping and [[Jimmy Carter]] at the arrival ceremony.]]\n\nIn early 1979, Deng undertook an official visit to the United States, meeting President Jimmy Carter in Washington as well as several Congressmen. The Chinese insisted that former President [[Richard Nixon]] be invited to the formal White House reception, a symbolic indication of their assertiveness on the one hand, and their desire to continue with the Nixon initiatives on the other. During the visit, Deng visited the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], as well as the headquarters of Coca-Cola and Boeing in [[Atlanta]] and [[Seattle]], respectively. With these visits so significant, Deng made it clear that the new Chinese regime's priorities were economic and technological development.\n\n[[People's Republic of China\u2013Japan relations|Sino-Japanese relations]] also improved significantly.<ref>(Article 2) \"The Contracting Parties declare that neither of them should seek [[hegemony]] in the Asia-Pacific region or in any other region and that each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony.\" [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/treaty78.html MOFA: Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China]</ref> Deng used Japan as an example of a rapidly progressing power that set a good example for China economically.\n\nTrue to his famous July 1962 pronouncement at the Communist youth league conference,<ref>{{cite news|title=In quotes : Deng Xiaoping|url=http://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-08/20/content_18453599.htm|accessdate=24 October 2017|publisher=Peoples Daily, China|date=20 August 2014}}</ref> \"[[Deng Xiaoping Theory|it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, if it catches mice it is a good cat\"]], which had caused so much criticism, Deng, along with his closest collaborators, such as [[Zhao Ziyang]], who in 1980 relieved Hua Guofeng as premier, and [[Hu Yaobang]], who in 1981 did the same with the post of party chairman, took the reins of power and the purpose of advancing the \"four modernizations\" (economy, agriculture, scientific and technological development and national defense), and announced an ambitious plan of opening and liberalizing the economy.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite news|title=In quotes - Deng Xiaoping|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-08/20/content_18453523.htm|accessdate=26 June 2017|newspaper=China Daily|date=20 August 2014}}</ref><ref>Fengbo Zhang</ref> The last position of power retained by Hua Guofeng, chairman of the Central Military Commission, was taken by Deng in 1981.<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|title=Reformer with an iron fist|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/china.50/inside.china/profiles/deng.xiaoping/|accessdate=26 June 2017|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Deng Thatcher 4.JPG|thumb|A model reconstruction of Deng Xiaoping's 1984 meeting with UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], Shenzhen.]]\n\nFrom 1980 onwards, Deng led the expansion of the economy and in political terms, took over negotiations with the United Kingdom to [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|return the territory of Hong Kong]], meeting personally with then-Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The result of these negotiations was the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], signed on 19 December 1984, which formally outlined the United Kingdom's return of Hong Kong to China by 1997. The Chinese government pledged to respect the economic system and civil liberties of the British colony for fifty years after the handover.\n\nIn 1987, Portugal, under pressure from the Chinese authorities, agreed to arrange the return of [[Macau]] by 1999, with an agreement roughly equal to that of Hong Kong. The return of these two territories was based on political principle formulated by Deng himself called \"[[one country, two systems]]\", which refers to the co-existence under one political authority areas with different economic systems of communism and capitalism. Although this theory was applied to the cases of Hong Kong and Macau, it seems that Deng intended to also present it as an attractive option to the people of [[Taiwan]] for eventual incorporation of that island; where sovereignty over the territory is disputed to the present day.\n\nChina's rapid economic growth presented several problems. The 1982 census revealed the extraordinary growth of the population, which already exceeded  1,000,000,000 people. Deng continued the plans initiated by Hua Guofeng to [[One-child policy|restrict birth to only one child]], limiting women to one child under pain of administrative penalty.<ref>Cited by Graziella Caselli, Gillaume Wunsch, Jacques Vallin in Demography: Analysis and Synthesis, Four Volume Set: A Treatise in Population, Volume 1, Oxford, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-12-765660-1}}</ref> Around this time, Deng launched his first \u201cstrike hard\u201d anti-crime campaign in August 1983.

In the late-1980s, dissatisfaction with the authoritarian regime and the growing inequalities caused the biggest crisis to Deng's leadership.\n\nIn October 1987, at the Plenary Session of the National People's Congress, Deng was re-elected as Chairman of [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]], but he resigned as Chairman of the [[Central Advisory Commission]] and he was succeeded by [[Chen Yun]]. He continued to chair and developed the reform and opening up as the main policy, put forward the three steps suitable for China's economic development strategy within seventy years: the first step, to double the 1980 GNP and ensure that the people have enough food and clothing, was attained by the end of the 1980s; second step, to quadruple the 1980 GNP by the end of the 20th century, was achieved in 1995 ahead of schedule; the third step, to increase per capita GNP to the level of the medium-developed countries by 2050, at which point, the Chinese people will be fairly well-off and modernization will be basically realized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/38199.htm|title=The Three-Step Development Strategy|publisher=china.org.cn|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nDeng, however, did little to improve relations with the Soviet Union; he continued to adhere the [[Maoism|Maoist]] line of the [[Sino\u2013Soviet split]] era that the Soviet Union was a superpower as \"hegemonic\" as the United States, but even more threatening to China because of its close proximity.<ref>Cited by Michael E. Marti in ''China and the Legacy of Deng Xiaoping'', p. 19, Brassy's Inc., United States, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57488-416-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic reforms ===\n{{Main|Chinese economic reform|Socialist market economy}}\n\nImproving relations with the outside world was the second of two important philosophical shifts outlined in Deng's program of reform termed ''Gaige Kaifang'' (''lit.'' Reforms and Openness). China's domestic social, political, and most notably, economic systems would undergo significant changes during Deng's time. The goals of Deng's reforms were summed up by the [[Four Modernizations]], those of agriculture, industry, science and technology, and the military.\n\nThe strategy for achieving these aims of becoming a modern, industrial nation was the [[socialist market economy]]. Deng argued that China was in the [[primary stage of socialism]] and that the duty of the party was to perfect so-called \"[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]\", and \"[[seek truth from facts]]\". (This somewhat resembles the Leninist theoretical justification of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in the 1920s, which argued that the [[Soviet Union]] had not gone deeply enough into the capitalist phase and therefore needed limited capitalism in order to fully evolve its means of production.)\n\nThis interpretation of Maoism reduced the role of ideology in economic decision-making. Downgrading communitarian values, but not necessarily criticising the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]], Deng emphasized that \"socialism does not mean shared poverty\". His theoretical justification for allowing market forces was given as such:\n\n<blockquote>\"Planning and market forces are not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. A planned economy is not the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too. Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity.\"<ref>Cited by John Gittings in ''The Changing Face of China'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-280612-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnlike [[Hua Guofeng]], Deng believed that no policy should be rejected outright simply because it was not associated with Mao. Unlike more conservative leaders such as [[Chen Yun]], Deng did not object to policies on the grounds that they were similar to ones that were found in capitalist nations.\n\nThis political flexibility towards the foundations of socialism is strongly supported by quotes such as:\n\n{{quote|We mustn't fear to adopt the advanced management methods applied in capitalist countries (...) The very essence of socialism is the liberation and development of the productive systems (...) Socialism and market economy are not incompatible (...) We should be concerned about right-wing deviations, but most of all, we must be concerned about left-wing deviations.<ref>Cited by Ant\u00f3nio Caeiro in ''Pela China Dentro'' (translated), Dom Quixote, Lisboa, 2004. {{ISBN|972-20-2696-8}}</ref>}}\n\nAlthough Deng provided the theoretical background and the political support to allow economic reform to occur, the general consensus amongst historians is that few of the economic reforms that Deng introduced were originated by Deng himself. Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], for example, pioneered the Four Modernizations years before Deng. In addition, many reforms would be introduced by local leaders, often not sanctioned by central government directives. If successful and promising, these reforms would be adopted by larger and larger areas and ultimately introduced nationally. An often cited example is the [[household responsibility system]], which was first secretly implemented by a poor rural village at the risk of being convicted as \"counter-revolutionary.\" This experiment proved very successful.<ref>Dali Yang, Calamity and Reform in China, Stanford University Press, 1996</ref> Deng openly supported it and it was later adopted nationally. Many other reforms were influenced by the experiences of the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian Tigers]].<ref>Cited by David Shambaugh in ''Deng Xiaoping: portrait of a Chinese statesman'', Oxford University, Oxford, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-828933-2}}</ref>\n\nThis is in sharp contrast to the pattern in the ''[[perestroika]]'' undertaken by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in which most of the major reforms were originated by Gorbachev himself. The bottom-up approach of the Deng reforms, in contrast to the top-down approach of ''perestroika'', was likely a key factor in the success of the former.<ref>Cited by Susan L. Shirk in ''The Political Logic of Economic Reform in China'', University of California, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1993. {{ISBN|0-520-07706-7}}</ref>\n\nDeng's reforms actually included the introduction of planned, centralized management of the macro-economy by technically proficient bureaucrats, abandoning Mao's mass campaign style of economic construction. However, unlike the Soviet model, management was indirect through market mechanisms. Deng sustained Mao's legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households. At the local level, material incentives, rather than political appeals, were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots at free market.\n\n==== Export focus ====\nIn the move toward market allocation, local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable, which encouraged investment in light manufacturing. Thus, Deng's reforms shifted China's development strategy to an emphasis on light industry and [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]]. Light industrial output was vital for a developing country coming from a low capital base. With the short gestation period, low capital requirements, and high foreign-exchange export earnings, revenues generated by light manufacturing were able to be reinvested in technologically more advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments.\n\nHowever, in sharp contrast to the similar, but much less successful reforms in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], these investments were not government mandated. The capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system, and most of that capital came from consumer deposits. One of the first items of the Deng reforms was to prevent reallocation of profits except through taxation or through the banking system; hence, the reallocation in state-owned industries was somewhat indirect, thus making them more or less independent from government interference. In short, Deng's reforms sparked an industrial revolution in China.<ref>FlorCruz, Jaime (19 December 2008) [http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/12/18/china.reform.florcruz/index.html \"Looking back over China's last 30 years\"] ''CNN''</ref>\n\nThese reforms were a reversal of the Maoist policy of economic self-reliance. China decided to accelerate the modernization process by stepping up the volume of foreign trade, especially the purchase of machinery from Japan and the West. By participating in such export-led growth, China was able to step up the Four Modernizations by attaining certain foreign funds, market, advanced technologies and management experiences, thus accelerating its economic development. Deng attracted foreign companies to a series of [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic Zones]], where foreign investment and market liberalization were encouraged.\n\nThe reforms sought to improve labor productivity. New material incentives and bonus systems were introduced. Rural markets selling peasants' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived. Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well. With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization as well and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms.\n\nThere are some parallels between Deng's [[market socialism]] especially in the early stages, and [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s NEP as well as those of [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s economic policies, in that both foresaw a role for private entrepreneurs and markets based on trade and pricing rather than central planning. An interesting anecdote on this note is the first meeting between Deng and [[Armand Hammer]]. Deng pressed the industrialist and former investor in Lenin's Soviet Union for as much information on the NEP as possible.\n\n=== Role in the Tiananmen Square protests ===\n{{Main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, culminating in the June Fourth Massacre, were a series of demonstrations in and near Tiananmen Square in the People's Republic of China (PRC) between 15 April and 4 June 1989, a year in which many other [[Revolutions of 1989|socialist governments collapsed]].\n\nThe protests were sparked by the death of [[Hu Yaobang]], a reformist official backed by Deng but ousted by the [[Eight Elders]] and the conservative wing of the politburo. Many people were dissatisfied with the party's slow response and relatively subdued funeral arrangements. Public mourning began on the streets of Beijing and universities in the surrounding areas. In Beijing this was centered on the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in Tiananmen Square. The mourning became a public conduit for anger against perceived nepotism in the government, the unfair dismissal and early death of Hu, and the behind-the-scenes role of the \"old men\". By the eve of Hu's funeral, the demonstration had reached 100,000 people on Tiananmen Square. While the protests lacked a unified cause or leadership, participants raised the issue of corruption within the government and some voiced calls for economic liberalization<ref name=\"nathan\" /> and democratic reform<ref name=\"nathan\">{{cite web|first=Andrew J. |last=Nathan |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |title=The Tiananmen Papers |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=January\u2013February 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219055135/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |archivedate=19 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> within the structure of the government while others called for a less authoritarian and less centralized form of socialism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialanarchism.org/mod/magazine/display/32/index.php |title=Voices for Tiananmen Square: Beijing Spring and the Democracy Movement |publisher=Socialanarchism.org |date=8 February 2006|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref><ref>Palmer, Bob (8 February 2006).

China, however, was still in the ''era of Deng Xiaoping''. He continued to be widely regarded as the \"[[paramount leader]]\" of the country, believed to have backroom control. Deng was recognized officially as \"the chief architect of China's economic reforms and China's socialist modernization\". To the Communist Party, he was believed to have set a good example for communist cadres who refused to retire at old age. He broke earlier conventions of holding offices for life. He was often referred to as simply ''Comrade Xiaoping'', with no title attached.\n[[File:DengXiaoPingNanXunJunJian.jpg|thumb|A patrol boat in use during Deng Xiaoping's southern tour.]]\n\nBecause of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], Deng's power had been significantly weakened and there was a growing formalist faction opposed to Deng's reforms within the Communist Party. To reassert his economic agenda, in the spring of 1992, Deng made his famous southern tour of China, visiting [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Zhuhai]] and spending the New Year in Shanghai, using his travels as a method of reasserting his economic policy after his retirement from office.\n\nOn his tour, Deng made various speeches and generated large local support for his reformist platform. He stressed the importance of economic reform in China, and criticized those who were against further reform and opening up. Although there was a debate on whether or not Deng actually said it,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Iritani |first=Evelyn |date=9 September 2004 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/689588251.html?dids=689588251:689588251&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+9%2C+2004&author=Evelyn+Iritani&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=COLUMN+ONE%3B+Great+Idea+but+Don%27t+Quote+Him%3B+Deng+Xiaoping%27s+famous+one-liner+started+China+on+the+way+to+capitalism.+The+only+problem+is+there%27s+no+proof+he+actually+said+it |title=Great Idea but Don't Quote Him; Deng Xiaoping's famous one-liner started China on the way to capitalism. The only problem is there's no proof he actually said it. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=A1 |via=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> his perceived catchphrase, \"To get rich is glorious\" (\u81f4\u5bcc\u5149\u8363), unleashed a wave of personal entrepreneurship that continues to drive China's economy today. He stated that the \"leftist\" elements of Chinese society were much more dangerous than \"rightist\" ones. Deng was instrumental in the development of Shanghai's [[Pudong]] New Area, revitalizing the city as China's economic hub.\n\nHis southern tour was at first ignored by the Beijing and national media, which were then under the control of Deng's political rivals. [[Jiang Zemin]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] since 1989, showed little support. Challenging their media control, Shanghai's ''[[Jiefang Daily|Liberation Daily]]'' newspaper published several articles supporting reforms authored by \"Huangfu Ping\", which quickly gained support amongst local officials and populace. Deng's new wave of policy rhetoric gave way to a new political storm between factions in the Politburo. Jiang eventually sided with Deng, and the national media finally reported Deng's southern tour several months after it occurred. Observers suggest that Jiang's submission to Deng's policies had solidified his position as Deng's heir apparent. Behind the scenes, Deng's southern tour aided his reformist allies' climb to the apex of national power, and permanently changed China's direction toward economic development. In addition, the eventual outcome of the southern tour proved that Deng was still the most powerful man in China.<ref>Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour: Elite Politics in Post-Tiananmen China, Suisheng Zhao,\nAsian Survey 1993 University of California Press</ref>\n\nDeng's insistence on economic openness aided in the phenomenal growth levels of the coastal areas, especially the \"[[Yangtze River Delta|Golden Triangle]]\" region surrounding Shanghai. Deng reiterated that \"some areas must get rich before others\", and asserted that the wealth from coastal regions will eventually be transferred to aid economic construction inland. The theory, however, faced numerous challenges when put into practice, as provincial governments moved to protect their own interests.\n\n== Death and reaction ==\n[[File:Deng Funeral.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping's ashes lie in state in Beijing, February 1997. The banner reads ''Memorial Service of Comrade Deng Xiaoping''.]]\nDeng died on 19 February 1997, aged 92 from a lung infection and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Even though his successor Jiang Zemin was in firm control, government policies maintained Deng's [[Deng Xiaoping Theory|political and economic philosophies]]. Officially, Deng was eulogized as a \"great Marxist, great Proletarian Revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, and diplomat; one of the main leaders of the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China, and the People's Republic of China; The great architect of China's socialist opening-up and modernized construction; the founder of [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]]\".<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9702/24/china.deng/ CNN: China officially mourns Deng Xiaoping] 24 February 1997</ref>\n\nAlthough the public was largely prepared for Deng's death, as rumors had been circulating for a long time, the death of Deng was followed by the greatest publicly sanctioned display of grief for any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. However, in contrast, Deng's death in the media was announced without any titles attached (Mao was called the Great Leader and teacher, Deng was simply \"[[Comrade]]\"), or any emotional overtones from the news anchors that delivered the message.\n\nAt 10:00 on the morning of 24 February, people were asked by Premier Li Peng to pause in silence for three minutes. The nation's flags flew at [[half-mast]] for over a week. The nationally televised funeral, which was a simple and relatively private affair attended by the country's leaders and Deng's family, was broadcast on all cable channels. Jiang's tearful eulogy to the late reformist leader declared, \"The Chinese people love, thank, mourn and cherish the memory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping because he devoted his life-long energies to the Chinese people, performed immortal feats for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation.\" Jiang vowed to continue Deng's policies.\n\nAfter the funeral, his organs were donated to medical research, the remains were cremated, and his ashes were subsequently scattered at sea, according to his wishes. For the next two weeks, Chinese state media ran news stories and documentaries related to Deng's life and death, with the regular 19:00 ''[[Xinwen Lianbo|National News]]'' program in the evening lasting almost two hours over the regular broadcast time.\n\nCertain segments of the Chinese population, notably the modern Maoists and radical reformers (the far left and the far right), had negative views on Deng. In the year that followed, songs like \"[[Story of Spring]]\" by [[Dong Wenhua]], which were created in Deng's honour shortly after Deng's southern tour in 1992, once again were widely played.\n\nThere was a significant amount of international reaction to Deng's death: UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] said Deng was to be remembered \"in the international community at large as a primary architect of China's modernization and dramatic economic development\". French President [[Jacques Chirac]] said \"In the course of this century, few men have, as much as Deng, led a vast human community through such profound and determining changes\"; British Prime Minister [[John Major]] commented about Deng's key role in the return of Hong Kong to Chinese control; Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] called Deng a \"pivotal figure\" in Chinese history. The [[Kuomintang]] chair in Taiwan also sent its condolences, saying it longed for peace, cooperation, and prosperity. The [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] voiced regret.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9702/19/deng.world.reax/index.html CNN:World leaders praise Deng's economic legacy] 24 February 1997</ref>\n\n== Memorials ==\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping statue in Shenzhen.JPG|thumb|Statue of Deng in [[Shenzhen]]]]\nWhen compared to the memorials of other CPC leaders, those dedicated to Deng have been low profile, in keeping with Deng's image of pragmatism. Moreover, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea, as opposed to being embalmed like Mao.\n\nThere are a few public displays of Deng in the country. A bronze statue of Deng was erected on 14 November 2000, at the grand plaza of [[Lianhuashan Park|Lianhua Mountain Park]] in [[Shenzhen]]. This statue is dedicated to Deng's role as a planner and contributor to the development of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, starting in 1979. The statue is {{Convert|6|m|ft|0}} high, with an additional 3.68-meter base. The statue shows Deng striding forward confidently. Many CPC high level leaders visit the statue. In addition, in coastal areas and on the island province of [[Hainan]], Deng is seen on roadside billboards with messages emphasizing economic reform or his policy of [[one country, two systems]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\">\nFile:Deng Xiaoping billboard 01.jpg|Deng Xiaoping billboard in [[Shenzhen]]\nFile:Deng Xiaoping billboard 06.jpg|Deng Xiaoping billboard in [[Qingdao]]\nFile:Deng Xiaoping billboard 08.JPG|Deng Xiaoping billboard in [[Dujiangyan]], Sichuan\nFile:Deng Xiaoping billboard 10.JPG|Deng Xiaoping billboard in [[Lijiang]], Yunnan\n</gallery>\n\nAnother bronze statue of Deng was dedicated 13 August 2004 in the city of [[Guang'an]], Deng's hometown, in southwest China's [[Sichuan]] Province. The statue was erected to commemorate Deng's 100th birthday. The statue shows Deng, dressed casually, sitting on a chair and smiling. The Chinese characters for \"Statue of Deng Xiaoping\" are inscribed on the pedestal. The original calligraphy was written by Jiang, then Chairman of the Central Military Commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/14/content_365434.htm |title=China Daily article \"Deng Xiaoping statue unveiled\" |work=China Daily |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Deng Xiaoping's Former Residence]] in his hometown of Paifang Village in [[Sichuan]] province has been preserved as a museum telling Deng's life story.\n\nIn [[Bishkek]], capital of the Republic of [[Kyrgyzstan]], there is a six-lane boulevard, {{Convert|25|m|ft|0}} wide and {{Convert|3.5|km|mi|0}} long, the ''Deng Xiaoping Prospekt'', which was dedicated on 18 June 1997.

[[Princetown, England|Princetown]], high on [[Dartmoor]] in the English county of [[Devon]]. Its high [[granite]] walls dominate this area of the [[moorland|moor]]. The prison is owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], and is operated by [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1805, Great Britain was at [[Napoleonic Wars|war with Napoleonic France]], a conflict during which thousands of prisoners were taken and confined in prison \"hulks\" or derelict ships. This was considered unsafe, partially due to the proximity of the Royal Naval dockyard at [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]] (then called Plymouth Dock), and as living conditions were appalling in the extreme, a prisoner of war depot was planned in the remote isolation of Dartmoor. Construction started in 1806, taking three years to complete. In 1809 the first French prisoners arrived, and were joined by American POWs taken in the [[War of 1812]]. At one time the prison population numbered almost 6,000. By July 1815 at least 270 Americans and 1,200 French prisoners had died. <ref>{{cite book |last= Adkins |first = Roy |last2= Adkins |first2 = Lesley |title= The War for All Oceans |location= London |publisher= Abacus |date=2007 |page= 460 |isbn= 978-0-349-11916-8}}</ref> Both French and American wars were concluded in 1815, and repatriations began. The prison then lay empty until 1850, when it was largely rebuilt and commissioned as a convict gaol. After originally being buried on the moor, due to the establishment of the prison farm in about 1852, all the prisoners' remains were exhumed and re-interred in two cemeteries behind the prison.\n\n===Early history===\nDesigned by [[Daniel Asher Alexander]] and constructed originally between 1806 and 1809 by local labour, to hold prisoners of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was also used to hold American prisoners from the [[War of 1812]]. Although the war ended with the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in December 1814, many American [[prisoners of war]] still remained in Dartmoor.\n\nFrom the spring of 1813 until March 1815 about 6,500 American sailors were imprisoned at Dartmoor. These were naval prisoners, and impressed American seamen discharged from British vessels. Whilst the British were in charge of the prison, the prisoners created their own governance and culture. They had courts which meted out punishments, there was an in-prison market, a theatre and a gambling room. About 1,000 of the prisoners were black Americans.<ref>1812: War with America, Jon Latimer, Harvard University Press, 2007 p. 239</ref><ref name=ea>{{Americana|wstitle=Dartmoor Massacre, The|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nAfter the prisoners heard of the Peace of Ghent, they expected immediate release, but the British government refused to let them go on parole or take any steps until the treaty was ratified by the [[United States Senate]], 17 February 1815. It took several weeks for the American agent to secure ships for their transportation home, and the men grew very impatient. On 4 April, a food contractor attempted to work off some damaged hardtack on them in place of soft bread and was forced to yield by their insurrection. The commandant, Captain T. G. Shortland, suspected them of a design to break out of the gaol. This was the reverse of the truth in general, as they would lose their chance of going on the ships, but a few had made threats of the sort, and the commandant was very uneasy.<ref name=ea/>\n\nAbout 6:00 pm of the 6th, Shortland discovered a hole from one of the five prisons to the barrack yard near the gun racks. Some prisoners were outside the fence, noisily pelting each other with turf, and many more were near the breach (and the gambling tables), though the signal for return to prisons had sounded. Shortland was convinced of a plot, and rang the alarm bell to collect the officers and have the men ready. This precaution brought back a crowd just going to quarters. Just then a prisoner broke a gate chain with an iron bar and a number of the prisoners pressed through to the prison market square. After attempts at persuasion, Shortland ordered a charge which drove some of the prisoners in. Those near the gate, however, hooted at and taunted the soldiery, who fired a volley over their heads. The crowd yelled louder and threw stones, and the soldiers, probably without orders, fired a direct volley which killed and wounded a large number. Then they continued firing at the prisoners, many of whom were now struggling to get back inside the blocks.<ref name=ea/>\n\nFinally the captain, a lieutenant and the hospital surgeon (the other officers being at dinner) succeeded in stopping the shooting and caring for the wounded \u2013 about 60, 30 seriously, besides seven killed outright. The affair was examined by a joint commission, Charles King for the United States and F. S. Larpent for Great Britain, which exonerated Shortland, justified the initial shooting and blamed the subsequent deaths on unknown culprits. The British government provided for the families of the killed, pensioned the disabled and promoted Shortland.<ref name=ea/>\n\nA memorial has been erected to the 271 [[POW]]s (mostly [[United States Navy|seamen]]) who are buried in the prison grounds.\n\nDartmoor was reopened in 1851 as a civilian prison, but was closed again in 1917, when it was converted into a Home Office Work Centre for certain [[conscientious objectors]] granted release from prison; cells were unlocked, inmates wore their own clothes, and could visit the village in their off-duty time. It was reopened as a prison in 1920, and then contained some of Britain's most serious offenders.\n\n===Dartmoor mutiny===\n[[Image:Dartmoor Prison entrance.jpg|right|thumb|Main gates of Dartmoor Prison]]\nOn 24 January 1932, there was a major disturbance at the prison. The cause of the riots is generally attributed to the food, not generally but just on specific days when it was suspected it had been tampered with prior to the disturbance.<ref>Fitzgerald, M. (1977) ''Prisoners in Revolt'', Harmondsworth: Penguin pg.123</ref> There had also been other instances of disobedience prior to this, according to the official Du Parcq report into the incident such as a model prisoner attacking a popular guard with a razor blade and rough treatment of a prisoner being removed to solitary.<ref>Fitzgerald, M. (1977) ''Prisoners In Revolt'', Harmondsworth: Penguin pg.124</ref> At the parade later that day, 50 prisoners refused orders, and the rest were marched back to their cells but refused to enter. At this point, the prison governor and his staff fled to an unused part of the prison and secured themselves in there. The prisoners then released those held in solitary. There was extensive damage to property and a prisoner was shot by one of the staff but no prison staff were injured.<ref>Fitzgerald, M. (1977) ''Prisoners In Revolt'', Harmondsworth: Penguin pg.124-5</ref> According to Fitzgerald (1977) \"Reinforcements arrived, and within fifteen minutes these 'vicious brutes', who for some two hours had terrorized well-armed prison staff, and effectively controlled the prison, had surrendered and been locked up again\".<ref>Fitzgerald, M.

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilot|backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character. Together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] the previous day.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|title=An Unearthly Child|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2012}}</ref> It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> \n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]]s were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]]. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]], controller of BBC 1.<ref name=\"powell\">{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,1511487,00.html|title=Doctor Who makes the Grade|first=Jason|last=Deans|work=The Guardian|quote=But Mr Grade was not at the helm when Doctor Who was finally retired for good in 1989&nbsp;\u2014 that decision fell to the then BBC1 controller, Jonathan Powell.|date=21 June 2005|accessdate=4 February 2007|location=London}}</ref> Although it was effectively [[cancellation (television)|cancelled]] with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed that the series would return.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\"/>\n\nWhile in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. [[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th series was still in production.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\">Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Panini Comics 2003</ref> Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]], broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as an [[international co-production]] between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC and [[BBC Worldwide]]. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1&nbsp;million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\" />\n\nLicensed media such as novels and audio plays provided [[Doctor Who spin-offs|new stories]], but as a television programme ''Doctor Who'' remained dormant until 2003.

In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable [[Time travel|time machine]], the \"[[TARDIS]]\" (an [[acronym]] for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality referred to as \"dimensional transcendentality\").<ref group=\"note\">When it became an entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word \"TARDIS\" often came to be used to describe anything that appeared larger on the inside than its exterior implied.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/424|title=Full record for Tardis-like adj.|work=Science Fiction Citations|accessdate=7 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523205631/http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/424|archivedate=23 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure and was eventually revealed to be a [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]], which the Doctor fled by stealing the TARDIS.\n\n====Changes of appearance====\n{{Main|Regeneration (Doctor Who)}}\nProducers introduced the concept of [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] to permit the recasting of the main character. This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, [[William Hartnell]]. The term \"regeneration\" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a \"renewal\", and the Second Doctor underwent a \"change of appearance\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chakoteya.net/DoctorWho/4-3.htm|title=The Doctor Who Transcripts - The Power of the Daleks|website=www.chakoteya.net|language=en-gb|access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chakoteya.net/DoctorWho/6-7.htm|title=The Doctor Who Transcripts - The War Games|website=www.chakoteya.net|language=en-gb|access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref> The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe serials ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976) and ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983) established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations.

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's sex (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors to date have been white) and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada]]'' episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant, and in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (both 2017). In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"The Name of the Doctor\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor's \"moral duty\".<ref name=Overview>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7736130.stm|title=Doctor Who (before the Tardis)|publisher=BBC News|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]) and her teachers [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) and [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]]). These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited.

The Daleks are [[Kaled]]s from the planet [[Skaro]], mutated by the scientist [[Davros]] and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a [[directed-energy weapon]]. Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the  [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearances being in the 2015 episodes \"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" and \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\". Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', although played by several different actors.\n\nThe Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] (who intended them to be an [[allegory]] of the [[Nazism|Nazis]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nationterry/nationterry.htm|title=Nation, Terry|accessdate=19 May 2008}}</ref> and BBC designer [[Raymond Cusick]].<ref name=\"cusick\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21563344|title=Doctor Who Dalek designer Ray Cusick dies after illness|publisher=BBC|date=24 February 2013|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> The Daleks' d\u00e9but in the programme's second serial, ''[[The Daleks]]'' (1963\u201364), made both the Daleks and ''Doctor Who'' very popular.

This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating [[cyborg]]s, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for. With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the ''Doctor Who'' franchise.\n\nThe 2006 series introduced a totally new variation of Cybermen.

The Master was briefly played by [[Peter Pratt]] and [[Geoffrey Beevers]] until [[Anthony Ainley]] took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of ''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]'', and was played by American actor [[Eric Roberts]].\n\nFollowing the series revival in 2005, [[Derek Jacobi]] provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\".

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite |date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986). [[Keff McCulloch]] provided the new arrangement for the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s era which lasted from [[Doctor Who (season 24)|season 24]] (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989.

For the return of the series in 2005, [[Murray Gold]] provided a new arrangement which featured [[sampling (music)|samples]] from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\".\n\nA new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, \"[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]\"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallifreynewsbase.blogspot.com/2010/01/murray-gold-returns.html|title=Murray Gold Returns|date=3 January 2010|work=Doctor Who News Page}}</ref> He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/7603262/Doctor-Who-nasty-new-theme-tune-angers-fans.html|title=Doctor Who: 'nasty' new theme tune angers fans|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes.

Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nThe incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop.

There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled ''[[Doctor Who: The Fan Show]]'', which began airing from the tenth series. Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of ''Doctor Who'' through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner.

It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E.

It was followed in November 2007 by \"[[Time Crash]]\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the [[Fifth Doctor]] (played once again by [[Peter Davison]]).\n\nA set of two mini-episodes, titled [[Space / Time|\"Space\" and \"Time\"]] respectively, were produced to support [[Comic Relief]].

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.\n\nSince 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Cathrine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the [[Virgin New Adventures]] and [[Virgin Missing Adventures]]. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]]. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979. This is published by Panini, as is the ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'' magazine for younger fans.\n\nSee also:\n* [[List of Doctor Who novelisations]]\n* [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]]\n* [[Past Doctor Adventures]]\n* [[New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)|New Series Adventures]]\n\n===Video games===\n{{See also|Category:Video games based on Doctor Who}}\n\nNumerous ''Doctor Who'' [[video games]] have been created from the mid-80s through to the present day.

In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the [[Canon (fiction)|canonicity]] of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Russell T.|title=Doctor Who Magazine|issue=356|date=March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{main|List of awards and nominations received by Doctor Who}}\n\nThe show has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Doctor Who|recognition]] as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series]] and five consecutive (2005\u20132010) awards at the [[National Television Awards]] during [[Russell T Davies]]' tenure as executive producer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8471232.stm|work=News|publisher=BBC|title=Doctor Who scoops two TV awards|date=21 January 2010|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a300378/national-television-awards-2011-winners.html|title=National Television Awards 2011&nbsp;\u2013 Winners|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012|author=Sperling, Daniel}}</ref> In 2011, [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] became the first Doctor to be nominated for a [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actor|BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor]] and in 2016, [[Michelle Gomez]] became the first female to receive a BAFTA nomination for the series, getting a [[British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] nomination for her work as [[The Master (Doctor Who)#Missy|Missy]].

around 460 BC, although there are disagreements about the exact year. His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor [[Leucippus]], as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the 19th-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases.<ref>Stephen Toulmin and June Goodfield, ''The Architecture of Matter'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962), 56.</ref>\nLargely ignored in [[ancient Athens]], Democritus is said to have been disliked so much by [[Plato]] that the latter wished all of his books [[Book burning |burned]].<ref>[[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', ix. 40: \"[[Aristoxenus]] in his ''Historical Notes'' affirms that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he could collect\".</ref> He was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Aristotle]].\nMany consider Democritus to be the \"father of modern science\".<ref>Pamela Gossin, ''Encyclopedia of Literature and Science'', 2002.</ref> None of his writings have survived; only fragments are known from his vast body of work.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/ Democritus at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Hendrik ter Brugghen - Democritus.jpg|thumb|260px|upright|''Democritus'' by [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], 1628]]\n[[File:Rembrandt laughing 1628.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|[[Rembrandt]], ''The Young Rembrandt as Democritus the Laughing Philosopher'' (1628-29)]]\nDemocritus was said to be born in the city of [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]], an [[Ionians|Ionian]] colony of [[Teos]],<ref>Aristotle, ''De Coel.'' iii.4, ''Meteor.'' ii.7</ref> although some called him a [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]].<ref>[[#DL|Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], ix. 34, etc.</ref>\nHe was born in the 80th [[Olympiad]] (460\u2013457&nbsp;BC) according to [[Apollodorus of Athens]],<ref name=\"diogix41\"/> and although [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]] placed his birth in 470 BC,<ref name=\"diogix41\">[[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], ix. 41.</ref> the later date is probably more likely.<ref>\"The latter date [460 BC] is perhaps somewhat preferable, especially given the evident temptation to classify Democritus as older than Socrates on generic grounds, i.e. that Democritus was the last 'scientific' philosopher, Socrates the first 'ethical' one\". Cynthia Farrar, 1989, The Origins of Democratic Thinking: The Invention of Politics in Classical Athens, page 195. Cambridge University Press</ref>\n[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] has argued that the date of 460 is \"too early\" since, according to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius ix.41, Democritus said that he was a \"young man (''neos'')\" during [[Anaxagoras]]'s old age ({{circa}}440\u2013428).<ref>[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] (1955). ''Greek Philosophy: Thales to [[Plato]]'', London: Macmillan, p. 194.</ref>\nIt was said that Democritus's father was from a noble family and so wealthy that he received [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] on his march through Abdera. Democritus spent the [[inheritance]] which his father left him on travels into distant countries, to satisfy his thirst for knowledge. He traveled to Asia, and was even said to have reached India and Ethiopia.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''de Finibus'', v.19; [[Strabo]], xvi.</ref>\n\nIt is known that he wrote on [[Babylon]] and [[Meroe]]; he visited [[Egypt]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] states that he lived there for five years.<ref>[[#DS|Diodorus]], i.98.</ref> He himself declared<ref>[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Stromata'', i.</ref> that among his contemporaries none had made greater journeys, seen more countries, and met more scholars than himself. He particularly mentions the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian mathematicians]], whose knowledge he praises. [[Theophrastus]], too, spoke of him as a man who had seen many countries.<ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', iv. 20; Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix. 35.</ref>\nDuring his travels, according to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, he became acquainted with the [[Assyria|Chaldean]] magi. \"[[Ostanes]]\", one of the magi accompanying [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], was also said to have taught him.<ref>Tatian, ''Orat. cont. Graec.'' 17. \"However, this Democritus, whom Tatian identified with the philosopher, was a certain [[Bolus of Mendes]] who, under the name of Democritus, wrote a book on sympathies and antipathies\" \u2013 Owsei Temkin (1991), ''Hippocrates in a World of Pagans and Christians'', p. 120. JHU Press.</ref>\n\nAfter returning to his native land he occupied himself with natural [[philosophy]]. He traveled throughout Greece to acquire a better knowledge of its cultures. He mentions many Greek philosophers in his writings, and his wealth enabled him to purchase their writings. [[Leucippus]], the founder of [[atomism]], was the greatest influence upon him. He also praises [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ii.14; [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.140.</ref> Diogenes Laertius says that he was friends with [[Hippocrates]].<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix.42.</ref>\nHe may have been acquainted with [[Socrates]], but [[Plato]] does not mention him and Democritus himself is quoted as saying, \"I came to Athens and no one knew me.\"<ref>Diogenes Laertius 9.36 and Cicero ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'' 5.36.104, cited in p. 349 n. 2 of [[W.

Anim.'' i.1</ref>\n\nThe many anecdotes about Democritus, especially in [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], attest to his disinterest, modesty, and simplicity, and show that he lived exclusively for his studies. One story has him deliberately blinding himself in order to be less disturbed in his pursuits;<ref>Cicero, ''de Finibus'' v.29; [[Aulus Gellius]], x.17; Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix.36; Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'' v.39.</ref> it may well be true that he lost his sight in old age. He was cheerful, and was always ready to see the comical side of life, which later writers took to mean that he always laughed at the foolishness of people.<ref>Seneca, ''de Ira'', ii.10; Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', iv.20.</ref>\n\nHe was highly esteemed by his fellow citizens, because as Diogenes La\u00ebrtius says, \"he had foretold them some things which events proved to be true,\" which may refer to his knowledge of [[natural phenomena]]. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]],<ref>[[#DS|Diodorus]], xiv.11.5.</ref>\nDemocritus died at the age of 90, which would put his death around 370&nbsp;BC, but other writers have him living to 104,<ref>Lucian, ''Macrobii'' 18</ref> or even 109.<ref>Hipparchus ap. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix.43.</ref>\n\nPopularly known as the Laughing Philosopher (for laughing at human follies), the terms ''Abderitan laughter'', which means scoffing, incessant laughter, and Abderite, which means a scoffer, are derived from Democritus.<ref name=\"brewer\">{{cite book |last=Brewer |first=E.

Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the [[Atomism|atomists]] attempted to explain the world without reasoning as to ''purpose'', ''[[Unmoved mover|prime mover]]'', or ''[[final cause]]''. For the atomists questions of physics should be answered with a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] explanation (\"What earlier circumstances caused this event?\"), while their opponents search for explanations which, in addition to the material and mechanistic, also included the formal and teleological (\"What purpose did this event serve?\").\n\n===Aesthetics===\nLater Greek historians consider Democritus to have established [[aesthetics]] as a subject of investigation and study,<ref name=\"Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz\">{{cite book |last=Tatarkiewicz |first=Wladyslaw |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LS_ji6fh60IC&pg=PA91&dq=Democritus+philosophy+of+art+Art&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZZZKVf76Csjg7QaSs4CoDg&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Democritus%20philosophy%20of%20art%20Art&f=false |title=History of Aesthetics: Edited by J.

Specifically, Thrasyllus identified six works in the philosopher's oeuvre which had belonged to aesthetics as a discipline, but only fragments of the relevant works are extant; hence of all Democritus's writings on these matters, only a small percentage of his thoughts and ideas can be known.\n\n===Atomic hypothesis===\n{{see also|Atomism}}\n\nThe theory of Democritus held that everything is composed of \"atoms\", which are physically, but not geometrically, indivisible; that between atoms, there lies empty space; that atoms are indestructible, and have always been and always will be in motion; that there is an infinite number of atoms and of kinds of atoms, which differ in shape and size. Of the mass of atoms, Democritus said, \"The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is\". But his exact position on atomic weight is disputed.<ref name=\"Russell64\u201365\"/>\n\n[[Leucippus]] is widely credited with having been the first to develop the theory of atomism, although [[Isaac Newton]] preferred to credit the obscure [[Mochus|Mochus the Phoenician]] (whom he believed to be the biblical Moses) as the inventor of the idea on the authority of [[Posidonius]] and [[Strabo]].<ref>Derek Gjertsen (1986), ''The Newton Handbook'', p. 468.</ref> The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes, \"This theologically motivated view does not seem to claim much historical evidence, however\".<ref>Sylvia Berryman (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/#1 \"Ancient Atomism\"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. \u2013 Retrieved on 15 July 2009.</ref>\n\nDemocritus, along with Leucippus and Epicurus, proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms. They reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved. Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials.<ref>{{cite book  |last=Pfeffer |first=Jeremy, I. |last2=Nir |first2=Shlomo |year=2001 |title=Modern Physics: An Introduction Text |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company  |isbn=1-86094-250-4 |page=183}}</ref>\nUsing analogies from humans' [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s, he gave a picture or an image of an atom that distinguished them from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets.<ref>See ''testimonia'' DK 68 A 80, DK 68 A 37 and DK 68 A 43.

In contrast, modern, quantum-mechanical atoms interact via electric and magnetic force fields and are far from inert.\n\nThe theory of the atomists appears to be more nearly aligned with that of modern science than any other theory of antiquity. However, the similarity with modern concepts of science can be confusing when trying to understand where the hypothesis came from. Classical atomists could not have had an empirical basis for modern concepts of atoms and molecules.\n\nHowever, [[Lucretius]], describing atomism in his ''[[De rerum natura]]'', gives very clear and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: Mix water with soil and mud will result, seldom disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in nature and technology to recreate \"pure\" materials like water, air, and metals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: Why has everything in the world not yet decayed, and how can exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of \"atoms\". These classical \"atoms\" are nearer to humans' modern concept of \"molecule\" than to the atoms of modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there must be considerable open space between these \"atoms\": the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow and change shape, while metals can be molded without their basic material properties changing.\n\n===Void hypothesis===\n[[File:Dosso Dossi 026.jpg|thumb|1540 painting of Democritus by [[Dosso Dossi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ficus.pntic.mec.es/~wque0012/filantigua/presocraticos/02_textos.htm |title=Periodo presocr\u00e1tico |publisher=[[Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte]] |access-date=28 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621140213/http://ficus.pntic.mec.es/~wque0012/filantigua/presocraticos/02_textos.htm |archive-date=21 June 2013}}</ref>]]\nThe [[The Void (philosophy)|atomistic void]] hypothesis was a response to the paradoxes of [[Parmenides]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], the founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult to answer arguments in favor of the idea that there can be no movement. They held that any movement would require a void\u2014which is nothing\u2014but a nothing cannot exist. The Parmenidean position was \"You say there ''is'' a void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the void\".<ref name=\"Russell69\">Russell, p. 69.</ref><ref name=\"Physics\">Aristotle, ''Phys.'' iv.6</ref> The position of Parmenides appeared validated by the observation that where there seems to be nothing there is air, and indeed even where there is not matter there is ''something'', for instance light waves.\n\nThe atomists agreed that motion required a void, but simply ignored the argument of Parmenides on the grounds that motion was an observable fact. Therefore, they asserted, there must be a void. This idea survived in a refined version as Newton's theory of [[absolute space]], which met the logical requirements of attributing reality to not-being. Einstein's theory of relativity provided a new answer to Parmenides and Zeno, with the insight that space by itself is relative and cannot be separated from time as part of a generally curved space-time manifold. Consequently, Newton's refinement is now considered superfluous.<ref name=\"Russell69\u201371\">Russell, pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n\n===Epistemology===\n[[File:Giordano, Luca Democritus ca 1600.jpg|thumb|''Democritus'' by Luca Giordano ({{circa}}1690).]]\nThe knowledge of truth, according to Democritus, is difficult, since the perception through the senses is subjective. As from the same senses derive different impressions for each individual, then through the sensual impressions we cannot judge the truth. We can interpret the senses' data and grasp the truth only through the intellect, because the truth is in an abyss:\n\n{{quote|And again, many of the other animals receive impressions contrary to ours; and even to the senses of each individual, things do not always seem the same. Which then, of these impressions are true and which are false is not obvious; for the one set is no more true than the other, but both are alike. And this is why Democritus, at any rate, says that either there is no truth or to us at least it is not evident.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' iv.1009 b 7.</ref>}}\n\nAnd:\n\n{{quote|Furthermore, they find Xenophanes, Zeno of Elea, and Democritus to be sceptics: \u2026  Democritus because he rejects qualities, saying,\"Opinion says hot or cold, but the reality is atoms and empty space,\" and again, \"Of a truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well.\"<ref>[[#DL|Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] (tr. [[Robert Drew Hicks|Hicks]], 1925), [[s:Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#cite_ref-102|ix.72]]. See also [[#Fr|Bakalis]] (2005, p.86)</ref>}}\n\nThere are two kinds of knowing, the one he calls \"legitimate\" (\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b7, ''gn\u0113si\u0113'', \"genuine\") and the other \"bastard\" (\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03af\u03b7, ''skoti\u0113'', \"secret\"). The \"bastard\" knowledge is concerned with the perception through the senses; therefore it is insufficient and subjective. The reason is that the sensual perception is due to the effluences of the atoms from the objects to the senses. When these different shapes of atoms come to us, they stimulate our senses according to their shape, and our sensual impressions arise from those stimulations.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 135]] (Bakalis (2005)): [[Theophrastus]] 12, ''De Sensu'' [''On the Senses''], 49\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe second sort of knowledge, the \"legitimate\" one, can be achieved through the intellect, in other words, all the sense data from the \"bastard\" must be elaborated through reasoning. In this way one can get away from the false perception of the \"bastard\" knowledge and grasp the truth through the inductive reasoning. After taking into account the sense impressions, one can examine the causes of the appearances, draw conclusions about the laws that govern the appearances, and discover the [[causality]] (\u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, ''aetiologia'') by which they are related. This is the procedure of thought from the parts to the whole or else from the apparent to nonapparent (inductive reasoning). This is one example of why Democritus is considered to be an early scientific thinker. The process is reminiscent of that by which science gathers its conclusions:\n\n{{quote|But in the Canons Democritus says there are two kinds of knowing, one through the senses and the other through the intellect. Of these he calls the one through the intellect 'legitimate' attesting its trustworthiness for the judgment of truth, and through the senses he names 'bastard' denying its inerrancy in the discrimination of what is true. To quote his actual words: Of knowledge there are two forms, one legitimate, one bastard. To the bastard belong all this group: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The other is legitimate and separate from that. Then, preferring the legitimate to the bastard, he continues: When the bastard can no longer see any smaller, or hear, or smell, or taste, or perceive by touch, but finer matters have to be examined, then comes the legitimate, since it has a finer organ of perception.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 11]] (Bakalis (2005)): [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.138.</ref>}}\n\nAnd:\n\n{{quote|In the Confirmations ... he says: But we in actuality grasp nothing for certain, but what shifts in accordance with the condition of the body and of the things (atoms) which enter it and press upon it.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 9]] (Bakalis (2005)): [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.136.</ref>}}\n\nAs well as:\n\n{{quote|Democritus used to say that 'he prefers to discover a causality rather than become a king of Persia'.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 118]] (Bakalis (2005))</ref>}}\n\n===Ethics and politics===\n[[File:Bramante heracleitus and democritus.jpeg|thumb|left|''Crying [[Heraclitus]] and laughing Democritus'', from a 1477 Italian fresco, [[Pinacoteca di Brera]], Milan.]]\nThe ethics and politics of Democritus come to us mostly in the form of maxims. As such, the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] has gone as far as to say that: \"despite the large number of ethical sayings, it is difficult to construct a coherent account of Democritus's ethical views,\" noting that there is a \"difficulty of deciding which fragments are genuinely Democritean\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#7 |title=Democritus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe says that \"Equality is everywhere noble\", but he is not encompassing enough to include women or slaves in this sentiment. Poverty in a democracy is better than prosperity under tyrants, for the same reason one is to prefer liberty over slavery.  In his [[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]], [[Bertrand Russell]] writes that Democritus was in love with \"what the Greeks called democracy.\" Democritus said that \"the wise man belongs to all countries, for the home of a great soul is the whole world.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Open Society and its Enemies. Vol I.: The Spell of Plato|last=Popper|first=Karl R.|publisher=George Routledge & Sons|year=1945|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>  Democritus wrote that those in power should \"take it upon themselves to lend to the poor and to aid them and to favor them, then is there pity and no isolation but companionship and mutual defense and concord among the citizens and other good things too many to catalogue\". Money when used with sense leads to generosity and charity, while money used in folly leads to a common expense for the whole society\u2014excessive hoarding of money for one's children is avarice. While making money is not useless, he says, doing so as a result of wrongdoing is the \"worst of all things\". He is on the whole ambivalent towards wealth, and values it much less than self-sufficiency. He disliked violence but was not a pacifist: he urged cities to be prepared for war, and believed that a society had the right to execute a criminal or enemy so long as this did not violate some law, treaty, or oath.<ref name=\"Barnes87\"/>\n\nGoodness, he believed, came more from practice and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed that one should distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes are tied to the society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set one's judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has\u2014giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.<ref name=\"Barnes87\"/>\n\n===Mathematics===\n[[File:Cone 3d.png|thumb|250px|right|Right circular and oblique circular cones]]\nDemocritus was also a pioneer of mathematics and geometry in particular. We only know this through citations of his works (titled ''On Numbers'', ''On Geometrics'', ''On Tangencies'', ''On Mapping'', and ''On Irrationals'') in other writings, since most of Democritus's body of work did not survive the Middle Ages. Democritus was among the first to observe that a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] and [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] with the same base and height has one-third the [[volume]] of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[prism (geometry)|prism]] respectively .\n\n===Anthropology, biology, and cosmology===\nHis work on nature is known through citations of his books on the subjects, ''On the Nature of Man'', ''On Flesh'' (two books), ''On Mind, On the Senses'', ''On Flavors'', ''On Colors'',  ''Causes concerned with Seeds and Plants and Fruits'', and ''Causes concerned with Animals'' (three books).<ref name=\"Barnes87\"/> He spent much of his life experimenting with and examining plants and minerals, and wrote at length on many scientific topics.<ref>[[#Petronius|Petronius ch. 88]].</ref> Democritus thought that the first [[humans]] lived an anarchic and animal sort of life, going out to forage individually and living off the most palatable herbs and the fruit which grew wild on the trees. They were driven together into societies for fear of wild animals, he said. He believed that these early people had no language, but that they gradually began to articulate their expressions, establishing symbols for every sort of object, and in this manner came to understand each other. He says that the earliest men lived laboriously, having none of the utilities of life; clothing, houses, fire, domestication, and farming were unknown to them. Democritus presents the early period of mankind as one of learning by trial and error, and says that each step slowly led to more discoveries; they took refuge in the caves in winter, stored fruits that could be preserved, and through reason and keenness of mind came to build upon each new idea.<ref name=\"Barnes87\"/><ref>[[#DS|Diodorus]] I.viii.1\u20137.</ref>\n\nDemocritus held that originally the universe was composed of nothing but tiny atoms churning in chaos, until they collided together to form larger units\u2014including the earth and everything on it.<ref name=\"Barnes87\"/> He surmised that [[Cosmic pluralism|there are many worlds]], some growing, some decaying; some with no sun or moon, some with several. He held that every world has a beginning and an end and that a world could be destroyed by collision with another world. To epitomize Democritus's cosmology, Russell calls on Shelley: \"Worlds on worlds are rolling ever / From creation to decay, / Like the bubbles on a river / Sparkling, bursting, borne away\".<ref>Russell, pp. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\n== Twentieth-century appraisals ==\nAccording to [[Bertrand Russell]], the point of view of Leucippus and Democritus \"was remarkably like that of modern science, and avoided most of the faults to which Greek speculation was prone.\"<ref>Russell ([[#Russell|1972]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/westernphilosoph035502mbp#page/n96/mode/1up 85]).</ref>\n\n[[Karl Popper|Karl R.

The consensus is that multiple groups of people played independently throughout the 1960s. Students at [[Rice University]] in Houston, Texas, for example, held tournaments with trees as targets as early as 1964, and in the early 1960s, players in Pendleton King Park in [[Augusta, Georgia]] would toss Frisbees into 50-gallon barrel trash cans designated as targets. In 1968 Frisbee Golf was also played in [[Alameda Park]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] by teenagers in the Anacapa and Sola street areas. Gazebos, water fountains, lamp posts, and trees were all part of the course. This took place for several years and an Alameda Park collectors edition disc still exists, though rare, as few were made. Clifford Towne from this group went on to hold a National Time Aloft record.\n\n===Early pioneers of the sport===\nTwo early coordinators of the sport are George Sappenfield and Kevin Donnelly, who, through similar backgrounds and the help of [[Ed Headrick]] at Wham-O, were able to individually spread the sport in their California cities. Donnelly began playing a form of Frisbee golf in 1959 called Street Frisbee Golf. In 1961, while a recreation leader and then recreation supervisor for the City of [[Newport Beach, California]], he formulated and then began organizing Frisbee golf tournaments at nine of the city's playgrounds he supervised. This culminated in 1965 with a fully documented, [[Wham-O]] sponsored, citywide Frisbee golf tournament spearheaded by \"Steady\" Ed Headrick at Wham-O. This highly publicized tournament included hula hoops as holes, with published rules, hole lengths, pars, and prizes; an event in which [[Walter Frederick Morrison]], inventor of the Pluto Plato and [https://patents.google.com/patent/US3359678 Frisbee inventor] [https://www.discgolf.com/disc-golf-education-development/ed-headrick-father-disc-golf/ \"Steady\"' Ed Headrick], was in attendance.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Kevin Donnelly: Disc Golf|url=http://www.omagdigital.com/display_article.php?id=835174|journal=Disc Golfer|issue=Fall 2011|author=Altmyer, Don}}</ref>  In 1965, Sappenfield was a recreation counselor during a summer break from college during which, he set up an object course for his children to play on. When he finished college in 1968, Sappenfield became the Parks and Recreation supervisor for Conejo Recreation and Park District in [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. Sappenfield planned a disc golf tournament as part of a recreation project and contacted Wham-O Manufacturing to ask them for help with the event. Wham-O supplied Frisbees for throwing, and [[hula hoop]]s for use as targets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pdga.com/history|title=Brief History of Disc Golf and the PDGA|last=Gregoire|first=Matt|date=2008-09-23|work=Professional Disc Golf Association|access-date=2017-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}</ref> Before 1973 and the invention of the [https://patents.google.com/patent/US4039189A/en disc golf target] called the [https://www.discgolf.com/disc-golf-education-development/disc-golf-history/ disc pole hole], there were only a few  disc golf object courses in the U.S. and Canada. Despite having never heard of the International Frisbee Association (IFA) that Ed Headrick and Wham-O had put together, or ever seeing a copy of the IFA Newsletter, Jim Palmeri, his brother, and a small group of people from Rochester, NY, had been playing disc golf as a competitive sport on a regular basis since August 1970, including tournaments and weekly league play. By 1973, they had even promoted two City of Rochester Disc Frisbee Championship events which featured disc golf as the main event. In Canada, beginning in 1970, [[Ken Westerfield]] and Jim Kenner played Frisbee golf daily on an 18 object hole course they designed at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] in downtown Toronto and presented Canada's first disc golf competitions.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Development of Frisbee and disc sports|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#appendix1|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}</ref> In California, the Berkeley Frisbee Group established a standardized 18 hole object course on the Berkeley campus in 1970.

Tone targets are designed to make a distinctive sound when hit with a disc. Baskets are now much more common, which are constructed with a central pole holding a basket under an assembly of hanging chains. A disc which hits the chains is often, but not always, deflected into the basket. Discs must land inside the basket or on the chains to count the hole as completed. There are many different brands of baskets made by numerous manufacturers.\n\n==Play of the game==\nThe sport of disc golf is set up similar to a game of golf. A \"round\" is played on a disc golf course consisting of a number of \"holes\", usually 9 or 18.

The object of the game is to get through the course with the lowest number of total throws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pdga.com/introduction|title=A Guide to Disc Golf from the PDGA|last=pdga|date=2008-10-09|work=Professional Disc Golf Association|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en}}</ref> Play is usually in groups of five or fewer, with each player taking turn at the tee box, then progressing with the player furthest from the hole throwing first, while the other players stand aside.&nbsp;\n\nEach course is unique, so each course requires a different combination of throws to complete, with the best players aiming to shape the flight of the disc to account for distance, terrain, obstacles and weather. In order to facilitate making different shots, players carry a variety of discs with different flight characteristics, choosing an appropriate disc for each throw. Some players also carry a mini marker disc, used to accurately mark the throwing position before each throw.&nbsp; Use of mini marker discs is particularly prevalent in formal competitive play.\n\nMany courses include out-of-bounds areas, commonly called \"OB zones\" or just \"OB\". If the disc lands in these areas, the player is usually required to add a penalty throw onto his or her score and continue play from near where the disc entered the out-of-bounds zone. Some courses include out-of-bounds areas with special rules requiring the player the resume play from a specified area called a drop zone, or requiring the player to restart the hole from the tee. Some courses also include Mandatories (also called \"Mandos\") which require the path of the disc to be above, below or to one side of a specific line indicated by a sign.\n\nBy tradition, players throw from the tee box in the order of their score on the previous hole, with the lowest scorer throwing first. Most players also follow a loose code of courtesy while playing, which includes norms such as standing out of the sight line of the throwing player and avoiding making distracting noises. Because a thrown disc could injure someone, the Professional Disc Golf Association recommends that players \"Never throw into a blind area or when spectators, pedestrians or facility users are within range.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pdga.com/code|title=The Disc Golfer's Code|last=steveganz|date=2016-01-20|work=Professional Disc Golf Association|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFormal competitive play is governed by the [http://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf PDGA Official Rules of Disc Golf] and the [http://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual-disc-golf-events PDGA Competition Manual for Disc Golf events].[[File:Disc golf in basket.JPG|thumb|A disc resting in the basket]]\n\n==Disc types==\nThe golf discs used today are much smaller and heavier than traditional flying discs, typically 8\u20139&nbsp;inches (20\u201323&nbsp;cm) in diameter and weighing between 120 and 180&nbsp;grams. The PDGA prohibits discs heavier than 200&nbsp;grams. Discs used for disc golf are designed and shaped for control, speed, and accuracy, while general-purpose flying discs, such as those used for playing [[Guts (game)|guts]] or [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], have a more traditional shape, similar to a catch disc. There is a wide variety of discs used in disc golf and they are generally divided into three categories: putters, all-purpose mid-range discs, and drivers.\n\n===Putter===\nPutters are similar to the discs used in simple games of catch, such as the Wham-o brand Frisbee. They are designed to fly straight, predictably, and very slowly compared to mid-range discs and drivers. They are typically used for tight, controlled shots that are close to the basket, although some players use them for short drives where trees or other obstacles come into play. Usually a pro carries 1\u20137 putters depending on their flight characteristics. As a beginner it is suggested that you only use a putter or mid-range.\n\n===Mid-range===\nMid-range discs have slightly sharper edges that enable them to cut through the air better. These discs are usually faster, more stable, and have a longer range than a putter. Some beginner players will use mid-ranges as drivers as it is recommended that new players stay away from higher speed drivers to help them advance quicker. They are good all-around discs and are suitable for a first time player or the most advanced pros.\n\n===Driver===\nDrivers are usually recognized by their sharp, beveled edge and have most of their mass concentrated on the outer rim of the disc rather than distributed equally throughout. They are designed to travel farther distances at greater speeds and are mostly used for tee-off and other long distance throws.<ref name=\"Eastham, Susan L 2015\">Eastham, Susan L. \"DISC GOLF: Teaching A Lifetime Activity.\" Strategies (08924562) 28.6 (2015): 3\u20138. SPORTDiscus with Full Text. Web. 1 Aug. 2016.</ref> Drivers are often divided into different categories. For example, Innova Discs divides their discs into Distance Drivers and Fairway Drivers, with a fairway driver being somewhere between a distance driver and a mid-range disc. Discraft divides their drivers into 3 categories: Long Drivers, Extra Long Drivers, and Maximum Distance Drivers. Because the physics of a disc require \"snap\" or \"flick\", which means putting spin on the disc, new players generally find that throwing a distance driver accurately can be somewhat difficult and will require experience with golf disc response. This is why it is better for players to begin with fairway drivers, long drivers, or even mid-ranges, and incorporate maximum distance drivers as their strength and disc control increases. Most players that are starting off will be most likely throwing lighter discs. Another type of driver, used less frequently, is a roller. As the name indicates, it has an edge designed to roll rather than fly. (Although any disc can be used for a roller, some behave quite differently than others.)\n\n===Stability===\nStability is the measurement of a disc's tendency to bank laterally during its flight.  A disc that is over-stable will tend to track left (for a right handed, backhand throw), whereas a disc that is under-stable will tend to track right (also for a right handed, backhand throw). The stability rating of the discs differs depending on the manufacturer of the disc. [[Innova Discs]] rate stability as \"turn\" and \"fade\". \"Turn\" references how the disc will fly at high speed during the beginning and middle of its flight, and is rated on a scale of +1<ref name=\"innovadiscs.com\">http://www.innovadiscs.com/home/disc-golf-faq/flight-ratings-system.html</ref> to \u22125, where +1<ref name=\"innovadiscs.com\"/> is the most overstable and \u22125 is the most understable. \"Fade\" references how the disc will fly at lower speeds towards the end of its flight, and is rated on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 has the least fade, and 5 has the most fade. For example, a disc with a turn of \u22125 and fade of +1 will fly to the right for (right handed, backhand throw) the majority of its flight then curl back minimally left at the end. A disc with a turn of \u22121 and a fade of +3 will turn slightly right during the middle of its flight and turn hard left as it slows down. These ratings can be found on the discs themselves or from the manufacturer's web site. [[Discraft]] prints the stability rating on all discs and also provides this information on their web site. The stability ranges from 3 to \u22122 for Discraft discs; however Discraft's ratings are more of a combination of turn and fade with the predominance being fade.\n\nSpin (rotation) has little influence on lift and drag forces but impacts a disc's stability during flight. Imagine a spinning top. A gentle nudge will knock it off its axis of rotation for a second, but it will not topple over because spin adds gyroscopic stability. In the same way, a flying disc resists rolling (flipping over) because spin adds gyroscopic stability. A flying disc will maintain its spin rate even as it loses velocity. Toward the end of a disc's flight, when the spin and velocity lines cross, a flying disc will predictably begin to fade. The degree to which a disc will fade depends on its pitch angle and design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.triumphbooks.com/the-definitive-guide-to-disc-golf-products-9781629372044.php?page_id=21|title=The Definitive Guide to Disc Golf|website=www.triumphbooks.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===Plastics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nThere are a variety of different discs, each with a specific plastic made with them. Plastics such as DX, J-Pro, Pro-D, X-Line, D-line, retro, and R-Pro from Innova discs, latitude 64, discmania, and Discraft are some of the less durable plastics, but good for beginners due to their lower prices, compared to the higher end plastics. Plastics such as Champion, Titanium, FLX, GStar, Gold Line, Tournament Plastic, Fuzion and Star plastics, which are the best offered from the same companies, offering the best quality, durability and flight compared to the other types available. There are also plastics that provide additional functionality, specifically glow in the dark plastic and plastic that allows the disc to float in water. Most companies also offer a line of plastic that is much lighter than the maximum throwing weight (normally filled with air bubbles) which is conducive to beginners or players with less arm speed. Players might prefer bright colored discs to contrast most green flora and recover their disc easier.\n\n==Throwing styles==\n{{Main|Flying disc techniques}}\nWhile there are many different grips and styles to throwing the disc, there are two basic throwing techniques: backhand and forehand (or sidearm). These techniques vary in effectiveness under different circumstances. Their understanding and mastery can greatly improve a player's game, and offer diverse options in maneuvering the disc to the basket with greater efficacy. Many players use what is referred to as a '''run-up''' during their drive. This is practiced to build more forward disc momentum and distance. Throwing styles vary from player to player, and there is no standard throwing style.\n\nAll discs when thrown will naturally fall to a certain direction, this direction is termed ''Hyzer'', the natural fall of the disc, or ''Anhyzer'', making the disc fall against its natural flight pattern. For a right-handed backhand throw (RHBH), the disc will naturally fall to the left. For a right-handed forehand throw (RHFH), the disc will naturally fall to the right. For a left-handed, backhand throw (LHBH), the disc will naturally fall to the right. For a left-handed, forehand throw (LHFH), the disc will naturally fall to the left.\n\n===Backhand===\nTo perform this throw, the disc is rapidly drawn from across the front of the body, and released towards a forward aimpoint. Due to the potential snap available with this technique, one can expect greater distance than with a  forehand throw. It is important to initiate momentum from the feet and allow it to travel up the body, hips and shoulders, culminating in the transfer of energy to the disc.\n\n===Forehand===\nThe forehand (sidearm) throw is performed by drawing the disc from behind and partially across the front of the body: similar to a sidearm throw in [[baseball]]. The term '''sidearm''' actually predates the term '''forehand''', which is seemingly in use today as a simpler means to communicate the technique, equating to a tennis forehand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Throwing sidearm|url=http://www.discgolfreview.com/resources/articles/throwingsidearm.shtml|work=Disc golf review|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative throws===\nThe following examples of throws may be used to better deliver a disc where the former common two throws would be impeded by obstacles such as bushes, trees, boulders, or artificial structures.\n\nCommon alternative styles\n*The '''Hatchet''' (or Tomahawk). Gripped similarly to the sidearm toss but thrown with an overhand motion; the disc orientation nearly perpendicular to the ground over much of the flight.\n*The '''Thumber''' (or U.D.). Thrown in an overhand manner but with thumb held on the disc's underside.\n*The '''Roller'''. Thrown either backhand or forehand, the disc will predominately be in contact with the ground. The disc remains in motion while travelling on its edge at a slight angle, and can travel exceedingly far in ideal situations. Once perfected, the roller is an invaluably versatile tool in the golfer's arsenal.\n*The '''Turbo-Putt''' Thrown with a putter when the player holds the disc upright, supported in the middle by the thumb, with the finger tips outside of the edge, somewhat like a waiter holding a platter. The player stands with the leg opposite from the throwing arm forward, reaches back, and then extends their arm towards the basket, throwing the disc in a motion similar to that of throwing a dart.  Ideally the thrower does not rotate his wrist; the act of following through will give the disc its spin.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzA8y0rwGuo</ref> The Turbo-Putt is a throw known for its accuracy, but it has extremely limited range.\n\nOther alternative styles\n*The '''Baseball''' or '''Grenade'''. Thrown as in the backhand, but with the disc upside-down. This shot is used often to get up and down on a short shot where there is danger of a shot rolling away or going out of bounds if thrown too far.  Primarily used on downhill shots but can be used to go up and over.  Also due to the quick turn and backspin of this shot, it is sometimes used to get out of the woods.\n*The '''Overhand wristflip''' (or '''chicken-wing''' [ambiguous origin]{{Dubious|date=April 2012}} ). This is a very difficult and stylized throw with which accomplished free-stylers and classic ultimate players are familiar; it is less used in disc golf.  It is thrown in the same manner the \"baseball\" but drawn on the sidearm side of the body, and by inverting the arm and disc. Using the thumb as the power finger, the disc is drawn from the thigh area rearwards and up from behind the body to over the shoulder, releasing toward a forward aimpoint. The disc flies in a conventional flight pattern. To the untrained eye, this appears to be an ungainly throw. It is, however, elegant and accurate. The term \"overhand wristflip\" has been in use since at least circa 1970.\n\n==Scoring==\n[[Stroke Play]] is the most common scoring method used in the sport but there are many other forms. These include [[match play]], [[skins game|skins]], [[speed golf]] and captain's choice, which in disc golf is referred to as \"doubles\" (not to be confused with partner or team play).\n\nRegardless of which form of play the participants choose, the main objectives of disc golf are conceptually the same as traditional golf in the sense that players follow the same scorekeeping technique.\n\nScoring terms for a single hole:\n\n*[[Condor (golf)|Condor]] \u2013 Where a player is four throws under par, or \"-4\".\n*[[Albatross (golf)|Albatross]] (or double-eagle) \u2013 Where a player is three throws under par, or \"-3\".\n*[[Eagle (golf)|Eagle]] (or double-birdie) \u2013 Where a player is two throws under par, or \"-2\".\n*[[Birdie (golf)|Birdie]] \u2013 Where a player is one throw under par, or \"-1\".\n*[[Par (score)|Par]] \u2013 Where a player has thrown par, or \"0\".\n*[[Bogey (golf)|Bogey]] \u2013 Where a player is one throw over par, or \"+1\".\n*[[Bogey (golf)|Double Bogey]] \u2013 Where a player is two throws over par, or \"+2\".\n*[[Bogey (golf)|Triple Bogey]] \u2013 Where a player is three throws over par, or \"+3\".\n\nDoubles play is a unique style of play that many local courses offer on a weekly basis. In this format, teams of two golfers are determined. Sometimes this is done by random draw, and other times it is a pro-am format. On the course, it is a \"best-disc\" scramble, meaning both players throw their tee shot; and then decide which lie they would like to play. Both players then play from the same lie, again choosing which lie is preferable. The World Amateur Doubles Format includes best shot, alternate shot, best score (players play singles and take the best result from the hole) and worst shot (both players must sink the putt).\n\n==Tournaments==\n[[File:KenClimo USDGC2008.JPG|thumb| [[Ken Climo]] teeing off at hole 5 of the 2008 [[United States Disc Golf Championship|USDGC]]]]\n\nTournaments are held nationwide and year long in the United States. Sanctioned Tournament play is communicated through the [[Professional Disc Golf Association]] Membership. The PDGA provides international, professional, and amateur disc golf tournaments as well as communicates event results, opinions and other information beneficial to the sport via electronic and printed media.  In 1982 the PDGA hosted the first World Championship Tournament.  Since then, the World Championships have been held in 17 different American states, as well as Toronto, Ontario.<ref>http://www.bestdiscgolfdiscs.com/infographic-pdga-world-championship/</ref>\n\nDisc golf tournaments are popular around the world.  As with traditional [[golf]], there are many championship tournaments.  One of the largest is the [[United States Disc Golf Championship]].\n\nEvery year, the largest teams tournament in the world is held in [[Austin, Texas]], by [[John Houck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.circularproductions.com/texas_teams.html |title=Texas Disc Golf Team Championships |publisher=Circular Productions |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>\n\nTo prove the year-round sustainability of the sport, annual winter tournaments known as Ice Bowls are held at courses around the world.  Using the motto \"No Wimps, No Whiners\", Ice Bowls collectively are designed to create sport awareness, and are considered charity events that typically benefit a food bank local to a given tournament location. The official Web site reports that the 2010 Ice Bowls raised over $250,000 and donated over 67,000 pounds of food in the 222 tournaments for the year.

The PDGA Women's Committee set historical records on 12 May 2012 by running the Inaugural Women's Global Event that attracted 636 female players in 24 states and 4 countries. The Women's Global Event was expected to take place every two years from 2014, with hopes of increasing the number of participants.\n\nThere are also Disc golf companies such as Disc-Diva, that have started up with a primary, though not exclusive, focus on women in the sport, promoting accessories geared towards women and using catch phrases like \"you wish you threw like a girl\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discgolfdiva.startlogic.com/index.html |title=Disc Diva Socks |publisher=Discgolfdiva.startlogic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> Sassy Pants is another group that focuses on getting more involvement from women in the sport, advocating for sponsorship of women to enter tournaments.<ref>[http://sassypantsgear.com/vision2.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727101953/http://sassypantsgear.com/vision2.html|date=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nWomen's disc golf teams are involved in the National Collegiate Disc Golf Championship, and the Mississippi State Women's Team were the inaugural champions.\n\n==Disc golf hall of fame==\n\nInductees:<ref>{{cite web|title=Disc Golf Hall of Fame|url=http://www.pdga.com/DGHOF/members/|publisher=Professional Disc Golf Association|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n*1993 Vanessa Chambers | [[Dave Dunipace]] | Ed Headrick | [[Tom Monroe (disc golfer)|Tom Monroe]] | Jim Palmeri | Dan Roddick | Ted Smethers\n*1994 Harold Duvall | Nobuya Kobayashi | Darrell Lynn | Dan Mangone | Doug Newland | Snapper Pierson | Lavone Wolfe\n*1995 [[Ken Climo]] | John David | David Greenwell | Johnny Roberts | Dr. Rick Voakes\n*1996 Mike Conger | Patti Kunkle | Rick Rothstein\n*1997 Steve Slasor | Elaine King | Jim Kenner\n*1998 Gregg Hosfeld | [[John Houck]] | Carlton Howard\n*1999 Sam Ferrans | Steve Wisecup | Tim Selinske\n*2000 Tom Schot | Royce Racinowski\n*2001 Stan McDaniel | Johnny Sias\n*2002 Alan Beaver | Gary Lewis\n*2003 Mark Horn | Brian Hoeniger | [[Stancil Johnson|Dr. Stancil Johnson]],\n*2004 Derek Robins | Geoff Lissaman | Johnny Lissaman | Marty Hapner\n*2005 Mats Bengtsson | Sylvia Voakes\n*2006 Chuck Kennedy | Kozo Shimbo\n*2007 Fred Salaz | Michael Travers\n*2008 Dan Ginnelly | Juliana Korver\n*2009 Crazy John Brooks | Lynne Warren | Michael Sullivan\n*2010 Charlie Callahan | Tomas Ekstrom | Brian Cummings\n*2011 Don Hoffman | Joe Feidt | Brent Hambrick\n*2012 Tim Willis | Jeff Homburg | Bob Gentil (New Zealand)\n*2013 [[Barry Schultz]] | Becky Zallek | Jim Challas | [[Ken Westerfield]]\n*2014 Don Wilchek | Jim Oates |  Italian Victor Parra\n*2015 Gail McColl | Anni Kreml | J Gary Dropcho\n*2016 Joseph Mela | Ace Mason | Tita Ugalde\n*2017 John Bird | Des Reading | Brian Graham\n\n==See also==\n*[[Flying disc games]]\n*[[Flying disc techniques]]\n*[[Frisbee]]\n*[[Golf]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikibooks|Disc Golf}}\n* [http://www.pdga.com/ Professional Disc Golf Association] (PDGA) \u2013 official rules, course directory and list of members\n* [http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/ History of Early Frisbee Sports]\n* [https://ultimatediscsport.com/ History of Disc Golf, Ultimate and Frisbee Pioneers]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Disc golf| ]]\n[[Category:Flying disc games]]\n[[Category:Forms of golf]]\n[[Category:Individual sports]]\n[[Category:Throwing sports]]\n[[Category:Sports originating in the United States]]\n[[Category:Sports originating in Canada]]", "sha1": "t0qc2s1uxguvov28syy57phy7plcceb"}}, {"title": "Decimal", "ns": "0", "id": "8214", "revision": {"id": "865416447", "parentid": "865416307", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T20:20:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "Balkywrest", "id": "34910745"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/73.205.195.13|73.205.195.13]] ([[User talk:73.205.195.13|talk]]) to last revision by 108.27.42.220.

It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>''The History of Arithmetic'', [[Louis Charles Karpinski]], 200pp, Rand McNally & Company, 1925.</ref> The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as ''Decimal notation''.<ref>Lam Lay Yong & Ang Tian Se (2004) ''Fleeting Footsteps. Tracing the Conception of Arithmetic and Algebra in Ancient China'', Revised Edition, World Scientific, Singapore.</ref>\n\nA ''decimal numeral'', or just ''decimal'', or, improperly ''decimal number'', refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal system, which contains a [[decimal mark|decimal separator]] (for example 10.00 or 3.14159). Sometimes these terms are used for any numeral in the decimal system. A ''decimal'' may also refer to any digit after the decimal separator, such as in \"3.14 is the approximation of {{pi}} to two decimals\".\n\nThe numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the [[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]], that is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of the form {{math|''a''/10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an integer, and {{math|''n''}} is a [[nonnegative integer]].\n\nThe decimal system has been extended to ''infinite decimals'', for representing any [[real number]], by using an [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] of digits after the decimal separator (see [[Decimal representation]]). In this context, the usual decimals are sometimes called ''terminating decimals''. A [[repeating decimal]], is an infinite decimal, that, after some place repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (for example {{math|1=5.123144144144144... = 5.123{{overline|144}}}}).<ref>The [[Vinculum (symbol)|viniculum (overline)]] in 5.123<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">144</span> indicates that the '144' sequence repeats itself indefinitely, i.e. {{val|5.123144144144144|s=...}}.</ref> An infinite decimal represents a [[rational number]] if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of nonzero digits.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Two hand, ten fingers.jpg|thumb|right|Ten fingers on two hands, the possible starting point of the decimal counting.]]\nMany [[numeral system]]s of ancient civilisations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, probably because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are [[Armenian numerals]], [[Brahmi numerals]], [[Greek numerals]], [[Hebrew numerals]], [[Roman numerals]], and [[Chinese numerals]]. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and, only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] for representing [[integer]]s. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called ''[[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]]'' or ''decimal numbers'' for forming the ''decimal numeral system''.\n\n== Decimal notation ==\nFor writing numbers, the decimal system uses ten [[decimal digit]]s, a [[decimal mark]], and, for [[negative number]]s, a [[minus sign]] \"\u2212\". The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;<ref>In some countries, such as [[Arab language|Arab speaking]] ones, other [[glyph]]s are used for the digits</ref> the decimal separator is the dot \"{{math|.}}\" in many countries (including English speaking ones), but may be a comma \"{{math|,}}\" in other countries (mainly in [[Europe]]).\n\nFor representing a [[nonnegative number]], a decimal consists of\n* either a (finite) sequence of digits such as 2017, or in full generality,\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0</math>\n:(in this case, the (entire) decimal represents an integer)\n* or two sequence of digits separated by a decimal mark such as 3.14159, 15.00, or in full generality\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math>\nIt is generally assumed that, if {{math|''m'' > 0}}, the first digit {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}} is not zero, but, in some circumstances, it may be useful to have one or more 0's on the left. This does not change the value represented by the decimal. For example, {{math|1=3.14 = 03.14 = 003.14}}. Similarly, if {{math|1=''b''<sub>''n''</sub> =0}}, it may be removed, and conversely, trailing zeros may be added without changing the represented number. For example, {{math|1=15 = 15.0 = 15.00}} and {{math|1=5.2 = 5.20 = 5.200}}. sometimes, the unnecessary zeros are used for indicating the accuracy of a measurement. For example, 15.00m may indicate that the measurement error is less than one centimeter, while 15m may mean that the length is roughly fifteen meters, and that the error may exceed 10&nbsp;cm.\n\nFor representing a [[negative number]], a minus sign is placed before {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}}.\n\nThe numeral <math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math> represents the number\n:<math>a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\\cdots+a_{0}10^0+\\frac{b_1}{10^1}+\\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{b_n}{10^n}</math>\nTherefore, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a [[positional numeral system]]\n\n== Decimal fractions ==\n\nThe numbers that are represented by decimal numeral are the '''decimal fractions''' (sometimes called '''decimal numbers'''), that is, the [[rational number]]s that may be expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the [[denominator]] of which is a [[exponentiation|power]] of ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Decimal_fraction|title=Decimal Fraction|work=[[Encyclopedia of Mathematics]]|accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> For example, the numerals <math>0.8, 14.89, 0.00024</math> represent the fractions {{math|{{sfrac|8|10}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|1489|100}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|24|100000}}}}. More generally, a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator {{math|10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.\n\nExpressed as a [[fully reduced fraction]], the decimal numbers are those, whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 by a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are\n:<math>1=2^0\\cdot 5^0, 2=2^1\\cdot 5^0, 4=2^2\\cdot 5^0, 5=2^0\\cdot 5^1, 8=2^3\\cdot 5^0, 10=2^1\\cdot 5^1, 16=2^4\\cdot 5^0, 25=2^0\\cdot 5^2, \\ldots</math>\n\n<!-- The remainder of the section seems misplaced here -->The ''[[integer part]]'', or ''integral part'' of a decimal is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator (see also [[truncation]]). For a nonnegative decimal, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the ''[[fractional part]]'', which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.\n\nWhen the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in [[computing]], that the integer part is not written (for example {{math|.1234}}, instead of {{math|0.1234}}). In normal writing, this is generally avoided because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation.\n\n==Real number approximation==\n\nDecimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all [[real number]]s, so e.g. for the real number [[pi|{{pi}}]]. Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real {{pi}}, being less than 10<sup>\u22125</sup> off; and so decimals are widely used in [[science]], [[engineering]] and everyday life.\n\nMore precisely, for every real number ''x'', and every positive integer ''n'', there are two decimals ''l'' and ''u'', with at most ''n'' digits after the decimal mark, such that ''l'' \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''u'' and (''u'' \u2013 ''l'') = 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>.\n\nNumbers are very often obtained as the result of a [[measurement]]. As measurements are generally afflicted with some [[measurement error]] with a known [[upper bound]], the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same decimal number, the numeral 0.080 is to suggest a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also [[significant figures]]).\n\n==Infinite decimal expansion==\n{{main|Decimal representation}}\n\nFor a [[real number]] ''x'' and an integer ''n'' \u2265 0, let [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> denote the (finite) decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than ''x'', which has exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark. Let ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> denote the last digit of [''x'']<sub>''i''</sub>. It is straightforward to see that [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> may be obtained by appending ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> to the right of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>. This way one has\n:[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,\n\nand the difference of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub> and [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> amounts to \n:|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> \u2212 [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>| = ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> \u22c5 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> < 10<sup>\u2212''n''+1</sup>,\n\nwhich is either 0, if ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0, or gets arbitrarily small, when ''n'' tends to infinity. According to the definition of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], ''x'' is the limit of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> when ''n'' tends to [[infinity]]. This is written as <math display=\"inline\">\\; x = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} [x]_n \\;</math> or\n: ''x'' = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...,\nwhich is called an '''infinite decimal expansion''' of ''x''.\n\nConversely, for any integer [''x'']<sub>0</sub> and any sequence of digits <math display=\"inline\">\\;(d_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> the (infinite) expression  {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...}} is an ''infinite decimal expansion'' of a real number ''x''. This expansion is  unique if neither all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 9 nor all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 0 for ''n'' large enough (for all ''n'' greater than some natural number ''N'').\n\nIf all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > ''N'' equal to 9 and {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,}} the limit of the sequence <math display=\"inline\">\\;([x]_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: ''d''<sub>''N''</sub>, by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> + 1, and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nAny such decimal fraction, i.e., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0 for ''n'' > ''N'', may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> \u2212 1, and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nIn summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub>, and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> as the greatest number that is ''less'' than ''x'', having exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark.\n\n=== Rational numbers ===\n{{main|Repeating decimal}}\n\nThe [[long division]] allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a [[rational number]]. If the rational number is a [[#decimal fraction|decimal fraction]], the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many 0. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainder are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a ''repeating decimal''. For example,\n:{{sfrac|81}} = 0.&thinsp;012345679&thinsp;012... (with the group 012345679 indefinitely repeating).\n\nConversely, every eventually repeating sequence of digit is the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. This is a consequence of the fact that the recurring part of a decimal representation is, in fact, an infinite [[geometric series]] which will sum to a rational number. For example,\n:<math>0.0123123123\\ldots =\\frac{123}{10000} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty 0.001^k = \\frac{123}{10000}\\ \\frac{1}{1-0.001} = \\frac{123}{9990} = \\frac{41}{3330}</math>\n\n== Decimal computation ==\n\n[[File:Decimal multiplication table.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the world's earliest multiplication table ({{circa}} 305 BC) from the Warring States period]]\n\nModern [[computer]] hardware and software systems commonly use a [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]] internally (although many early computers, such as the [[ENIAC]] or the [[IBM 650]], used decimal representation internally).<ref>''Fingers or Fists?

(123.1, for example, is written as such in a computer program, even though many computer languages are unable to encode that number precisely.)\n\nBoth computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic.

All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly (e.g. 11 is expressed as \"tizenegy\" literally \"one on ten\"), as with those between 20 and 100 (23 as \"huszonh\u00e1rom\" = \"three on twenty\").\n\nA straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order (10 {{lang|zh|\u5341}}, 100 {{lang|zh|\u767e}}, 1000 {{lang|zh|\u5343}}, 10,000 {{lang|zh|\u4e07}}), and in which 11 is expressed as ''ten-one'' and 23 as ''two-ten-three'', and 89,345 is expressed as 8 (ten thousands) {{lang|zh|\u4e07}} 9 (thousand) {{lang|zh|\u5343}} 3 (hundred) {{lang|zh|\u767e}} 4 (tens) {{lang|zh|\u5341}} 5 is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a few irregularities.  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for the numbers between 10 and 20, and decades.

And yet, all Hellenes knew which localities were Dorian, and which were not. Dorian states at war could more likely, but not always, count on the assistance of other Dorian states. Dorians were distinguished by the [[Doric Greek]] dialect and by characteristic social and historical traditions.\n\nIn the 5th century BC, Dorians and [[Ionians]] were the two most politically important Greek ''[[Ethnic group|ethne]]'', whose ultimate clash resulted in the [[Peloponnesian War]]. The degree to which fifth-century Hellenes self-identified as \"Ionian\" or \"Dorian\" has itself been disputed. At one extreme \u00c9douard Will concludes that there was no true ethnic component in fifth-century Greek culture, in spite of anti-Dorian elements in Athenian propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|first=\u00c9douard|last=Will|title=Doriens et Ioniens: essai sur la valeur du crit\u00e8re ethnique appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de l'histoire et de la civilisation grecques|publisher=Belles Lettres|location=Paris|year=1956 | language=French}}</ref> At the other extreme John Alty reinterprets the sources to conclude that ethnicity did motivate fifth-century actions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alty|first=John|title=Dorians and Ionians|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=102|pages=1\u201314|year=1982|doi=10.2307/631122}}</ref> Moderns viewing these ethnic identifications through the 5th and 4th century BC literary tradition have been profoundly influenced by their own social politics.

One theory, widely believed in ancient times, is that they originated in the northern mountainous regions of [[Greece]], [[Macedon|ancient Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]], and obscure circumstances brought them south into the [[Peloponnese]], to certain [[Aegean Sea|Aegean islands]], [[Magna Graecia]], [[Lapithos]] and [[Ancient Crete|Crete]]. [[Greek mythology|Mythology]] gave them a Greek origin and [[eponym]]ous founder, [[Dorus]] son of [[Hellen]], the mythological [[patriarch]] of the [[Greeks|Hellenes]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Peloponnesian dialect replacement===\nThe origin of the Dorians is a multifaceted concept. In modern scholarship, the term has often meant the location of the population disseminating the Doric Greek dialect within a hypothetical [[Proto-Greek]] speaking population. The dialect is known from records of classical northwestern Greece, the [[Peloponnesus]] and [[Crete]] and some of the islands. The geographic and ethnic information found in the west's earliest known literary work, the ''[[Iliad]]'', combined with the administrative records of the former [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states, prove to universal satisfaction that East Greek speakers were once dominant in the Peloponnesus but suffered a setback there and were replaced at least in official circles by West Greek speakers. A historical event is associated with the overthrow, called anciently the ''Return of the Heracleidai'' and by moderns the [[Dorian Invasion]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThis theory of a return or invasion presupposes that West Greek speakers resided in northwest Greece but overran the Peloponnesus replacing the East Greek there with their own dialect. No records other than Mycenaean ones are known to have existed in the [[Bronze Age]] so a West Greek of that time and place can be neither proved nor disproved. West Greek speakers were in western Greece in classical times. Unlike the East Greeks, they are not associated with any evidence of displacement events. That provides circumstantial evidence that the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]] disseminated among the Hellenes of northwest Greece, a highly-mountainous and somewhat-isolated region.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Dorian invasion===\nThe [[Dorian invasion]] is a modern historical concept attempting to account for:\n* at least the replacement of dialects and traditions in southern Greece in pre-classical times\n* more generally, the distribution of the Dorians in [[Classical Greece]]\n* the presence of the Dorians in Greece at all\n\nOn the whole, none of the objectives has been met, but the investigations served to rule out various speculative hypotheses. Most scholars doubt that the Dorian invasion was the main cause of the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. The source of the West Greek speakers in the Peloponnese remains unattested by any solid evidence.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Post-migrational distribution of the Dorians===\n[[File:Lato - Prytaneion 01.jpg|thumb|Dorian site of [[Lato]] on the island of Crete]]\nThough most of the Doric invaders settled in the Peloponnese, they also settled on [[Rhodes]] and [[Sicily]], in what is now Southern Italy. In Asia Minor existed the Dorian Hexapolis (the six great Dorian cities): [[Halikarnassos]] (Halicarnassus) and [[Knidos]] (Cnidus) in [[Asia Minor]], [[Kos]], and [[Lindos]], [[Kameiros]], and [[Ialyssos]] on the island of Rhodes. The six cities would later become rivals with the [[Ionia]]n cities of Asia Minor. The Dorians also invaded [[Crete]]. The origin traditions remained strong into classical times: [[Thucydides]] saw the [[Peloponnesian War]] in part as \"Ionians fighting against Dorians\" and reported the tradition that the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusans]] in Sicily were of Dorian descent.<ref>[http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/thucydides-passages.php?pleaseget=7.57 7.57]</ref> Other such \"Dorian\" colonies, originally from Corinth, Megara, and the Dorian islands, dotted the southern coasts of Sicily from Syracuse to Selinus.

However, [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] doubted the validity of this derivation and asserted that no good etymology exists.<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 363.</ref>\n\n====Chosen Greeks====\nIt sometimes happens that different derivations of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word exploit similar-sounding Indo-European roots. Greek ''doru'', \"lance,\" is from the o-grade of Indo-European *''deru'', \"solid,\" in the sense of wood. It is similar to an extended form, *''d\u014d-ro-'', of ''*d\u014d-'', (give), as can be seen in the modern Greek imperative \u03b4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5 (''dose'', \"give [sing.]!\") appearing in Greek as \u03b4\u1ff6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (''d\u014dron'', \"gift\").  This is the path taken by [[Jonathan M. Hall|Jonathan Hall]], relying on elements taken from the myth of the Return of the Herakeidai.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jonathan | last=Hall | title=Hellenicity: between ethnicity and culture | year=2002 | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago | pages=85\u201389}}</ref>\n\nHall cites the tradition, based on a fragment of the poet, [[Tyrtaeus]], that \"Sparta is a divine gift granted by Zeus and Hera\" to the Heracleidae. In another version, [[Tyndareus]] gives his kingdom to Heracles in gratitude for restoring him to the throne, but Heracles \"asks the Spartan king to safeguard the gift until his descendants might claim it.\"\n\nHall, therefore, proposes that the Dorians are the people of the gift. They assumed the name on taking possession of Lacedaemon. Doris was subsequently named after them. Hall makes comparisons of Spartans to Hebrews as a chosen people maintaining a covenant with God and being assigned a Holy Land. To arrive at this conclusion, Hall relies on Herodotus' version of the myth (see below) that the Hellenes under Dorus did not take his name until reaching the Peloponnesus. In other versions the Heracleidae enlisted the help of their Dorian neighbors. Hall does not address the problem of the Dorians not calling Lacedaemon Doris, but assigning that name to some less holy and remoter land. Similarly, he does not mention the Dorian servant at Pylos, whose sacred gift, if such it was, was still being ruled by the Achaean Atreid family at Lacedaemon.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nA minor, and perhaps regrettably forgotten, episode in the history of scholarship was the attempt to emphasize the etymology of Doron with the meaning of 'hand'. This in turn was connected to an interpretation of the famous lambda on Spartan shields, which was to rather stand for a hand with outstanding thumb than the initial letter of Lacedaimon.<ref>{{cite book | first=Gilbert | last= Murray | title= The Rise of Greek Epic |origyear=1907|year= 1934 | location=Oxford | publisher=OUP | pages=39 n.2}}</ref> Given the origin of the Spartan shield lambda legend, however, in a fragment by [[Eupolis]], an Athenian comic poet, there has been a recent attempt to suggest that a comic confusion between the letter and the hand image may yet have been intended.\n\n===Distinctions of language===\n{{main article|Doric Greek}}\nThe [[Doric Greek|Doric]] dialect was spoken in northwest Greece, the [[Peloponnese]], [[Crete]], southwest [[Asia Minor]], the southernmost islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], and the various Dorian colonies of [[Magna Graecia]] in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]]. After the classical period, it was mainly replaced by the [[Attic Greek|Attic]] dialect upon which the [[Koine Greek|Koine]] or \"common\" Greek language of the [[Hellenistic period]] was based.

The most copious authors, however, lived in Hellenistic and Roman times, long after the main events. This apparent paradox does not necessarily discredit the later writers, who were relying on earlier works that did not survive. The customs of the [[Sparta]]n state and its illustrious individuals are detailed at great length in such authors as [[Plutarch]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===[[Homer]]===\nThe ''[[Odyssey]]'' has one reference to the Dorians:<ref>Book 19, Line 177.</ref><blockquote>\"There is a land called [[Crete]], in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair, rich land, begirt with water, and therein are many men, past counting, and ninety cities.

In the ''Odyssey'', Odysseus and his relatives visit those states. Two solutions are possible, either the ''Odyssey'' is anachronistic or Dorians were on Crete in Mycenaean times.

He helped to establish the Spartan constitution, giving the kings and elders, among other powers, the power to dismiss the assembly. He established a rigorous military training program for the young including songs and poems he wrote himself, such as the \"Embateria or Songs of the Battle-Charge which are also called Enoplia or Songs-under-Arms.\" These were chants used to establish the timing of standard drills under arms.

These races, Ionian and Dorian, were the foremost in ancient time, the first a Pelasgian and the second a Hellenic people. The Pelasgian race has never yet left its home; the Hellenic has wandered often and far. For in the days of king Deucalion it inhabited the land of Phthia, then the country called Histiaean, under Ossa and Olympus, in the time of Dorus son of Hellen; driven from this Histiaean country by the Cadmeans, it settled about Pindus in the territory called Macedonian; from there again it migrated to Dryopia, and at last came from Dryopia into the Peloponnese, where it took the name of Dorian.\n\n1.57.1-3 What language the Pelasgians spoke I cannot say definitely. But if one may judge by those that still remain of the Pelasgians who live above the Tyrrheni1 in the city of Creston\u2014who were once neighbors of the people now called Dorians, and at that time inhabited the country which now is called Thessalian and of the Pelasgians who inhabited Placia and Scylace on the Hellespont, who came to live among the Athenians, and by other towns too which were once Pelasgian and afterwards took a different name: if, as I said, one may judge by these, the Pelasgians spoke a language which was not Greek. If, then, all the Pelasgian stock spoke so, then the Attic nation, being of Pelasgian blood, must have changed its language too at the time when it became part of the Hellenes. For the people of Creston and Placia have a language of their own in common, which is not the language of their neighbors; and it is plain that they still preserve the manner of speech which they brought with them in their migration into the places where they live. \n\n1.58 But the Hellenic stock, it seems clear to me, has always had the same language since its beginning; yet being, when separated from the Pelasgians, few in number, they have grown from a small beginning to comprise a multitude of nations, chiefly because the Pelasgians and many other foreign peoples united themselves with them. Before that, I think, the Pelasgic stock nowhere increased much in number while it was of foreign speech. \n</blockquote>\nThus, according to Herodotus, the Dorians did not name themselves after Dorus until they had reached Peloponnesus. Herodotus does not explain the contradictions of the myth; for example, how Doris, located outside the Peloponnesus, acquired its name. However, his goal, as he relates in the beginning of the first book, is only to report what he had heard from his sources without judgement.

As can be seen in the texts, the French declaration was heavily influenced by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment and principles of human rights as was the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] which preceded it (4 July 1776).\n\nAccording to a legal textbook published in 2007, the declaration is in the spirit of \"secular natural law\", which does not base itself on religious doctrine or authority, in contrast with traditional [[natural law]] theory, which does.<ref name=\"Merryman 2007 16\">{{cite book| last = Merryman| first = John Henry|author2=Rogelierdomo| title = The civil law tradition: an introduction to the legal system of Europe and Latin America| publisher=Stanford University Press | year = 2007| location =| page = 16| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6OJf9CbgKTkC&pg=PA16&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen#v=onepage&q=Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen&f=false| doi =| id =| isbn =9780804755696 }}</ref>\n\nThe declaration defines a single set of individual and collective rights for all men. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights are held to be [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] and valid in all times and places. For example, \"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.\"<ref>First Article, Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</ref> They have certain natural rights to [[property]], to liberty, and to life. According to this theory, the role of government is to recognize and secure these rights. Furthermore, government should be carried on by elected representatives.<ref name=\"Merryman 2007 16\"/>\n\nAt the time of writing, the rights contained in the declaration were only awarded to men. Furthermore, the declaration was a statement of vision rather than reality. The declaration was not deeply rooted in either the practice of the West or even France at the time. The declaration emerged in the late 18th century out of war and revolution. It encountered opposition as democracy and [[individual rights]] were frequently regarded as synonymous with [[anarchy]] and [[subversion]]. The declaration embodies ideals and aspirations towards which France pledged to struggle in the future.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| authorlink = | title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| location =| page = 32| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| doi =| id = | isbn =9780812218541 }}</ref>\n\n==Substance==\n\nThe Declaration is introduced by a preamble describing the fundamental characteristics of the rights which are qualified as being \"natural, unalienable and sacred\" and consisting of \"simple and incontestable principles\" on which citizens could base their demands. In the second article, \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" are defined as \"liberty, property, security and [[right of revolution|resistance to oppression]]\". It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to [[feudalism]] and to exemptions from taxation, freedom and equal rights for all \"Men\", and access to public office based on talent. The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process. [[Freedom of speech]] and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed.<ref>{{cite book| last = Spielvogel| first = Jackson J.| title = Western Civilization: 1300 to 1815| publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | year = 2008| location = | page = 580| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0QKxEJF-zQQC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen | isbn = 978-0-495-50289-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe Declaration also asserted the principles of [[popular sovereignty]], in contrast to the [[divine right of kings]] that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, \"All the citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents,\" eliminating the special rights of the nobility and clergy.<ref>{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|url=https://www.academia.edu/9869783/The_French_Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=85\u201388}}</ref>\n\n===Articles===\n{{Copy section to Wikisource}}\n\n'''Article I''' \u2013 Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.  Social distinctions can be founded only on the common good.\n\n'''Article II''' \u2013 The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.  These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression.\n\n'''Article III''' \u2013 The principle of any sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation.  No body, no individual can exert authority which does not emanate expressly from it.\n\n'''Article IV''' \u2013 Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the fruition of these same rights.  These borders can be determined only by the law.\n\n'''Article V''' \u2013 The law has the right to forbid only actions harmful to society.  Anything which is not forbidden by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it does not order.\n\n'''Article VI''' \u2013 The law is the expression of the general will.

Those who were deemed to hold these political rights were called active citizens. [[Active citizenship]] was granted to men who were French, at least 25 years old, paid taxes equal to three days work, and could not be defined as servants [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/ (Thouret)].<ref>Thouret 1789, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/</ref> This meant that at the time of the Declaration only male property owners held these rights.<ref>Censer and Hunt 2001, p. 55.</ref>  The deputies in the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] believed that only those who held tangible interests in the nation could make informed political decisions.<ref name=\"Popkin 2006, p. 46\">Popkin 2006, p. 46.</ref> This distinction directly affects articles 6, 12, 14, and 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen as each of these rights is related to the right to vote and to participate actively in the government. With the decree of 29 October 1789, the term active citizen became embedded in French politics.<ref name=\"Doyle 1989, p. 124\">Doyle 1989, p. 124.</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[passive citizens]] was created to encompass those populations that had been excluded from political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. Because of the requirements set down for active citizens, the vote was granted to approximately 4.3 million Frenchmen<ref name=\"Doyle 1989, p. 124\"/> out of a population of around 29 million.<ref>[http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap1a.html \"Social Causes of the Revolution\"]</ref>  These omitted groups included women, slaves, children, and foreigners. As these measures were voted upon by the General Assembly, they limited the rights of certain groups of citizens while implementing the democratic process of the new [[French First Republic|French Republic (1792\u20131804)]].<ref name=\"Popkin 2006, p. 46\"/> This legislation, passed in 1789, was amended by the creators of the [[Constitution of the Year III]] in order to eliminate the label of active citizen.<ref name=\"Doyle 1989, p. 420\">Doyle 1989, p. 420.</ref> The power to vote was then, however, to be granted solely to substantial property owners.<ref name=\"Doyle 1989, p. 420\"/>\n\nTensions arose between active and passive citizens throughout the Revolution. This happened when passive citizens started to call for more rights, or when they openly refused to listen to the ideals set forth by active citizens. This [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/ cartoon] clearly demonstrates the difference that existed between the active and passive citizens along with the tensions associated with such differences.<ref>\"Active/Passive Citizen\", http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/.</ref> In the cartoon, a passive citizen is holding a spade and a wealthy landowning active citizen is ordering the passive citizens to go to work. The act appears condescending to the passive citizen and it revisits the reasons why the French Revolution began in the first place.\n\nWomen, in particular, were strong passive citizens who played a significant role in the Revolution. [[Olympe de Gouges]] penned her [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] in 1791 and drew attention to the need for gender equality.<ref>De Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Women\", 1791.</ref> By supporting the ideals of the French Revolution and wishing to expand them to women, she represented herself as a revolutionary citizen. Madame Roland also established herself as an influential figure throughout the Revolution. She saw women of the French Revolution as holding three roles; \"inciting revolutionary action, formulating policy, and informing others of revolutionary events.\"<ref>Dalton 2001, p. 1.</ref> By working with men, as opposed to working separate from men, she may have been able to further the fight of revolutionary women. As players in the French Revolution, women occupied a significant role in the civic sphere by forming social movements and participating in popular clubs, allowing them societal influence, despite their lack of direct political influence.<ref>Levy and Applewhite 2002, pp. 319\u201320, 324.</ref>\n\n===Women's rights===\nThe Declaration recognized many rights as belonging to citizens (who could only be male). This was despite the fact that after [[The March on Versailles]] on 5 October 1789, women presented the [[Women's Petition to the National Assembly]] in which they proposed a decree giving women equal rights.<ref>[https://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/629/ Women's Petition to the National Assembly<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1790, [[Nicolas de Condorcet]] and [[Etta Palm d'Aelders]] unsuccessfully called on the National Assembly to extend civil and political rights to women.<ref>{{cite book |title=Letters written in France |last=Williams |first= Helen Maria |authorlink= |author2=Neil Fraistat |author3=Susan Sniader Lanser |author4=David Brookshire  |year=2001 |publisher=Broadview Press Ltd |location= |isbn=978-1-55111-255-8 |page=246  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ruwz82RicgC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref> Condorcet declared that \"he who votes against the right of another, whatever the religion, color, or sex of that other, has henceforth abjured his own\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The evolution of international human rights |last=Lauren |first=Paul Gordon |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-8122-1854-1 |pages=18\u201320 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref> The French Revolution did not lead to a recognition of [[women's rights]] and this prompted [[Olympe de Gouges]] to publish the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] in September 1791.<ref>{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431\u20131933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=136 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen is modeled on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that:\n\n<blockquote>This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights, they have lost in society.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as \"almost a parody... of the original document\". The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that \"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.\" The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: \"Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility\".\n\nDe Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights, declaring \"Women have the right to mount the scaffold, they must also have the right to mount the speaker's rostrum\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431\u20131933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Slavery===\nThe declaration did not revoke the institution of slavery, as lobbied for by Jacques-Pierre Brissot's ''[[Slavery abolition efforts by Les Amis des Noirs|Les Amis des Noirs]]'' and defended by the group of colonial planters called the Club Massiac because they met at the H\u00f4tel Massiac.<ref>The club of reactionary colonial proprietors meeting since July 1789 were opposed to representation in the Assembl\u00e9e of France's overseas dominions, for fear \"that this would expose delicate colonial issues to the hazards of debate in the Assembly\", as Robin Blackburn expressed it (Blackburn, The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery, 1776\u20131848 [1988:174f]); see also the speech of [[Jean-Baptiste Belley]]</ref> Despite the lack of explicit mention of slavery in the Declaration, slave uprisings in [[Saint-Domingue]] in the [[Haitian Revolution]] were inspired by it, as discussed in [[C. L. R. James]]' history of the Haitian Revolution, ''[[The Black Jacobins]]''.<ref>Cf. Heinrich August Winkler (2012), ''Geschichte des Westens. Von den Anf\u00e4ngen in der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Third Edition, Munich (Germany), p. 386</ref>\n\nDeplorable conditions for the thousands of slaves in Saint-Domingue, the most profitable slave colony in the world, led to the uprisings which would be known as the first successful slave revolt in the New World. [[Free persons of color]] were part of the first wave of revolt, but later former slaves took control. In 1794 the Convention dominated by the Jacobins [[Abolitionism#First general abolition of slavery|abolished]] slavery, including in the colonies of Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe. However, Napoleon reinstated it in 1802 and attempted to regain control of Saint-Domingue by sending in thousands of troops. After suffering the losses of two-thirds of the men, many to yellow fever, the French withdrew from Saint-Domingue in 1803. Napoleon gave up on North America and agreed to the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States. In 1804, the leaders of Saint-Domingue declared it as an independent state, the [[Republic of Haiti]], the second republic of the New World.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nThe Declaration has also influenced and inspired rights-based [[liberal democracy]] throughout the world. It was translated as soon as 1793\u20131794 by Colombian [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], who published it despite the [[Inquisition]]. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for doing so. In 2003, the document was listed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World register]].\n\n===Constitution of the French Fifth Republic===\n{{main|Constitution of the French Fifth Republic}}\nAccording to the [[preamble]] of the [[Constitution of the French Fifth Republic]] (adopted on 4 October 1958, and the current constitution), the principles set forth in the Declaration have constitutional value. Many laws and regulations have been canceled because they did not comply with those principles as interpreted by the [[Conseil Constitutionnel]] (\"Constitutional Council of France\") or by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]'' (\"Council of State\").\n* Taxation legislation or practices that seem to make some unwarranted difference between citizens are struck down as unconstitutional.\n* Suggestions of [[positive discrimination]] on ethnic grounds are rejected because they infringe on the principle of equality, since they would establish categories of people that would, by birth, enjoy greater rights.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Human rights in France]]\n* [[Universality (philosophy)|Universality]]\n\n===Other early declarations of rights===\n* [[Cortes of Le\u00f3n|The decreta of Le\u00f3n]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-decreta-of-leon-of-1188-the-oldest-documentary-manifestation-of-the-european-parliamentary-system/|title=The Decreta of Le\u00f3n of 1188 - The oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:5e01f9da-8205-47ee-8053-2c3a68e198ef/decreta-leon-version-espanola.pdf|title=Versi\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola de los Decreta de Le\u00f3n de 1188|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Spanish MINISTERIO DE EDUCACI\u00d3N, CULTURA Y DEPORTE|website=www.mecd.gob.es|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> (Modern-day Spain 1188)\n* [[Magna Carta]] {{small|(England, 1215)}}\n* [[Statute of Kalisz]] {{small|(Poland, 1264)}}\n* [[Henrician Articles]] and [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta Conventa]] {{small|(Poland, 1573)}}\n* [[Petition of Right]] {{small|(England, 1628)}}\n* [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] {{small|(England, 1689)}}\n* [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] {{small|(Scotland, 1689)}}\n* [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] {{small|(United States, 1776)}}\n* [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] {{small|(United States, 1789)}}\n* [[Republic of Li\u00e8ge|Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of Franchimont]] {{small|(modern-day Belgium, 16 September 1789)}}\n* [[Committee of United Belgians and Li\u00e9geois|\"Belgian\" Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] {{small|(exiled [[Brabantine Revolution|Belgian]] and [[Li\u00e8ge Revolution|Li\u00e9geois revolutionaries]] in Paris, 23 April 1792)}}\n* [[Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland|\"Batavian\" Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] {{small|([[Batavian Republic]], The Hague, 31 January 1795)}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Jack Censer and Lynn Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution'', University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2001.\n* Susan Dalton, ''Gender and the Shifting Ground of Revolutionary Politics: The Case of Madame Roland'', ''Canadian Journal of History'', 36, no. 2 (2001): 259\u201383.\n* William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989.\n* Darline Levy and Harriet Applewhite, ''A Political Revolution for Women?

Originally published in 1835 as '''Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God''', editions of the book continue to be printed mainly by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and the [[Community of Christ]] (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints [RLDS Church]).\n\nThe book originally contained two parts: a sequence of [[Lectures on Faith|lectures]] setting forth basic church doctrine, followed by a compilation of important revelations, or \"covenants\" of the church: thus the name \"Doctrine and Covenants\". The \"doctrine\" portion of the book, however, has been removed by both the LDS Church and the Community of Christ. The remaining portion of the book contains revelations on numerous topics, most of which were dictated by the movement's founder [[Joseph Smith]], supplemented by materials periodically added by each denomination.\n\nControversy has existed between the two largest denominations of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] over some sections added to the 1876 LDS edition, attributed to founder Smith. Whereas the LDS Church believes these sections to have been revelations to Smith,<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/132 ''Section 132'', scriptures.lds.org], accessed December 26, 2008.</ref> the RLDS Church traditionally disputed their authenticity.<ref>[http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/dc/ldc-marr.htm ''Differences between the RLDS and LDS Doctrine and Covenants on the subject of Marriage''], accessed December 26, 2008.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Doctrine and Covenants was first published in 1835 as a later version of the [[Book of Commandments]], which had been partially printed in 1833. This earlier book contained 65 early [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] to church leaders, including [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]]. Before many copies of the book could be printed, the printing press and most of the printed copies were destroyed by a mob in [[Missouri]].\n[[File:Book of Commandments.jpg|thumb|125px|left|<center>Title page of the 1903 reprint of the Book of Commandments.</center>]]\nOn September 24, 1834, a committee was appointed by the general assembly of the church to organize a new volume containing the most significant revelations. This committee of Presiding [[Elder (Mormonism)|Elder]]s, consisting of Smith, Cowdery, [[Sidney Rigdon]], and [[Frederick G. Williams]], began to review and revise numerous revelations for inclusion in the new work. The committee eventually organized the book into two parts: a \"Doctrine\" part and a \"Covenants\" part.\n[[File:D&C 1835.jpg|thumb|125px|<center>Title page of the original 1835 edition.</center>]]\nThe \"Doctrine\" part of the book consisted of a theological course now called the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\". The lectures were a series of doctrinal courses used in the [[School of the Prophets]] which had recently been completed in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. According to the committee, these lectures were included in the compilation \"in consequence of their embracing the important doctrine of salvation.\"<ref name = 1835preface>''See'' 1835 D&C, Preface.</ref>\nThe \"Covenants\" part of the book, labeled \"Covenants and Commandments of the Lord, to his servants of the church of the Latter Day Saints\", contained a total of 103 revelations. These 103 revelations were said to \"contain items or principles for the regulation of the church, as taken from the revelations which have been given since its organization, as well as from former ones.\"<ref name = 1835preface/> Each of the 103 revelations was assigned a \"section number\"; however, section 66 was mistakenly used twice. Thus, the sections of the original work were numbered only to 102.\n\nOn February 17, 1835, after the committee had selected the book's contents, the committee wrote that the resulting work represents \"our belief, and when we say this, humbly trust, the faith and principles of this society as a body.\"<ref name = 1835preface/>\n\nThe book was first introduced to the church body in a general conference on August 17, 1835. Smith and Williams, two of the Presiding Elders on the committee, were absent, but Cowdery and Rigdon were present. The church membership at the time had not yet seen the Doctrine and Covenants manuscript as it had been compiled and revised solely by the committee; however, various church members who were familiar with the work \"bore record\" of the book's truth. At the end of the conference, the church \"by a unanimous vote\" agreed to accept the compilation as \"the doctrine and covenants of their faith\" and to make arrangements for its printing.<ref>Joseph Smith, [[B. H. Roberts]] (ed.) (1902). ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':243\u201346.</ref>\n\nIn 1835, the book was printed and published under the title ''Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God''.\n\n==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints editions==\nIn [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), '''The Doctrine and Covenants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' stands alongside the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], and [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|The Pearl of Great Price]] as scripture. Together the LDS Church's scriptures are referred to as the \"[[standard works]]\". The LDS Church's version of the Doctrine and Covenants is described by the church as \"containing revelations given to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, with some additions by his successors in the Presidency of the Church.\"<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/contents LDS 1981 D&C Title Page]</ref>\n\n===Sections added to LDS edition===\nThe 138 sections and two official declarations in LDS Church's Doctrine and Covenants break down as follows:\n*Sections 1\u2013134, 137: From the presidency of [[Joseph Smith]] (1828\u201344)\n*Sections 135\u2013136: During the administration of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]] (1844\u201347)\n*[[Official Declaration 1]]: From the presidency of [[Wilford Woodruff]] (1889\u201398)\n*Section 138: From the presidency of [[Joseph F. Smith]] (1901\u201318)\n*[[Official Declaration 2]]: From the presidency of [[Spencer W. Kimball]] (1973\u201385)\n\nThe following sections are not revelations, but letters, reports, statements, and other similar documents: 102, 123, 127\u2013131, 134, 135, and Official Declarations 1 and 2.\n\nIn 1844, the church added eight sections not included in the 1835 edition. In the current edition, these added sections are numbered 103, 105, 112, 119, 124, 127, 128, and 135.\n\nIn 1876, a new LDS Church edition renumbered most of the sections in a roughly chronological order instead of the earlier topical order, and included 26 sections not included in previous editions, now numbered as sections 2, 13, 77, 85, 87, 108\u2013111, 113\u2013118, 120\u2013123, 125, 126, 129\u2013132, and 136. Previous editions had been divided into verses with the early versifications generally following the paragraph structure of the original text. It was with the 1876 edition that the currently used versification was first employed.\n\nDuring the 1880s, five foreign editions contained two revelations to [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] that were received in 1882 and 1883; these revelations \"set in order\" the priesthood, gave more clarification about the roles of priesthood offices\u2014especially the [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]]\u2014and required \"men who ... preside over my [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]]\" to live [[plural marriage]] in order to qualify to hold their church positions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holzapfel|first1=Richard|last2=Jones|first2=Christopher|title=\"John the Revelator\": The Written Revelations of John Taylor|url=http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/champion-liberty-john-taylor/john-revelator-written-revelations-john-taylor#_ednref99|website=BYU Religious Studies Center|accessdate=2014-12-16}}</ref> Due to the LDS Church's change in attitude to polygamy in 1890, these sections were not included in future English editions of the Doctrine and Covenants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nIn 1930, a small volume edited by [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[James E. Talmage]] titled ''Latter-day Revelations'' was published, which was a highly edited selective version of the Doctrine and Covenants. Talmage wrote that the book's purpose was \"to make the strictly doctrinal parts of the Doctrine and Covenants of easy access and reduce its bulk\" by including only \"the sections comprising scriptures of general and enduring value\".<ref name = bringhurst>Newell G.

These were accounts of two visions, one from [[Joseph Smith]] in 1837 and the other from his nephew, [[Joseph F. Smith]], in 1918. The revelations were earlier accepted as scripture when added to the Pearl of Great Price in April 1976.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | coauthors =\n | title =Scriptural Text for Visions Added to Pearl of Great Price\n | journal =[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]\n | volume =\n | issue =\n | page =127\n | publisher =\n | location =\n | date=May 1976\n | url =http://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/05/scriptural-text-for-visions-added-to-pearl-of-great-price\n | doi =\n | id =\n | accessdate = }}</ref> No new revelatory sections have been added since 1981.\n\nThe LDS Church's 1981 edition contains two \"Official Declarations\" at the book's conclusion. The 1890 [[1890 Manifesto|Official Declaration 1]] ended the church-authorized practice of plural marriage, and the 1978 [[Official Declaration 2]] announces the opening of [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] ordination to all worthy male members without regard to race or color. The two Official Declarations are not revelations, but they serve as the formal announcements that a revelation was received. In neither case is the revelation included in the Doctrine and Covenants. The text of Official Declaration 1 has been included in every LDS Church printing of the Doctrine and Covenants since 1908.\n\n===Portions removed from the LDS edition===\n\nIn 1876, section 101 from the 1835 edition (and subsequent printings) was removed. Section 101 was a \"Statement on Marriage\" as adopted by an 1835 conference of the church,<ref>''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':247.</ref><ref>''[[Messenger and Advocate]]'', August 1835, p. 163</ref> and contained the following text: \n{{quote|Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.<ref>[http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835#259 Doctrine and Covenants (1835 edition) 101:4].</ref> }} \nThis section was removed because it had been superseded by section 132 of the modern LDS edition, recorded in 1843, which contains a revelation received by Joseph Smith on [[eternal marriage]] and [[plural marriage]], the principles of which can be dated to as early as 1831.\n\nIn 1921, the LDS Church removed the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\" portion of the book, with an explanation that the lectures \"were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons\".<ref>''See'' Introduction, 1921 edition.</ref> The lectures contain theology concerning the [[Godhead (Mormonism)|Godhead]] and emphasize the importance of faith and works.\n\nUntil 1981, editions of the book used [[List of code names in the Doctrine and Covenants|code names for certain people and places]] in those sections that dealt with the [[United Order]]. The 1981 LDS edition replaced these with the real names, relegating the code names to footnotes. The Community of Christ edition still uses the code names.\n\n==Community of Christ editions==\nOfficials of [[Community of Christ]] (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) first published an edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1864, based on the previous 1844 edition. A [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|general conference]] of the church in 1878 approved a resolution that declared that the revelations of the [[President of the Church|Prophet-President]] [[Joseph Smith III]] had equal standing to those previously included in the work. Since that time, the church has continued to add sections to its edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, containing the revelations of succeeding Prophet\u2013Presidents. The most recent addition was formally authorized on April 14, 2010, after being presented to the church for informal consideration on January 17, 2010. The numbers of the sections and versification differ from the edition published by the LDS Church and both modern editions differ from the original 1835 edition numeration.\n\nRegarding the contents of the Doctrine and Covenants, the church has stated: \"As with other books of scripture, the various passages vary in their enduring quality.\"<ref>[http://www.communityofchrist.net/Scriptures/Doctrine_and_Covenants/doctrine_and_covenants.html \"Doctrine and Covenants\"], communityofchrist.net.</ref>\n\n===Sections added to Community of Christ edition===\nThe 167 sections of the Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants break down as follows:\n*Sections 1\u2013113 (includes 108A): From the presidency of [[Joseph Smith]] (1828\u201344)\n*Sections 114\u2013131: From the presidency of [[Joseph Smith III]] (1860\u20131914)\n*Sections 132\u2013138: From the presidency of [[Frederick M. Smith]] (1914\u201346)\n*Sections 139\u2013144: From the presidency of [[Israel A. Smith]] (1946\u201358)\n*Sections 145\u2013152 (includes 149A): From the presidency of [[W. Wallace Smith]] (1958\u201378)\n*Sections 153\u2013160: From the presidency of [[Wallace B. Smith]] (1978\u201396)\n*Sections 161\u2013162: From the presidency of [[W. Grant McMurray]] (1996\u20132004)\n*Sections 163\u2013165: From the presidency of [[Stephen M. Veazey]] (2005\u2013)\n\nThe following sections are not revelations, but letters, reports, statements, and other similar documents: 99, 108A, 109\u2013113, and 123.\n\nBased on the above, the number of revelations (accounting for sections that are not revelations) presented by each Community of Christ president, are as follows:\n\n*Joseph Smith: 107\n*Joseph Smith III: 17\n*Frederick M. Smith: 7\n*Israel A. Smith: 6\n*W. Wallace Smith: 9\n*Wallace B. Smith: 8\n*W. Grant McMurray: 2\n*Stephen M. Veazey: 3\n\n===Portions removed from the Community of Christ edition===\nCommunity of Christ removed the \"Lectures on Faith\" in 1897. The 1970 [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] concluded that several sections that had been added between the 1835 and 1844 editions\u2014mainly dealing with the subjects of [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple worship]] and [[baptism for the dead]]\u2014had been published without proper approval of a church conference. As a result, the World Conference removed sections 107, 109, 110, 113, and 123 to a historical appendix, which also includes documents that were never published as sections. Of these, only section 107 was a revelation. The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 108A contained the minutes of a business meeting, which, because of its historical nature, was moved to the Introduction in the 1970s. After 1990, the Introduction was updated, and what was section 108A was removed entirely.\n\n===Doctrinal developments in the Community of Christ edition===\nThe ongoing additions to the Community of Christ edition provide a record of the leadership changes and doctrinal developments within the denomination. When W. Grant McMurray became Prophet-President, he declared that instruction specific to leadership changes would no longer be included, so that the focus of the work could be more doctrinal in nature, and less administrative. The record of these leadership changes are still maintained in the form of published \"letters of counsel.\" Prophet\u2013President Stephen M. Veazey has conformed to this pattern. Although these letters are not formally published in the Doctrine and Covenants, they are still deemed to be inspired, and are dealt with in the same manner that revelations are (that is, they must be deliberated and approved by the voting members of a World Conference).\n\nA modern revelation that resulted in some \"disaffection\" and \"led to intense conflict in scattered areas of the RLDS Church\"<ref>{{citation |last= Howard |first= Richard P. |authorlink= Richard P.

Smith and added in 1984, which called for the [[ordination of women]] to the priesthood and set out the primary purpose of [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] to be \"the pursuit of peace\".<ref>[http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/dc/rdc-156.htm D&C Section 156].</ref> A resulting schism over the legitimacy of these change led to the formation of the [[Restoration Branches]] movement, the [[Restoration Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] and the [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].\n\nWhile some of the prose in the new revelations seems designed to guide the denomination on matters of church governance and doctrine, others are seen as inspirational. One such example can be cited from section 161, presented as counsel to the church by [[W. Grant McMurray]] in 1996: \"Become a people of the Temple\u2014those who see violence but proclaim peace, who feel conflict yet extend the hand of reconciliation, who encounter broken spirits and find pathways for healing.\"\n\n==Editions used by other denominations==\nThe [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]] uses the 1846 edition that was published in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]; this version is virtually identical to the 1844 edition. Most recently a facsimile reprint was produced for the church at [[Voree, Wisconsin]] by Richard Drew in 1993.\n\nThe [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] contends that the thousands of changes made to the original revelations as published in the [[Book of Commandments]] (including the change of the church's name) are not doctrinal and result from Joseph Smith's fall from his original calling. As a result, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) prefers to use reprints of the Book of Commandments text.\n\nThe [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]] accepts the 1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, including the Lectures on Faith, which it insists are as much inspired as the revelations themselves.\n\nThe [[Restoration Branches]] generally use the older RLDS Church Doctrine and Covenants, typically sections 1\u2013144.\n\nThe [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] uses the older RLDS Church version of the Doctrine and Covenants up to section 144, and also continues to add new revelations from their president, [[Frederick Niels Larsen]].\n\n[[Remnant movement|\"Remnant\" movement]], a spiritual movement in schism with the LDS Church, published an online \"Restoration\" edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 2017. It includes any sections authored by Joseph Smith. It also: includes a new version of D&C 54, as revised by [[Denver Snuffer]];<ref>{{cite book|title = Restoration edition [preview] Doctrine and Covenants; Pearls of Great Price|url = http://scriptures.info/Home/Downloads|chapter = Section 54: Revelation given to Joseph Smith, Nauvoo, Illinois, 12 July 1843.

When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of \"decease\", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of \"cremation\" and \"remains\".\n\n== Senescence ==\n[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]\n\n[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick & Moody, 2003).\n\nAlmost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as \"senescence\".

As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref> Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.\n\nIt is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.<ref>{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

Thus, the definition of \"life\" simultaneously defines death.\n\nHistorically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.\n\nThe category of \"brain death\" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: \"By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant \"brain-dead\" women).\"<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616\u2013620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}</ref>\n\nThose people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&nbsp;\u2013 irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&nbsp;\u2013 has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nEven by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.\n\n===Legal===\n{{See also|Legal death}}\n\nThe death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.\nA [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.\n\n===Misdiagnosed===\n{{See also|Premature burial}}\n[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]\nThere are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then \"coming back to life\", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}</ref> and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&nbsp;71.}}</ref> Writing in 1895, the physician J.C.

It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].\n\nAutopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.\n\nA \"necropsy\" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.\n\n== Cryonics ==\n[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]\n{{Main|Cryonics}}\n\n[[Cryonics]] (from Greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03c2 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.<ref>{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote=\"Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing \u2013 usually in liquid nitrogen \u2013 of human beings who have been legally declared dead.

Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.\n\nA United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.\n\nResearchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as \"biomedical [[gerontologist]]s\".

Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called \"life extensionists\" or \"longevists\".

The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.\n\nDeath is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].\n\nLegal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.\n\n[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]\n[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty.

Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.\n\n[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].\n\nIn [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cart\u00f3rio, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cart\u00f3rio.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204\u2013220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}</ref>\n\nTalking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.\n\n== Consciousness ==\n{{Main|Consciousness after death}}\n\nMuch interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.\n\n== In biology ==\n[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]] \nAfter death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.\n\n[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.\n\n=== Natural selection ===\n{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}\n\nContemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.\n\n=== Extinction ===\n{{Main|Extinction}}\n[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.

The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappear\" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] \u2013 and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.\n\n=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===\n{{Main|Evolution of aging}}\n\nInquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.\n\nOrganisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are \"immortal\" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident.

Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|\"deathless\"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.<ref name=\"Blum 2004\">{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York (u.a.)|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}</ref>\n\nDeath is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|dependent origination]].<ref name=\"Blum 2004\" />\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]\n{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}\nDeath is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.

The standard way to render this word is as \ud801\udc3a\ud801\udc49\ud801\udc2c\ud801\udc3f\ud801\udc2f\ud801\udc4c ({{IPA|/bro\u028ak\u025bn/}}).]]\n\n=== Representation of {{IPA|/\u0259/}} ===\nThe Deseret alphabet does not have a distinct symbol for the [[mid central vowel]] ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}, \"schwa\"). The lack of a schwa has been cited as the biggest \"[[phonological]] flaw\" in the alphabet.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\nBecause of the lack of a schwa, the author must write the sound that would be used if the word was stressed. For example, the word ''enough'' is commonly pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8n\u0250f]}}, but when it is stressed (as in a declaration of irritation) it is pronounced {{IPA|[i\u02c8n\u0250f]}}. The Deseret spelling of the word, \ud801\udc28\ud801\udc4c\ud801\udc32\ud801\udc41, reflects that stressed pronunciation. If {{IPA|/\u0259/}} does not have an inherent stressed value in a word, as is often the case before {{IPA|/r/}}, then it is written as \ud801\udc32.<ref name=\":14\" />{{Rp|32\u201333}}\n\n[[Marion J. Shelton]], an early [[Mormon missionary]], proposed the addition of a new glyph to represent the schwa, a simple vertical line of the same height as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the [[Turkish dotless i]] (\u0131). The addition of this glyph did not catch on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|19\u201320}} Shelton used the new glyph in an 1860 letter to Brigham Young reporting on a recently completed mission to the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute people]].<ref>{{Cite letter|last=Shelton|first=Marion J.|url=https://dcms.lds.org/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE3956499|date=3 April 1860|title=Beloved brother, it is with heartfelt gratitude to my Heavenly Father...|recipient=Brigham Young}}</ref>\n\n===Syllabic values===\nEach letter in the Deseret alphabet has a name, and when a letter is written on its own it has the value of that name. This allows some short words to be written with a single letter, and is called a letter's \"syllabic value\". The most common word in English, ''the'', is written simply \ud801\udc44, as the letter's name is {{IPA|/\u00f0i\u02d0/}} and that is the stressed pronunciation of the word. The consonants with syllabic values are \ud801\udc36 (woo), \ud801\udc37 (yee), \ud801\udc38 (ha),  \ud801\udc39 (pee), \ud801\udc3a (be/bee), \ud801\udc3b (tee/tea), \ud801\udc3d (qi), \ud801\udc3e (gee), \ud801\udc40 (gay), and \ud801\udc44 (the/thee).<ref name=\":14\" />{{Rp|25}}\n\nSyllabic values do not apply within words, although this was formerly the case. In early documents, Watt writes \"people\" as \ud801\udc39\ud801\udc39\ud801\udc4a with the expectation that readers will interpret the first \ud801\udc39 as {{IPA|/pi/}}, but the second \ud801\udc39 as {{IPA|/p/}}.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|13}} This contextual value switching was soon done away with, so in later documents, while \"bee\" is written \ud801\udc3a, \"bees\" is written \ud801\udc3a\ud801\udc28\ud801\udc46.\n\nIn 40-letter versions of the alphabet which include the letter \ud801\udc27 (ew) which represents {{IPA|/ju\u02d0/}}, the letter \ud801\udc27 when standing alone can be used to represent the word \"you\".<ref name=\":14\" />{{Rp|25,51}}\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:WikipediaTheFreeEncyclopedia-DeseretAlphabet.svg|thumb|320x320px|{{Big|\ud801\udc0e\ud801\udc2e\ud801\udc3f\ud801\udc28\ud801\udc39\ud801\udc28\ud801\udc3c\ud801\udc28\ud801\udc32, \ud801\udc44 \ud801\udc41\ud801\udc49\ud801\udc28 \ud801\udc2f\ud801\udc4c\ud801\udc45\ud801\udc34\ud801\udc3f\ud801\udc4a\ud801\udc32\ud801\udc39\ud801\udc28\ud801\udc3c\ud801\udc28\ud801\udc32}} (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)]]\n*[[File:Deseret Second Book Juvenile Hymn page 23.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Hymn]] from the ''Deseret Second Book'', printed in 1868.

[[Vowels]] can be dropped if the writer is in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an [[abjad]], letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and \ud801\udc2e is placed on letters after they are already written as in an [[abugida]]. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in [[Pitman shorthand]], which is written in a similar way.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|13}}\n\nThe table below shows some examples of how the cursive form is written.

minor Danish-speaking communities are found in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Spain]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Brazil]], and [[Argentina]]. Due to immigration and [[language shift]] in urban areas, around 15\u201320% of the population of [[Greenland]] speak Danish as their [[first language]].\n\nAlong with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] who lived in [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Viking Age|Viking Era]]. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the [[Middle Norwegian]] language before the influence of Danish and [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]] are classified as West Norse along with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. A more recent classification based on [[mutual intelligibility]] separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as \"mainland Scandinavian\", while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as \"insular Scandinavian\". Danish has close similarities to the two main Germanic languages of [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]], but is not mutually intelligible with either.\n\nUntil the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to [[Scania]] with no [[standard language|standard variety]] or spelling conventions. With the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[History of printing|introduction of printing]], a standard language was developed which was based on the educated [[Copenhagen]] dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration, though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity, with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional [[Danish dialects]] have all but disappeared, though regional variants of the standard language exist. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.\n\nDanish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 [[phonemes|phonemically distinctive]] [[vowel]]s,{{sfn|Haberland|1994|page=318}} and its [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon ''[[st\u00f8d]]'', a kind of [[glottal consonant|laryngeal phonation type]]. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and \"weakly\" pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand,{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|2008a}} and some evidence shows that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish.{{sfn|Bleses|Vach|Slott|Wehberg|2008}} The grammar is moderately [[Fusional language|inflective]] with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. Like English, Danish only has remnants of a former [[grammatical case|case system]], particularly in the pronouns. Unlike English, it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is [[V2 word order]], with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:North Germanic languages.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Danish and its relationship to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European]]\nDanish is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] of the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic branch]]. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the [[Old Norse language]]; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}{{sfn|Rischel|2012|pp=809-10}}\n\nScandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where no sharp dividing lines are seen between the different vernacular languages.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nLike Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nDanish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: West Danish (Jutlandic), [[Insular Danish]] (including the Standard variety), and East Danish (including [[Bornholmsk dialect|Bornholmian]] and [[Scanian dialect|Scanian]]). Under the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmsk is its closest relative.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\n=== Mutual intelligibility ===\nDanish is largely [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.{{sfn|\u00c5kesson|2005}} The reason Norwegian occupies a middle position in terms of intelligibility is because of its shared border with Sweden resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language which has led to similarities in vocabulary.{{sfn|Torp|2006|pp=70-72}} Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces, and in general, younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as are Norwegian and Swedish youths.{{sfn|\u00c5kesson|2005}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Danish}}\nThe Danish philologist [[Johannes Br\u00f8ndum-Nielsen]] divided the history of Danish into a period from 800 AD to 1525 to be \"Old Danish\", which he subdivided into \"Runic Danish\" (800-1100), Early Middle Danish (1100\u20131350) and Late Middle Danish (1350\u20131525).{{sfn|Howe|1996}}\n\n{{Anchor|Runic Danish: D\u01ebnsk tunga}}\n=== Runic Danish===\n{{Main|Old Norse}}{{Old Norse language map}}\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=left|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''M\u00f3\u00f0ir Dyggva var Dr\u00f3tt, d\u00f3ttir Danps konungs, sonar R\u00edgs er fyrstr var konungr kalla\u00f0r \u00e1 danska tungu''.<br /> \"[[Dyggvi]]'s mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, [[R\u00edgs\u00feula|R\u00edg]]'s son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.\"\n|source= ''[[Heimskringla]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Ynglinga_saga|title=Ynglinga saga \u2013 heimskringla.no|website=www.heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n}}\nBy the eighth century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, [[Proto-Norse]], had undergone some changes and evolved into [[Old Norse]].\nThis language was generally called the \"Danish tongue\" (''D\u01ebnsk tunga''), or \"Norse language\" (''Norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l''). Norse was written in the [[runic alphabet]], first with the [[elder futhark]] and from the 9th century with the [[younger futhark]].{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=38-41}}\n\nFrom the seventh century, the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse ([[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and Old East Norse ([[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway.{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=39}} A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''\u00e6i'' (Old West Norse ''ei'') to the [[monophthong]] ''e'', as in ''st\u00e6in'' to ''sten''. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. Also, a change of ''au'' as in ''dau\u00f0r'' into ''\u00f8'' as in ''d\u00f8\u00f0r'' occurred. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tau\u00fer'' into ''tu\u00fer''. Moreover, the ''\u00f8y'' (Old West Norse ''ey'') diphthong changed into ''\u00f8'', as well, as in the Old Norse word for \"island\". This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=41}}\n\nThrough Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the [[Danelaw|northeast counties of England]]. Many words derived from Norse, such as \"gate\" ({{wiktda|gade}}) for street, still survive in [[Yorkshire]], the East Midlands and East Anglia, and [[Danelaw|parts of eastern England]] colonized by Danish [[Vikings]]. The city of [[York]] was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example \"are\" ({{wiktda|er}}), \"knife\" ({{wiktda|kniv}}), \"husband\" ({{wiktda|husbond}}), and \"egg\" ({{wiktda|\u00e6g}}). The suffix \"-by\" for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby, and Grimsby. The word \"dale\" meaning valley is common in Yorkshire and Derbyshire placenames.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/e-pl-england.htm |title=Viking place names and language in England |publisher=Viking.no |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Old/Middle Danish|Old and Middle Danish}}\n\n=== Old and Middle dialects ===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''Fang\u00e6r man saar i hor seng m\u00e6th ann\u00e6ns mansz kun\u00e6. oc kum\u00e6r han burt liu\u00e6nd...''.<br /> \"If one catches someone in the whore-bed with another man's wife and he comes away alive...\"\n|source= Jutlandic Law, 1241 {{sfn|Pedersen|1996|page=220}}\n}}\nIn the medieval period, Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish-language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not latinate. The [[Codex Holmiensis|Jutlandic Law]] and [[Scanian Law]] were written in vernacular Danish in the early-13th century. Beginning in 1350, Danish began to be used as a language of administration, and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=219\u201321}}\n\nThroughout this period, Danish was in contact with [[Low German language|Low German]], and many Low German loan words were introduced in this period.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=221\u2013224}} With the [[Protestant Reformation in Denmark|Protestant Reformation]] in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. Also in this period, Danish began to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the ''[[st\u00f8d]]'', the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.{{sfn|Torp|2006|pp=57-58}}\n\nThe first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the ''Rimkr\u00f8niken'' (''Rhyming Chronicle''), a history book told in rhymed verses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|publisher=Royal Danish Library|title=Bog Museum (Book Museum)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221182726/http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|archivedate=21 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first complete translation of the [[Bible]] in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by [[Christiern Pedersen]], was published in 1550.

In the second half of the 17th century, grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them [[Rasmus Bartholin]]'s 1657 Latin grammar ''De studio lingv\u00e6 danic\u00e6''; then [[Laurids Olufsen Kock]]'s 1660 grammar of the [[Zealand]] dialect ''Introductio ad lingvam Danicam puta selandicam''; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, ''Den Danske Sprog-Kunst'' (\"The Art of the Danish Language\") by [[Peder Syv]]. Major authors from this period are [[Thomas Kingo]], poet and psalmist, and [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]], whose novel ''Jammersminde'' (''Remembered Woes'') is considered a literary masterpiece by scholars. [[Orthography]] was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of [[Jens Pedersen H\u00f8ysgaard]] was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the ''st\u00f8d''. In this period, scholars were also discussing whether it was best to \"write as one speaks\" or to \"speak as one writes\", including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. ''han er'' \"he is\" vs. ''de ere'' \"they are\").{{sfn|Pedersen|1996}}\n\nThe East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)]] after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, beginning also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the [[History of Denmark#Absolutism|introduction of absolutism]] in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the Danish chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the ''de facto'' [[Lingua franca|official standard language]], especially in writing \u2014 this was the original so-called ''rigsdansk'' (\"Danish of the Realm\"). Also beginning in the mid-18th century, the ''skarre-R'', the [[Guttural R|uvular R]] sound ({{IPA|[\u0281]}}), began spreading through Denmark, likely through influence from German, which had official status in Denmark at the time. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden, and coastal southern Norway.{{sfn|Torp|2006|p=52}}\n\nIn the 18th century, Danish philology was advanced by [[Rasmus Rask]], who pioneered the disciplines of [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] and [[Historical linguistics|historical]] linguistics, and wrote the first English-language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish continued to develop with the works of [[Ludvig Holberg]], whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by [[Hans Egede]], Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language until the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996}}\n\n=== Standardized national language ===\n{{Quote box |width=250px |align=left|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''Moders navn er vort Hjertesprog,<br /> kun l\u00f8s er al fremmed Tale.<br /> Det alene i mund og bog,<br /> kan v\u00e6kke et folk af dvale.''<br /> \"Mother's name is our hearts' tongue,<br /> only idle is all foreign speech<br /> It alone, in mouth or in book,<br /> can rouse a people from sleep.\"\n|source= [[N.F.S.

The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called \"[[Danish Golden Age|Golden Age]]\" of Danish culture. Authors such as [[N.F.S. Grundtvig]] emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish-language authors of this period are [[existentialism|existential]] [[philosopher]] [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and prolific [[fairy tale]] author [[Hans Christian Andersen]].{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=828}} The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. After the [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920|Schleswig referendum in 1920]], a number of Danes remained as a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|minority within German territories]].{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=831}} Throughout the 19th century, Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the US, Canada, and Argentina, where memory and some use of Danish remains today.\n\n[[File:LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png|thumb|right|[[Language shift]] in the 19th century in southern [[Schleswig]]]]\nAfter the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German-influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter \u00c5/\u00e5. Three 20th-century Danish authors have become [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]]: [[Karl Adolph Gjellerup|Karl Gjellerup]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (joint recipients in 1917) and [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen|Johannes V.

In the 20th century, they have all but disappeared, and the standard language has extended throughout the country.{{sfn|Pedersen|2003}} Minor regional pronunciation variation of the standard language, sometimes called ''regionssprog'' (\"regional languages\") remain, and are in some cases vital. Today, the major varieties of Standard Danish are High Copenhagenian, associated with elderly, well to-do, and well educated people of the capital, and low-Copenhagenian traditionally associated with the working class, but today adopted as the prestige variety of the younger generations.{{sf|Kristiansen|J\u00f8rgensen|2003}}<ref>Quist, P.

Until 2009, it had also been one of two official languages of Greenland (alongside [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]). Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as ''lingua franca'', and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; a large percentage of the native Greenlandic population speaks Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in Iceland until 1944, but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school taught as a second foreign language after English.{{sfn|Jacobsen|2003}}\n\n[[File:Learn Danish in Germany, 2012, ubt.JPG|thumb|''Learn Danish'' banner in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]], where it is an officially recognized [[regional language]]]]\nIn addition,  a noticeable community of Danish speakers is in [[Southern Schleswig]], the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized [[regional language]], just as [[German language|German]] is north of the border.

Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, which has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm.{{sfn|Pedersen|2003}}{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nDanish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents or regional languages, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects. Traditional dialects are now mostly extinct in Denmark, with only the oldest generations still speaking them.{{sfn|Kristiansen|1998}}{{sfn|Pedersen|2003}}\n\nDanish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas:\n* [[Insular Danish]] (''\u00f8m\u00e5l''), including dialects of the [[Danish islands]] of Zealand, Funen, Lolland, Falster, and M\u00f8n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/oemaal/|publisher=Copenhagen University, Center for Dialect Research|title=\u00d8m\u00e5l}}</ref>\n* [[Jutlandic]] (''jysk''), further divided in North, East, West, and [[South Jutlandic]]{{sfn|Nielsen|1959}}\n* [[Bornholmsk dialect|Bornholmian]] (''bornholmsk''), the dialect of the island of [[Bornholm]]{{sfn|Prince|1924}}\n\nJutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic. Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, M\u00f8n, and Lolland-Falster dialect areas \u2013 each with addition internal variation. The term \"Eastern Danish\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Sprog/Dansk/danske_dialekter |title=danske dialekter &#124; Gyldendal \u2013 Den Store Danske |language= da |publisher=Denstoredanske.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> is occasionally used for Bornholmian, but including the dialects of [[Scanian dialects|Scania]] (particularly in a historical context) \u2013 Jutlandic dialect, Insular Danish, and Bornholmian. Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to [[Sweden]] and subsequently swedified.\n\nTraditional dialects differ in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary from standard Danish. Phonologically, one of the most diagnostic differences is the presence or absence of ''st\u00f8d''.{{sfn|S\u00f8rensen|2011}} Four main regional variants for the realization of st\u00f8d are known: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland, and \u00c6r\u00f8, no ''st\u00f8d'' is used, but instead a [[pitch accent]]. South of a line ({{lang-da|St\u00f8dgr\u00e6nsen}} \"The St\u00f8d border\") going through central South Jutland, crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, M\u00f8n, Southern Zealand and Bornholm neither ''st\u00f8d'' nor pitch accent exists.<ref name=\"dialekt\">{{cite web |url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialekttraek/stoed/ |title=St\u00f8d |publisher=University of Copenhagen, Center for Dialect Studies }}</ref> Most of Jutland and on Zealand use'' st\u00f8d'', and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language,'' st\u00f8d'' occurs more often than in the standard language. In Zealand, the ''st\u00f8d'' line divides Southern Zealand (without ''st\u00f8d''), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.{{sfn|Ejskj\u00e6r|1990}}{{sfn|Kroman|1980}}\n\nGrammatically, a dialectally significant feature is the number of grammatical genders. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of [[suffix]]es, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as [[West Germanic languages]]. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three [[grammatical gender]]s.{{sfn|Prince|1924}} Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900, Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not.{{sfn|Arboe|2008}} Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: \"Katti, han f\u00e5r unger\", literally ''The cat, he is having kittens'', because cat is a masculine noun, thus is referred to as ''han'' (he), even if it is female cat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialekttraek/navneordenes_koen/|publisher=Copenhagen University, Center for Dialect Research|title=Navneordenes k\u00f8n}}</ref>\n\n== Phonology ==\n[[File:Michael Noer - voice - da.flac|thumb|Spoken Danish]]\n{{Main|Danish phonology}}\n\nThe sound system of Danish is unusual among the world's languages, particularly in its large vowel inventory and in the unusual prosody. In informal or rapid speech, the language is prone to considerable reduction of unstressed syllables, creating many vowel-less syllables with syllabic consonants, as well as reduction of final consonants. Furthermore, the language's prosody does not include many clues about the sentence structure, unlike many other languages, making it relatively more difficult to segment{{what|date=August 2018}} the speech flow into its constituent elements.{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|2008a}}{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|2008b}} These factors taken together make Danish pronunciation difficult to master for learners, and Danish children are indicated to take slightly longer in learning to segment speech in early childhood.{{sfn|Bleses|Vach|Slott|Wehberg|2008}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nAlthough somewhat depending on analysis, most modern variants of Danish distinguish 12 long vowels, 13 short vowels, and two ''schwa'' vowels, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u0250/}} that only occur in unstressed syllables. This gives a total of 27 different vowel phonemes \u2013 a very large number among the world's languages.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=319}} At least 19 different diphthongs also occur, all with a short first vowel and the second segment being either {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, {{IPA|[u\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|[\u0250\u032f]}}.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=320}} The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as given by {{Harvcoltxt|Gr\u00f8nnum|1998}} in Modern Standard Danish, with the symbols used in [[Help:IPA/Danish|IPA/Danish]]. Questions of analysis may give a slightly different inventory, for example based on whether r-colored vowels are considered distinct phonemes. {{harvcoltxt|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|page=50}} gives 25 \"full vowels\", not counting the two unstressed ''schwa'' vowels.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n!

Phonetically there is no voicing distinction among the stops, rather the distinction is one of aspiration and fortis vs. lenis.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=320}} {{IPA|/p t k/}} are aspirated in onset realized as {{IPA|[b\u0325\u02b0, d\u0325\u02e2, \u0261\u030a\u02b0]}}, but not in coda. The pronunciation of ''t'', {{IPA|[d\u0325\u02e2]}}, is in between a simple aspirated {{IPA|[d\u0325\u02b0]}} and a fully affricated {{IPA|[d\u0325s]}} as has happened in German with many words that now contain ''z''. The stops /b d g/ are realized as {{IPA|[b\u0325, d\u0325, \u0261\u030a]}} in onset and as [b\u0325 \u00f0\u031e\u02e0\u0320, j/\u028a\u032f] in coda. In syllable onset the phonemes {{IPA|/b d \u0261 v j r/}} are [[contoid]] (having enough closure to produce friction), but in coda syllables they become [[vocoid]]s, with no audible friction making them phonetically similar to vowels. For example, /v b/ is pronounced as a [w]-sound in syllable coda e.g. /grav, l\u00f8b/ (\"grave, ran\") are pronounced {{IPA|[grau\u032f, l\u00f8u\u032f]}}.\n\n{{IPA|[\u028b, \u00f0]}} often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as [[approximant]]s. Danish {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} differs from the similar sound in English and Icelandic, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar [[approximant]] which sounds like and is frequently mistaken for an [l] (or [[Voiced dental and alveolar lateral fricatives|[\u026e]]]) by second language learners.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=320}}\n\nThe sound {{IPA|[\u0255]}} is found for example in the word /sjov\u02c0/ \"fun\" pronounced {{IPA|[\u0255\u0252u\u032f\u02c0]}} and /tjal\u02c0/ \"marijuana\" pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0255al\u02c0]}}. Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|[j]}} doesn't occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/j/}}, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a {{IPA|/\u0255/}}-phoneme in Danish.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gr\u00f8nnum|2005|pp=305\u2013306}}</ref>\n\nIn onset {{IPA|/r/}} is realized as a [[voiced uvular fricative|uvu-pharyngeal approximant]], {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic [[near-open central vowel|low central vowel]], {{IPA|[\u0250\u032f]}} or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the ''r'' in German or in [[non-rhotic]] pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} as a so-called skarre-r distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\n=== Prosody ===\nDanish is characterized by a [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] feature called ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' (lit. \"thrust\"). This is a form of laryngealization or [[creaky voice]]. Some sources have described it as a [[glottal stop]], but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon.{{sfn|Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen|1989}} It has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in [[minimal pair]]s such as ''b\u00f8nder'' (\"peasants\") with st\u00f8d, versus ''b\u00f8nner'' (\"beans\") without st\u00f8d. The distribution of st\u00f8d in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian [[pitch accent]]s found in most dialects of [[Norwegian phonology#Accent|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|Swedish]].{{sfn| Basb\u00f8ll|2005|pp=83-86}}\n\n[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is phonemic and distinguishes words such as ''billigst'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bilist]}} \"cheapest\" and ''bilist'' {{IPA|[bi\u02c8list]}} \"car driver\".{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=811}}\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Danish grammar}}\n\nSimilarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] pattern with a rich [[inflection]]al morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly [[Analytic language|analytic]] pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed [[SVO word order]] and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected [[strong inflection|strong]] stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs ''tager/tog'' (\"takes/took\") and ''fod/f\u00f8dder'' (\"foot/feet\")) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as ''elsker/elskede'' \"love/loved\", ''bil/biler'' \"car/cars\"). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typically for an Indo-European language, Danish follows [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and ideophones.{{sfn|Becker-Christensen|2010|p=17}}\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an [[enclitic]]. A distinctive feature of the Nordic languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typically of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or \"[[strong inflection|strong]]\" stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem (e.g. ''fod/f\u00f8dder'' \"foot/feet\", ''mand/m\u00e6nd'' \"man/men\") or \"weak\" stems inflected through affixation (e.g. ''skib/skibe'' \"ship/ships\", ''kvinde/kvinder'' \"woman/women\").{{sfn|Haberland|1994|pp=323-331}}\n\n==== Gender ====\n{{Main|Gender in Danish and Swedish}}\nStandard Danish has two [[Grammatical gender|nominal genders]]: ''common'' and ''neuter''; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the ''common'' gender, and ''neuter'' is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized. The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes. {{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=323-324}}\n\n==== Definiteness ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish regular plural patterns\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Class 1\n! colspan=\"3\"|Class 2\n! colspan=\"3\" | Class 3\n|-\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n|-\n|''m\u00e5ned''<br />month||''m\u00e5neder''<br />months||''m\u00e5nederne''<br />the months||''dag''<br />day||''dage''<br /> days||''dagene''<br />\"the days\"||''\u00e5r'' <br />year||''\u00e5r''<br />years ||''\u00e5rene'' <br /> the years\n|-\n|''bil''<br />car||''biler''<br />cars||''bilerne''<br />the cars||''hund''<br />dog||''hunde''<br />dogs||''hundene''<br />the dogs||''fisk''<br />fish||''fisk''<br />fish (pl.)||''fiskene''<br />the fishes\n|-\n|}\nDefiniteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles, a preposed demonstrative article which occurs with nouns that are modified by an adjective or a postposed enclitic.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=813}} Neuter nouns take the clitic ''-et'', and common gender nouns take ''-en''. Indefinite nouns take the articles ''en'' (common gender) or ''et'' (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun ''en mand'' \"a man\" (indefinite) has the definite form ''manden'' \"the man\", whereas the neuter noun ''et hus'' \"a house\" (indefinite) has the definite form, \"the house\" (definite) ''huset''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=323-324}} {{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=61-68}}\n\nIndefinite:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 '''et''' hus''\n:\"I saw a house\"\n\nDefinite with enclitic article:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 hus'''et'''''\n:\"I saw the house\"\n\nDefinite with preposed demonstrative article:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 '''det''' store hus''<ref group='nb'>Note here that in Swedish and Norwegian the preposed and the enclitic article occur together (e.g. ''det store huset''), whereas in Danish the enclitic article is replaced by the preposed demonstrative.</ref>\n:\"I saw the big house\"\n\nThe plural definite ending is ''-(e)ne'' (e.g. ''drenge'' \"boys > ''drengene'' \"the boys\" and ''piger'' \"girls\" > ''pigerne'' \"the girls\"), and nouns ending in -''ere'' lose the last ''-e'' before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. ''danskere'' \"Danes\" > ''danskerne'' \"the Danes\"). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article ''den'' (common) or ''det'' (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: ''den store mand'' \"the big man\", ''det store hus'' \"the big house\".{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=330}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=61-68}}\n\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==== Number ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish irregular plurals\n|-\n!

Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of ''\u00f8je'' \"eye\", which is the old dual form ''\u00f8jne''), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word ''konto'' \"account\" which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form ''konti'' \"accounts\").{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=326}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=35-40}}\n\n==== Possession ====\nPossessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -''s'', for example ''min fars hus'' \"my father's house\" where the noun ''far'' carries the possessive enclitic.{{sfn|Herslund|2001}} This is however not an example of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases ''kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik'' \"the king of Denmark's candy factory\", or ''det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter'' \"that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with\", where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=325}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=53-60}}\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish personal pronouns\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Person\n! scope=\"col\" | Subjective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Objective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Dependent<br /> possessive\n! scope=\"col\" | Independent <br />possessive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. sg.\n| ''jeg'' <br /> I || ''mig''<br /> me || ''min/mit''<br /> my || ''mine''<br /> mine\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd o. sg.\n| ''du'' <br /> You || ''dig''<br /> you|| ''din/dit''<br /> your || ''dine''<br /> yours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. sg.\n| ''han/hun<br />/den/det'' <br /> he/she/it|| ''ham/hende<br />/den/det''<br /> him/her/it|| ''hans/hendes<br />/dens/dets''<br /> his/her/its||  ''hans/hendes<br />/dens/dets''<br /> his/hers/its\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. pl.\n| ''vi''<br />we || ''os''<br /> us || ''vores''<br />our || ''vores''<br />ours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd p. pl.\n| ''I''<br /> you (pl.) || ''jer'' <br /> you (pl.) || ''jeres''<br /> your (pl.)|| ''jeres''<br /> yours (pl.)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. pl\n| ''de'' <br /> they|| ''dem''<br /> them || ''deres''<br /> their || ''deres''<br /> theirs\n|}\nAs does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between subjective and oblique case. The subjective case form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence, and oblique forms are used for all non-subjective occurrences including accusative, dative, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between and animate masculine (''han'' \"he\"), animate feminine (''hun'' \"she\") forms, as well as inanimate neuter (''det'' \"it\") and inanimate common gender (''den'' \"it\") {{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=326-328}}\n\n:''Jeg sover''\n:\"I sleep\"\n\n:''Du sover''\n:\"you sleep\"\n\n:''Jeg kysser dig''\n:\"I kiss you\"\n\n:''du kysser mig''\n:\"you kiss me\"\n\nPossessive pronouns have independent and adjectival forms. The adjectival form is used immediately preceding the possessed noun (''det er min hest'' \"it is my horse\"), whereas the independent possessive pronoun is used in place of the possessed noun (''den er min'' \"it is mine\"). In the third person singular ''sin'' is used when the owner is also the subject of the sentence, whereas ''hans'' (\"his\"), ''hendes'' (her) and ''dens/dets'' \"its\" is used when the owner is different from the grammatical subject.{{sfn|Allan|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2005|p=63}}{{sfn|Bredsdorff|1958|pp=83-85}}\n\n:''Han tog '''sin''' hat''\n:He took his (own) hat\n\n:''Han tog '''hans''' hat''\n:He took his hat (someone else's hat)\n\n==== Nominal compounds ====\nLike all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in ''kvindeh\u00e5ndboldlandsholdet'', \"the female national handball team\". In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra ''s'', originally possessive in function, like ''landsmand'' (from ''land'', \"country\", and ''mand'', \"man\", meaning \"compatriot\"), but ''landmand'' (from same roots, meaning \"farmer\"). Some words are joined with an extra ''e'', like ''g\u00e6stebog'' (from ''g\u00e6st'' and ''bog'', meaning \"guest book\").\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish verbal forms|-\n! infinitive\n!

They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=331}}\n\n{{Anchor|Tense, Aspect, Mood, Voice}}\n==== Tense, aspect, mood, and voice ====\nVerbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=813}} The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix -''te'' and those that take the suffix -''ede''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=332}}\n\nThe infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259]}}), infinitive forms are preceded by the article ''at'' (pronounced {{IPA|[\u0252]}}).{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=332}} The non-past or present tense takes the suffix -''r'', except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=333}}\n\nThe present participle ends in -''ende'' (e.g. ''l\u00f8bende'' \"running\"), and the past participle ends in -''et'' (e.g. ''l\u00f8bet'' \"run\"), ''-t'' (e.g. k\u00f8bt \"bought\"). Additional composite tenses are constructed with auxiliary verbs (e.g. ''at v\u00e6re'' \"to be\" and ''at have'' \"to have\") and participial forms:\n\n:''Hun er g\u00e5et''\n:\"She has left\"\n\n:''Hun har g\u00e5et''\n:\"She has walked\"\n\n:''Hun var g\u00e5et''\n:\"She had left\"\n\n:''Hun blev siddende''\n:She remained seated (lit. \"she stayed sitting\")\n\nThe passive form takes the suffix -s: ''avisen l\u00e6ses hver dag'' (\"the newspaper is read every day\"). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb ''at blive'' \"to become\": ''avisen bliver l\u00e6st hver dag''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=333}}{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=814}}\n\nThe imperative mood is formed from the infinitive by removing the final schwa-vowel:\n:''l\u00f8b!''\n:\"run!\"\n\n=== Syntax ===\nDanish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|Subject-Verb-Object]].{{sfn|Becker-Christensen|2010|p=24}} However, Danish is also a [[V2 word order|V2 language]], which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian [[Paul Diderichsen]]{{sfn|Diderichsen|1974}} Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or \"grounding\") field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or [[Topic and comment|topics]]. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=336}}\n\n:''Peter (S) s\u00e5 (V) Jytte (O)''\n:\"Peter saw Jytte\"\n\nbut\n\n:''I g\u00e5r s\u00e5 (V) Peter (S) Jytte (O)''\n:\"Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte\"\n\nWhen there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a [[Dummy pronoun|dummy subject]] \"der\".{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=344}}\n\n:''der kom en pige ind ad d\u00f8ren''\n:there came a girl in through the door\n:\"A girl came in the door\"\n\n==== Main clauses ====\n{{Harvtxt|Haberland|1994|p=336}} describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:\n\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n|''Og''||''ham''||''havde''||''Per''||''ikke''||''sk\u00e6nket''||''en tanke''||''i \u00e5revis''\n|-\n|And||him||had||Per||not||given||a thought||for years\n|-\n|0||1||2||3||4||5||6||7\n|-\n|colspan=\"8\" | \"And him Per hadn't given a thought in years\"\n\n|}\n\nPosition 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the main verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=336}}\n\nQuestions with [[Interrogative word|wh-words]] are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.\n\nWh-question:\n:''hvem s\u00e5 hun?'''\n: whom saw she\n:\"whom did she see?\"\n\n:''s\u00e5 hun ham?''\n:saw she him?\n:\"did she see him?\"\n\n==== Subordinate clauses ====\nIn subordinate clauses, the syntax differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).{{sfn|Jensen|2011}} [[Complement clause]]s begin with the particle ''at'' in the \"connector field\".\n\n:''Han sagde '''at han ikke ville g\u00e5'''''\n:he said that he not would go\n:\"He said that he did not want to go\"\n\n[[Relative clause]]s are marked by the relative articles ''som'' or ''der'' which occupy the preverbal slot:\n\n:''Jeg kender en mand '''som''' bor i Helsing\u00f8r{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=345}}\n:\"I know a man who lives in Elsinore\"\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Danish military police Mercedes.JPG|thumb|Danish label reading ''milit\u00e6rpoliti,'' \"military police\", on police vehicle]]\nAbout 2000 of Danish non-compound words are derived from the [[Old Norse language]], and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]]. Of these 2000 words, 1200 are nouns, 500 are verbs, 180 are adjectives and the rest belong to other word classes.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|pp=346-347}} Danish has also absorbed a large number of [[loan words]], most of which were borrowed from [[Middle Low German]] in the [[late medieval]] period. Out of the 500 most frequently used words in Danish, 100 are medieval loans from Middle Low German.<ref name=Sproget>{{cite web|url=http://sproget.dk/raad-og-regler/artikler-mv/svarbase/SV00001479|title=Antal arveord og l\u00e5neord|first=Anita \u00c5gerup |last=Jervelund|publisher=Dansk Sprogn\u00e6vns svarbase|year=2008}}</ref> In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[German language|standard German]] and [[French language|French]] superseded Low German influence and in the 20th century English became the main supplier of loan words, especially after [[World War II]]. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, as can be seen with ''\u00e6de'' (to eat) which became less common when the Low German ''spise'' came into fashion. As well as loan words, new words are freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard texts of contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16\u201217% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin-loans 4\u20128%, French 2\u20124% and English about 1%.<ref name=Sproget />\n\nDanish and English are both Germanic languages, Danish a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse and English a West Germanic language descended from Old English, and Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period. To see their shared Germanic heritage, one merely has to note the many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, commonly used Danish nouns and prepositions such as ''have'', ''over'', ''under'', ''for'', ''give'', ''flag,'' ''salt,'' and ''kat'' are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers.{{sfn|Bredsdorff|1958|pp=6-10}} Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their [[Scots language|Scots]] equivalents, e.g., ''kirke'' (Scots ''kirk'', i.e., 'church') or ''barn'' (Scots ''bairn'', i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word ''by'', meaning \"village\" or \"town\", occurs in many English place-names, such as ''Whitby'' and ''Selby'', as remnants of the [[Danelaw|Viking occupation]]. During the latter period, English adopted \"are\", the third person plural form of the verb \"to be\", as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form \"they\" from contemporary Old Norse.\n\n=== Numerals{{anchor|Numerals}} ===\nIn the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered ''enogtyve'', literally \"one and twenty\".\n\nThe numeral ''halvanden'' means 1\u00bd (literally \"half second\", implying \"one plus half of the second one\"). The numerals ''halvtredje'' (2\u00bd), ''halvfjerde'' (3\u00bd) and ''halvfemte'' (4\u00bd) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the [[vigesimal]] system described below. Similarly, the [[time|temporal designation]] (''klokken'')'' halv tre'', literally \"half three (o'clock)\", is half past two.\n\nOne peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (as are the [[French language|French]] numerals from 80 through 99) based on a [[vigesimal]] system, meaning that the [[20 (number)|score]] (20) is used as a base unit in counting. ''Tres'' (short for ''tre-sinds-tyve'', \"three times twenty\") means 60, while 50 is ''halvtreds'' (short for ''halvtredje-sinds-tyve'', \"half third times twenty\", implying two score plus half of the third score). The [[suffix|ending]] ''sindstyve'' meaning \"times twenty\" is no longer included in [[cardinal number]]s, but may still be used in [[ordinal number]]s. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as ''tooghalvtreds'' from the now obsolete ''tooghalvtredsindstyve'', whereas 52nd is either ''tooghalvtredsende'' or ''tooghalvtredsindstyvende''. Twenty is ''tyve'' (derived from old Danish ''tiughu'', a [[haplology]] of ''tuttiughu'', meaning 'two tens'<ref name=\"ODS\">{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?select=tyve,4&query=tyve|title=tyve,4 \u2014 ODS|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref>), while thirty is ''tredive'' (Old Danish ''\u00ferjatiughu'', \"three tens\"), and forty is ''fyrre'' (Old Danish ''fyritiughu'', \"four tens\",<ref name=\"dsnfaq\">[http://dsn.dk/sproghjaelp/ofte-stillede-spoergsmaal/de-danske-tal-halvtreds-tres-halvfjerds-firs-og-halvfems {{Link language|da}} Dansk sprogn\u00e6vn \u2013 De danske tal halvtreds, tres, halvfjerds, firs og halvfems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825105818/http://dsn.dk/sproghjaelp/ofte-stillede-spoergsmaal/de-danske-tal-halvtreds-tres-halvfjerds-firs-og-halvfems |date=25 August 2011 }}{{Subscription required}}</ref> still used today as the [[archaism]] ''fyrretyve'').{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=348}} Thus, the suffix ''-tyve'' should be understood as a plural of ''ti'' (10), though to modern Danes ''tyve'' means 20, making it hard to explain why ''fyrretyve'' is 40 (four tens) and not 80 (four times twenty).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The letters c, q, w, x and z are only used in loan words. A [[spelling reform]] in 1948 introduced the letter ''\u00e5'', already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''aa''.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=815}} The old usage continues to occur in some personal and [[geographical name]]s; for example, the name of the city of ''[[Aalborg]]'' is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and ''[[Aarhus]]'' decided to go back to Aa in 2011. When representing the ''\u00e5'' sound, ''aa'' is treated like ''\u00e5'' in [[collating|alphabetical sorting]], though it appears to be two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations, they are often replaced by ''ae'' (\u00c6, \u00e6), ''oe'' or ''o'' (\u00d8, \u00f8), and ''aa'' (\u00c5, \u00e5), respectively.\n\nThe same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense ''vilde'' (would), ''kunde'' (could) and ''skulde'' (should), to their current forms of ''ville'', ''kunne'' and ''skulle'' (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech). Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs slightly, particularly with the phonetic spelling of loanwords; for example the spelling of ''station'' and ''garage'' in Danish remains identical to other languages, whereas in Norwegian, they are transliterated as ''stasjon'' and ''garasje''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Danish language}}\nRealm languages:\n* [[Faroese language|Faroese]]\n* [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]\n\nNordic languages:\n* [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n* [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]\n* [[Swedish language|Swedish]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n:{{cite book|last=\u00c5kesson|first=K.

It contains 35 of Young's songs recorded between 1966 and 1976, among them five tracks that had been unreleased up to that point. It peaked at No. 43 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Young,%20Neil%22|title=Searchable Database|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=2014-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCompiled by Young himself, with his hand-written [[liner notes]] about each track, ''Decade'' represents almost every album from his career and various affiliations through 1977 with the exception of ''[[Four Way Street]]'' and ''[[Time Fades Away]]''. Of the previously unreleased songs, \"Down to the Wire\" features the [[New Orleans]] pianist [[Dr. John]] with [[Buffalo Springfield]] on an item from their shelved ''Stampede'' album; \"[[Love Is a Rose]]\" was a minor hit for [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1975; \"Winterlong\" received a cover by [[Pixies]] on the Neil Young tribute album from 1989, ''[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young|The Bridge]]''; and \"Campaigner\" is a Young song critical of [[Richard Nixon]].  The track \"Long May You Run\" is a different mix to that found on the [[Long May You Run|album of the same name]], featuring the harmonies of the full [[Crosby Stills & Nash]] before [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] left the recording sessions.\n\nFor many years, ''Decade'' was the only Neil Young compilation album available. A 1993 compilation called ''[[Lucky Thirteen (Neil Young album)|Lucky Thirteen]]'' was released, but it only covered Young's 1982\u20131988 output. It was not until 2004 that [[Reprise Records]] released a single-disc retrospective of his best-known tracks, titled ''[[Greatest Hits (Neil Young album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, Young promised fans a follow-up to the original ''Decade'' collection, provisionally titled ''Decade II''; eventually, this idea was scrapped in favor of a much more comprehensive anthology to be titled ''[[Neil Young Archives|Archives]]'', spanning his entire career and ranging in size from a box set to an entire series of audio and/or video releases. The first release of archival material since ''Decade'' and ''Lucky Thirteen'' would appear in 2006, ''[[Live at the Fillmore East (Neil Young album)|Live at the Fillmore East]]'', a recording from a 1970 concert featuring [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] with [[Danny Whitten]]. Several other archival live releases followed, and in 2009 the first of several planned multi-disc box sets, ''[[The Archives Vol. 1 1963\u20131972]]'', was issued. In April 2017 ''Decade'' was reissued on vinyl as a limited-edition [[Record Store Day]] release, with remastered vinyl and CD editions planned for general release in June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musictap.net/2017/05/23/remastered-neil-young-collection-decade-to-be-made-more-widely-available-cd-and-lp/|title=Remastered Neil Young Collection, Decade, To Be Made More Widely Available, CD and LP|publisher=MusicTAP|date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=May 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Alternate early version==\nInitially, ''Decade'' was to be released in 1976, but was pulled at the last minute by Young.  It was shelved until the following year, where it appeared with two songs removed from the original track list (a live version of \"[[Don't Cry No Tears]]\" recorded in Japan in 1976, and a live version of \"Pushed It Over the End\" recorded in 1974). Also removed were the following comments on those two songs and ''[[Time Fades Away]]'', from Young's handwritten liner notes:<ref>{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Paul |title= Neil Young: Love to Burn |isbn=0-934558-19-1 |page=115}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Time Fades Away.

However, in the original article on Young from the first edition of the ''[[Rolling Stone]] Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' and a subsequent article in the ''1983 [[Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', critic [[Dave Marsh]] used this album to accuse Young of deliberately manufacturing a self-mythology, arguing that while his highlights could be seen to place him on a level with other artists from his generation like [[Bob Dylan]] or [[The Beatles]], the particulars of his catalogue did not bear this out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/tfa/marshbookchapter.htm|title=NEIL YOUNG by Dave Marsh|website=Thrasherswheat.org|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref> The magazine has since excised the article from subsequent editions of the ''Illustrated History'' book.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by Neil Young.\n\n===Side one===\n#\"Down to the Wire\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:28\n#*Previously unreleased (1967);

At the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at this time the old crop and the new meet each other.<ref>[https://sacred-texts.com/cla/gpr/gpr07.htm#page_48 Martin Nilsson, ''Greek Popular Religion''.] pp 48-50</ref>\n\nAccording to the personal mythology of [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Graves' work on Greek myth was often criticized; see [[The White Goddess#Criticism]] and [[The Greek Myths#Reception|The Greek Myths]].</ref> Persephone is not only the younger self of Demeter,<ref>The idea that Kore (the maiden) is not Demeter's daughter, but Demeter's own younger self, was discussed much earlier than Graves, in [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] (1896), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FKVEsNO6wFYC&pg=PA121 ''The Cults of the Greek States'', volume 3, p.121.]</ref> she is in turn also one of three guises of the [[Triple deity|Triple Goddess]]&nbsp;\u2013 Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying the ripe grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of group name.

She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse [[Demophon of Eleusis|Demophon]] and [[Triptolemus]], his sons by [[Metanira]]. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with [[ambrosia]] and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as [[Eleusis (mythology)|Eleusis]], [[Rarus]] and [[Trochilus (mythology)|Trochilus]]. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.<ref>Nilsson (1940), p. 50: \"The Demophon<!--Demophoon?--> story in Eleusis is based on an older folk-tale motif which has nothing to do with the Eleusinian Cult.

The \"Two Queens\" may be related with Demeter and [[Persephone]], or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods.<ref name=Mylonas159/> An exception is the myth of isolated [[Arcadia]] in southern Greece. [[Despoina]], is daughter of Demeter and [[Poseidon]] ''Hippios'', Horse-Poseidon. These myths seem to be connected with the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north during the [[Bronze age]]. Poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld and he appears as a horse as it often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and she bears one daughter who obviously originally had the form or the shape of a mare too. Demeter and Despoina were closely connected with springs and animals, related to Poseidon as a God of waters and especially with [[Artemis]], the mistress of the animals and the goddess of, among others, the Hunt.\n\nDemeter as mare-goddess was pursued by Poseidon, and hid from him among the horses of King [[Onkios]], but could not conceal her divinity. In the form of a stallion, Poseidon caught and covered her. Demeter was furious ([[erinys]]) at Poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she is known as Demeter Erinys. But she washed away her anger in the River [[Ladon (river)|Ladon]], becoming ''Demeter Lousia'', the \"bathed Demeter\".<ref>Other ritually bathed goddesses were Argive [[Hera]] and [[Cybele]]; [[Aphrodite]] renewed her own powers bathing herself in the sea.</ref> \"In her alliance with Poseidon,\" [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Gods of the Greeks'', 1951:185.</ref> \"she was [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]], who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of [[grain]] or a mare.\" She bore a daughter [[Despoina]] ({{lang|grc|\u0394\u03ad\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1}}: the \"Mistress\"), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian [[Sacred mysteries|Mysteries]],<ref>\"In Arcadia she was also a second goddess in the Mysteries of her daughter, the unnameable, who was invoked only as 'Despoina', the 'Mistress'\" ([[Karl Kerenyi]], ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter''(Princeton University Press) 1967:31f, instancing Pausanias, viii.37.9.</ref> and a horse named [[Arion (mythology)|Arion]], with a black mane and tail.\n\nIn [[Arcadia]], Demeter's mare-form was worshiped into historical times.

This was her main function at [[Eleusis]], and became panhellenic. In [[Cyprus]], \"grain-harvesting\" was ''damatrizein''. The main theme in the [[Eleusinian]] mysteries was the reunion of [[Persephone]] with her mother Demeter, when new crops were reunited with the old seed, a form of eternity. However, some cults interpreted Demeter as Mother Earth. At Phigaleia in [[Arcadia]], she was represented as an archaised [[Medusa]] type, horse-headed and snake-haired, holding a dove and dolphin, perhaps to symbolize her power over air and water. In the cult of Flya, she was worshiped as [[Anesidora]] (one who sends up gifts from the underworld) and in Sparta as Demeter-Chthonia ([[chthonic]] Demeter).<ref>[[Pausanias]] I 31,4- III 14,5</ref> This can explain the name Demetrioi that the Athenians gave to the dead, and probably reflects an ancient cult of the dead, linked to the agrarian-belief that a new life would sprout from the dead body, as a new plant arises from buried seed. This was probably a belief shared by initiates in Demeter's mysteries, as interpreted by [[Pindar]]: \"Happy is he who has seen what exists under the earth, because he knows not only the end of life, but also his beginning that the Gods will give\". In antiquity Demeter was also ''zeidoros ar\u03bfura'', the Homeric \"Mother Earth [[arura|ar\u03bfura]]\" who gave the gift of cereals (''zeai'' or ''deai'').<ref>Martin Nilsson, (1967), ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', C.F.Beck Verlag Munchen, pp 462, 466, 675-676.</ref>-->\n\n== Titles and functions ==\n[[File:Eleusinian hydria Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.46 n2.jpg|thumb|left|Demeter, enthroned and extending her hand in a benediction toward the kneeling [[Metaneira]], who offers the [[wikt:triune|triune]] wheat ({{circa|340 {{small|BC}}}})]]\nDemeter's [[epithet]]s show her many religious functions.

In the early 1990s, the rise of [[melodic death metal]] was recognized, with bands such as [[Dark Tranquillity]], [[At the Gates]], and [[In Flames]].\n\nFollowing the original death metal innovators, new subgenres began by the end of the decade. British band [[Napalm Death]] became increasingly associated with death metal, in particular, on their 1990 album ''[[Harmony Corruption]]''. This album displays aggressive and fairly technical guitar riffing, complex rhythmics, a sophisticated growling vocal delivery by [[Mark \"Barney\" Greenway]], and socially aware lyrical subjects, merging death metal with the \"[[grindcore]]\" subgenre. Other bands contributing significantly to this early movement include Britain's [[Bolt Thrower]] and [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] and New York's [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]].\n\nTo close the circle, Death released their fourth album ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]'' in 1991. Death's founder Schuldiner helped push the boundaries of uncompromising speed and technical virtuosity, mixing technical and intricate rhythm guitar work with complex arrangements and emotive guitar solos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emptywords.org|title=Welcome to Empty Words|website=www.emptywords.org}}</ref> Other examples are Carcass's ''[[Necroticism \u2013 Descanting the Insalubrious]]'', Suffocation's ''[[Effigy of the Forgotten]]'' and Entombed's ''[[Clandestine (album)|Clandestine]]'' from 1991. At this point, all the above characteristics are present: abrupt tempo and time signature changes, occasionally extremely fast drumming, morbid lyrics, and growling vocal delivery.\n\n[[Earache Records]], [[Relativity Records]] and [[Roadrunner Records]] became the genre's most important labels,<ref>'Death Metal Special: Dealers in Death' ''Terrorizer #151''</ref> with Earache releasing albums by Carcass, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, and Entombed, and Roadrunner releasing albums by Obituary, and [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]]. Although these labels had not been death metal labels, initially, they became the genre's flagship labels in the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to these, other labels formed as well, such as [[Nuclear Blast]], [[Century Media Records|Century Media]], and [[Peaceville]]. Many of these labels would go on to achieve successes in other genres of metal throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn September 1990, Death's manager [[Eric Greif]] held one of the first North American death metal festivals, ''Day of Death'', in Milwaukee suburb Waukesha, Wisconsin, and featured 26 bands including Autopsy, [[Broken Hope]], Hellwitch, Obliveon, Revenant, Viogression, Immolation, [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], and [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]].<ref>[http://www.officialatheist.com/index.php?item=biography ''Biography'', Official Atheist site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325022446/http://www.officialatheist.com/index.php?item=biography |date=March 25, 2010 }}.

However, the genre as a whole never broke into the mainstream. The genre's mounting popularity may have been partly responsible for a strong rivalry between [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal]] and [[Scandinavian death metal|Swedish death metal]] scenes. [[Fenriz]] of [[Darkthrone]] has noted that Norwegian black metal musicians were \"fed up with the whole death metal scene\" at the time. Death metal diversified in the 1990s, spawning a rich variety of subgenres which still have a large \"underground\" following at the present.<ref>{{cite video|first=Bill|last=Zebyb|year=2007|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZd13-dSrAc|title=Black Metal: A Documentary|medium=motion picture}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Instrumentation===\n[[File:Deicide band 016.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Death metal drummer [[Steve Asheim]]]]\n\nThe setup most frequently used within the death metal genre is two guitarists, a bass player, a vocalist and a drummer often using \"hyper [[Bass drum#Double bass drum|double-bass]] [[blast beat]]s\".{{sfn|Purcell|2003|p=9}}{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=32}} Although this is the standard setup, bands have been known to occasionally incorporate other instruments such as [[electronic keyboard]]s.<ref>[http://heavymetal.about.com/od/heavymetal101/p/melodicdeathmetalprofile.htm Marsicano, D. ''Melodic Death Metal''], About.com (Retrieved October 27, 2010)</ref> The genre is often identified by fast, heavily [[distortion (guitar)|distorted]] and low tuned guitars, played with techniques such as [[palm muting]] and [[tremolo picking]]. The percussion is usually aggressive and powerful.\n\nDeath metal is known for its abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes. Death metal may include [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] chord progressions and a varied song structure. In some circumstances, the style will incorporate melodic riffs and harmonies for effect. This incorporation of melody and harmonious playing was even further used in the creation of [[melodic death metal]]. These compositions tend to emphasize an ongoing development of themes and motifs.\n\n===Vocals and lyrics===\n[[File:CannibalCorpse@Innsbruck2009.jpg|thumb|left|Death metal band [[Cannibal Corpse]] performing in 2009.]]\n\nDeath metal vocals are referred to as [[death growl]]s; hoarse roars/snarls. Death growling is mistakenly thought to be a form of screaming using the lowest vocal register known as [[vocal fry]], however vocal fry is actually a form of overtone screaming, and while growling can be performed this way by experienced vocalists who use the fry screaming technique, \"true\" death growling is in fact created by an altogether different technique.<ref>Interview with Samuel Deschaine, Death Metal Vocal Instructor 2011</ref> The three major methods of harsh vocalization used in the genre are often mistaken for each other, encompassing vocal fry screaming, [[Vestibular fold|false chord]] screaming, and \"true\" death growls.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Growling is sometimes also referred to as [[Cookie Monster]] vocals, tongue-in-cheek, due to the vocal similarity to the voice of the popular ''[[Sesame Street]]'' character of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cookie Monster Vocals|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/glossary/g/gl_cookiemonste.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=January 21, 2006}}</ref> Although often criticized, death growls serve the aesthetic purpose of matching death metal's aggressive lyrical content.<ref>Sharpe-Young, Garry. ''Death Metal'', {{ISBN|0-9582684-4-4}}</ref> High-pitched screaming is occasionally utilized in death metal, being heard in songs by [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Aborted]], [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]], [[Dying Fetus]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]].\n\n[[File:12-08 Wacken SFU 05.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Death metal band [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]]]]\n\nThe lyrical themes of death metal may invoke [[slasher film]]-stylised violence,<ref name=\"Moynihan, Michael 1998 p. 27\"/> but may also extend to topics like [[Satanism]], religion, [[occultism]], [[Lovecraftian horror]], nature, [[mysticism]], philosophy, science fiction, and politics.{{sfn|Purcell|2003|p=39-42}}<ref name=\"wikihow.com\"/> Although violence may be explored in various other genres as well, death metal may elaborate on the details of extreme acts, including [[mutilation]], [[dissection]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]]. Sociologist [[Keith Kahn-Harris]] commented this apparent glamorisation of violence may be attributed to a \"fascination\" with the human body that all people share to some degree, a fascination which mixes desire and disgust.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=}} Heavy metal author [[Gavin Baddeley]] also stated there does seem to be a connection between \"how acquainted one is with their own mortality\" and \"how much they crave images of death and violence\" via the media.<ref>Baddeley, Gavin. ''Raising Hell!: The Book of Satan and Rock 'n' Roll''</ref> Additionally, contributing artists to the genre often defend death metal as little more than an extreme form of art and entertainment, similar to horror films in the motion picture industry.<ref name=\"hbj\"/> This explanation has brought such musicians under fire from activists internationally, who claim that this is often lost on a large number of adolescents, who are left with the glamorisation of such violence without social context or awareness of why such imagery is stimulating.<ref name=\"hbj\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Alex Webster]], bassist of Cannibal Corpse, \"The gory lyrics are probably not, as much as people say, [what's keeping us] from being mainstream. Like, 'death metal would never go into the mainstream because the lyrics are too gory?' I think it's really the music, because violent entertainment is totally mainstream.\"<ref name=\"Cannibal Corpse Alex Webster\">[http://www.waytooloud.com/2007/10/23/cannibal-corpse-alex-webster-and-george-%E2%80%9Ccorpsegrinder%E2%80%9D-fisher/ Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse) interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604092255/http://www.waytooloud.com/2007/10/23/cannibal-corpse-alex-webster-and-george-%E2%80%9Ccorpsegrinder%E2%80%9D-fisher/ |date=June 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Origin of the term==\nThe most popular theory of the subgenre's christening is [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]'s 1984 demo, ''Death Metal''; the song from the eponymous demo would also be featured on the band's 1985 debut album, ''[[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]]''.{{sfn|Purcell|2003|p=53}} Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a high school English class assignment.{{sfn|Ekeroth|2008|p=11}} Another possible origin was a magazine called ''Death Metal'', started by [[Thomas Gabriel Fischer|Thomas Fischer]] and [[Martin Eric Ain|Martin Ain]] of [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]].

Bands described as technical death metal or progressive death metal usually fuse common death metal aesthetics with elements of [[progressive rock]], [[jazz]] or classical music. While the term technical death metal is sometimes used to describe bands that focus on speed and extremity as well as complexity, the line between progressive and technical death metal is thin. ''Tech death'' and ''prog death'', for short, are terms commonly applied to such bands as [[Nile (band)|Nile]], [[Edge of Sanity]], and [[Opeth]]. [[Necrophagist]] and [[Spawn of Possession]] are known for a classical music-influenced death metal style. Death metal pioneers [[Death (metal band)|Death]] also refined their style in a more progressive direction in their final years. Some albums for this subgenre are ''[[Hallucinations (Atrocity album)|Hallucinations]]'' (1990) by the German band [[Atrocity (band)|Atrocity]] and [[Death (metal band)|Death]]'s ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]'' (1991).

pronunciation: [don ki\u02c8\u0283ote]), is a [[Spanish literature|Spanish]] [[novel]] by [[Miguel de Cervantes]]. Published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, ''Don Quixote'' is the most influential work of literature from the [[Spanish Golden Age]] and the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern [[Western literature]] and the earliest [[Western canon|canonical]] novel,{{fact|date=September 2018}} it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published, such as the [[Bokklubben World Library]] collection that cites ''Don Quixote'' as the authors' choice for the \"best literary work ever written\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Angelique|first=Chrisafis|title=Don Quixote is the world's best book say the world's top authors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/08/humanities.books|accessdate=13 October 2012|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe story follows the adventures of a noble ([[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]]) named Alonso Quixano who reads so many [[chivalric romance]]s that he loses his sanity and decides to become a [[knight-errant]] (''caballero andante''), reviving [[chivalry]] and serving his country, under the name ''Don Quixote de la Mancha''. He recruits a simple farmer, [[Sancho Panza]], as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical orations on antiquated [[knighthood]]. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story. \n\nThroughout the novel, Cervantes uses such literary techniques as [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[metatheatre]], and [[intertextuality]]. The book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1844), [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884), and [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1897), as well as the word \"[[Quixotism|quixotic]]\" and the epithet \"[[Lothario]]\"; the latter refers to a character in \"[[El curioso impertinente]]\" (\"The Impertinently Curious Man\"), an intercalated story that appears in Part One, chapters 33\u201335. The 19th century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] cited ''Don Quixote'' as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse]]'', and ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship|Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]''.<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\">{{cite web|last = Schopenhauer|first = Arthur|title = The Art of Literature|work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20150504103459/http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 4 May 2015 | accessdate = 22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen first published, ''Don Quixote'' was usually interpreted as a [[comic novel]]. After the [[French Revolution]], it was popular for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting. In the 19th century, it was seen as a social commentary, but no one could easily tell \"whose side Cervantes was on\". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and [[nobility]] are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature.\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Don Quijote Illustration by Gustave Dore VII.jpg|thumb|Don Quijote (Don Quixote) illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], depicting the famous windmill scene.]]\n\nCervantes wrote that the first chapters were taken from \"the archives of La Mancha\", and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by the [[Moors|Moor]]ish author [[Cide Hamete Benengeli]]. This [[metafiction]]al trick appears to give a greater credibility to the text, implying that Don Quixote is a real character and that the events related truly occurred several decades prior to the recording of this account. However, it was also common practice in that era for fictional works to make some pretense of being factual, such as the common opening line of fairy tales \"[[Once upon a time]] in a land far away...\"\n\nIn the course of their travels, the protagonists meet innkeepers, prostitutes, goat-herders, soldiers, priests, escaped convicts and scorned lovers. The aforementioned characters sometimes tell tales that incorporate events from the real world, like the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Maynila]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} or battles in the [[Eighty Years' War]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Their encounters are magnified by Don Quixote's imagination into chivalrous quests. Don Quixote's tendency to intervene violently in matters irrelevant to himself, and his habit of not paying debts, result in privations, injuries, and humiliations (with Sancho often the victim). Finally, Don Quixote is persuaded to return to his home village. The narrator hints that there was a third quest, but says that records of it have been lost.\n\n===Part 1===\n\n====The First Sally (Chapters 1\u20135)====\nAlonso Quixano, the protagonist of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later in the book), is a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing 50 years of age, living in an unnamed section of [[La Mancha]] with his niece and housekeeper, as well as a boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. Although Quixano is usually a rational man, in keeping with the [[humorism|humoral]] physiology theory  of the time, not sleeping adequately \u2014 because he was reading \u2014 has caused his brain to dry; Quixano's temperament is thus [[choleric]], the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger<ref>Otis H. Green. \"El Ingenioso Hidalgo\", ''[[Hispanic Review]]'' 25 (1957), 175\u2013193.</ref> and believes every word of these fictional books of chivalry to be true.\n\nImitating the protagonists of these books, he decides to become a [[knight-errant]] in search of adventure. To these ends, he dons an old suit of [[armour]], renames himself \"Don Quixote\", names his exhausted horse \"[[Rocinante]]\", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo, a neighboring farm girl, as his [[Courtly love|lady love]], renaming her [[Dulcinea|Dulcinea del Toboso]], while she knows nothing of this. Expecting to become famous quickly, he arrives at an [[inn]], which he believes to be a [[castle]]; calls the prostitutes he meets \"ladies\" (''doncellas''); and asks the innkeeper, whom he takes as the lord of the castle, to dub him a knight. He spends the night holding [[vigil]] over his armor and becomes involved in a fight with [[Arriero|muleteers]] who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules. In a pretended ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.\n\nDon Quixote next \"frees\" a young boy named Andres who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master, and makes his master swear to treat the boy fairly; but the boy's beating is continued as soon as Quixote leaves. Don Quixote then encounters traders from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], who \"insult\" the imaginary Dulcinea. He attacks them, only to be severely beaten and left on the side of the road, and is returned to his home by a neighbouring peasant.\n\n====Destruction of Don Quixote's library (Chapters 6 and 7)====\nWhile Don Quixote is unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parish [[curate]] and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of [[high comedy]]: If the books are so bad for morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel ''[[La Galatea]]'' is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance ''Felixmarte de Hyrcania'' is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the [[The library of Don Quixote|library]], later telling Don Quixote that it was the action of a wizard (''encantador'').\n\n====The Second Sally====\nAfter a short period of feigning health, Don Quixote requests his neighbour, Sancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship (''\u00ednsula''). Sancho is a poor and simple farmer but more practical than the head-in-the-clouds Don Quixote and agrees to the offer, sneaking away with Don Quixote in the early dawn. It is here that their famous adventures begin, starting with Don Quixote's attack on [[Tilting at windmills|windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants]].\n\nThe two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage. Don Quixote takes the [[friar]]s to be enchanters who hold the lady captive, knocks a friar from his horse, and is immediately challenged by an armed [[Basque people|Basque]] traveling with the company. As he has no shield, the Basque uses a pillow to protect himself, which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. Cervantes chooses this point, in the middle of the battle, to say that his source ends here. Soon, however, he resumes Don Quixote's adventures after a story about finding Arabic notebooks containing the rest of the story by Cid Hamet Ben Engeli. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those traveling with her to \"surrender\" to Don Quixote.\n\n[[Image:Quijote1y2.jpg|thumb|First editions of the first and second part]]\n\n=====The Pastoral Peregrinations (Chapters 11\u201315)=====\nSancho and Don Quixote fall in with a group of goat herders. Don Quixote tells Sancho and the goat herders about the \"Golden Age\" of man, in which property does not exist and men live in peace. The goatherders invite the Knight and Sancho to the funeral of Gris\u00f3stomo, a former student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels (paralleling Don Quixote's decision to become a knight), seeking the shepherdess Marcela. At the funeral Marcela appears, vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by Gris\u00f3stomo, and claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clich\u00e9s. She disappears into the woods, and Don Quixote and Sancho follow. Ultimately giving up, the two dismount by a pond to rest. Some [[Galician people|Galicians]] arrive to water their ponies, and Rocinante (Don Quixote's horse) attempts to mate with the ponies. The Galicians hit Rocinante with clubs to dissuade him, whereupon Don Quixote tries to defend Rocinante. The Galicians beat Don Quixote and Sancho, leaving them in great pain.\n\n=====The inn (Chapters 16\u201317)=====\nAfter escaping the musketeers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride to a nearby inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Helen, to be a beautiful princess, and makes her sit on his bed with him, scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls \"the balm of Firearbras\", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.\n\n=====The galley slaves and Cardenio (Chapters 19\u201324)=====\n[[File:Don Quijote and Sancho Panza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Don Quixote de la Mancha and Sancho Panza'', 1863, by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\nAfter Don Quixote has adventures involving a dead body, a helmet, and freeing a group of [[galley slave]]s, he and Sancho wander into the [[Sierra Morena]] and there encounter the dejected [[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]. Cardenio relates the first part of his [[The History of Cardenio#Synopsis of \"Cardenio\", the episode in the novel Don Quixote|story]], in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend Luscinda, and is hired as the companion to the Duke's son, leading to his friendship with the Duke's younger son, Don Fernando. Cardenio confides in Don Fernando his love for Luscinda and the delays in their engagement, caused by Cardenio's desire to keep with tradition. After reading Cardenio's poems praising Luscinda, Don Fernando falls in love with her. Don Quixote interrupts when Cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels. They get into a fight, ending with Cardenio beating all of them and walking away to the mountains.\n\n=====The priest, the barber, and Dorotea (Chapters 25\u201331)=====\nQuixote pines for Dulcinea, imitating Cardenio. Quixote sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest and brings them to Quixote. The priest and barber make plans to trick Don Quixote to come home. They get the help of Dorotea, a woman who has been deceived by Don Fernando. She pretends that she is the Princess Micomicona and desperate to get Quixote's help. Quixote runs into Andres, who insults his incompetence.\n\n=====Return to the inn (Chapters 32\u201342)=====\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nThe group returns to the previous inn where the priest tells the story of Anselmo while Quixote battles with wineskins. Dorotea is reunited with Don Fernando and Cardenio with Lucinda. A captive from Moorish lands arrives and is asked to tell the story of his life. A judge arrives, and it is found that the captive is his long-lost brother, and the two are reunited.\n\n=====The ending (Chapters 45\u201352)=====\nAn officer of the [[Santa Hermandad]] has a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley-slaves. The priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote\u2019s insanity. The officer agrees, and Quixote is locked in a cage and made to think that it is an enchantment and that there is a prophecy of his heroic return home. While traveling, the group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage, and he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, and he is finally brought home. The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.\n\n===Part 2===\n[[File:Don Quixote Illustration I.jpg|thumb|Illustration to ''The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha''. Volume II. Ilustraci\u00f3n para el ingenioso caballero Don Quijote de La Mancha. Volumen dos.]]\n\nAlthough the two parts are now published as a single work, ''Don Quixote, Part Two'' was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. While ''Part One'' was mostly farcical, the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception.\n\n''Part Two'' of ''Don Quixote'' explores the concept of a character understanding that he is written about, an idea much explored in the 20th century.\n\n====The Third Sally====\nAs ''Part Two'' begins, it is assumed that the literate classes of Spain have all read the first part of the story. Cervantes's [[meta-fiction]]al device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of ''Part One'', as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of ''Part One'') that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.\n\nSancho later gets his comeuppance for this when, as part of one of the Duke and Duchess's pranks, the two are led to believe that the only method to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the Duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets a governorship, though it is false; and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler; though this ends in humiliation as well. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.\n\nThe lengthy untold \"history\" of Don Quixote's adventures in knight-errantry comes to a close after his battle with the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Don Quixote's hometown who had previously posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach in [[Barcelona]], in which the reader finds him conquered. Bound by the rules of chivalry, Don Quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror: here, it is that Don Quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year (in which he may be cured of his madness). He and Sancho undergo one more prank by the Duke and Duchess before setting off.\n\nUpon returning to his village, Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully recovered his sanity. Sancho tries to restore his faith, but Quixano (his proper name) only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.\n\n==Meaning==\n[[Harold Bloom]] says that ''Don Quixote'' is a work of radical [[nihilism]] and anarchism,{{Failed verification|date=February 2017}} which prefers the glory of fantasy over a real world, which includes imminent death, and is \"the first modern novel\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes The Knight in the Mirror] a 2003 book report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about [[Harold Bloom]]'s book.</ref>\n\n[[Edith Grossman]], who wrote and published a highly acclaimed English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:<blockquote>The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muOZ6WdAg3o Edith Grossman about Don Quixote as tragedy and comedy] a discussion held in New York City on 5 February 2009 by [[Words Without Borders]] (YouTube)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Themes==\n{{See also|List of works influenced by Don Quixote}}\n[[File:Don Quichotte Honor\u00e9 Daumier.jpg|thumb|right|''Don Quixote'' by [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] (1868)]]\n\nThe novel's structure is [[episode|episodic]] in form. It is written in the ''[[Picaresque novel|picaresco]]'' style of the late 16th century and features references to other picaresque novels including ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' and ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, as ''ingenioso'' (Spanish) means \"quick with inventiveness\",<ref>{{lang|es|ingenio <sup>'''1'''</sup>}}, ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola''</ref> marking the transition of modern literature from [[Classical unities|dramatic]] to thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.\n\nAlthough [[burlesque]] on the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.\n\nEven faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire of [[orthodoxy]], veracity and even nationalism. In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped move beyond the narrow literary conventions of the [[chivalric romance]] literature that he [[Parody|spoofed]], which consists of straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to the [[Chivalry|knightly virtues]] of the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the word ''[[Quixotism|quixotic]]'' was quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed, [[Rocinante]], are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase \"[[tilting at windmills]]\" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies, derives from an iconic scene in the book.\n\nIt stands in a unique position between medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]] and the modern novel. The former consist of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through \"having read his adventures\", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more \"Alonso Quixano the Good\".\n\n==Background==\n\n===Sources===\nSources for ''Don Quixote'' include the Castilian novel ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, is ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', which the priest describes in Chapter VI of ''Quixote'' as \"the best book in the world.\" (However, the sense in which it was \"best\" is much debated among scholars. The passage is called since the 19th century \"the most difficult passage of ''Don Quixote''\".)\nThe scene of the book burning gives us an excellent list of Cervantes's likes and dislikes about literature.\n\nCervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poem ''[[Orlando furioso]]''. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet of [[Mambrino]], an episode from Canto I of ''Orlando'', and itself a reference to [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s ''[[Orlando innamorato]]''.<ref>''Don Quijote de la Mancha'', Miguel de Cervantes, Edici\u00f3n de Florencio Sevilla Arroyo, \u00c1rea 2002 p.161</ref> The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 of ''Orlando'', regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.<ref>\"Don Quixote\" by Miguel de Cervantes, translated and annotated by Edith Grossman, p.272</ref>\n\nAnother important source appears to have been Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale \"The Curious Impertinent\" in chapter 35 of the first part of ''Don Quixote'' is a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes's program.<ref>See chapter 2 of E. C. Graf's ''Cervantes and Modernity''.</ref> Similarly, many of both Sancho's adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian folklore.\n\nCervantes's experiences as a [[galley slave]] in Algiers also influenced ''Quixote''.\n\n===Spurious ''Second Part'' by Avellaneda===\nIt is not certain when Cervantes began writing ''Part Two'' of ''Don Quixote'', but he had probably not proceeded much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. About September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitled ''Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate) [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]], of [[Tordesillas]]'', was published in [[Tarragona]] by an unidentified [[Aragon]]ese who was an admirer of [[Lope de Vega]], rival of Cervantes.<ref name=\"Ei\">{{cite book|first=D. |last=Eisenberg|title=Cervantes, Lope and Avellaneda|work= ''Estudios cervantinos'' (Barcelona: Sirmio, 1991), pp. 119\u201341|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/hisp/56826142007993728511191/p0000002.htm#I_7_.}}</ref>\n\nSome modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote's fictional encounter with Avellaneda in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that ''Cervantes'' encountered it, which may have been much earlier.\n\nAvellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who not surprisingly took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes' ''Segunda Parte'' lend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.\n\nIn his introduction to ''The Portable Cervantes'', [[Samuel Putnam]], a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version \"one of the most disgraceful performances in history\".<ref>Cervantes, Miguel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9eAOicE_b4AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=putnam+portable+cervantes&hl=en&ei=0A3QTfiaBIHz0gGF4aSfDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Portable Cervantes''], ed.

By [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\n''Don Quixote, Part One'' contains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of the [[picaresque]] figures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is \"El Curioso Impertinente\" (the impertinently curious man), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of a [[Florence|Florentine]] nobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity, and talks his close friend [[Lothario]] into attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.\n\nIn ''Part Two'', the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions in ''Part One'' and promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, \"Part Two\" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.\n\nSeveral abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.<ref>An example is ''The Portable Cervantes'' (New York: Viking Penguin, 1949), which contains an abridged version of the Samuel Putnam translation.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\n===Spelling and pronunciation===\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}\nCervantes wrote his work in early modern Spanish, heavily borrowing from [[Old Spanish language|Old Castilian]], the medieval form of the language. The language of ''Don Quixote'', although still containing [[archaisms]], is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of the ''[[Poema de mio Cid]]'', a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes's language as [[Middle English]] is from [[Modern English]]. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.\n\nIn ''Don Quixote'', there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource \u2013 he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and many times, when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearian English, or even Middle English.)\n\nIn Old Castilian, the letter ''x'' represented the sound written ''sh'' in modern English, so the name was originally pronounced {{IPA-es|ki\u02c8\u0283ote|}}. However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, a [[sound change]] caused it to be pronounced with a [[voiceless velar fricative]] sound (like the [[Scots language|Scottish]] or German ''ch''), and today the Spanish pronunciation of \"Quixote\" is {{IPA-es|ki\u02c8xote|}}. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such as [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[French language|French]], where it is pronounced with a \"sh\" or \"ch\" sound; the French opera ''[[Don Quichotte]]'' is one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.\n\nToday, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation of ''Quixote'' (''Quijote''), as {{IPAc-en|k|i\u02d0|\u02c8|h|o\u028a|t|i|}},<ref name=\"oed\"/> although the traditional English [[spelling pronunciation|spelling-based pronunciation]] with the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|\u0259|t|}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|o\u028a|t|}}. In [[Australian English]], the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|\u0259|t|}} until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to \"anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=P.

Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:\n\n{{quote|text=Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer.|sign=Miguel de Cervantes|source=''Don Quixote'', Volume II, Chapter 74}}\n\nIn 2004, a multidisciplinary team of academics from [[Complutense University]], led by Francisco Parra Luna, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Nieto, and Santiago Petschen Verdaguer, deduced that the village was that of [[Villanueva de los Infantes, Ciudad Real|Villanueva de los Infantes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article404423.ece|title=To Quixote's village at the speed of a nag|publisher=Times Online | location=London}}</ref> Their findings were published in a paper titled ''\"'El Quijote' como un sistema de distancias/tiempos: hacia la localizaci\u00f3n del lugar de la Mancha\"'', which was later published as a book: ''El enigma resuelto del Quijote''.

Cervantes was friend of the family Villase\u00f1or, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acu\u00f1a. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road from [[El Toboso]] to [[Miguel Esteban]] in 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of \"hidalgo\", and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2014/12/07/54830651268e3e242b8b4576.html|title=Don Quijote era Acu\u00f1a el Procurador|publisher=El Mundo | location=Madrid}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2014/12/07/actualidad/1417983722_234613.html|title=Don Quijote de La Mancha: \u00bfrealidad o ficci\u00f3n?|publisher=El Pa\u00eds | location=Madrid}}</ref>\n\n===Language===\nBecause of its widespread influence, ''Don Quixote'' also helped cement the modern Spanish language. The opening sentence of the book created a classic Spanish clich\u00e9 with the phrase {{lang|es| \"de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme\" }} (\"whose name I do not wish to recall\"): {{lang|es| \"En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no hace mucho tiempo que viv\u00eda un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, roc\u00edn flaco y galgo corredor.\"}} (\"In a village of La Mancha, whose name I do not wish to recall, there lived, not very long ago, one of those gentlemen with a lance in the lance-rack, an ancient shield, a skinny old horse, and a fast greyhound.\")\n\nThe novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming in ''Don Quixote'' makes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the names ''[[Rocinante]]''<ref>{{lang|es|rocinante}}: deriv. of ''roc\u00edn'', work horse; colloq., brusque labourer; rough, unkempt man. ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola.</ref> (a reversal) and ''[[Dulcinea]]'' (an allusion to illusion), and the word {{lang|es|quixote}} itself, possibly a pun on {{lang|es|quijada}} (jaw) but certainly {{lang|es|cuixot}} (Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse's [[rump (animal)|rump]].<ref>quijote<sup>'''1.2'''</sup>: rump or haunch. ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola.''</ref>\n\nAs a military term, the word ''quijote'' refers to ''[[cuisses]]'', part of a full suit of [[plate armour]] protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix ''-ote'' denotes the augmentative\u2014for example, ''grande'' means large, but ''grandote'' means extra large. Following this example, ''Quixote'' would suggest 'The Great Quijano', a play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur.\n\n''La Mancha'' is a region of Spain, but ''mancha'' (Spanish word) means spot, mark, stain. Translators such as [[John Ormsby (translator)|John Ormsby]] have declared La Mancha to be one of the most desertlike, unremarkable regions of Spain, the least romantic and fanciful place that one would imagine as the home of a courageous knight.\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:Illustration to Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration to ''Don Quixote de la Mancha'' by Miguel de Cervantes (the edition translated by Charles Jarvis)]]\n[[File:Don Quixote attacking a puppet theatre.jpg|thumb|upright|Don Quixote.

''Don Quixote'' had been growing in favour, and its author's name was now known beyond the [[Pyrenees]].

In 1607, an edition was printed in [[Brussels]]. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet demand with a third edition, a seventh publication in all, in 1608. Popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller issued an Italian edition in 1610.

Many people agree that it is richer and more profound.{{Who|date=February 2013}} Parts One and Two were published as one edition in Barcelona in 1617. Historically, Cervantes's work has been said to have \"smiled [[Spanish chivalry|Spain's chivalry]] away\", suggesting that Don Quixote as a chivalric satire contributed to the demise of Spanish Chivalry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prestage|first=Edgar| title=Chivalry|year=1928|page=110}}</ref>\n\n===English editions in translation===\n[[File:Gustave Dor\u00e9 - Miguel de Cervantes - Don Quixote - Part 1 - Chapter 1 - Plate 1 \"A world of disorderly notions, picked out of his books, crowded into his imagination\".jpg|thumb|upright|Don Quixote goes mad from his reading of books of chivalry.

The translation, as literary critics claim, was not based on Cervantes' text but mostly upon a French work by Filleau de Saint-Martin and upon notes which Thomas Shelton had written.\n\nAround 1700, a version by [[Pierre Antoine Motteux]] appeared.

Through a printer's error, it came to be known, and is still known, as \"the Jarvis translation\". It was the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time, but future translator John Ormsby points out in his own introduction to the novel that the Jarvis translation has been criticized as being too stiff. Nevertheless, it became the most frequently reprinted translation of the novel until about 1885. Another 18th-century translation into English was that of [[Tobias Smollett]], himself a novelist, first published in 1755. Like the Jarvis translation, it continues to be reprinted today.\n\nA translation by Alexander James Duffield appeared in 1881 and another by Henry Edward Watts in 1888.

For many participants, the movement was a protest against the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[colonialism|colonialist]] interests, which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war, and against the cultural and intellectual conformity\u2014in art and more broadly in society\u2014that corresponded to the war.<ref name=RichterAntiArt>{{Citation | last=Richter | first=Hans | year=1965 | title=Dada: Art and Anti-art | location= New York and Toronto | publisher = Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nAvant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments.

If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend.\n\nAs [[Hugo Ball]] expressed it, \"For us, art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in.\"<ref>{{Citation | title=DADA: Cities | url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]] | accessdate=2008-10-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | archive-date=2008-11-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}</ref>\n\nA reviewer from the ''[[ARTnews|American Art News]]'' stated at the time that \"Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man.\" Art historians have described Dada as being, in large part, a \"reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide.\"<ref name=\"gardners\">{{Citation | author = Fred S. Kleiner | title = Gardner's Art Through the Ages | edition = 12th | year = 2006 | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | page = 754}}</ref>\n\nYears later, Dada artists described the movement as \"a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis, a savior, a monster, which would lay waste to everything in its path... [It was] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege.\"<ref name=\"gardners\"/>\n\nTo quote Dona Budd's ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', <blockquote>Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Z\u00fcrich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words \"da, da,\" meaning \"yes, yes\" in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name \"Dada\" came during a meeting of the group when a [[paper knife]] stuck into a French\u2013German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for '[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobbyhorse]]'.<ref name=\"Budd\" /></blockquote> The movement primarily involved [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[art manifesto]]s, [[aesthetics|art theory]], [[theatre]], and [[graphic design]], and concentrated its [[anti-war]] politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through anti-art cultural works.\n\nThe creations of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and others between 1915 and 1917 eluded the term Dada at the time, and \"[[New York Dada]]\" came to be seen as a post facto invention of Duchamp. At the outset of the 1920's the term Dada flourished in Europe with the help of Duchamp and Picabia, who had both returned from New York. Notwithstanding, Dadaists such as Tzara and Richter claimed European precedence. Art historian David Hopkins notes:\n\n<blockquote>Ironically, though, Duchamp's late activities in New York, along with the machinations of Picabia, re-cast Dada's history. Dada's European chroniclers\u2014primarily Richter, Tzara, and Huelsenbeck\u2014would eventually become preoccupied with establishing the pre-eminence of Zurich and Berlin at the foundations of Dada, but it proved to be Duchamp who was most strategically brilliant in manipulating the genealogy of this avant-garde formation, deftly turning New York Dada from a late-comer into an originating force.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=1118476182 Hopkins, David, ''A Companion to Dada and Surrealism''], Volume 10 of Blackwell Companions to Art History, John Wiley & Sons, May 2, 2016, p. 83, ISBN 11184761828</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\n\n===Z\u00fcrich===\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90\u00d7144&nbsp;cm, [[Berlin State Museums|Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]]]]\nIn 1916, [[Hugo Ball]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Marcel Janco]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Sophie Taeuber]], and [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], along with others, discussed art and put on performances in the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\u00fcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] expressing their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it.\n\nSome sources state that Dada coalesced on October&nbsp;6 at the Cabaret Voltaire. Other sources state that Dada did not originate fully in a Z\u00fcrich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe, particularly Romania, that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish [[Modernism|modernist]] artists (Tzara, Janco, [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], and others) settled in Z\u00fcrich. In the years prior to the First World War similar art had already risen in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities; it is likely that Dada's catalyst was the arrival in Z\u00fcrich of artists like Tzara and Janco.<ref>Tom Sandqvist, ''DADA EAST: The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire'', London MIT Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nHaving left Germany and Romania during the Great War, the artists found themselves in Switzerland, a country recognized for its neutrality. Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction to fight against the social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society, a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the ''[[status quo]]''.<ref name=\"nga.gov\">{{cite web|title=Introduction: \"Everybody can Dada\"|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=10 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|archive-date=2 November 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nJanco recalled, \"We had lost confidence in our culture.

In 1917, Tzara wrote a second [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto|Dada manifesto]] considered one of the most important Dada writings, which was published in 1918. Other manifestos followed.\n\nA single issue of the magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire'' was the first publication to come out of the movement.\n\nAfter the cabaret closed down, Dada activities moved on to a new gallery, and [[Hugo Ball]] left for Bern. Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas. He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters, and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist. The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened, and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf.\n\nZ\u00fcrich Dada, with Tzara at the helm, published the art and literature review ''Dada'' beginning in July 1917, with five editions from Z\u00fcrich and the final two from Paris.\n\nOther artists, such as [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]], created \u201cliterature groups to help extend the influence of Dada.\u201d<ref>Europe of Cultures.

Others, such as the Swiss native [[Sophie Taeuber]], would remain in Z\u00fcrich into the 1920s.\n\n===Berlin===\n[[File:An Anna Blume.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Anna Blume, Dichtungen'', 1919]]\n\"Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers, of mounting, thundering hunger, where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust, and men's minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence... Fear was in everybody's bones \"- Richard H\u00fclsenbeck\n\nThe groups in Germany were not as strongly [[anti-art]] as other groups. Their activity and art were more political and social, with corrosive [[art manifesto|manifestos]] and propaganda, satire, public demonstrations and overt political activities. The intensely political and war-torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists. Conversely, New York's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically-driven, less political nature.<ref>{{Cite book|title = New York Dada|last = Naumann|first = Francis M.|publisher = Abrams|year = 1994|isbn = 0810936763|location = New York}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1918, while the Great War was approaching its climax, Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin, and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year. Following the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], by then out of the war, [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]] and [[George Grosz]] used Dada to express communist sympathies. Grosz, together with [[John Heartfield]], H\u00f6ch and Hausmann developed the [[wikt:technique|technique]] of [[photomontage]] during this period.\n\nAfter the war, the artists published a series of short-lived political magazines and held the ''First International Dada Fair'', 'the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists', in the summer of 1920.<ref name=\"Dada, Dickermann p443\">Dada, Dickermann, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2006 p443</ref> As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada \u2013 Grosz, [[Raoul Hausmann]], Hannah H\u00f6ch, [[Johannes Baader]], Huelsenbeck and Heartfield \u2013 the exhibition also included the work of [[Otto Dix]], [[Francis Picabia]], Jean Arp, [[Max Ernst]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]], [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld|Johannes Baargeld]] and others.<ref name=\"Dada, Dickermann p443\"/> In all, over 200 works were exhibited, surrounded by incendiary slogans, some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi's ''[[Entartete Kunst]]'' exhibition in 1937.

Cologne's Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub, and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a [[Eucharist|communion]] dress. The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped.<ref>{{Citation\n|last=Schaefer\n|first=Robert A.\n|date=September 7, 2006\n|title=Das Ist Dada\u2013An Exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC\n|periodical=Double Exposure\n|url=http://www.doubleexposure.com/DadaExhibit.shtml\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917; photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]\n\n===New York===\n{{main|New York Dada}}\nLike Z\u00fcrich, New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War. Soon after arriving from France in 1915, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]] met American artist [[Man Ray]]. By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical [[anti-art]] activities in the United States. American [[Beatrice Wood]], who had been studying in France, soon joined them, along with [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]. [[Arthur Cravan]], fleeing conscription in France, was also in New York for a time. Much of their activity centered in [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s gallery, [[291 (art gallery)|291]], and the home of [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]].\n\nThe New Yorkers, though not particularly organized, called their activities ''Dada,'' but they did not issue manifestos. They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as ''[[The Blind Man]]'', ''Rongwrong'', and ''New York Dada'' in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for ''museum'' art. New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor. In his book ''Adventures in the arts: informal chapters on painters, vaudeville and poets'' [[Marsden Hartley]] included an essay on \"[[s:The Importance of Being Dada|The Importance of Being 'Dada']]\".\n\n[[File:Label for the Belle Haleine cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Rrose S\u00e9lavy]], the alter ego of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]]]]\nDuring this time Duchamp began exhibiting \"[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]\" (everyday objects found or purchased and declared art) such as a bottle rack, and was active in the [[Society of Independent Artists]]. In 1917 he submitted the now famous ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal signed R.&nbsp;Mutt, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece. First an object of scorn within the arts community, the ''Fountain'' has since become almost canonized by some<ref name=\"Independent\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/fountain-most-influential-piece-of-modern-art-673625.html, ''Fountain' most influential piece of modern art''], Independent, December 2, 2004</ref> as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture.

For seven years he also published the Dada periodical ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' in Barcelona, New York City, Z\u00fcrich, and Paris from 1917 through 1924.\n\nBy 1921, most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation.\n\n===Paris===\n[[File:Man Ray, Rencontre dans la porte tournante.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Man Ray]], c. 1921\u201322, ''Rencontre dans la porte tournante'', published on the cover of ''[[Der Sturm]]'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]\n[[File:Man Ray, Dessin.jpg|thumb|upright|Man Ray, c. 1921\u201322, ''Dessin'' (''Drawing''), published on page 43 of ''Der Sturm'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]\nThe French [[avant-garde]] kept abreast of Dada activities in Z\u00fcrich with regular communications from [[Tristan Tzara]] (whose pseudonym means \"sad in country,\" a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania), who exchanged letters, poems, and magazines with [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Cl\u00e9ment Pansaers]], and other French writers, critics and artists.\n\nParis had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, [[Erik Satie]], collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]] in a mad, scandalous ballet called ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]''. First performed by the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's ''[[Le Sacre du printemps]]'' had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with.\n\nDada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there. Inspired by Tzara, Paris Dada soon issued manifestos, organized demonstrations, staged performances and produced a number of journals (the final two editions of ''Dada'', ''Le Cannibale'', and ''Litt\u00e9rature'' featured Dada in several editions.)<ref>Marc Dachy, Dada, la r\u00e9volte de l'art, Paris, Gallimard / Centre Pompidou, \"[[D\u00e9couvertes Gallimard]]\" n\u00b0 476, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the ''[[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]]'' in 1921. [[Jean Crotti]] exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled, ''Explicatif''  bearing the word ''Tabu''. In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' to howls of derision from the audience. When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production, the play provoked a theatre riot (initiated by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]) that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce [[Surrealism]]. Tzara's last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his \"[[Irony|ironic]] [[tragedy]]\" ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' in 1924.\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around [[Theo van Doesburg]], best known for establishing the [[De Stijl]] movement and magazine of the same name. Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry, and included poems from many well-known Dada writers in ''De Stijl'' such as [[Hugo Ball]], [[Hans Arp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Van Doesburg and {{Interlanguage link multi|Thijs Rinsema|nl}} (a [[cordwainer]] and artist in [[Drachten]]) became friends of Schwitters, and together they organized the so-called ''Dutch Dada campaign'' in 1923, where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada (entitled ''What is Dada?''), Schwitters read his poems, [[Vilmos Husz\u00e1r]] demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg (Theo's wife), played [[avant-garde]] compositions on piano.\n\n[[File:I.K. Bonset Voorbijtrekkende troep 2.jpg|thumb|A Bonset sound-poem, \"Passing troop\", 1916]]\nVan Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in ''De Stijl'', although under a pseudonym, I.K.&nbsp;Bonset, which was only revealed after his death in 1931. 'Together' with I.K.&nbsp;Bonset, he also published a short-lived [[Dutch literature|Dutch]] Dada magazine called ''M\u00e9cano'' (1922\u20133). Another Dutchman identified by [[K. Schippers]] in his study of the movement in the Netherlands<ref>''Holland Dada'', Amsterdam, 1974</ref> was the [[Groningen]] typographer [[H. N. Werkman]], who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, ''The Next Call'' (1923\u20136). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Caf\u00e9 Voltaire in Z\u00fcrich, and [[Paul Citroen]].\n\n===Georgia===\nAlthough Dada itself was unknown in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] until at least 1920, from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves \"41st Degree\" (referring both to the latitude of [[Tbilisi]], Georgia and to the temperature of a high fever) organized  along Dadaist lines. The most important figure in this group was [[Ilia Zdanevich|Iliazd]], whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists. After his flight to Paris in 1921, he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nIn [[Yugoslavia]] there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922, run mainly by [[Dragan Aleksi\u0107]] and including work by Mihailo S.&nbsp;Petrov, [[Zenitism]]'s two brothers Ljubomir Mici\u0107 and Branko Ve Poljanski.<ref>[https://monoskop.org/Zenit ''Zenit: International Review of Arts and Culture'']</ref> Aleksi\u0107 used the term \"Yougo-Dada\" and is known to have been in contact with [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and [[Tristan Tzara]].<ref>Dubravka Djuri\u0107, Mi\u0161ko \u0160uvakovi\u0107.

It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome, featuring paintings, quotations from Tristan Tzara, and original epigrams such as \"True Dada is against Dada\". The most notable member of this group was [[Julius Evola]], who went on to become an eminent scholar of [[occultism]], as well as a right-wing philosopher and an assistant to [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref>[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/dadas/evola.htm Julius Evola \u2013 International Dada Archive]</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Dada in Ultraman.jpg|thumb|Dada, an iconic character from the Ultra Series.

The Dadaist poem is described as one that abolishes the traditional concept of poetry, including the structure, order, as well as the interplay of sound and meaning or the meaning of language itself. The belief is that the existing system by which information is articulated is said to rob language of its dignity. \n\n[[File:Dadaglobe Form Letter to Vagts (Nov 1920).jpg|thumb|Dadaglobe solicitation form letter signed by Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Walter Serner, c. week of November 8, 1920.

The poems are considered manifestations of modern society such as advertising, technology, and conflict, among others. However, unlike movements such as expressionism, Dadaism appreciated the dynamics of modernity and the urban life. The poetry produced by this genre does not consider the chaotic urban and futuristic world as negative, man-eating or hellish. Instead, there is a focus on how these serve as new natural terrain that opens up new ideas for life and art.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Text Into Image, Image Into Text: Proceedings of the Interdisciplinary|last=Morrison|first=Jeffrey|last2=Krobb|first2=Florian|publisher=Rodopi|year=1997|isbn=9042001526|location=Atlanta|pages=234}}</ref> \n\nDadaism also blurred the line between the literary and visual arts. One of the Dadaist techniques, for instance, proposed the use of physical materials alongside words so that the newly created poem became a fruit of the written idea and the physical artifacts such as newspapers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brazilian Literature as World Literature|last=Coutinho|first=Eduardo|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781501323263|location=New York|pages=158}}</ref> Marc Lowenthal, in ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation'', writes:<blockquote>Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to [[postmodernism]], an influence on [[pop art]], a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for [[Surrealism]].<ref>Marc Lowenthal, translator's introduction to [[Francis Picabia]]'s ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation''</ref></blockquote>Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts; its influence reached into sound and music. [[Kurt Schwitters]] developed what he called ''[[Sound poetry|sound poems]]'', while [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920. Other composers such as [[Erwin Schulhoff]], Hans Heusser and [[Alberto Savinio]] all wrote ''Dada music'', while members of [[Les Six]] collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings. [[Erik Satie]] also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career, although he is primarily associated with musical [[Impressionism]].\n\nIn the very first Dada publication, Hugo Ball describes a \"balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk-songs.\" [[African music]] and jazz were common at Dada gatherings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nMusician [[Frank Zappa]] was a self-proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement:<blockquote>In the early days, I didn't even know what to call the stuff my life was made of.

By 1924 in Paris, Dada was melding into Surrealism, and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements, including Surrealism, [[social realism]] and other forms of [[modernism]]. Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of [[postmodern art]].<ref>{{Citation| last=Locher| first=David| title=Unacknowledged Roots and Blatant Imitation: Postmodernism and the Dada Movement| journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology| volume=4| issue=1| year=1999| url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| accessdate=2007-04-25| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223045916/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| archive-date=2007-02-23| dead-url=yes| df=}}</ref>\n\nBy the dawn of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States. Some ([[Otto Freundlich]], [[Walter Serner]]) died in death camps under [[Adolf Hitler]], who actively persecuted the kind of \"[[degenerate art]]\" that he considered Dada to represent. The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature.\n\nDada is a named influence and reference of various [[anti-art]] and political and cultural movements, including the [[Situationist International]] and [[culture jamming]] groups like the [[Cacophony Society]]. Upon breaking up in July 2012, [[anarchist]] pop band [[Chumbawamba]] issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chumbawamba|url=http://www.chumba.com/|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time that the Z\u00fcrich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\u00fcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment. [[Tom Stoppard]] used this coincidence as a premise for his play ''[[Travesties]]'' (1974), which includes Tzara, Lenin, and [[James Joyce]] as characters. French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue-in-cheek ''L\u00e9nine Dada'' (1989).\n\nThe former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002, by a group proclaiming themselves [[Neo-Dada]]ists, led by [[Mark Divo]].<ref>[http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/11/01/a-work-in-process.php 2002 occupation by neo-Dadaists] ''Prague Post''</ref> The group included [[Leumund Cult|Jan Thieler]], [[Ingo Giezendanner]], Aiana Calugar, [[Lennie Lee]], and Dan Jones. After their eviction, the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada. The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum.\n\nSeveral notable [[retrospective]]s have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society. In 1967, a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris. In 2006, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. The [[LTM Recordings|LTM]] label has released a large number of Dada-related sound recordings, including interviews with artists such as Tzara, Picabia, Schwitters, Arp, and Huelsenbeck, and musical repertoire including Satie, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Picabia, and Nelly van Doesburg.<ref>[http://www.ltmrecordings.com/fdrcat.html LTM Recordings]</ref>\n\n==Art techniques developed==\n\n===Collage===\nThe Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life.\n\n===Cut-up technique===\n[[Cut-up technique]] is an extension of collage to words themselves, [[Tristan Tzara]] describes this in the Dada Manifesto:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=1920-12-12 |accessdate=2011-06-27}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">\nTO MAKE A DADAIST POEM\nTake a newspaper.\nTake some scissors.\nChoose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem.\nCut out the article.\nNext carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag.\nShake gently.\nNext take out each cutting one after the other.\nCopy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.\nThe poem will resemble you.\nAnd there you are \u2013 an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.\n</poem>\n\n===Photomontage===\n[[File:ABCD-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''ABCD'' (self-portrait), a photomontage from 1923\u201324]]\nThe Dadaists \u2013 the \"monteurs\" (mechanics) \u2013 used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media. A variation on the collage technique, photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press. In Cologne, [[Max Ernst]] used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/techniques/index.shtm |title=DADA \u2013 Techniques \u2013 photomontage |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}</ref>\n[[File:MechanicalHead-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''Mechanischer Kopf (Der Geist unserer Zeit)'' (Mechanical Head [The Spirit of Our Age]), c. 1920]]\n\n===Assemblage===\nThe [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]]s were three-dimensional variations of the collage \u2013 the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless (relative to the war) pieces of work including war objects and trash. Objects were nailed, screwed or fastened together in different fashions.

He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called \"readymade aided\" or \"rectified readymades\". Duchamp wrote: \"One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'\"<ref>\"The Writings of Marcel Duchamp\" {{ISBN|0-306-80341-0}}</ref> One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed \"R.

[[B.D. (Doonesbury)|BD]]'s helmet changed from having a \"Y\" (for Yale) to a star (for the fictional Walden College). Mike and BD started ''Doonesbury'' as roommates; they were not roommates in ''Bull Tales''.\n\n''Doonesbury'' became known for its social and political commentary. As of the mid-2010s, it is currently syndicated in approximately 1,400 newspapers worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comic strip \"Doonerbury\" predicts Obama win|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-doonesbury1-2008nov01-story.html|website=LA Times|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1975, ''Doonesbury'' became the first daily comic strip to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]], taking the award for [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning|Editorial Cartooning]].<ref name=toonopedia /> That year, US President [[Gerald Ford]] told the [[Radio and Television Correspondents' Association]] at their annual dinner, \"There are only three major vehicles to keep us informed as to what is going on in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]: the electronic media, the print media, and ''Doonesbury'', not necessarily in that order.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Blair, Walter and Hamlin Hill | title=America's Humor: From Poor Richard to Doonesbury | edition=First paperback | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1980 | isbn=978-0-19-502756-3 | page=511}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stonewall-clip.png|thumb|600px|right|A panel from the a ''Doonesbury'' \"Stonewall\" strip, referring to the [[Watergate scandal]], from August 12, 1974; awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]]]]\n\nIn 1977, Trudeau wrote a script for a 26-minute animated special, ''A Doonesbury Special'', which was produced and directed by Trudeau along with [[John Hubley]] (who died during the storyboarding stage)<ref name=solomon>Solomon, Charles (1989), p. 251.

The special was first broadcast by [[NBC]] on November 27, 1977. It won a Special Jury Award at the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] for best short film, and received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination (for best animated short film), both in 1978.<ref name=solomon/> Voice actors for the special included [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], [[William Sloane Coffin|William Sloane Coffin, Jr.]], [[Jack Gilford]] and [[Will Jordan]]. Also included were two songs \"sung\" by the character Jimmy Thudpucker (actually actor/singer/songwriter/producer James Allen \"Jimmy\" Brewer), entitled \"Stop in the Middle\" and \"I Do Believe\", also part of the \"Special\". While the compositions and performances were credited to \"Jimmy Thudpucker\", they were in fact co-written and sung by Brewer, who also co-wrote and provided the vocals for \"Ginny's Song\", a 1976 single on the Warner Bros. Label, and ''Jimmy Thudpucker's Greatest Hits'', an LP released by Windsong Records, [[John Denver]]'s subsidiary of RCA Records.\n\n===1983\u20131984 hiatus===\nTrudeau took a 22-month hiatus, from January 1983 to October 1984. Before the break in the strip, the characters were eternal college students, living in a [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] together near Walden College, which was modeled after Trudeau's alma mater, Yale. During the break, Trudeau helped create a [[Doonesbury (musical)|Broadway musical of the strip]], showing the graduation of the main characters. The Broadway adaptation opened at the [[Biltmore Theatre]] on November 21, 1983, and played 104 performances. [[Elizabeth Swados]] composed the music for Trudeau's book and lyrics.\n\n===After the hiatus===\nThe strip resumed some time after the events in the musical, with further changes having taken place after the end of the musical's plot. While Mike, Mark, Zonker, B.D., and Boopsie were all now graduates, B.D. and Boopsie were living in [[Malibu, California]], where B.D. was a third-string quarterback for the [[Los Angeles Rams]], and Boopsie was making a living from walk-on and cameo roles. Mark was living in Washington, DC, working for [[National Public Radio]]. Michael and J.J. had gotten married, and Mike had dropped out of business school to start work in an advertising agency in New York City. Zonker, still not ready for the \"real world\", was living with Mike and J.J. until he was accepted as a medical student at his Uncle Duke's \"Baby Doc College\" in [[Haiti]].\n\nPrior to the hiatus, the strip's characters had aged only slightly. But when Trudeau returned to ''Doonesbury,'' the characters began to age in something close to real time, as in ''[[Gasoline Alley]]'' and ''[[For Better or for Worse]].'' Since then, the main characters' ages and career developments have tracked that of standard media portrayals of baby boomers, with jobs in advertising, law enforcement, and the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]]. Current events are mirrored through the original characters, their offspring (the \"second generation\"), and occasional new characters.\n\nGarry Trudeau received the [[National Cartoonist Society]] Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 1994, and their [[Reuben Award]] for 1995 for his work on the strip.\n\n=== ''Alpha House'' and hiatuses: 2013 ===\n''Doonesbury''&apos;s syndicate, [[Universal Uclick]], announced on May 29, 2013, that the comic strip would go on hiatus from June 10 to [[Labor Day]] of that year while Garry Trudeau worked on his streaming video comedy ''[[Alpha House]]'', which was picked up by Amazon Studios.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cavna | first = Michael|date=29 May 2013 | title = THIS JUST IN: 'Doonesbury' to go on sabbatical as Amazon Studios officially picks up Trudeau's Capitol Hill comedy, 'Alpha House' | journal = Washington Post | volume = | issue = | page = blog | accessdate = June 16, 2013 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/this-just-in-doonesbury-to-go-on-sabbatical-as-amazon-studios-officially-picks-up-trudeaus-capitol-hill-comedy-alpha-house/2013/05/29/3aba59ee-c866-11e2-9245-773c0123c027_blog.html}}</ref> \"Doonesbury Flashbacks\" were offered during those weeks, but due to the unusually long hiatus, some newspapers opted to run different comic strips instead.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cavna | first = Michael|date=9 Jun 2013 | title = POST PICKS UP 'FORT KNOX': Military strip will replace 'Doonesbury Flashbacks' for the summer| journal = Washington Post | volume = | issue = | page = blog | accessdate = June 16, 2013 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/post-picks-up-fort-knox-military-strip-will-replace-doonesbury-flashbacks-for-the-summer/2013/06/09/9b1cdcc6-d167-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_blog.html}}</ref> Sunday strips returned as scheduled, but the daily strip's hiatus was extended until November 2013.<ref>[http://www.buffalonews.com/life-arts/trudeau-extends-doonesbury-hiatus-to-finish-tv-series-20130910 Trudeau extends \u2018Doonesbury\u2019 hiatus to finish TV series], The Buffalo News</ref>\nAfter ''Alpha House'' was retained for a second season in February 2014, Trudeau announced that he would now produce only Sunday strips for the foreseeable future.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/this-just-in%E2%80%94trudeau-puts-daily-doonesbury-on-long-term-hiatus-to-work-on-renewed-alpha-house-im-ready-for-an-extended-break/2014/02/11/e22bebbe-92d4-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_blog.html Trudeau puts daily \u2018Doonesbury\u2019 on long-term hiatus], The Washington Post</ref> Since March 3, 2014, the strip has offered reruns starting from the very beginning of its history as opposed to the recent ones that re-run when Trudeau is on vacation.\n\nThough ''Alpha House'' was cancelled following its second season<ref>{{cite web|title=Alpha House Cancelled By Amazon \u2013 No Season 3|url=http://renewcanceltv.com/alpha-house-cancelled-amazon-no-season-3/|work=RenewCancelTV.com|date=August 7, 2016|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}</ref> and has not been in production since 2014, Trudeau has not returned to creating new daily ''Doonesbury'' strips.\n\n==Style==\nWith the exception of Walden College, Trudeau has frequently used real-life settings, based on real scenarios, but with fictional results. Due to deadlines, some real-world events have rendered some of Trudeau's comics unusable, such as a 1973 series featuring [[John Ehrlichman]], a 1989 series set in [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing, China, a 1993 series involving [[Zo\u00eb Baird]], and a 2005 series involving [[Harriet Miers]]. Trudeau has also displayed fluency in various forms of [[jargon]], including those of real estate agents, [[flight attendant]]s, computer scientists, journalists, presidential aides, and soldiers in Iraq.\n\n===Walden College===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Walden College|Walden University}}\nThe unnamed college attended by the main characters was later given the name \"Walden College\", revealed to be in [[Connecticut]] (the same state as Yale), and depicted as devolving into a third-rate institution under the weight of [[grade inflation]], slipping academic standards, and the end of [[tenure]], issues that Trudeau has consistently revisited since the original characters graduated. Some of the second generation of ''Doonesbury'' characters have attended Walden, a venue Trudeau uses to advance his concerns about academic standards in the United States.\n\nPresident King, the leader of Walden College, was originally intended as a parody of [[Kingman Brewster]], President of Yale, but all that remains of that is a certain physical resemblance.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Use of real-life politicians as characters===\nEven though ''Doonesbury'' frequently features real-life U.S. politicians, they are rarely depicted with their real faces. Originally, strips featuring the President of the United States would show an external view of the [[White House]], with dialogue emerging from inside. During the [[Gerald Ford]] administration, characters would be shown speaking to Ford at press conferences, and fictional dialogue supposedly spoken by Ford would be written as coming \"off-panel\". Similarly, while having several characters as students in a class taught by [[Henry Kissinger]], the dialogue made up for Kissinger would also come from \"off-panel\" (although Kissinger had earlier appeared as a character with his face shown in a 1972 series of strips in which he met Mark Slackmeyer while the latter was on a trip to Washington). Sometimes hands, or in rare cases, the back of heads would also be seen.\n\nLater, personal symbols reflecting some aspect of their character came into use. For example, during the 1980s, character Ron Headrest served as a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] for [[Ronald Reagan]] and was depicted as a computer-generated artificial-intelligence, an image based on the television character ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''. Members of the [[Bush family]] have been depicted as invisible. During his term as Vice President, [[George H. W. Bush]] was first depicted as completely invisible, his words emanating from a little \"voice box\" in the air. (In one strip, published March 20, 1988, the vice president almost materialized, but only made it to an outline before reverting to invisibility.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1988/03/20 |title= Doonesbury Comic Strip, March 20, 1988|first= Garry|last= Trudeau|work=gocomics.com |date= 1988-03-20|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref>)\n\n[[George W. Bush]] was symbolized by a [[Stetson]] hat atop the same invisible point, because he was [[Governor of Texas]] prior to his presidency (Trudeau accused him of being \"all hat and no cattle\", reiterating the characterization of Bush by columnist [[Molly Ivins]]). The point became a giant [[asterisk]] (a la [[Roger Maris]]) following the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential elections]] and the controversy over vote-counting. Later, President Bush's hat was changed to a [[Galea (helmet)|Roman military helmet]] (again, atop an asterisk) representing imperialism. Towards the end of his first term, the helmet became battered, with the gilt work starting to come off and with clumps of bristles missing from the top.

Many less well-known politicians have also been represented as icons over the years, like a [[swastika]] for [[David Duke]], but only for the purposes of a gag strip or two. Trudeau has made his use of icons something of an [[in joke]] to readers, where the first appearance of a new one is often a [[Punch line|punchline]] in itself.\n\nThe long career of the series and continual use of real-life political figures, analysts note, have led to some uncanny cases of the cartoon foreshadowing a national shift in the politicians' political fortunes.

Most of the other characters first appeared as family members, friends, or other acquaintances. The original Walden Commune residents were [[Mike Doonesbury]], [[Zonker Harris]], [[Mark Slackmeyer]], Nicole, Bernie, and DiDi. In September 1972, [[Joanie Caucus]] joined the comic, meeting Mike and Mark in Colorado and eventually moving into the commune. They were later joined by [[B.D. (Doonesbury)|B.D.]] and his girlfriend (later wife) [[Boopsie]], upon B.D.'s return from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Nicole, DiDi, and Bernie were mostly phased out in subsequent years, and Zonker's [[Uncle Duke]] was introduced as the most prominent character outside the Walden group, and the main link to many secondary characters.\n\nThe Walden students graduated in 1983, after which the strip began to progress in something closer to real time. Their spouses and developing families became more important after this: Joanie's daughter [[J.J. (Doonesbury)|J.J. Caucus]] married Mike and they had a daughter, [[Alex Doonesbury]]. They divorced, Mike remarried [[Kim Rosenthal]], a Vietnamese refugee (who had appeared in the strip as a baby adopted by a Jewish family just after the [[fall of Saigon]], see [[Operation Babylift]]), and J.J. married Zeke Brenner, her former boyfriend and Uncle Duke's former groundskeeper. Joanie married [[Rick Redfern]], and they had a son, [[Jeff Redfern|Jeff]]. [[Uncle Duke]] and [[Roland Hedley]] have also appeared often, frequently in more topical settings unconnected to the main characters. In more recent years the second generation has taken prominence as they have grown to college age: Jeff Redfern, Alex Doonesbury, Zonker's nephew [[Zipper Harris]], and Uncle Duke's son Earl.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n''Doonesbury'' has delved into a number of political and social issues, causing controversies and breaking new ground on the comics pages.

The face of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. One typical [[List of dice games|dice game]] today is [[craps]], where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to randomize moves in [[board game]]s, usually by deciding the distance through which a piece will move along the board; examples of this are backgammon and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''.\n\nThe result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of [[classical mechanics]]. A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of [[hardware random number generator]]. Perhaps to mitigate concerns that the pips on the faces of certain styles of dice cause a small bias,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dice-play.com/DiceCasino.htm|title=Casino Dice|website=www.dice-play.com|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref> casinos use precision dice with flush markings.\n\n==Construction==\n===Arrangement===\n[[File:Chiralit\u00e4t von W\u00fcrfeln V.2.svg|thumb|left|[[Chirality]] of dice.

The pips or numbers on the die are a part of the mold. The coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the die entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry. The die is then polished via a [[tumble finishing]] process similar to [[rock polishing]]. The [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasive agent]] scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also creates the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.<ref name=\"awesomedice\">[http://www.awesomedice.com/blog/64/how-dice-are-made/ How Dice Are Made] from Awesome Dice</ref>\n\nPrecision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same [[density]] as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. All such dice are stamped with a [[serial number]] to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die. Precision backgammon dice are made the same way; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the dice cup and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.\n\n===Terms===\nWhile the terms ''[[ace]]'', ''deuce'', ''trey'', ''cater'', ''cinque'' and ''sice'' are generally obsolete, with the names of the numbers preferred, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice.

The numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, are distinguished with a dot or underline.\n\n====Standard variations====\n{{Further information|isohedral figure{{!}}isohedron}}\nDice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the [[Platonic solid]]s, whose faces are [[regular polygon]]s. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal [[trapezohedron]] die, whose faces are ten [[kite (geometry)|kites]], each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing for a pair of 10-sided dice to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate the real probability distributions of the events they simulate. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to [[normal distribution]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |title=Tumbling Dice & Birthdays: Understanding the Central Limit Theorem |publisher=Minitab |first=Michelle |last=Paret |first2=Eston |last2=Martz |year=2009 |accessdate=29 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101141751/http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df= }}</ref> \n\nUnlike other common dice, a [[four-sided die]] does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it has to be read in a different way. Many such dice have the numbers printed around the points, so that when it settles, the numbers at the vertex pointing up are the same and are read. Alternatively, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middles of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are read.\n\nNormally, the faces on a die will be placed so opposite faces will add up to one more than the number of faces (this is not possible with 4-sided dice and dice with an odd-number of faces). Some dice, such as those with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 21 if numbered 1\u201320.\n|}\n\n====Rarer variations====\n\"Uniform fair dice\" are dice where all faces have equal probability of outcome due to the symmetry of the die as it is [[isohedral figure|face-transitive]].

This is a less symmetric tetrahedron than the Platonic tetrahedron, but still sufficiently symmetrical to be face-transitive. Similarly, [[Pyritohedron|pyritohedra]] and [[tetartoid]]s are less symmetrical but still face-transitive dodecahedra: 12 sides.\n\n[[Long dice]] can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aleakybos.ch/Properties%20of%20Dice.pdf |title=Properties of Dice |first=Alea |last=Kybos |accessdate=7 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528013233/http://www.aleakybos.ch/Properties%20of%20Dice.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2012 |df= }}</ref> They are based on the infinite set of [[prism (geometry)|prisms]].

However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for [[Boggle]], directions for ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'', [[Fudge (role-playing game system)#Fudge dice|Fudge dice]], playing card symbols for [[poker dice]], and instructions for sexual acts using [[sex dice]].\n\n===Alternatively numbered dice===\nDice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.<ref name=\"em4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.em4miniatures.com/acatalog/SPECIALIST_D6.html|title=Specialist D6|website=em4miniatures|access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"tmp\">{{Cite web|url=http://theminiaturespage.com/boards/msg.mv?id=184673|title=[TMP] 'What are Average Dice' Topic|date=20 November 2009|website=The Miniatures Page|language=en|access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref> These are six-sided dice with sides numbered <code>2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5</code>, which have the same [[arithmetic mean]] as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top [[wargaming|wargames]], where a narrower range of numbers is required.<ref name=\"tmp\" /> Other numbered variations include [[Sicherman dice]] and [[nontransitive dice]].\n\n===Spherical dice===\n[[File:Black and red round 6-sided die.jpg|150px|thumb|A spherical die]]\nA die can be constructed in the shape of a sphere, with the addition of an internal cavity in the shape of the [[dual polyhedron]] of the desired die shape and an internal weight. The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.\n\n==Applications==\n[[Image:Wuerfel5.jpg|thumb|180px|Typical role-playing dice, showing a variety of colors and styles. Note the older hand-inked green 12-sided die (showing an 11), manufactured before pre-inked dice were common. Many players collect or acquire a large number of mixed and unmatching dice.]]\nPolyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like ''[[Exalted]]'' which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, [[dice notation]] is frequently used.\n\nMany board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as Axis & Allies, have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In Castles of Burgundy, players spend their dice to take actions based on the die's value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In Quarriors (and its descendent, Dicemasters), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/10/02/making-better-use-of-dice-in-g.html|title=Making better use of dice in games|date=2 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDice can be used for [[divination]] and using dice for such a purpose is called [[cleromancy]]. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this [[Mo (divination)|method of divination]]. It is highly likely that the [[Pythagoreans]] used the [[Platonic solids]] as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=Kenneth |title=The Pythagorean sourcebook and library: an anthology of ancient writings which relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy |year=1988 |publisher=Phanes Press |location=Grand Rapids, MI |isbn=978-0-933999-50-3 |oclc=255212063 }}</ref>\n\nAstrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the [[orbital node|nodes]] of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. A specialized icosahedron die provides the answers of the [[Magic 8-Ball]], conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\n===Notation===\n{{Main|Dice notation}}\nIn many gaming contexts, especially tabletop role-playing games, shorthand notations representing different dice rolls are used. A \"d\" or \"D\" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example, <code>d4</code> denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence, <code>6d8</code> means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, <code>3d6+4</code> instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Master Jean de Maul\u00e9on - Playing Dice - Walters W4492V - Full Page.jpg|thumb|Medieval People at Play, The [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore]]\n\n* [[Crown and Anchor]]\n* [[d20 System]]\n* [[Dreidel]]\n* [[Fuzzy dice]]\n* ''[[Musikalisches W\u00fcrfelspiel]]''\n* [[Quincunx]]\n* [[Teetotum]]\n* [[Urim and Thummim]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* [[Persi Diaconis|Diaconis, Persi]]; and Keller, Joseph B.; [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/fairdice.pdf \"Fair Dice\"], ''The American Mathematical Monthly'', 96(4):337\u2013339, 1989 (Discussion of dice that are fair \"by symmetry\" and \"by continuity\".)\n* Iverson, G.

As a privacy violation, discarded medical records as trash led to a $140,000 penalty against  Massachusetts billing company Goldthwait Associates and a group of pathology offices in 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/whitecoatnotes/2013/01/07/doctors-billing-company-pay-penalty-for-records-tossed-public-dump/FDGSf172lyc2xasT6D0DRM/story.html|title=Doctors, billing company pay $140,000 penalty for records tossed in public dump|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref> and a $400,000 settlement between Midwest Women\u2019s Healthcare Specialists and 1,532 clients in Kansas City in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article4279093.html|title=Settlement reached in medical billing records case|website=kansascity|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Legal status ==\nSince dumpsters are usually located on private premises, divers may occasionally get in trouble for [[trespassing]] while dumpster diving, though the law is enforced with varying degrees of rigor.<ref name=\"Mansvelt\"/> Some businesses may lock dumpsters to prevent pickers from congregating on their property, vandalism to their property, and to limit potential liability if a dumpster diver is injured while on their property.<ref name=\"Mansvelt\"/> Dumpster diving is often not prohibited by law. [[Abandonment of property]] is another principle of law that applies to recovering materials via dumpster diving.\n\n[[Police]] searches of discarded waste as well as similar methods are also generally not considered violations; [[evidence (law)|evidence]] [[Search and seizure|seized]] in this manner has been permitted in many [[criminal procedure|criminal trials]]. In the United States this has been affirmed by numerous courts including and up to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in the decision ''[[California v. Greenwood]]''. The doctrine is not as well established in regards to [[civil litigation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nCompanies run by private investigators specializing in such techniques have emerged as a result of the need for discreet, undetected retrieval of documents and evidence for civil and criminal trials. Private investigators have also written books on \"P.I. technique\" in which dumpster diving or its equivalent \"wastebasket recovery\" figures prominently.\n\n=== By country ===\nIn 2009, a Belgian dumpster diver and eco-activist nicknamed Ollie was detained for a month for removing food from a garbage can, and was accused of theft and burglary.

In many developing countries, food is rarely thrown away unless it is rotten as food is scarce in comparison to developed nations. In countries like the United States, where 40 to 50 percent of food is wasted, the trash contains a lot more food to gather.<ref>{{cite web|date = 18 November 2004|last = Harrison|first = Jeff|title = U.S. Wastes Half of Food Produced|url = http://uanews.org/node/10448|accessdate = 2010-03-07|postscript = <!-- None -->}}</ref> In many countries, charities collect excess food from supermarkets and restaurants and distribute it to impoverished neighbourhoods. Trash pickers, [[Karung guni]], [[Zabaleen]], and [[Rag and bone man|rag and bone men]] in these countries may concentrate on looking for usable items or scrap materials to sell rather than food items.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.paghat.com/dumpster.html | title=Dumpster Diving | publisher=Paghat the Ratgirl | accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> In the United States, Canada, and Europe, some bakeries, [[Supermarket|grocery stores]], or restaurants will routinely donate food according to a [[Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act|Good Samaritan Food Donation Act]], but more often, because of health laws or company policy, they are required to discard food items by the [[shelf life|expiration date]], because of overstock, being overly ripened, spoiled, cosmetically imperfect, or blemished.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dumpsterdive360.com/food-or-perishables/ | title=Food or Perishables | accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n* '''Books and periodicals'''. As proof to publishing houses of unsold merchandise, booksellers will routinely remove the front covers of printed materials to render them destroyed prior to disposing of their remains in the garbage. Though readable, many damaged publications have disclaimers and legal notices against their existence or sale.\n* '''Irregular or damaged goods'''. [[Office]]s, [[factory|factories]], [[department store]]s, and other commercial establishments may equally throw out non-perishable items that are irregular, were returned, have minor damages, or are replaced by newer inventory. Many items tend to be in such a state of disrepair or cosmetically flawed that they will require some work to make the items functionally usable. For this reason, employees will at times intentionally destroy their items prior to being discarded to prevent them from being reused or resold.\n* '''Returned items'''. Manufacturers often find it cheaper to routinely discard items returned as defective under warranty instead of repairing them, although a device is often repairable or usable as a source of spare parts to repair other, similar discarded devices.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://garbagefinds.com/ | title=Things I find in the Garbage | accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref>\n* '''School Supplies'''. At the end of each school year many people throw away perfectly useful supplies like pencils, pens, notebooks, art supplies, backpacks and more just to buy brand new ones a few months later at the beginning of the next school year. Many of these items still have plenty of useful life left in them.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dumpsterdive360.com/education/ | title=How to Scavenge for School Supplies | accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n* '''[[eWaste]]'''. Some [[consumer electronics]] are dumped because of their rapid depreciation, obsolescence, cost to repair, or expense to upgrade. Owners of functional computers may find it easier to dump them rather than donate because many nonprofit organizations and schools are unable, or unwilling, to work with used equipment,<ref>{{Cite journal|date = 6 November 2003|last = Ha|first = Tanya|title = E-waste|url = http://abc.net.au/science/features/ewaste|accessdate = 2007-06-11|publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|postscript = <!-- None -->}}</ref> making the otherwise intact devices attractive to those who seek to collect, repair or restore such equipment. Some organizations like [[Geeks Into The Streets]], [[reBOOT]], [[Free Geek]] and [[Computerbank]] try to [[computer recycling|refurbish old computers]] for charity or educational use. Occasionally, vendors dispose of unsaleable, non-defective new merchandise as landfill. The [[Atari video game burial]] in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]] after the [[North American video game crash of 1983]] is a well-known example; a 2014 excavation recovered about 1300 games for curation as museum exhibits or auction.\n* '''Clothing'''. While thrift stores routinely refuse used goods which they cannot cheaply and easily resell, the items which they do accept cost them nothing. There is therefore no shrinkage cost associated with discarding mendable garments, repairable appliances or even working donated items which are overstock or find no buyer after some arbitrary length of time.\n* '''Metal'''. Sometimes waste may contain recyclable [[metal]]s and materials that can be reused or sold to [[Recycling|recycling plants]] and scrap yards.

Two other early commercial digital synthesizers were the [[Fairlight CMI]], introduced in 1979, and the New England Digital [[Synclavier]] II, introduced in 1980.

The Fairlight CMI and the Synclavier were both expensive systems, retailing for more than $20,000 in the early 1980s. The cost of digital synthesizers began falling rapidly in the early 1980s. [[E-mu Systems]] introduced the [[E-mu Emulator|Emulator]] sampling synthesizer in 1982 at a retail price of $7,900. Although not as flexible or powerful as either the Fairlight CMI or the Synclavier, its lower cost and portability made it popular.\n\n[[Image:Yamaha DX7 Table 4.JPG|thumb|The Yamaha DX7 (1983) signalled the rise of digital synthesizers]]\n\nIntroduced in 1983, the [[Yamaha DX7]] was the breakthrough digital synthesizer to have a major impact, both innovative and affordable,   and thus spelling the decline of [[analog synthesizers]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Yamaha DX7 |url=http://www.synthlearn.com/yamaha-dx7.html |website=synthlearn.com}}</ref> It used FM synthesis and, although it was incapable of the sampling synthesis of the Fairlight CMI, its price was around $2,000, putting it within range of a much larger number of musicians.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Le Heron |first= Richard B. |last2= Harrington |first2= James W. |title= New Economic Spaces: New Economic Geographies |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |year= 2005 |page=41 |isbn= 0-7546-4450-2}}</ref> The DX-7 was also known for its \"key scaling\" method to avoid distortion and for its recognizabley bright tonality that was partly due to its high [[sampling rate]] of 57&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{cite book |title=Electronic and experimental music: technology, music, and culture|first=Thom|last=Holmes|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2008|isbn=0-415-95781-8|chapter=Early Computer Music|pages=257\u2013259 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCthQ-bec-QC&pg=PA257 |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref> It became indispensable to many music artists of the 1980s,<ref>{{Cite magazine |title= Three Yamaha products that reshaped the industry mark 20th anniversary |magazine= Music Trades |pages= 70\u201374 |date= February 2004 |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5264/is_200402/ai_n20430721 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019204706/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5264/is_200402/ai_n20430721 |archive-date=2008-10-19}}</ref> and would become one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time.<ref name=\"holmes_257\"/>\n\nIn 1987, [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released its own influential synthesizer of the time, the [[Roland D-50|D-50]]. This popular synth broke new ground in affordably combining short samples and digital oscillators, as well as the innovation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar99/articles/synthfx.htm|title=Synth FX|website=Sound On Sound|accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> of built-in digital effects (reverb., chorus, equalizer<ref>\n{{cite book  |ref={{sfnref|Roland|1987}}\n | title     = Roland D-50 Owner's Manual (Basic)\n | url       = http://media.rolandus.com/manuals/D-50_QS.pdf\n | format    = PDF manual\n | publisher = Roland Corporation\n | publication-date = c. 1987\n | pages     = 6\n | quote     = ''...

Roland called this Linear Arithmetic (LA) synthesis.  This instrument is responsible for some of the very recognisable preset synthesizer sounds of the late 1980s, such as the Pizzagogo sound used on [[Enya]]'s \"[[Orinoco Flow]].\"\n\nIt gradually became feasible to include high quality samples of existing instruments as opposed to synthesizing them.  In 1988, [[Korg]] introduced the last of the hugely popular trio of digital synthesizers of the 1980s after the DX7 and D50, the [[Korg M1|M1]]. This heralded both the increasing popularisation of digital sample-based synthesis, and the rise of '[[music workstation|workstation]]' synthesizers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb02/articles/korgm1retro.asp |title=The Korg M1 |website=Sound On Sound |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020122243/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Feb02/articles/korgm1retro.asp |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}</ref>  After this time, many popular modern digital synthesizers have been described as not being full synthesizers in the most precise sense, as they play back samples stored in their memory.  However, they still include options to shape the sounds through use of [[envelopes]], [[Low-frequency oscillation|LFOs]], filters and effects such as reverb. The Yamaha Motif and Roland Fantom series of keyboards are typical examples of this type, described as 'ROMplers' ;  at the same time, they are also examples of \"workstation\" synthesizers.\n\n[[Image:Clavia Nord Lead 2x.jpg|thumb|The Clavia Nord Lead is a popular virtual analog synth]]\nWith the addition of sophisticated sequencers on board, now added to built-in effects and other features,  the '[[music workstation|workstation]]' synthesizer had been born.  These always include a multi-track [[Music sequencer|sequencer]], and can often record and playback samples, and in later years full audio tracks, to be used to record an entire song. These are usually also ROMplers, playing back samples, to give a wide variety of realistic instrument and other sounds such as drums, string instruments and wind instruments to sequence and compose songs, along with popular keyboard instrument sounds such as electric pianos and organs.\n\nAs there was still interest in [[analog synthesizer]]s, and with the increase of computing power, over the 1990s another type of synthesizer arose : the [[analog modeling synthesizer|analog modeling]], or \"virtual analog\" synthesizer. These use computing power to simulate traditional analog waveforms and circuitry such as envelopes and filters, with the most popular examples of this type of instrument including the [[Nord Lead]] and [[Access Virus]].\n\nAs the cost of processing power and memory fell, new types of synthesizers emerged, offering a variety of novel sound synthesis options.  The [[Korg Oasys]] was one such example, packaging multiple digital synthesizers into a single unit.\n\nDigital synthesizers can now be completely emulated in software (\"[[Software synthesizer|softsynth]]\"), and run on conventional PC hardware. Such soft implementations require careful programming and a fast CPU to get the same [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] response as their dedicated equivalents. To reduce latency, some professional [[sound card]] manufacturers have developed specialized Digital Signal Processing ([DSP]) hardware. Dedicated digital synthesizers have the advantage of a performance-friendly user interface (physical controls like buttons for selecting features and enabling functionality, and knobs for setting variable parameters). On the other hand, software synthesizers have the advantages afforded by a rich graphical display.\n\nWith focus on performance-oriented keyboards and digital computer technology, manufacturers of commercial electronic [[musical instrument|instrument]]s created some of the earliest digital [[synthesizer]]s for studio and experimental use with computers being able to handle built-in sound synthesis algorithms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/183802/electronic-instrument/53839/Digital-synthesizers-the-music-workstation-and-MIDI#ref=ref111959 |title=Electronic Instruments |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n==Analog vs. digital==\n\nThe main difference is that a digital synthesizer uses digital processors and analog synthesizers use analog circuitry.  A digital synthesizer is in essence a computer with (often) a piano-keyboard and an [[LCD]] as an interface. An [[analog synthesizer]] is made up of sound-generating circuitry and modulators.  Because computer technology is rapidly advancing, it is often possible to offer more features in a digital synthesizer than in an analog synthesizer at a given price. However, both technologies have their own merit. Some forms of synthesis, such as, for instance, [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[additive synthesis]] are not feasible in analog synthesizers, while on the other hand, many musicians prefer the character of analog synthesizers over their digital equivalent.\n\n==Bands using digital synths==\nThe [[New wave music|New wave]] era of the 1980s first brought the digital synthesizer to the public ear.  Bands like [[Talking Heads]] and [[Duran Duran]] used the digitally made sounds on some of their most popular albums.  Other more [[pop music|pop]]-inspired bands like [[Hall & Oates]] began incorporating the digital synthesizer into their sound in the 1980s.  Through breakthroughs in technology in the 1990s many modern synthesizers use [[Digital signal processing|DSP]].\n\n==Digital synthesis==\n\nWorking in more or less the same way, every digital synthesizer appears similar to a [[computer]].  At a steady sample rate, digital synthesis produces a stream of numbers.  Sound from speakers is then produced by a conversion to analog form.  Through signal generation, voice and instrument-level processing, a signal flow is created and controlled either by MIDI capabilities or voice and instrument-level controls.<ref>{{cite web |title=Digital Synthesis |url=http://arts.ucsc.edu/ems/Music/equipment/synthesizers/digital/Digisynths.html |website=UCSC Electronic Music Studios}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.vintagesynth.com Vintage Synth Explorer], a great resource on vintage analog and digital hardware synthesizers.\n* [http://psycle.pastnotecut.org Psycle], a freely downloadable modular software synthesizer and sequencer/tracker (open source and totally free)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160214031056/http://www.buzzmachines.com/ Buzz], a freely downloadable modular software synthesizer (free but proprietary)\n\n[[Category:Synthesizers]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]", "sha1": "08m4epowwsc3pefft634btia7l77698"}}, {"title": "Drug of abuse", "ns": "0", "id": "8248", "redirect": {"title": "Substance abuse"}, "revision": {"id": "357923777", "parentid": "340516104", "timestamp": "2010-04-23T23:56:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Xqbot", "id": "8066546"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot: Fixing double redirect to [[Substance abuse]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Substance abuse]]", "sha1": "a580cfwy7g4mwgokbr1kv36z01uowha"}}, {"title": "Definition of music", "ns": "0", "id": "8249", "revision": {"id": "864046946", "parentid": "864046693", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T19:16:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/Clam57|Clam57]] ([[User talk:Clam57|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Circular definition of musicality.png|thumb|[[Circular definition]] of \"musicality\"]]\n\nA '''definition of music''' endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of music's basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of [[definition|defining]] what is meant by the term ''[[music]]''. Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined and there is ongoing debate. A number of explanations start with the notion of music as ''organized sound'' but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music, such as [[human speech]], and sounds found in both [[Natural environment|natural]] and [[Industrial society|industrial]] environments {{harv|Kania|2014}}. The problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of [[culture in music cognition]]. \n\nThe ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' defines music as \"the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion\" {{harv|Concise Oxford Dictionary|1992}}. However, the music genres known as [[noise music]] and [[musique concr\u00e8te]], for instance, challenge these ideas about what constitutes music's essential attributes by using sounds not widely considered as musical, like randomly produced electronic [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], [[Noise (radio)|static]], [[Phonaesthetics|cacophony]], and compositional processes using [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] ({{harvnb|Priest|2013|loc=132}}; {{harvnb|Hagerty|2007}}).\n\nAn oft cited notable example of the dilemma in defining music is a work entitled ''[[4'33'']]'' (1952) by the American composer [[John Cage]] (1912\u20131992). The written score has three movements and directs the performer(s) to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound and only mark sections and the end by gesture. What is heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue this is not music because, for example, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered \"musical\" and the composer and performer(s) exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard {{harv|Dodd|2013}}. Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer(s) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form {{harv|Gann|2010}}.\n\n\n==Concepts of music==\n\nBecause of differing fundamental concepts of music, the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as \"music,\" as that word is generally understood by Western cultures {{harv|Nettl|2005}}. [[Inuit]] and most [[North American Indian]] languages do not have a general term for music. Among the [[Aztecs]], the ancient [[Mexico|Mexican]] theory of rhetorics, poetry, dance, and instrumental music used the [[Nahuatl]] term ''In xochitl-in kwikatl'' to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements, and reserve the word ''Kwikakayotl'' (or cuicacayotl) only for the sung expressions {{harv|Leon-Portilla|2007|loc=11}}. In [[Africa]] there is no term for music in [[Tiv language|Tiv]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Berom language|Birom]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Idoma language|Idoma]], [[Eggon language|Eggon]] or [[Jarawa language (Nigeria)|Jarawa]]. Many other languages have terms which only partly cover what Western culture typically means by the term ''music'' ({{harvnb|Schafer|1996|loc=222-223}}). The [[Mapuche]] of [[Argentina]] do not have a word for ''music'', but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms (''kantun''), European and non-Mapuche music (''kantun winka''), ceremonial songs (''\u00f6l''), and ''tayil'' {{harv|Robertson\u2013de Carbo|1976|loc=39}}.\n\nWhile some languages in West Africa have no term for music, some West African languages accept the general concepts of music ({{harvnb|Nettl|1989|loc=48}}). ''Musiqi'' is the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for the science and art of music, ''muzik'' being the sound and performance of music ({{harvnb|Sakata|1983|loc=39}}), though some things European-influenced listeners would include, such as [[Quran]] chanting, are excluded.\n\n==Music vs. noise==\n[[Ben Watson (music writer)|Ben Watson]] points out that [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge|Grosse Fuge]]'' (1825) \"sounded like noise\" to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven's publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling ''Allegro''. They subsequently published it separately {{harv|Watson|n.d.|loc=109\u201310}}.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}<!--Is this meant to differentiate \"music\" from \"noise\", or to assert that the two things may not be indistinguishable?--> Musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that \"The border between music and noise is always culturally defined\u2014which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus&nbsp;... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be\" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=48, 55}}.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Organized sound===\n{{See also|Musique concrete|Acousmatic music|Spectral music}} \nAn often-cited definition of music is that it is \"organized sound\", a term originally coined by [[modernist]] composer [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] {{harv|Goldman|1961|loc=133}} in reference to his own musical aesthetic. Var\u00e8se's concept of music as \"organized sound\" fits into his vision of \"sound as living matter\" and of \"musical space as open rather than bounded\" {{harv|Chou|1966a|loc=1&ndash;4}}. He conceived the elements of his music in terms of \"sound-masses\", likening their organization to the natural phenomenon of [[crystallization]] {{harv|Chou|1966b|loc=157}}. Var\u00e8se thought that \"to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called [[Noise in music|noise]]\", and he posed the question, \"what is music but organized noises?\" {{harv|Var\u00e8se and Chou|1966|loc=18}}.\n\nThe fifteenth edition of the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' states that \"while there are no sounds that can be described as inherently unmusical, musicians in each culture have tended to restrict the range of sounds they will admit.\" A human organizing element is often felt to be implicit in music (sounds produced by non-human agents, such as waterfalls or birds, are often described as \"musical\", but perhaps less often as \"music\"). The composer [[R. Murray Schafer|R. Murray]] {{harvtxt|Schafer|1996|loc=284}} states that the sound of classical music \"has decays; it is granular; it has attacks; it fluctuates, swollen with impurities\u2014and all this creates a musicality that comes before any 'cultural' musicality.\" However, in the view of semiologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]], \"just as music is whatever people choose to recognize as such, noise is whatever is recognized as disturbing, unpleasant, or both\" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&ndash;48}}. (See \"[[Definition of music#Social construct|music as social construct]]\" below.)'''''\n\n====Language====\n{{Main|Musical language}}\nLevi R. Bryant defines music not as a language, but as a marked-based, problem-solving method such as mathematics {{harv|Ashby|2004|loc=4}}.\n\n===Musical universals===\n{{main|Elements of music}}\nMost definitions of music include a reference to sound and a list of universals of music can be generated by stating the elements (or aspects) of sound: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[timbre]], [[loudness]], [[duration (music)|duration]], spatial location and [[Texture (music)|texture]] ({{harvnb| Burton |2015|loc=22\u201328}}). However, in terms more specifically relating to music: following [[Wittgenstein]], cognitive psychologist [[Eleanor Rosch]] proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may be more or less a member of a category {{harv|Rosch|1973|loc=328}}. As such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with a valid definition {{harv|Levitin|2006|loc=136\u201339}}. This is primarily because other cultures have different understandings in relation to the sounds that English language writers refer to as music.\n\n===Social construct===\n{{main|Ethnomusicology}}\nMany people do, however, share a general idea of music. The Websters definition of music is a typical example: \"the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity\" (''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', online edition).\n\n===Subjective experience===\n{{main|Aesthetics of music}}\n\nThis approach to the definition focuses not on the ''construction'' but on the ''experience'' of music. An extreme statement of the position has been articulated by the  Italian composer [[Luciano Berio]]: \u201cMusic is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music\u201d {{harv|Berio, Dalmonte, and Varga|1985|loc=19}}. This approach permits the boundary between music and noise to change over time as the conventions of musical interpretation evolve within a culture, to be different in different cultures at any given moment, and to vary from person to person according to their experience and proclivities. It is further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly be considered music is experienced as nonmusic if the mind is concentrating on other matters and thus not perceiving the sound's ''essence'' ''as music'' {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}.\n\n==Specific definitions==\n\n===Clifton===\nIn his 1983 book, ''Music as Heard'', which sets out from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] position of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Paul Ricoeur|Ric\u0153ur]], Thomas Clifton defines music as \"an ordered arrangement of sounds and silences whose meaning is [[Presentationism|presentative]] rather than [[Denotation|denotative]]. . . . This definition distinguishes music, as an end in itself, from compositional technique, and from sounds as purely physical objects.\" More precisely, \"music is the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body\u2014that is to say, with his mind, his feelings, his senses, his will, and his metabolism\" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=1}}. It is therefore \"a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his behavior, and a sounding object\" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=10}}.\n\nClifton accordingly differentiates music from non-music on the basis of the human behavior involved, rather than on either the nature of compositional technique or of sounds as purely physical objects. Consequently, the distinction becomes a question of what is meant by musical behavior: \"a musically behaving person is one whose very being is absorbed in the significance of the sounds being experienced.\" However, \"It is not altogether accurate to say that this person is listening ''to'' the sounds. First, the person is doing more than listening: he is perceiving, interpreting, judging, and feeling. Second, the preposition 'to' puts too much stress on the sounds as such. Thus, the musically behaving person experiences musical significance by means of, or through, the sounds\" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=2}}.\n\nIn this framework, Clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from non-music: (1) musical meaning is presentative, and (2) music and non-music are distinguished in the idea of personal involvement. \"It is the notion of personal involvement which lends significance to the word ''ordered'' in this definition of music\" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=3\u20134}}. This is not to be understood, however, as a sanctification of extreme [[relativism]], since \"it is precisely the 'subjective' aspect of experience which lured many writers earlier in this century down the path of sheer opinion-mongering. Later on this trend was reversed by a renewed interest in 'objective,' scientific, or otherwise non-introspective musical analysis. But we have good reason to believe that a musical experience is not a purely private thing, like [[seeing pink elephants]], and that reporting about such an experience need not be [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] in the sense of it being a mere matter of opinion\" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=8\u20139}}.\n\nClifton's task, then, is to describe musical experience and the objects of this experience which, together, are called \"phenomena,\" and the activity of describing phenomena is called \"phenomenology\" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}. It is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards. <blockquote>Music is not a fact or a thing in the world, but a meaning constituted by human beings. . . . To talk about such experience in a meaningful way demands several things. First, we have to be willing to let the composition speak to us, to let it reveal its own order and significance. . . . Second, we have to be willing to question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials. . . . Last, and perhaps most important, we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful. {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=5\u20136}}</blockquote>\n\n===Nattiez===\n\"Music, often an [[art]]/[[entertainment]], is a [[total social fact]] whose definitions vary according to [[era]] and [[culture]],\" according to [[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=37}}. It is often contrasted with [[noise (environmental)|noise]]. According to musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]]: \"The border between music and noise is always culturally defined\u2014which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus.... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be\" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&ndash;8 and 55}}. Given the above demonstration that \"there is no limit to the number or the genre of variables that might intervene in a definition of the musical,\" {{harv|Molino|1975|loc=42}} an organization of definitions and elements is necessary.\n\nNattiez (1990, 17) describes definitions according to a [[wikt:tripartite|tripartite]] semiological scheme similar to the following:\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=3|Poietic Process\n|colspan=2|Esthesic Process\n|-\n|Composer (Producer)\n| \u2192\n|Sound (Trace)\n| \u2190\n|Listener (Receiver)\n|}\n\nThere are three levels of description, the poietic, the neutral, and the esthesic:\n*\"<!-- If musical semiology's sole contribution were replacing what everybody calls \"composition\" and \"perception\" with barbarou neologisms like 'poietic' and 'esthesic', then semiology would entail risibly small profits. There is, of course, more to it than that. --> By 'poietic' I understand describing the ''link'' among the composer's intentions, his creative procedures, his mental schemas, and the ''result'' of this collection of strategies; that is, the components that go into the work's material embodiment. Poietic description thus also deals with a quite special form of hearing (Varese called it 'the interior ear'): what the composer hears while imagining the work's sonorous results, or while experimenting at the piano, or with tape.\"\n*\"By 'esthesic' I understand not merely the artificially attentive hearing of a musicologist, but the description of perceptive behaviors within a given population of listeners; that is how this or that aspect of sonorous reality is captured by their perceptive strategies\" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=90}}.\n*The neutral level is that of the physical \"trace\", (Saussere's sound-image, a sonority, a score), created and interpreted by the esthesic level (which corresponds to a perceptive definition; the perceptive and/or \"social\" construction definitions below) and the poietic level (which corresponds to a creative, as in compositional, definition; the organizational and social construction definitions below).\n\nTable describing types of definitions of music {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=46}}:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!poietic level<br/>(choice of the composer)\n!neutral level<br/>(physical definition)\n!esthesic level<br/>(perceptive judgment)\n|-\n! music\n| musical sound\n| sound of the<br/>harmonic<br/>spectrum\n| agreeable sound\n|-\n! non-music\n| noise<br/>(nonmusical)\n| noise<br/>(complex sound)\n| disagreeable<br/>noise\n|}\n\nBecause of this range of definitions, the study of music comes in a wide variety of forms. There is the study of sound and [[oscillation|vibration]] or [[acoustics]], the cognitive study of music, the study of [[music theory]] and performance practice or music theory and [[ethnomusicology]] and the study of the reception and history of music, generally called [[musicology]].\n\n===Xenakis===\nComposer [[Iannis Xenakis]] in \"Towards a Metamusic\" (chapter 7 of ''Formalized Music'') defined music in the following way {{harv|Xenakis|1971|loc=181}}:\n#It is a sort of comportment necessary for whoever thinks it and makes it.\n#It is an individual [[pleroma]], a realization.\n#It is a fixing in sound of imagined virtualities (cosmological, philosophical, . . ., arguments)\n#It is normative, that is, unconsciously it is a model for being or for doing by sympathetic drive.\n#It is catalytic: its mere presence permits internal psychic or mental transformations in the same way as the crystal ball of the hypnotist.\n#It is the gratuitous play of a child.\n#It is a mystical (but atheistic) asceticism. Consequently, expressions of sadness, joy, love and dramatic situations are only very limited particular instances.\n\n==See also==\n* [[zoomusicology]]\n* [[Noise (music)]]\n* [[Sound art]]\n\n==References==\n<!--this article currently uses in-text, Chicago-format citations, see [[The Chicago Manual of Style]]-->\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ashby|2004}}|reference=Ashby, Arved, ed. 2004.

Among the Thompson Party was Benjamin Van Cleve,<ref>{{cite book |title=Early Dayton |author=Robert W. Steele and Mary Davies Steele |year=1896 |publisher=W.J.

Ohio was admitted into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in 1803, and the city of Dayton was incorporated in 1805.

Orville and Wilbur Wright were the first to construct and demonstrate powered flight.  Although the first flight was in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], their Wright Flyer was built in Dayton, and was returned to Dayton for improvements and further flights at [[Huffman Field]], a cow pasture eight miles (13 km) northeast of Dayton, near the current Wright Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nWhen the government tried to move development to Langley field in southern Virginia, six Dayton businessmen including Edward A. Deeds, formed the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company in Moraine and established a flying field.  Deeds also opened a field to the north in the flood plain of the Great Miami River between the confluences of that river, the Stillwater River, and the Mad River, near downtown Dayton.  Later named [[McCook Field]] for Alexander McDowell McCook, an American Civil War general, this became the Army Signal Corps' primary aviation research and training location. Wilbur Wright also purchased land near Huffman prairie to continue their research.\n\nDuring World War I, the Army purchased 40 acres adjacent to Huffman Prairie for the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot.  As airplanes developed more capability, they needed more runway space than McCook could offer, and a new location was sought. The Patterson family formed the Dayton Air Service Committee, Inc which held a campaign that raised $425,000 in two days and purchased 4,520.47 acres (18.2937 km2) northeast of Dayton, including Wilbur Wright Field and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field.  Wright Field was \"formally dedicated\" on 12 October 1927.  After World War II, Wright Field and the adjacent Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field, and Clinton Army Air Field were merged as the Headquarters, Air Force Technical Base. On 13 January 1948, the facility was renamed [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].\n\n=== The Dayton Flood ===\nA catastrophic flood in March 1913, known as the [[Great Dayton Flood]], led to the creation of the [[Miami Conservancy District]], a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton, in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|title=Flood Protection|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Miami Conservancy District|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817150122/http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|archivedate=August 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the [[Dayton Project]], a branch of the larger [[Manhattan Project]], to develop [[polonium]] triggers used in early atomic bombs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?id=83&option=com_content&task=view|title=The Dayton Project|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Atomic Heritage}}</ref> The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daytonology.blogspot.com/2008/11/world-war-ii-housing-daytonfairborn.html|title=WWII Emergency Housing|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Daytonology Blogspot}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-War Dayton ===\nBetween the 1940s and the 1970s, the city saw significant growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service in large numbers seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, a part of the local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the [[Interstate Highway System]] allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area.

Unlike the population of, say, New York City, [[Geneva]] or [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the \"temporary center of international peace.\" The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. [[Warren Christopher]] was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed \"candles of peace\" in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a \"peace chain,\" although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.<ref>[[Richard Holbrooke]], ''To End a War'', p. 234</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nDayton is known as the \"Gem City.\" The nickname's origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. In the early 19th century, a well-known [[racehorse]] named Gem hailed from Dayton. In 1845, an article published in the ''Cincinnati Daily Chronicle'' by an author known as T stated: \n{{quote|In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns.

Bickham of the ''Dayton Journal'' began a campaign to nickname Dayton the \"Gem City.\" The name was adopted by the city's Board of Trade several years later.<ref name=\"Dayton FAQs\" /> [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] referred to the nickname in his poem, \"Toast to Dayton,\" as noted in the following excerpt:\n<blockquote><poem>\nShe shall ever claim our duty,\nFor she shines\u2014the brightest gem\nThat has ever decked with beauty\n     Dear Ohio's diadem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunbarsite.org/gallery/AToasttoDayton.asp |title=Toast to Dayton |accessdate=March 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718091359/http://www.dunbarsite.org/gallery/AToasttoDayton.asp |archivedate=July 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nDayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio, \"Birthplace of Aviation.\" Dayton is the hometown of the [[Wright brothers]], aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the world's first successful airplane.

From top to bottom, the element names are: ''plate'', ''cathode'', and ''heater''.]]\n\nA thermionic diode is a [[thermionic valve|thermionic-valve]] device consisting of a sealed, evacuated glass or metal envelope containing two [[electrode]]s: a [[thermionic cathode|cathode]] and a [[plate electrode|plate]]. The cathode is either ''indirectly heated'' or ''directly heated''. If indirect heating is employed, a heater is included in the envelope.\n\nIn operation, the cathode is heated to red heat  (800\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C). A directly heated cathode is made of tungsten wire and is heated by current passed through it from an external voltage source. An indirectly heated cathode is heated by infrared radiation from a nearby heater that is formed of [[Nichrome]] wire and supplied with current provided by an external voltage source.\n\nThe operating temperature of the cathode causes it to release [[electron]]s into the vacuum, a process called [[thermionic emission]]. The cathode is coated with [[oxide]]s of [[alkaline earth metal]]s, such as [[barium]] and [[strontium]] [[oxide]]s. These have a low [[work function]], meaning that they more readily emit electrons than would the uncoated cathode.\n\nThe plate, not being heated, does not emit electrons; but is able to absorb them.\n\nThe alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the plate.  When the plate voltage is positive with respect to the cathode, the plate [[electrostatics|electrostatically]] attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. When the plate voltage is negative with respect to the cathode, no electrons are emitted by the plate, so no current can pass from the plate to the cathode.\n\n==Semiconductor diodes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Boltzmann constant]] -->\n\n[[File:1N23C 04.jpg|thumb||upright=0.4|Point contact diode (''crystal rectifier'' or ''crystal diode''), type 1N23C.

Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative [[charge carrier]]s (electrons), called an [[n-type semiconductor]], and a region on the other side that contains positive charge carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]), called a [[p-type semiconductor]]. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the [[depletion region]] because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a [[p\u2013n junction]], is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the [[anode]]) than to the N side (the [[cathode]]), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical [[check valve]].\n\n====Schottky diode====\n{{main article|Schottky diode}}\nAnother type of junction diode, the [[Schottky diode]], is formed from a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]] rather than a p\u2013n junction, which reduces capacitance and increases switching speed.<ref name=\"skyworks_01\">[http://www.skyworksinc.com/uploads/documents/200826A.pdf Skyworks Solutions, Inc., ''Mixer and Detector Diodes'']</ref><ref>[https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/rf-microwave-a-millimeter-wave/1575-diodes-schottky Microsemi Corporation Schottky web page]</ref>\n\n===Current\u2013voltage characteristic===\n[[File:Diode current wiki.png|thumb|400px|I\u2013V (current vs. voltage) characteristics of a p\u2013n junction diode]]\n\nA semiconductor diode's behavior in a circuit is given by its [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]], or I\u2013V graph (see graph below). The shape of the curve is determined by the transport of charge carriers through the so-called ''[[depletion zone|depletion layer]]'' or ''[[depletion region]]'' that exists at the [[p\u2013n junction]] between differing semiconductors. When a p\u2013n junction is first created, conduction-band (mobile) electrons from the N-[[dopant|doped]] region diffuse into the P-[[dopant|doped]] region where there is a large population of holes (vacant places for electrons) with which the electrons \"recombine\". When a mobile electron recombines with a hole, both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P side. The region around the p\u2013n junction becomes depleted of [[charge carrier]]s and thus behaves as an [[nonconductor|insulator]].\n\nHowever, the width of the depletion region (called the [[depletion width]]) cannot grow without limit. For each [[electron\u2013hole pair]] recombination made, a positively charged [[dopant]] ion is left behind in the N-doped region, and a negatively charged dopant ion is created in the P-doped region. As recombination proceeds and more ions are created, an increasing electric field develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop recombination. At this point, there is a \"built-in\" potential across the depletion zone.\n\n[[File:PN band.gif|thumb|600px|right|A [[PN junction]] diode in forward bias mode, the [[depletion width]] decreases. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] level, leading to built-in [[potential]] of ~0.59V. Observe the different [[Quasi Fermi level]]s for conduction band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves).]]\n\n====Reverse bias====\nIf an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless [[electron\u2013hole pair]]s are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see [[photodiode]]). This is called the ''[[reverse bias]]'' phenomenon.\n\n====Forward bias====\nHowever, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial electric current through the p\u2013n junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode is said to be \"turned on\" as it has been given an external ''[[p\u2013n junction#Forward bias|forward bias]]''. The diode is commonly said to have a forward \"threshold\" voltage, above which it conducts and below which conduction stops. However, this is only an approximation as the forward characteristic is smooth (see I-V graph above).\n\nA diode's [[I\u2013V characteristic]] can be approximated by four regions of operation:\n\n# At very large reverse bias, beyond the [[peak inverse voltage]] or PIV, a process called reverse [[avalanche breakdown|breakdown]] occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., a large number of electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p\u2013n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The [[avalanche diode]] is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the [[Zener diode]], the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p\u2013n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is \"clamped\" to a known value (called the ''Zener voltage''), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.\n# For a bias less than the PIV, the reverse current is very small. For a normal P\u2013N rectifier diode, the reverse current through the device in the micro-ampere (\u00b5A) range is very low. However, this is temperature dependent, and at sufficiently high temperatures, a substantial amount of reverse current can be observed (mA or more). There is also a tiny surface leakage current caused by electrons simply going around the diode as though it were an imperfect insulator.\n# With a small forward bias, where only a small forward current is conducted, the current\u2013voltage curve is [[Exponential function|exponential]] in accordance with the ideal diode equation.  There is a definite forward voltage at which the diode starts to conduct significantly.  This is called the ''knee voltage'' or ''cut-in voltage'' and is equal to the [[p\u2013n junction#Properties of a p\u2013n junction|barrier potential]] of the p-n junction. This is a feature of the exponential curve, and appears sharper on a current scale more compressed than in the diagram shown here.\n# At larger forward currents the current-voltage curve starts to be dominated by the ohmic resistance of the bulk semiconductor.  The curve is no longer exponential, it is asymptotic to a straight line whose slope is the bulk resistance.  This region is particularly important for power diodes.  The diode can be modeled as an ideal diode in series with a fixed resistor.\n\nIn a small silicon diode operating at its rated currents, the voltage drop is about 0.6 to 0.7 [[volt]]s. The value is different for other diode types\u2014[[Schottky diode]]s can be rated as low as 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or blue [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V respectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAt higher currents the forward voltage drop of the diode increases. A drop of 1 V to 1.5 V is typical at full rated current for power diodes.\n\n===Shockley diode equation===\n{{main article|Shockley diode equation}}\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' (named after the [[bipolar junction transistor]] co-inventor [[William Shockley|William Bradford Shockley]]) gives the I\u2013V characteristic of an ideal diode in either forward or reverse bias (or no bias). The following equation is called the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' when ''n'', the ideality factor, is set equal to 1 :\n\n:<math>I=I_\\mathrm{S} \\left( e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}} - 1 \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:''I'' is the diode current,\n:''I''<sub>S</sub> is the reverse bias [[saturation current]] (or scale current),\n:''V''<sub>D</sub> is the voltage across the diode,\n:''V''<sub>T</sub> is the [[thermal voltage]], and\n:''n'' is the ''ideality factor'', also known as the ''quality factor'' or sometimes ''emission coefficient''. The ideality factor ''n'' typically varies from 1 to 2 (though can in some cases be higher), depending on the fabrication process and semiconductor material and is set equal to 1 for the case of an \"ideal\" diode (thus the n is sometimes omitted). The ideality factor was added to account for imperfect junctions as observed in real transistors. The factor mainly accounts for [[carrier recombination]] as the charge carriers cross the [[depletion region]].\n\nThe [[thermal voltage]] ''V''<sub>T</sub> is approximately 25.85 mV at 300 K, a temperature close to \"room temperature\" commonly used in device simulation software. At any temperature it is a known constant defined by:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{T} = \\frac{k T}{q} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the absolute temperature of the p\u2013n junction, and ''q'' is the magnitude of charge of an [[electron]] (the [[elementary charge]]).\n\nThe reverse saturation current, ''I''<sub>S</sub>, is not constant for a given device, but varies with temperature; usually more significantly than ''V''<sub>T</sub>, so that ''V''<sub>D</sub> typically decreases as ''T'' increases.\n\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' is derived with the assumption that the only processes giving rise to the current in the diode are drift (due to electrical field), diffusion, and thermal [[carrier generation and recombination|recombination\u2013generation]] (R\u2013G) (this equation is derived by setting n = 1 above). It also assumes that the R\u2013G current in the depletion region is insignificant. This means that the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' doesn't account for the processes involved in reverse breakdown and photon-assisted R\u2013G. Additionally, it doesn't describe the \"leveling off\" of the I\u2013V curve at high forward bias due to internal resistance. Introducing the ideality factor, n, accounts for recombination and generation of carriers.\n\nUnder ''reverse bias'' voltages the exponential in the diode equation is negligible, and the current is a constant (negative) reverse current value of \u2212''I<sub>S</sub>''. The reverse ''breakdown region'' is not modeled by the Shockley diode equation.\n\nFor even rather small ''forward bias'' voltages the exponential is very large, since the thermal voltage is very small in comparison. The subtracted '1' in the diode equation is then negligible and the forward diode current can be approximated by\n\n:<math>I = I_\\text{S} e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}}</math>\n\nThe use of the diode equation in circuit problems is illustrated in the article on [[diode modelling#Shockley diode model|diode modeling]].\n\n===Small-signal behavior===\nAt forward voltages less than the saturation voltage, the voltage versus current characteristic curve of most diodes is not a straight line. The current can be approximated by <math>I = I_\\text{S} e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}}</math> as mentioned in the previous section. \n\nIn detector and mixer applications, the current can be estimated by a Taylor's series.<ref name=\"Giacoletto_1977\">{{cite book |author-first=Lawrence Joseph |author-last=Giacoletto |title=Electronics Designers' Handbook |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=1977 |page=24-138}}</ref> The odd terms can be omitted because they produce frequency components that are outside the pass band of the mixer or detector.  Even terms beyond the second derivative usually need not be included because they are small compared to the second order term.<ref name=\"Giacoletto_1977\" /> The desired current component is approximately proportional to the square of the input voltage, so the response is called ''square law'' in this region.<ref name=\"HC\" />{{rp|p. 3}}\n\n===Reverse-recovery effect===\nFollowing the end of forward conduction in a p\u2013n type diode, a reverse current can flow for a short time. The device does not attain its blocking capability until the mobile charge in the junction is depleted.\n\nThe effect can be significant when switching large currents very quickly.<ref>[http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5817/hw/hw1/Diode%20reverse%20recovery%20in%20a%20boost%20converter.pdf Diode reverse recovery in a boost converter]. ECEN5817. ecee.colorado.edu</ref> A certain amount of \"reverse recovery time\" t<sub>r</sub> (on the order of tens of nanoseconds to a few microseconds) may be required to remove the reverse recovery charge Q<sub>r</sub> from the diode. During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/LED.2014.2353301| title = Gate-Controlled Reverse Recovery for Characterization of LDMOS Body Diode| journal = IEEE Electron Device Letters| volume = 35| issue = 11| page = 1079| year = 2014| last1 = Elhami Khorasani | first1 = A. | last2 = Griswold | first2 = M. | last3 = Alford | first3 = T.

ECEN5797. ecee.colorado.edu</ref> However, when the [[slew rate]] of the current is not so severe (e.g. Line frequency) the effect can be safely ignored. For most applications, the effect is also negligible for [[Schottky diode]]s.\n\nThe reverse current ceases abruptly when the stored charge is depleted; this abrupt stop is exploited in [[step recovery diode]]s for generation of extremely short pulses.\n\n===Types of semiconductor diode===\n\nNormal (p\u2013n) diodes, which operate as described above, are usually made of doped [[silicon]] or [[germanium]]. Before the development of silicon power rectifier diodes, [[cuprous oxide]] and later [[selenium]] was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7&nbsp;V per \"cell\", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often an extension of the diode's metal [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]]), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p\u2013n diodes found in [[CMOS]] [[integrated circuits]], which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.\n\n;[[Avalanche diode]]s\n:These are diodes that conduct in the reverse direction when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically very similar to Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the ''avalanche effect''. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p\u2013n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2&nbsp;V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on the way through the channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.\n;[[Constant current diode]]s\n:These are actually [[JFET]]s<ref>[http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_CurrentRegulatorDiodes.pdf Current regulator diodes].

Schottky|Schottky]] diodes are constructed from a metal to semiconductor contact. They have a lower forward voltage drop than p\u2013n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1&nbsp;mA is in the range 0.15&nbsp;V to 0.45&nbsp;V, which makes them useful in voltage [[Clamper (electronics)|clamping applications]] and prevention of transistor saturation. They can also be used as low loss [[rectifier]]s, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are [[majority carrier]] devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes\u2014so they have a faster reverse recovery than p\u2013n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p\u2013n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as [[switched-mode power supply]], [[Frequency mixer|mixer]]s, and [[Detector (radio)|detectors]].\n;Super barrier diodes\n:Super barrier diodes are rectifier diodes that incorporate the low forward voltage drop of the Schottky diode with the surge-handling capability and low reverse leakage current of a normal p\u2013n junction diode.\n;[[Gold]]-doped diodes\n:As a dopant, gold (or [[platinum]]) acts as recombination centers, which helps a fast recombination of minority carriers. This allows the diode to operate at signal frequencies, at the expense of a higher forward voltage drop. Gold-doped diodes are faster than other p\u2013n diodes (but not as fast as Schottky diodes).

These are important in PLL ([[phase-locked loop]]) and FLL ([[frequency-locked loop]]) circuits, allowing tuning circuits, such as those in television receivers, to lock quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled tunable oscillators in early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-frequency, crystal oscillator provided the reference frequency for a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]].\n;[[Zener diode]]s\n:These can be made to conduct in reverse bias (backward), and are correctly termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called [[Zener breakdown]], occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode to be used as a precision voltage reference. The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or [[Transorb]], a registered trademark).\n\nOther uses for semiconductor diodes include the sensing of temperature, and computing analog [[logarithm]]s (see [[Operational amplifier applications#Logarithmic output]]).\n\n===Graphic symbols===\n{{Main article|Electronic symbol}}\n\nThe symbol used to represent a particular type of diode in a [[circuit diagram]] conveys the general electrical function to the reader.

Most diodes have a 1-prefix designation (e.g., 1N4003). Among the most popular in this series were: 1N34A/1N270 (germanium signal), 1N914/[[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] (silicon signal), [[1N400x general-purpose diodes|1N400x]] (silicon 1A power rectifier), and [[1N58xx schottky diodes|1N580x]] (silicon 3A power rectifier).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/Home/about_jedec.cfm |title=About JEDEC |publisher=Jedec.org |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |title=Introduction dates of common transistors and diodes? |publisher=EDAboard.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011133032/http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://semiconductormuseum.com/Museum_Index.htm |title=Transistor Museum Construction Projects Point Contact Germanium Western Electric Vintage Historic Semiconductors Photos Alloy Junction Oral History |publisher=Semiconductormuseum.com |author=I.D.E.A |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n====JIS====\nThe [[JIS semiconductor designation]] system has all semiconductor diode designations starting with \"1S\".\n\n====Pro Electron====\nThe European [[Pro Electron]] coding system for [[active component]]s was introduced in 1966 and comprises two letters followed by the part code. The first letter represents the semiconductor material used for the component (A = germanium and B = silicon) and the second letter represents the general function of the part (for diodes, A = low-power/signal, B = variable capacitance, X = multiplier, Y = rectifier and Z = voltage reference); for example:\n\n*AA-series germanium low-power/signal diodes (e.g., AA119)\n*BA-series silicon low-power/signal diodes (e.g., BAT18 silicon RF switching diode)\n*BY-series silicon rectifier diodes (e.g., BY127 1250V, 1A rectifier diode)\n*BZ-series silicon Zener diodes (e.g., BZY88C4V7 4.7V Zener diode)\n\nOther common numbering / coding systems (generally manufacturer-driven) include:\n\n*GD-series germanium diodes (e.g., GD9){{spaced ndash}}this is a very old coding system\n*OA-series germanium diodes (e.g., OA47){{spaced ndash}}a [[Mullard\u2013Philips tube designation|coding sequence]] developed by [[Mullard]], a UK company\n\nAs well as these common codes, many manufacturers or organisations have their own systems too{{spaced ndash}}for example:\n\n*HP diode 1901-0044 = JEDEC 1N4148\n*UK military diode CV448 = Mullard type OA81 = [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] type GEX23\n\n==Related devices==\n*[[Rectifier]]\n*[[Transistor]]\n*[[Thyristor]] or silicon controlled rectifier (SCR)\n*[[TRIAC]]\n*[[DIAC]]\n*[[Varistor]]\nIn optics, an equivalent device for the diode but with laser light would be the [[Optical isolator]], also known as an Optical Diode, that allows light to only pass in one direction. It uses a [[Faraday rotator]] as the main component.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Radio demodulation===\n[[File:Simple envelope detector.svg|thumb|300x300px|A simple [[envelope detector|envelope demodulator]] circuit.]]\nThe first use for the diode was the demodulation of [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the [[radio]] article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose [[amplitude]] or envelope is proportional to the original audio signal. The diode [[rectifier|rectifies]] the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple [[electronic filter|filter]] and fed into an audio amplifier or [[transducer]], which generates sound waves.\n\nIn microwave and millimeter wave technology, beginning in the 1930s, researchers improved and miniaturized the crystal detector. [[Diode#Point-contact_diodes|Point contact diodes]] (''crystal diodes'') and [[Diode#Junction_diodes|Schottky diodes]] are used in radar, microwave and millimeter wave detectors.<ref name=\"skyworks_01\"/>\n\n===Power conversion===\n{{Main article|Rectifier}}\n[[File:ACtoDCpowersupply.png|250px|thumb|Schematic of basic ac-to-dc power supply]]\n\n[[Rectifier]]s are constructed from diodes, where they are used to convert [[alternating current]] (ac) electricity into [[direct current]] (dc). Automotive [[alternator (auto)|alternator]]s are a common example, where the diode, which rectifies the AC into dc, provides better performance than the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] or earlier, [[electrical generator|dynamo]]. Similarly, diodes are also used in ''[[Cockcroft-Walton generator|Cockcroft\u2013Walton]] [[voltage multiplier]]s'' to convert ac into higher ac voltages.\n\n===Over-voltage protection===\nDiodes are frequently used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage rises above the normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in ([[stepper motor]] and [[H-bridge]]) [[motor controller]] and [[relay]] circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging [[voltage spike]]s that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a [[flyback diode]]). Many [[integrated circuits]] also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive [[transistors]]. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see [[#Types of semiconductor diode|Diode types]] above).\n\n===Logic gates===\nDiodes can be combined with other components to construct [[logical conjunction|AND]] and [[logical disjunction|OR]] [[logic gate]]s. This is referred to as [[diode logic]].\n\n===Ionizing radiation detectors===\nIn addition to light, mentioned above, [[semiconductor]] diodes are sensitive to more [[energy|energetic]] radiation. In [[electronics]], [[cosmic ray]]s and other sources of ionizing radiation cause [[noise]] [[pulse]]s and single and multiple bit errors.\nThis effect is sometimes exploited by [[particle detector]]s to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of [[electron volt]]s of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is deposited in the semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large enough to catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.\nThese semiconductor radiation detectors need efficient and uniform charge collection and low leakage current. They are often cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]. For longer-range (about a centimetre) particles, they need a very large depletion depth and large area. For short-range particles, they need any contact or un-depleted semiconductor on at least one surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as energy.\nThey have a finite life, especially when detecting heavy particles, because of radiation damage. Silicon and germanium are quite different in their ability to convert [[gamma ray]]s to electron showers.\n\n[[Semiconductor detector]]s for high-energy particles are used in large numbers. Because of energy loss fluctuations, accurate measurement of the energy deposited is of less use.\n\n===Temperature measurements===\nA diode can be used as a [[temperature]] measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a [[silicon bandgap temperature sensor]]. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might ''appear'' that the voltage has a ''positive'' temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the [[Saturation current|reverse saturation current]] term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a ''negative'' temperature coefficient, typically \u22122 mV/\u02daC for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 [[kelvin]]s. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/1n400x_diode_family_forward_voltage.htm |title=1N400x Diode Family Forward Voltage |website=cliftonlaboratories.com |access-date=2013-12-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524153406/http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/1n400x_diode_family_forward_voltage.htm |archivedate=2013-05-24}}</ref> and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.<ref>[http://www.omega.com/Temperature/pdf/CY7.pdf Cryogenic Temperature Sensors]. omega.com</ref>\n\n===Current steering===\nDiodes will prevent currents in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. An [[uninterruptible power supply]] may use diodes in this way to ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.\n\nDiodes are also used in [[electronic keyboards|electronic musical keyboards]]. To reduce the amount of wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use [[keyboard matrix circuit]]s. The keyboard controller scans the rows and columns to determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards through the circuit and trigger \"[[Keyboard (computing)#Control processor|phantom keys]]\" that cause \"ghost\" notes to play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the [[musical keyboard]].

It was founded in 1891 by [[Anthony J. Drexel]], a noted [[financier]] and [[philanthropist]]. Founded as '''Drexel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry'''; it was renamed '''Drexel Institute of Technology''' in 1936, before assuming the name Drexel University in 1970.\n\n{{as of|2015}}, more than 26,000 students are enrolled in over 70 undergraduate programs and more than 100 master's, doctoral, and professional programs at the university.<ref name=\"facts\" /> Drexel's cooperative education program (co-op) is a unique aspect of the school's degree programs, offering students the opportunity to gain up to 18 months of paid, full-time work experience in a field relevant to their undergraduate major or graduate degree program prior to graduation.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Drexel Main Building c.1892.jpg|right|thumb|The Main Building, dedicated in 1891.]]\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|right|thumb|Monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], sculpture by [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]]. Donated in 1912 to the University. Main building, great court.]]\n{{Main|History of Drexel University}}\n\nDrexel University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry, by Philadelphia financier and philanthropist [[Anthony J. Drexel]]. The original mission of the institution was to provide educational opportunities in the \"practical arts and sciences\" for women and men of all backgrounds. The institution became known as the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936, and in 1970 the Drexel Institute of Technology gained university status, becoming Drexel University.\n\nAlthough there were many changes during its first century, the university's identity has been held constant as a privately controlled, non-sectarian, coeducational center of higher learning, distinguished by a commitment to practical education and hands-on experience in an occupational setting. The central aspect of Drexel University's focus on career preparation, in the form of its cooperative education program, was introduced in 1919. The program became integral to the university's unique educational experience. Participating students alternate periods of classroom-based study with periods of full-time, [[Internship|practical work experience]] related to their academic major and career interests.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2009, Drexel University underwent a period of significant change to its programs, enrollment, and facilities under the leadership of Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]], the university's president during that time. Papadakis oversaw Drexel's largest expansion in its history, with a 471 percent increase in its endowment and a 102 percent increase in student enrollment. His leadership also guided the university toward improved performance in collegiate rankings, a more selective approach to admissions, and a more rigorous academic program at all levels. It was during this period of expansion that Drexel acquired and assumed management of the former MCP Hahnemann University, creating the [[Drexel University College of Medicine]] in 2002. In 2006, the university established the [[Thomas R. Kline School of Law]], and in 2011 the School of Law achieved full accreditation by the [[American Bar Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/about/ABA_accreditation/ |title=Drexel University Earle Mack School of Law ABA Accreditation |accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nDr. [[Constantine Papadakis]] died of pneumonia in April 2009 while still employed as the university's president. His successor, [[John Anderson Fry]], was formerly the president of [[Franklin & Marshall College]] and served as the Executive Vice President of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"fry\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/past-presidents/john-fry |title=Past Presidents: John Fry |accessdate=2 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112093452/http://www.fandm.edu/past-presidents/john-fry |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Under Fry's leadership, Drexel has continued its expansion, including the July 2011 acquisition of [[The Academy of Natural Sciences]].\n\n==Academics==\n\n===College of Arts and Sciences===\n{{main|Drexel University College of Arts and Sciences}}\nThe College of Arts and Sciences was formed in 1990 when Drexel merged the two existing College of Sciences and College of Humanities together.\n\n===Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts and Design===\n{{main|Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts and Design}}\nThe College of Media Arts and Design \"fosters the study, exploration and management of the arts: media, design, the performing and visual\".

These residence halls include Millennium, Calhoun, Kelly, Myers, Towers, Van Rensselaer and Race Halls. Kelly, Myers, Towers, and Calhoun Halls are traditional residence halls (a bedroom shared with one or more roommate(s) and one bathroom per floor), while Race and Van Rensselaer Halls are suite-style residence halls (shared bedrooms, private bathrooms, kitchens, and common area within the suite). Millennium Hall, Drexel's newest residence hall, is a modified suite (a bedroom shared with one roommate, and bathrooms and showers that look like closets with open sinks in the hallway).\n\nEach residence hall is designed to facilitate the Freshman Experience in a slightly different way. Calhoun, Kelly and Towers Halls are all typical residence halls. Myers Hall offers \"Living Learning Communities\" where a group of students who share common interests such as language or major live together. Most of Millennium Hall is reserved for students of the [[Pennoni Honors College]], although some floors are occupied by other students.\n\nSecond-year students have the option of living in a residence hall designated for upperclassmen, or \"university approved housing\". The residence halls for upperclassmen are North and Caneris Halls. North Hall operates under the For Students By Students Residential Experience Engagement Model, developed by the Residential Living Office. There are many apartments that are university approved that second-year students can choose to live in. Three of the largest apartment buildings that fit this description are Chestnut Square, University Crossings, and The Summit, all owned by [[American Campus Communities]].

In ''Euthyphro,'' Socrates says, \"Your statements, Euthyphro, seem to belong to my ancestor, Daedalus.\" In ''Alcibaides'', Socrates says, \"And mine, noble Alcibiades, to Daedalus, and he to Hephaestus, son of Zeus.\" This suggests that Daedalus was related to [[Hephaestus]], the god of blacksmiths, and therefore to [[Zeus]] himself.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===The Labyrinth===\nDaedalus is first mentioned by [[Homer]] as the creator of a wide dancing-ground for [[Ariadne]].<ref>''Iliad'' xviii, 590-3; the passage is often cited as a vivid and authentic reminiscence of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]] encapsulated in the orally transmitted tradition, as in Alfred Burns,  \"The Chorus of Ariadne\" ''Classical Journal'', '''70'''.2 (December 1974 - January 1975:1-12): bibliography.</ref> He also created the [[Labyrinth]] on [[Crete]], in which the [[Minotaur]] (part man, part bull) was kept. In the story of the labyrinth as told by the [[Greeks#Hellenes|Hellenes]], the Athenian hero [[Theseus]] is challenged to kill the Minotaur, finding his way with the help of [[Ariadne's thread]]. Daedalus' appearance in Homer is in an extended metaphor, \"plainly not Homer's invention\", [[Robin Lane Fox]] observes: \"He is a point of comparison and so he belongs in stories which Homer's audience already recognized.\"<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2009:187, 178.</ref> In Bronze Age Crete, an inscription ''da-da-re-jo-de'' has been read as referring to a place at Knossos,<ref>\"The word ''da-da-re-jo-de'' on a has been interpreted as meaning Daidaleionde\u2014 \"towards\" or \"into the Daidaleion,\" and [[Karl Kerenyi|K. Kerenyi]] conjectures that it may refer to the ''choros'' that Daedalus is supposed to have built for Ariadne\" (Burns 1974/75:3; the Kerenyi assertion is in an article in ''Atti e memorie del primo congresso internazionale del micenologia, 1967'', vol. II, Rome 1968).</ref> and a place of worship.<ref>Fox is unconvinced; other scholars urging caution in making connections with Daedalus are noted by Fox 2009:188 note 6: S.P. Morris, ''Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art'', 1992:76f, and L.M. Bendall, ''Economics of Religion in the Mycenaean World'', 2007:17.</ref>\n\nIn Homer's language, ''[[daidala]]'' refers to finely crafted objects. They are mostly objects of [[armor]], but fine bowls and furnishings are also ''daidala'', and on one occasion so are the \"bronze-working\" of \"clasps, twisted brooches, earrings and necklaces\" made by [[Hephaestus]] while cared for in secret by the goddesses of the sea.<ref>Fox 2009:187f.</ref>\n\nIgnoring Homer, later writers envisaged the Labyrinth as an edifice rather than a single dancing path to the center and out again, and gave it numberless winding passages and turns that opened into one another, seeming to have neither beginning nor end.<ref>Compare [[labyrinth]] and [[maze]].</ref> [[Ovid]], in his ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', suggests that Daedalus constructed the Labyrinth so cunningly that he himself could barely escape it after he built it.<ref>Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: From Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', 1992:36, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}.</ref> Daedalus built the labyrinth for King [[Minos]], who needed it to imprison his wife's son the Minotaur. The story is told that [[Poseidon]] had given a white bull to Minos so that he might use it as a sacrifice. Instead, Minos kept it for himself; and in revenge, Poseidon, with the help of [[Aphrodite]], made  [[Pasipha\u00eb]], King Minos's wife, lust for the bull.<ref>Edith Hamilton, ''Mythology'', (1942) 1998:151, {{ISBN|0-451-62702-4}}.</ref> For Pasipha\u00eb, as Greek mythologers interpreted it, Daedalus also built a wooden cow so she could mate with the bull, for the Greeks imagined the Minoan [[Bull (mythology)|bull of the sun]] to be an actual, earthly bull, <!--Another interpretation equates the wooden cow with metaphorical human folly. Though divinely inspired, a well-meaning and loyal, yet fallible man contrived a human mechanism that facilitated the creation of a proverbial monster. The Minotaur abomination that devoured men for sustenance.--> the slaying of which later required a heroic effort by Theseus.\n\nThis story thus encourages others to consider the long-term consequences of their own inventions with great care, lest those inventions do more harm than good. As in the tale of [[Icarus]]' wings, Daedalus is portrayed assisting in the creation of something that has subsequent negative consequences, in this case with his creation of the monstrous Minotaur's almost impenetrable Labyrinth, which made slaying the beast an endeavour of legendary difficulty.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Daedalus and Icarus===\n[[File:Charles Le Brun - Daedalus and Icarus - WGA12535.jpg|thumb| ''Daedalus and Icarus'', c. 1645, by [[Charles Le Brun]] (1619\u20131690) ]]\nThe most familiar literary telling explaining Daedalus' wings is a late one, that of Ovid: in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (VIII:183\u2013235) Daedalus was shut up in a tower to prevent the knowledge of his Labyrinth from spreading to the public. He could not leave Crete by sea, as the king kept a strict watch on all vessels, permitting none to sail without being carefully searched. Since Minos controlled the land and sea routes, Daedalus set to work to fabricate wings for himself and his young son [[Icarus]]. He tied feathers together, from smallest to largest so as to form an increasing surface. He secured the feathers at their midpoints with string and at their bases with wax, and gave the whole a gentle curvature like the wings of a bird. When the work was done, the artist, waving his wings, found himself buoyed upward and hung suspended, poising himself on the beaten air. He next equipped his son in the same manner, and taught him how to fly. When both were prepared for flight, Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high, because the heat of the sun would melt the wax, nor too low, because the sea foam would soak the feathers.\n\n[[File:Draper Herbert James Mourning for Icarus.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Lament for Icarus]]'' by [[Herbert James Draper|H. J. Draper]] (1898)]]\n\nThey had passed [[Samos]], [[Delos]] and [[Lebynthos]] by the time the boy, forgetting himself, began to soar upward toward the sun. The blazing sun softened the wax that held the feathers together and they came off. Icarus quickly fell in the sea and drowned. His father cried, bitterly lamenting his own arts, and called the island near the place where Icarus fell into the ocean [[Icaria]] in memory of his child. Some time later, the goddess Athena visited Daedalus and gave him wings, telling him to fly like a god.\n\nAn early image of winged Daedalus appears on an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] jug of ca 630 BC found at [[Cerveteri]], where a winged figure captioned ''Taitale'' appears on one side of the vessel, paired on the other side, uniquely, with ''Metaia'', [[Medea]]:<ref>Erika Simon, \"Daidalos-Taitale-Daedalus: neues zu einem wohlbekannten Mythos\", ''Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger'' (2004:419-22).</ref> \"its linking of these two mythical figures is unparalleled,\" Robin Lane Fox observes: \"The link was probably based on their wondrous,  miraculous art. Magically, Daedalus could fly, and magically Medea was able to rejuvenate the old (the scene on the jug seems to show her doing just this)\".<ref>Fox 2009:189.</ref> The image of Daedalus demonstrates that he was already well known in the West.\n\n===Sicily===\nFurther to the west Daedalus arrived safely in [[Sicily]], in the care of King [[Cocalus]] of Kamikos on the island's south coast; there Daedalus built a temple to [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], and hung up his wings, an offering to the god. In an invention of [[Virgil]] (''[[Aeneid]]'' VI), Daedalus flies to [[Cumae]] and founds his temple there, rather than in Sicily; long afterward Aeneas confronts the sculpted golden doors of the temple.\n\n[[Minos]], meanwhile, searched for Daedalus by traveling from city to city asking a riddle. He presented a spiral seashell and asked for a string to be run through it. When he reached Kamikos, King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, privately fetched the old man to him. He tied the string to an ant which, lured by a drop of honey at one end, walked through the seashell stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince Minos to take a bath first, where Cocalus' daughters killed Minos. In some versions, Daedalus himself poured boiling water on Minos and killed him.\n\nThe anecdotes are literary and late; however, in the founding tales of the Greek colony of [[Gela]], founded in the 680s on the southwest coast of Sicily, a tradition was preserved that the Greeks had seized [[cult image]]s wrought by Daedalus from their local predecessors, the [[Sicani]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], viii.46.2, ix.40.3-4; T.J. Dunbabin, ''The Western Greeks'', 1948; S.P. Morris, ''Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art'' (1992:199), all noted by Fox 2009:189 note 9.</ref>\n\n=== Daedalus and Perdix ===\nDaedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the idea of a rival. His sister had placed her son, named variously as [[Perdix (mythology)|Perdix]], Talos, or Calos,<ref>In Hyginus, ''Fabulae'', 39 Perdix is the name of the nephew; but according to ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 15. 8 and the dictionary of [[Suda]] (s. v. ''Perdikos hieron''), Perdix is the name of Daedalus' sister and T son, nephew of Daedalus. The latter source also states that Perdix had a sanctuary dedicated to her near the [[Acropolis]].</ref> under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts. He was an art scholar and showed striking evidence of ingenuity. Walking on the seashore, he picked up the spine of a fish. According to Ovid, imitating it, he took a piece of iron and notched it on the edge, and thus invented the saw. He put two pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet, and sharpening the other ends, and made a pair of compasses.<ref>Both inventions are in Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' viii.236</ref> <!--uncited assertion: It is also said that he invented a way to transfer the soul of a human being into a machine, therefore creating a machine with a soul and rendering the soul immortal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}--> Daedalus was so envious of his nephew's accomplishments that he took an opportunity and caused him to fall from the Acropolis. Athena turned Perdix into a [[Perdix|partridge]] and left a scar that looked like a partridge on Daedalus' right shoulder{{Citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Query: What original text claims this?}} and Daedalus left Athens due to this.\n\n==Innovator==\nSuch anecdotal details as these were embroideries upon the reputation of Daedalus as an innovator in many arts. In [[Pliny's Natural History]] (7.198) he is credited with inventing carpentry \"and with it the saw, axe, plumb-line, drill, glue, and [[isinglass]]\". [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], in travelling around Greece, attributed to Daedalus numerous archaic wooden [[cult figure]]s (see ''[[xoanon|xoana]]'') that impressed him: \"All the works of this artist, though somewhat uncouth to look at, nevertheless have a touch of the divine in them.\"<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' ii.4.5. Pausanias listed existing works that were attributed to Daedalus in the second century AD, ''Description'' ix.40.3</ref>\n\nIt is said he first conceived masts and sails for ships for the navy of Minos. He is said to have carved statues so well they looked as if alive; even possessing self-motion. They would have escaped if not for the chain that bound them to the wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=40}}</ref>\n\nDaedalus gave his name, [[eponym]]ously, to any Greek artificer and to many Greek contraptions that represented dextrous skill. At [[Plataea]] there was a festival, the [[Daedala]], in which a temporary wooden altar was fashioned, and an effigy was made from an oak-tree and dressed in bridal attire. It was carried in a cart with a woman who acted as bridesmaid. The image was called ''Daedale'' and the archaic ritual given an explanation through a myth to the purpose\n\nIn the period of [[Romanticism]], Daedalus came to denote the classic artist, a skilled mature craftsman, while [[Icarus]] symbolized the romantic artist, whose impetuous, passionate and rebellious nature, as well as his defiance of formal aesthetic and social conventions, may ultimately prove to be self-destructive. [[Stephen Dedalus]], in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' envisages his future artist-self \"a winged form flying above the waves ... a hawk-like man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve\u201d.\n\n==Daedalus' statues==\nDaedalus is said to have created statues that were so realistic that they had to be tied down to stop them from wandering off. In ''Meno'', Socrates and Meno are debating the nature of knowledge and true belief when Socrates refers to Daedalus' statues: \"... if they are not fastened up they play truant and run away; but, if fastened, they stay where they are.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Meno|last=Beresford (translation of Plato)|first=Adam |publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=97a-98b}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Lord Frederick Leighton FLL006.jpg|''Daedalus and Icarus'', by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederick Leighton]], ca 1869\nImage:DEDAL ZA JASNA (Small).JPG#file|Small bronze sculpture of Daedalus, 3rd century BC; found on [[Plaoshnik]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]\nImage:PBrueghelElderIcarus.jpg|''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' (detail) by [[Peter Brueghel the Elder]], ca. 1558.<ref>Ovid: \"Some angler catching fish with a quivering rod, or a shepherd leaning on his crook, or a ploughman resting on the handles of his plough, saw them, perhaps, and stood there amazed, believing them to be gods able to travel the sky.\"</ref>\nImage:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Pasiphae.jpg|Daedalus and [[Pasipha\u00eb]].

The bridges were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Deception Island.JPG|left|thumb|Deception Island]]\nThe Deception Pass area has been home to various [[Coast Salish]] tribes for thousands of years. The first [[Europe]]ans to see Deception Pass were members of the 1790 expedition of [[Manuel Quimper]] on the ''[[Princesa Real (sloop)|Princesa Real]]''. The Spanish gave it the name ''Boca de Flon''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=Derek |title=Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of Exploration and Discovery |year=1999 |publisher=Sasquatch Books |isbn=1-57061-215-3 |page=72}}</ref> A group of sailors led by [[Joseph Whidbey]], part of the [[Vancouver Expedition]], found and mapped Deception Pass on June 7, 1792.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=John E. |title=A Discovery Journal: George Vancouver's First Survey Season \u2013 1792 |publisher=Trafford |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4120-7097-3 |page=87}}</ref> [[George Vancouver]] gave it the name \"Deception\" because it had misled him into thinking Whidbey Island was a peninsula.<ref name=wasp>{{cite web |url=http://parks.state.wa.us/497/Deception-Pass |title=Deception Pass State Park |publisher=Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref> The \"deception\" was heightened due to Whidbey's failure to find the strait at first. In May 1792, Vancouver was anchored near the southern end of Whidbey Island. He sent Joseph Whidbey to explore the waters east of Whidbey Island, now known as [[Saratoga Passage]], using small boats. Whidbey reached the northern end of Saratoga Passage and explored eastward into Skagit Bay, which is shallow and difficult to navigate. He returned south to rejoin Vancouver without having found Deception Pass. It appeared that Skagit Bay was a dead-end and that Whidbey Island and Fidalgo Island were a long peninsula attached to the mainland. In June the expedition sailed north along the west coast of Whidbey Island. Vancouver sent Joseph Whidbey to explore inlets leading to the east. The first inlet turned out to be a \"very narrow and intricate channel, which...abounded with rocks above and beneath the surface of the water\".<ref name=historylink/> This channel led to Skagit Bay, thus separating Whidbey Island from the mainland. Vancouver apparently felt he and Joseph Whidbey had been deceived by the tricky strait. Vancouver wrote of Whidbey's efforts: \"This determined [the shore they had been exploring] to be an island, which, in consequence of Mr. Whidbey\u2019s circumnavigation, I distinguished by the name of Whidbey\u2019s Island: and this northern pass, leading into [Skagit Bay], Deception Passage\".<ref name=historylink>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=5060 |title=Joseph Whidbey circumnavigates Whidbey Island in June 1792 |publisher=[[HistoryLink]] |work=The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |first=Kit |last=Oldham |date=August 2, 2006 |accessdate=January 17, 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the waters of Deception Pass, just east of the present-day Deception Pass Bridge, is a small island known as [[Ben Ure Island]]. The island became infamous for its activity of [[Human trafficking|human smuggling]] of migrant Chinese people for local labor. Ben Ure and his partner Lawrence \"Pirate\" Kelly were quite profitable at their human smuggling business and played hide-and-seek with the United States Customs Department for years. Ure's own operation at Deception Pass in the late 1880s consisted of Ure and his Native-American wife. Local tradition has it that his wife would camp on the nearby [[Strawberry Island (Deception Pass, Washington)|Strawberry Island]] (which was visible from the open sea) and signal him with a fire on the island's summit to alert him to whether or not it was safe to attempt to bring the human cargo he illegally transported ashore. For transport, Ure would tie the people up in burlap bags so that if customs agents were to approach he could easily toss the people in bags overboard. The tidal currents would carry the entrapped drowned migrants' bodies to [[San Juan Island]] to the north and west of the pass and many ended up in what became known as Dead Man's Bay.\n[[File:Deception Pass pano 02.jpg|left|thumb|600px|View looking south from Pass Island.

Guards stood watch at the quarry as the prisoners cut the rock into gravel and loaded it onto barges located at the base of the cliff atop the pass's waters. The quarried rock was then taken by barge to the Seattle waterfront.  The camp was dismantled in 1924 and although abandoned as a quarry, the remains of the camp can still be found. The location, however, is hazardous and over the years there have been several fatal accidents when visitors have ventured onto the steep cliffs.\n\nUpon completion on July 31, 1935, the {{convert|976|ft|m|adj=on}} span [[Deception Pass Bridge]] connected Whidbey Island to the tiny Pass Island, and Pass Island to [[Fidalgo Island]]. Prior to the bridge, travellers and businessmen would use an inter-island ferry to commute between Fidalgo and Whidbey islands.\n\n==Currents==\nDeception Pass is a dramatic seascape where the tidal flow and whirlpools beneath the twin bridges connecting Fidalgo Island to Whidbey Island move quickly. During [[Tide#Characteristics|ebb and flood tide]] current speed reaches about {{convert|8|kn|mph}}, flowing in opposite directions between ebb and flood.<ref>{{cite web |url= \nhttp://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/spills/preparedness/GRP/NorthCentralPugetSound/NCPS-AllChapters.pdf |title=2.5 Tides and Currents |work=North Central Puget Sound Geographic Response Plan |pages=2\u20134 |publisher=Washington Department of Ecology |date=December 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref> This swift current can lead to standing waves, large whirlpools, and roiling eddies. This swift current phenomenon can be viewed from the twin bridges' pedestrian walkways or from the trail leading below the larger south bridge from the parking lot on the Whidbey Island side. Boats can be seen waiting on either side of the pass for the current to stop or change direction before going through. Thrill-seeking kayakers go there during large tide changes to surf the standing waves and brave the class 2 and 3 rapid conditions.\n\n==Scuba diving==\nDiving Deception Pass is dangerous and only for the most competent and prepared divers. There are a few times each year that the tides are right for a drift dive from the cove, under the bridge, and back to the cove as the tide changes. These must be planned well in advance by divers who know how to read currents and are aware of the dangerous conditions. However, because of the large tidal exchange, Deception Pass hosts some of the most spectacular colors and life in the Pacific Northwest. The walls and bottom are covered in colorful invertebrates, [[lingcod]], [[greenling]]s, and barnacles everywhere.\n\n==State park==\n[[Image:Deception Pass 1.jpg|thumb|Tourist sign at Deception Pass State Park]]\nDeception Pass is surrounded by {{convert|3,854 |acre|adj=on}} '''Deception Pass State Park''', one of the most visited Washington state park's with over two million annual visitors.<ref name=wasp/> \n;History\nThe park was officially established in 1923, when the original {{convert|1600|acre}} of a military reserve was transferred to Washington State Parks. The park's facilities were greatly enhanced in the 1930s when the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) built roads, trails, and buildings in order to develop the park.<ref name=wasp/> The road to West Beach was created in 1950, opening up a stretch of beach to hordes of vehicles. The former fish hatchery at [[Bowman Bay (Washington)|Bowman Bay]] became a part of the park in the early 1970s. The old entrance to the park was closed in 1997 when a new entrance was created at the intersection of Highway 20 and Cornet Bay road, improving access into and out of the park.\n;Activities and amenities\nThe park's recreational facilities include campgrounds, hiking trails, beaches, and tidepools. Several miles of the [[Pacific Northwest Trail]] are within the park, most notably including the section that crosses Deception Pass on the Highway 20 bridge. In addition, the Cornet Bay Retreat Center provides cabins and dining and recreation facilities. Cornet Bay offers boat launches and fishing opportunities, while Bowman Bay has an interpretive center that explains the story of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] throughout Washington state. Near the center is a CCC honor statue, which can be found in 30 different states in the country. Fishing is popular in Pass Lake, on the north side of the bridge.  Boat rentals and guided tours of the park are also offered.\n;Islands\nIncluded in the park are ten islands: Northwest Island, Deception Island, Pass Island, Strawberry, Ben Ure, Kiket, Skagit, Hope, and Big and Little Deadman Islands. Ben Ure Island is partially privately owned.  The island is not open to the public except for a small rentable cabin available via the state park, which is only accessible by rowboat.\n{{clear}}\n{{wide image|Deception Pass pano 03.jpg|1200px|Looking roughly west from near the south span of the Deception Pass Bridge.

Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ''ends''. Each end is marked with a number of spots (also called ''[[Pip (counting)|pips]]'', ''nips'', or ''dobs'') or is blank. The backs of the dominoes in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. The domino gaming pieces make up a domino set, sometimes called a ''deck'' or ''pack''.  The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 28 dominoes, featuring all combinations of spot counts between zero and six. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to [[playing card]]s or [[dice]], in that a variety of games can be played with a set.\n\nThe earliest mention of dominoes is from [[Song dynasty]] China found in the text ''Former Events in Wulin'' by Zhou Mi (1232\u20131298).<ref name=\"lo 2000\">Lo, Andrew. \"The Game of Leaves: An Inquiry into the Origin of Chinese Playing Cards,\" ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 63, No. 3 (2000): 389-406.</ref> Modern dominoes first appeared in Italy during the 18th century, but how [[Chinese dominoes]] developed into the modern game is unknown. Italian missionaries in China may have brought the game to Europe.<ref name=\"Carl\">{{cite book|author=Rodney P.

Later, the name was given to a mourning-veil for women and later still to half-masks worn by women when travelling or at a masquerade, for disguise. A domino was a masquerade-dress worn for disguise by ladies and gentlemen, and consisting of an ample cloak or mantle with wide sleeves and a hood removable at pleasure. It was usually made of black silk, but sometimes of other colours and materials.[The Probert Encyclopaedia]</ref> Despite the coinage of the word [[polyomino]] as a generalization, there is no connection between the word \"domino\" and the number 2 in any language.\n\n==Construction and composition of domino sets==\nEuropean-style dominoes are traditionally made of bone or [[ivory]], or a dark hardwood such as [[ebony]], with contrasting black or white pips ([[inlay|inlaid]] or [[paint]]ed). Alternatively, domino sets have been made from many different natural materials: stone (e.g., [[marble]], [[granite]] or [[soapstone]]); other hardwoods (e.g., [[ash tree|ash]], [[oak]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]], and [[cedrus|cedar]]); metals (e.g., [[brass]] or [[pewter]]); [[ceramic]] clay, or even [[frosted glass]] or [[crystal]]. These sets have a more novel look, and the often heavier weight makes them feel more substantial; also, such materials and the resulting products are usually much more expensive than polymer materials. \n[[Image:Dominoes.jpg|thumb|left|Domino tiles]]\nModern commercial domino sets are usually made of synthetic materials, such as [[ABS plastic|ABS]] or [[polystyrene]] plastics, or [[Bakelite]] and other [[phenolic resin]]s; many sets approximate the look and feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of card stock like that for [[playing card]]s. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Western Domino Attributes|url=http://www.domino-play.com/TypeDoubleSquares.htm|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional set of dominoes contains one unique piece for each possible combination of two ends with zero to six spots, and is known as a double-six set because the highest-value piece has six pips on each end (the \"double six\"). The spots from one to six are generally arranged as they are on six-sided [[dice]], but because blank ends having no spots are used, seven faces are possible, allowing 28 unique pieces in a double-six set.\n\nHowever, this is a relatively small number especially when playing with more than four people, so many domino sets are \"extended\" by introducing ends with greater numbers of spots, which increases the number of unique combinations of ends and thus of pieces. Each progressively larger set increases the maximum number of pips on an end by three, so the common extended sets are double-nine, double-12, double-15, and double-18. Larger sets such as double-21 can theoretically exist, but are rarely seen in retail stores, as identifying the number of pips on each domino becomes difficult, and a double-21 set would have 253 pieces, far more than is normally necessary for most domino games even with eight players.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|Chinese dominoes}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bemanning tijdens een spel domino aan boord van een schip TMnr 60008507.jpg|thumb|Dutch sailors playing dominoes, 1890s]]\nThe oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the ''Former Events in Wulin'' (i.e., the capital [[Hangzhou]]) written by the Yuan Dynasty (1271\u20131368) author Zhou Mi (1232\u20131298), who listed ''pupai'' (gambling plaques or dominoes), as well as [[dice]] as items sold by peddlers during the reign of [[Emperor Xiaozong of Song]] (r. 1162\u20131189).<ref name=\"lo 2000\"/> Andrew Lo asserts that Zhou Mi meant dominoes when referring to ''pupai'', since the Ming author [[Lu Rong]] (1436\u20131494) explicitly defined ''pupai'' as dominoes (in regard to a story of a suitor who won a maiden's hand by drawing out four winning ''pupai'' from a set).<ref name=\"lo 2000\"/>\n\nThe earliest known manual written about dominoes is the {{lang|zh|\u300a\u5ba3\u548c\u724c\u8b5c\u300b}} ''(Manual of the Xuanhe Period)'' written by [[Qu You]] (1341\u20131437),<ref name=\"lo 2000\"/> but some Chinese scholars believe this manual is a forgery from a later time.<ref name=\"\u300a\u5ba3\u548c\u724c\u8c31\u300b\u77bf\u4f51\u4f5c\u8fa8\u4f2a\">{{Cite news|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/article/ZHWL200901006.htm|date=|publisher=<span lang=\"zh\">\u300a\u4e2d\u534e\u6587\u5316\u8bba\u575b\u300b2009\u5e7401\u671f</span>|language=zh|script-title=zh:\u300a\u5ba3\u548c\u724c\u8c31\u300b\u77bf\u4f51\u4f5c\u8fa8\u4f2a|author=<span lang=\"zh\">\u4e54\u5149\u8f89\u3001\u90ed\u5a01\u3001\u738b\u9a8f</span>|accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Encyclopedia of a Myriad of Treasures'', Zhang Pu (1602\u20131641) described the game of laying out dominoes as ''pupai'', although the character for ''pu'' had changed, yet retained the same pronunciation.<ref name=\"lo 2000\"/> Traditional Chinese domino games include ''[[Tien Gow]], [[Pai Gow]], [[Che Deng]]'', and others. The 32-piece Chinese domino set, made to represent each possible face of two thrown dice and thus have no blank faces, differs from the 28-piece domino set found [[Western world|in the West]] during the mid 18th century.<ref>Pickover (2002), 141.</ref> Chinese dominoes with blank faces were known during the 17th century.<ref>Lo, Andrew (2004) 'China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong.'

New York: [[Asia Society]], pp. 224.</ref>\n\nMany different domino sets have been used for centuries in various parts of the world to play a variety of domino games.  Each domino originally represented one of the 21 results of throwing two six-sided dice (2d6). One half of each domino is set with the pips from one die and the other half contains the pips from the second die. Chinese sets also introduce duplicates of some throws and divide the dominoes into two [[Suit (cards)|suits]]: military and civil.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2003|title=Pan Zhiheng's 'Xu Yezi Pu' - Part 2|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|volume=31|issue=6|pages=281\u2013284|ref=Lo|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew}}</ref> Chinese dominoes are also longer than typical European dominoes.\n\nThe early 18th century had dominoes making their way to Europe, making their first appearance in [[Italy]]. The game changed somewhat in the translation from Chinese to the European culture. European domino sets contain neither suit distinctions nor the duplicates that went with them. Instead, European sets contain seven additional dominoes, with six of these representing the values that result from throwing a single die with the other half of the tile left blank, and the seventh domino representing the blank-blank (0\u20130) combination.\n\nIvory dominoes were routinely used in 19th-century rural England in the settling of disputes over traditional grazing boundaries, and were commonly referred to as \"bonesticks\".<ref>Hartley, Land Law in West Lancashire in the mid- 19th Century, Farm Gazette, March 1984</ref>\n\n==Tiles and suits==\n[[Image:Dominomatrix.svg|thumb|right|Complete double-six set]]\n\nDomino tiles, also known as bones, are twice as long as they are wide and usually have a line in the middle dividing them into two squares. The value of either side is the number of spots or pips. In the most common variant (double-six), the values range from blank or no pips to six.<ref name=hoyle1950>{{Cite book\n|title=Hoyle's games modernized\n|last=Hoyle\n|first=Edmond\n|last2=Dawson\n|first2=Lawrence Hawkins\n|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul\n|year=1950\n}}. Republished 1994 by Wordsworth Editions.</ref> The sum of the two values, i.e. the total number of pips, may be referred to as the rank or weight of a tile, and a tile with more pips may be called heavier than a lighter tile with fewer pips.\n\nTiles are generally named after their two values; e.g. deuce-five or five-deuce (2\u20135 or 5\u20132) are alternative ways of describing the tile with the values two and five. Tiles that have the same value on both ends are called doubles, and are typically referred to as double-zero, double-one, etc.<ref name=hoyle1950 /> Tiles with two different values are called singles.<ref name=\"kelleylugo2003\" />\n\nEvery tile belongs to the two suits of its two values, e.g. 0\u20133 belongs both to the blank suit (or 0 suit) and to the 3 suit. Naturally the doubles form an exception in that each double belongs to only one suit.<ref name=hoyle1950 /> In [[42 (dominoes)|42]], the doubles can be treated as an additional suit of doubles, so the double-six (6\u20136) belongs both to the six suit and the suit of doubles.\n\nThe most common domino sets commercially available are double six (with 28 tiles) and double nine (with 55 tiles). Larger sets exist and are popular for games involving several players or for players looking for long domino games. The number of tiles in a set has the formula <math>\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}</math> for a double-''n'' set.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mathematics of Dominoes|url=http://www.pagat.com/tile/wdom/math.html|work=Pagat.com|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}\n{{See also|List of domino games}}\n\nThe most popular type of play are layout games, which fall into two main categories, blocking games and scoring games.\n\n* Most domino games are blocking games, i.e. the objective is to empty one's hand while blocking the opponent's. In the end, a score may be determined by counting the pips in the losing players' hands.\n* In scoring games, the scoring is different and happens mostly during game play, making it the principal objective.<ref name=\"kelleylugo2003\" />\n* A popular version played predominantly in Singapore, referenced as Hector's Rules, allows for playing double tiles on opponents' hands and awards a bonus play of an additional tile immediately after playing a double tile. \n\n===Blocking game===\nThe most basic domino variant is for two players and requires a double-six set. The 28 tiles are shuffled face down and form the ''stock'' or ''boneyard''. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge in front of the players, so each player can see their own tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the opponent's hands at all times during gameplay.\n\nOne player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. This tile starts the line of play, in which values of adjacent pairs of tile ends must match. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends; if a player is unable to place a valid tile, they must keep on pulling tiles from the stock until they can. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.<ref name=\"hoyle1950\" />\n\n===Scoring game===\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says domino after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino.\n\n===Draw game===\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile, and they are not allowed to pass before the stock is (nearly) empty.<ref name=\"hoyle1950\" /> The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock.<ref name=\"kelleylugo2003\">{{Cite book\n|title=The Little Giant Book of Dominoes\n|last=Kelley\n|first=Jennifer A.\n|last2=Lugo\n|first2=Miguel\n|year=2003\n|isbn=1-4027-0290-6\n|publisher=Sterling}}</ref> The draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominoes\".<ref>{{Cite web\n|title=My Book of Indoor Games\n|last=Squareman\n|first=Clarence\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13022\n|year=1916}}</ref>\n\nAdaptations of both games can accommodate more than two players, who may play individually or in teams.<ref name=\"hoyle1950\" />\n\n===Line of play===\n[[Image:Muggins.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Muggins (domino game)|Muggins]] played with multicolored tiles: The doubles serve as spinners, allowing the line of play to branch.]]\n\nThe line of play is the configuration of played tiles on the table. It starts with a single tile and typically grows in two opposite directions when players add matching tiles. In practice, players often play tiles at right angles when the line of play gets too close to the edge of the table.\n\nThe rules for the line of play often differ from one variant to another. In many rules, the doubles serve as spinners, i.e., they can be played on all four sides, causing the line of play to branch. Sometimes, the first tile is required to be a double, which serves as the only spinner.<ref name=\"kelleylugo2003\" /> In some games such as [[Chicken Foot (domino game)|Chicken Foot]], all sides of a spinner must be occupied before anybody is allowed to play elsewhere. [[Matador (domino game)|Matador]] has unusual rules for matching. [[Bendomino]] uses curved tiles, so one side of the line of play (or both) may be blocked for geometrical reasons.\n\nIn [[Mexican Train]] and other train games, the game starts with a spinner from which various trains branch off. Most trains are owned by a player and in most situations players are allowed to extend only their own train.\n\n===Scoring===\nIn blocking games, scoring happens at the end of the game. After a player has emptied their hand, thereby winning the game for the team, the score consists of the total pip count of the losing team's hands. In some rules, the pip count of the remaining stock is added. If a game is blocked because no player can move, the winner is often determined by adding the pips in players' hands.<ref name=\"kelleylugo2003\" />\n\nIn scoring games, each individual can potentially add to the score. For example, in [[Bergen (domino game)|Bergen]], players score two points whenever they cause a configuration in which both open ends have the same value and three points if additionally one open end is formed by a double.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bergen|publisher=domino-games.com|url=http://www.domino-games.com/domino-rules/bergen-rules.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bergen|publisher=pagat.com|url=http://www.pagat.com/tile/wdom/bergen.html}}</ref> In Muggins, players score by ensuring the total pip count of the open ends is a multiple of a certain number. In variants of Muggins, the line of play may branch due to spinners.\n\nIn British public houses and social clubs, a scoring version of \"5s-and-3s\" is used. The game is normally played in pairs (two against two) and is played as a series of \"ends\". In each \"end\", the objective is for players to attach a domino from their hand to one end of those already played so that the sum of the end dominoes is divisible by five or three. One point is scored for each time five or three can be divided into the sum of the two dominoes, i.e. four at one end and five at the other makes nine, which is divisible by three three times, resulting in three points. Double five at one end and five at the other makes 15, which is divisible by three five times (five points) and divisible by five three times (three points) for a total of eight points.\n\nAn \"end\" stops when one of the players is out, i.e., has played all of their dominoes. In the event no player is able to empty their hand, then the player with the lowest domino left in hand is deemed to be out and scores one point. A game consists of any number of ends with points scored in the ends accumulating towards a total. The game ends when one of the pair's total score exceeds a set number of points. A running total score is often kept on a [[cribbage]] board. 5s-and-3s is played in a number of competitive leagues in the British Isles.\n\n===Variations and game play===\n{{One source|section|date=June 2018}}\nFor 40 years the game has been played by four people, with the winner being the first player to score 150 points, in multiples of five, by using 27 bones, using mathematical strategic defenses and explosive offense. At times, it has been played with pairs of partners. The double-six set is the preferred deck with the lowest denomination of game pieces, with 28 dominoes.\n\nIn many versions of the game, the player with the highest double leads with that double, for example \"double-six\". If no one has it, the next-highest double is called: \"double-five?\", then \"double-four?\", etc. until the highest double in any of the players' hands is played. If no player has an \"opening\" double, the next heaviest domino in the highest suit is called - \"six-five?\", \"six-four?\". In some variants, players take turns picking dominoes from the stock until an opening double is picked and played. In other variants, the hand is reshuffled and each player picks seven dominoes. After the first hand, the winner (or winning team) of the previous hand is allowed to pick first and begins by playing any domino in his or her hand.\n\nPlaying the first bone of a hand is sometimes called setting, leading, downing, or posing the first bone. Dominoes aficionados often call this procedure smacking down the bone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://domino-play.com/glossary.htm|title=Domino Glossary|website=domino-play.com|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref> After each hand, bones are shuffled and each player draws the number of bones required, normally seven. Play proceeds clockwise. Players, in turn, must play a bone with an end that matches one of the open ends of the layouts.\n\nIn some versions of the games, the pips or points on the end, and the section to be played next to it must add up to a given number. For example, in a double-six set, the \"sum\" would be six, requiring a blank to be played next to a six, an ace (one) next to a five, a deuce (two) next to a four, etc.\n\nThe stock of bones left behind, if any, is called the bone yard, and the  bones therein are said to be sleeping. In draw games, players take part in the bone selection, typically drawing from the bone yard when they do not have a \"match\" in their hands.\n\nIf a player inadvertently picks up and sees one or more extra dominoes, those dominoes become part of his or her hand.\n\nA player who can play a tile may be allowed to pass anyway.<!-- What is the rule here? --> Passing can be signalled by tapping twice on the table or by saying \"go\" or \"pass\".\n\nPlay continues until one of the players has played all the dominoes in his or her hand, calls \"Out!\", \"I win\", or \"Domino!\" and wins the hand, or until all players are blocked and no legal plays remain. This is sometimes referred to as locked down or sewed up. In a common version of the game, the next player after the block picks up all the dominoes in the bone yard as if trying to find a (nonexistent) match. If all the players are blocked, or locked out, the player with the lowest hand (pip count) wins. In team play, the team with the lowest individual hand wins. In the case of a tie, the first of tied players or the first ''team'' in the play rotation wins.\n\nIn games where points accrue, the winning player scores a point for each pip on each bone still held by each opponent or the opposing team. If no player went out, the win is determined by the lightest hand, sometimes only the excess points held by opponents.\n\nA game is generally played to 100 points, the tally being kept on paper. In more common games, mainly urban rules, games are played to 150, 200, or 250 points.\n[[File:Scoring Houses.jpeg|alt=scoring houses|thumb|Score being kept by houses: The player at left has 75 points and the player at right has 115 points.]]\nIn some games, the tally is kept by creating [[:File:Scoring Houses.jpeg|houses]], where the beginning of the house (the first 10 points) is a large [[+]], the next 10 points are [[O]], and scoring with a five is a [[/]], and are placed in the four corners of the house. One house is equal to 50 points.\n\nIn some versions, if a lock down occurs, the first person to call a lock-down gains the other players bones and adds the amount of the pips to his or her house. If a person who calls rocks after a call of lock-down or domino finds the number of pips a player called is incorrect, those points become his.\n\n===Bogus play===\nWhen a player plays out of turn or knocks when he could have played and someone calls bogus play, the other person is awarded 50 points.\n\n===Card games using domino sets===\nApart from the usual blocking and scoring games, also domino games of a very different character are played, such as solitaire or trick-taking games. Most of these are adaptations of [[card game]]s and were once popular in certain areas to circumvent religious proscriptions against [[playing card]]s.<ref>{{Cite book\n|title=The New Complete Hoyle\n|last=Morehead\n|first=Albert Hodges\n|last2=Hoyle\n|first2=Edmond\n|last3=Frey\n|first3=Richard L.\n|last4=Mott-Smith\n|first4=Geoffrey\n|year=1991\n|isbn=0-385-24962-4\n|publisher=Doubleday}}</ref>\nA very simple example is a [[Concentration (game)|Concentration]] variant played with a double-six set; two tiles are considered to match if their total pip count is 12.\n\nA popular domino game in [[Texas]] is [[42 (dominoes)|42]]. The game is similar to the card game [[spades]]. It is played with four players paired into teams. Each player draws seven dominoes, and the dominoes are played into tricks. Each trick counts as one point, and any domino with a multiple of five dots counts toward the total of the hand. These 35 points of \"five count\" and seven tricks equals 42 points, hence the name.<!---\n\nThe following seems to be just a slightly spiced up standard variant of the 4 player Block game with empty stock.Part of this information may be worth including elsewhere, but it doesn't really belong into an \"other games\" section.\n\nAlso, in the Caribbean, there are other common games which involve four players in which the players can play as partners or as individuals. In partners, the partners sit across from each other and all hands can not be seen by the other players. The game is started by shuffling the dominoes or 'cards' and each player pulling seven cards. The double six is then played and play continues to the starter's right side. If a player can not play then he is passed and it is the next player's turn. The object is for a team to win by one of the players running out of dominoes. The winning team is awarded a point and then restart the process by shuffling and pulling a new hand and then starting with any domino either partner wishes to play. The game goes on till one team reaches six points. Double points are awarded when you get 'key'. This happens when your last card is the only card that can be played on both ends. Also when a player pulls five doubles all players put their dominoes back and pull new hands, the following game is played for 2 points and the double six is started by the player who has it. This variation is called Partners, where the other variation is called Cut-Throat (or 'pin-tin tin' in the Dominican Republic), where each player plays for himself, in which all the same rules apply as in partners. This form of dominoes is most common in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]].\n\n[[Dominican Republic]] is know to have the best Dominos players in the world.\n-->\n\n==Competitive play==\n[[File:Abkhazia 10 apsar Ag 2011 Domino b.jpg|thumb|left|150px| Commemorative Coin of the 2011 Domino World Championship in Abkhazia]] \nDominoes is played at a professional level, similar to poker. Numerous organisations and clubs of amateur domino players exist around the world. Some organizations, including the ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Domino (FIDO)''<ref>http://domino-fid.org/</ref> organize international competitions. The 2008 and 2009 Double FIDO domino world champion from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is Darren Elhindi.\n\n==Other uses of dominoes==\n[[Image:Domino Cascade.JPG|thumb|Dominoes in motion]]\n[[Image:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|Dominoes waiting to fall]]\n\nBesides playing games, another use of dominoes is the [[domino show]], which involves standing them on end in long lines so that when the first tile is toppled, it topples the second, which topples the third, etc., resulting in all of the tiles falling. By analogy, the phenomenon of small events causing similar events leading to eventual catastrophe is called the [[domino effect]].\n\nArrangements of millions of tiles have been made that have taken many minutes, even hours to fall. For large and elaborate arrangements, special blockages (also known as firebreaks) are employed at regular distances to prevent a premature toppling from undoing more than a section of the dominoes while still being able to be removed without damage.\n\nThe phenomenon also has some theoretical relevance ([[amplifier]], [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]], [[information processing]]),<ref name=domcom>[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1764437 Domino computer]</ref> and this amounts to the theoretical possibility of building [[domino computer]]s.<ref name=comdomcon>[http://www.pinkandaint.com/oldhome/comp/dominoes/index.html Domino computers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816075615/http://www.pinkandaint.com/oldhome/comp/dominoes/index.html |date=16 August 2006 }}, a detailed description written by [http://www.pinkandaint.com/ David Johnston]</ref> Dominoes are also commonly used as components in [[Rube Goldberg machine]]s.\n\nThe Netherlands has hosted an annual domino-toppling exhibition called [[Domino Day]] since 1986.

On Domino Day 2008 (14 November 2008), the Weijers Domino Productions team attempted to set 10 records:<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7730834.stm |title=World domino record set on TV |accessdate=18 November 2008|work=BBC News | date=15 November 2008}}</ref>\n# Longest domino spiral (200 m)\n# Highest domino climb (12 m)\n# Smallest domino tile (7&nbsp;mm)\n# Largest domino tile (4.8 m)\n# Longest domino wall (16 m)\n# Largest domino structure (25,000 tiles)\n# Fastest topple of 30 metres of domino tiles (4.21 sec, time by Churandy Martina: 3.81 sec)\n# Largest number of domino tiles resting on a single domino (1002 tiles) for more than 1 hour\n# Largest rectangular level domino field (1 million tiles)\n# A new record of 4,345,027 tiles\nThis record attempt was held in the {{ill|WTC Expo hall|nl|WTC Leeuwarden}} in [[Leeuwarden]].

The [[conversion of units]] from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex. Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the '''factor-label method''', also known as the '''unit-factor method''', is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of [[algebra]].<ref>{{cite book|first=David |last=Goldberg|title=Fundamentals of Chemistry|edition=5th |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-322104-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=James |last=Ogden|title=The Handbook of Chemical Engineering|publisher=Research & Education Association|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87891-982-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentchemistry.com/links/Measurements/dimensionalanalysis.htm |title=Dimensional Analysis or the Factor Label Method |website=Mr Kent's Chemistry Page}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of '''physical dimension''' was introduced by [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1822.<ref>{{Citation |last=Fourier |first=Joseph |title=Theorie analytique de la chaleur |publisher=Firmin Didot |location=Paris |year=1822 |language=fr |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TDQJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR3 }}</ref> Physical quantities that are of the same kind (also called ''commensurable'') have the same dimension (length, time, mass) and can be directly compared to each other, even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure (such as yards and meters).  If physical quantities have different dimensions (such as length vs. mass), they cannot be expressed in terms of similar units and cannot be compared in quantity (also called ''incommensurable''). For example, asking whether a kilogram is larger than an hour is meaningless.\n\nAny physically meaningful [[equation]] (and any [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]) will have the same dimensions on its left and right sides, a property known as ''dimensional homogeneity''. Checking for dimensional homogeneity is a common application of dimensional analysis, serving as a plausibility check on [[Formal proof|derived]] equations and computations.  It also serves as a guide and constraint in deriving equations that may describe a physical system in the absence of a more rigorous derivation.\n\n== Concrete numbers and base units ==\n\nA lot of parameters and the measurements(m) in the physical sciences and engineering are expressed as a [[concrete number]] \u2013 a numerical quantity(q) and a corresponding dimensional unit.  Often a quantity is expressed in terms of several other quantities; for example, speed is a combination of length and time, e.g. 60 miles per hour or 1.4&nbsp;kilometers per second.  Compound relations with \"per\" are expressed with [[Division (mathematics)|division]], e.g. 60&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;h.  Other relations can involve [[multiplication]] (often shown with a [[centered dot]] or [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]]), powers (like m<sup>2</sup> for square meters), or combinations thereof.\n\nA set of [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]s for a [[system of measurement]] is a conventionally chosen set of units, none of which can be expressed as a combination of the others, and in terms of which all the remaining units of the system can be expressed.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |author=JCGM 200 |year=2012 |title=International vocabulary of metrology \u2013 Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) |edition=3rd |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224356/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-23 }}</ref> For example, units for [[length]] and [[time]] are normally chosen as base units.  Units for [[volume]], however, can be factored into the base units of length (m<sup>3</sup>), thus they are considered derived or compound units.\n\nSometimes the names of units obscure the fact that they are derived units. For example, a [[newton (unit)|newton]] (N) is a unit of [[force]], which will have units of mass (kg) times acceleration (m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>). The newton is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 N = 1 kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>}}.\n\n=== Percentages and derivatives ===\nPercentages are dimensionless quantities, since they are ratios of two quantities with the same dimensions.  In other words, the % sign can be read as \"hundredths\", since {{nowrap|1=1% = 1/100}}.\n\nTaking a derivative with respect to a quantity adds the dimension of the variable one is differentiating with respect to, in the denominator. Thus:\n* position (''x'') has the dimension L (length);\n* derivative of position with respect to time (''dx''/''dt'', [[velocity]]) has dimension LT<sup>\u22121</sup> \u2013 length from position, time due to the derivative;\n* the second derivative (''d''<sup>2</sup>''x''/''dt''<sup>2</sup> = (''dx''/''dt'') / ''dt'', [[acceleration]]) has dimension LT<sup>\u22122</sup>.\nIn economics, one distinguishes between [[stocks and flows]]: a stock has units of \"units\" (say, widgets or dollars), while a flow is a derivative of a stock, and has units of \"units/time\" (say, dollars/year).\n\nIn some contexts, dimensional quantities are expressed as dimensionless quantities or percentages by omitting some dimensions. For example, [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s are generally expressed as percentages: total debt outstanding (dimension of currency) divided by annual GDP (dimension of currency) \u2013 but one may argue that in comparing a stock to a flow, annual GDP should have dimensions of currency/time (dollars/year, for instance), and thus Debt-to-GDP should have units of years, which indicates that Debt-to-GDP is the number of years needed for a constant GDP to pay the debt, if all GDP is spent on the debt and the debt is otherwise unchanged.\n\n== Conversion factor ==\n{{Main article|Conversion factor}}\nIn dimensional analysis, a ratio which converts one unit of measure into another without changing the quantity is called a [[conversion factor]].  For example, kPa and bar are both units of pressure, and {{nowrap|1=100 kPa = 1 bar}}.  The rules of algebra allow both sides of an equation to be divided by the same expression, so this is equivalent to {{nowrap|1=100 kPa / 1 bar = 1}}.  Since any quantity can be multiplied by 1 without changing it, the expression \"{{nowrap|100 kPa / 1 bar}}\" can be used to convert from bars to kPa by multiplying it with the quantity to be converted, including units.  For example, {{nowrap|1=5 bar \u00d7 100 kPa / 1 bar = 500 kPa}} because {{nowrap|1=5 \u00d7 100 / 1 = 500}}, and bar/bar cancels out, so {{nowrap|1=5 bar = 500 kPa}}.\n\n== Dimensional homogeneity ==\n{{See also|Apples and oranges}}\nThe most basic rule of dimensional analysis is that of dimensional homogeneity.<ref>John Cimbala and Yunus Cengel (2006), ''Essential of Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications'', McGraw-Hill. Chapter 7: \"Dimensional Analysis and Modeling\", Section 7-2: \"Dimensional homogeneity\" [http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073138355/student_view0/chapter7/]</ref> Only commensurable quantities (physical quantities having the same dimension) may be ''compared,'' ''equated,'' ''added,'' or ''subtracted.''\nHowever, the dimensions form an [[abelian group]] under multiplication, so:\n:One may take ''ratios'' of ''incommensurable'' quantities (quantities with different dimensions), and ''multiply'' or ''divide'' them.\n\nFor example, it makes no sense to ask whether 1 hour is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer, as these have different dimensions, nor to add 1 hour to 1 kilometer.  However, it makes perfect sense to ask whether 1 mile is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer being the same dimension of physical quantity even though the units are different. On the other hand, if an object travels 100&nbsp;km in 2 hours, one may divide these and conclude that the object's average speed was 50&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe rule implies that in a physically meaningful ''expression'' only quantities of the same dimension can be added, subtracted, or compared. For example, if ''m''<sub>man</sub>, ''m''<sub>rat</sub> and ''L''<sub>man</sub> denote, respectively, the mass of some man, the mass of a rat and the length of that man, the dimensionally homogeneous expression {{nowrap|''m''<sub>man</sub> + ''m''<sub>rat</sub>}} is meaningful, but the heterogeneous expression {{nowrap|''m''<sub>man</sub> + ''L''<sub>man</sub>}} is meaningless. However, ''m''<sub>man</sub>/''L''<sup>2</sup><sub>man</sub> is fine. Thus, dimensional analysis may be used as a [[sanity check]] of physical equations: the two sides of any equation must be commensurable or have the same dimensions.\n\nEven when two physical quantities have identical dimensions, it may nevertheless be meaningless to compare or add them. For example, although [[torque]] and [[energy]] share the dimension {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=\u22122}}, they are fundamentally different physical quantities.\n\nTo compare, add, or subtract quantities with the same dimensions but expressed in different units, the standard procedure is first to convert them all to the same units. For example, to compare 32 [[metre]]s with 35 [[yard]]s, use 1 yard = 0.9144&nbsp;m to convert 35 yards to 32.004&nbsp;m.\n\nA related principle is that any physical law that accurately describes the real world must be independent of the units used to measure the physical variables.<ref>{{cite book|first=Frits J. |last=de Jong|first2=Wilhelm |last2=Quade|title=Dimensional analysis for economists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5BRAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=North Holland |page=28}}</ref>  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] must hold true whether distance is measured in miles or kilometers.  This principle gives rise to the form that conversion factors must take between units that measure the same dimension: multiplication by a simple constant.  It also ensures equivalence; for example, if two buildings are the same height in feet, then they must be the same height in meters.\n\n== The factor-label method for converting units ==\n\nThe factor-label method is the sequential application of conversion factors expressed as fractions and arranged so that any dimensional unit appearing in both the numerator and denominator of any of the fractions can be cancelled out until only the desired set of dimensional units is obtained. For example, 10 [[miles per hour]] can be converted to [[meters per second]] by using a sequence of conversion factors as shown below:\n\n: <math> \\frac{10\\ \\cancel{\\text{mile}}}{1\\ \\cancel{\\text{hour}}} \\times \\frac{1609.344\\text{ meter}}{1\\ \\cancel{\\text{mile}}} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\cancel{\\text{hour}}}{3600\\text{ second}} = 4.4704\\ \\frac{\\text{meter}}{\\text{second}}. </math>\n\nIt can be seen that each conversion factor is equivalent to the value of one. For example, starting with 1 mile = 1609.344 meters and dividing both sides of the equation by 1 mile yields 1 mile / 1 mile = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile, which when simplified yields 1 = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile.\n\nSo, when the units ''mile'' and ''hour'' are cancelled out and the arithmetic is done, 10 miles per hour converts to 4.4704 meters per second.\n\nAs a more complex example, the [[concentration]] of [[nitrogen oxides]] (i.e., [[NOx|<math chem>\\color{Blue}\\ce{NO}_x</math>]]) in the [[flue gas]] from an industrial [[furnace]] can be converted to a [[mass flow rate]] expressed in grams per hour (i.e., g/h) of <math chem>\\ce{NO}_x</math> by using the following information as shown below:\n\n; NO<sub>x</sub> concentration := 10 [[parts per notation|parts per million]] by volume = 10 ppmv = 10 volumes/10<sup>6</sup> volumes\n; NO<sub>x</sub> molar mass := 46&nbsp;kg/kmol = 46&nbsp;g/mol\n; Flow rate of flue gas := 20 cubic meters per minute = 20 m<sup>3</sup>/min\n: The flue gas exits the furnace at 0 \u00b0C temperature and 101.325 kPa absolute pressure.\n: The [[standard conditions of temperature and pressure#Molar volume of a gas|molar volume]] of a gas at 0 \u00b0C temperature and 101.325 kPa is 22.414 m<sup>3</sup>/[[kmol]].\n\n:<math chem>\n\\frac{10\\ \\cancel{\\ce{m}^3\\ \\ce{NO}_x}}{10^6\\ \\cancel{\\ce{m}^3\\ \\ce{gas}}} \\times\n\\frac{20\\ \\cancel{\\ce{m}^3\\ \\ce{gas}}}{1\\ \\cancel{\\ce{minute}}} \\times\n\\frac{60\\ \\cancel{\\ce{minute}}}{1\\ \\ce{hour}} \\times\n\\frac{1\\ \\cancel{\\ce{mol\\ NO}_x}}{22.414\\ \\cancel{\\ce{m}^3\\ \\ce{NO}_x}} \\times\n\\frac{46\\ \\cancel{\\ce{kg\\ NO}_x}}{1\\ \\cancel{\\ce{mol\\ NO}_x}} \\times\n\\frac{1000\\ \\ce{g\\ NO}_x}{1 \\cancel{\\ce{kg\\ NO}_x}} =\n24.63\\ \\frac{\\ce{g\\ NO}_x}{\\ce{hour}}\n</math>\n\nAfter canceling out any dimensional units that appear both in the numerators and denominators of the fractions in the above equation, the NO<sub>x</sub> concentration of 10 ppm<sub>v</sub> converts to mass flow rate of 24.63&nbsp;grams per hour.\n\n=== Checking equations that involve dimensions ===\nThe factor-label method can also be used on any mathematical equation to check whether or not the dimensional units on the left hand side of the equation are the same as the dimensional units on the right hand side of the equation. Having the same units on both sides of an equation does not ensure that the equation is correct, but having different units on the two sides (when expressed in terms of base units) of an equation implies that the equation is wrong.\n\nFor example, check the [[Gas Laws|Universal Gas Law]] equation of {{nowrap|1=''PV'' = ''nRT''}}, when:\n* the pressure ''P'' is in pascals (Pa)\n* the volume ''V'' is in cubic meters (m<sup>3</sup>)\n* the amount of substance ''n'' is in moles (mol)\n* the [[Gas constant|universal gas law constant ''R'']] is 8.3145 Pa\u22c5m<sup>3</sup>/(mol\u22c5K)\n* the temperature ''T'' is in kelvins (K)\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{Pa.m^3} = \\frac{\\cancel{\\ce{mol}}}{1} \\times\n\\frac{\\ce{Pa.m^3}}{\\cancel{\\ce{mol}}\\ \\cancel{\\ce{K}}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel{\\ce{K}}}{1}\n</math>\n\nAs can be seen, when the dimensional units appearing in the numerator and denominator of the equation's right hand side are cancelled out, both sides of the equation have the same dimensional units.\n\n=== Limitations ===\nThe factor-label method can convert only unit quantities for which the units are in a linear relationship intersecting at 0. Most units fit this paradigm. An example for which it cannot be used is the conversion between [[degrees Celsius]] and [[kelvin]]s (or [[degrees Fahrenheit]]). Between degrees Celsius and kelvins, there is a constant difference rather than a constant ratio, while between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit there is neither a constant difference nor a constant ratio. There is, however, an [[affine transform]] (<math>x \\mapsto ax+b</math>, rather than a [[linear transform]] <math>x \\mapsto ax</math>) between them.\n\nFor example, the freezing point of water is 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and 32&nbsp;\u00b0F, and a 5&nbsp;\u00b0C change is the same as a 9&nbsp;\u00b0F change. Thus, to convert from units of Fahrenheit to units of Celsius, one subtracts 32&nbsp;\u00b0F (the offset from the point of reference), divides by 9&nbsp;\u00b0F and multiplies by 5&nbsp;\u00b0C (scales by the ratio of units), and adds 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (the offset from the point of reference). Reversing this yields the formula for obtaining a quantity in units of Celsius from units of Fahrenheit; one could have started with the equivalence between 100&nbsp;\u00b0C and 212&nbsp;\u00b0F, though this would yield the same formula at the end.\n\nHence, to convert the numerical quantity value of a temperature ''T''[F] in degrees Fahrenheit to a numerical quantity value ''T''[C] in degrees Celsius, this formula may be used:\n\n:''T''[C] = (''T''[F] \u2212 32) \u00d7 5/9.\n\nTo convert ''T''[C] in degrees Celsius to ''T''[F] in degrees Fahrenheit, this formula may be used:\n\n:''T''[F] = (''T''[C] \u00d7 9/5) + 32.\n\n== Applications ==\nDimensional analysis is most often used in physics and chemistry \u2013 and in the mathematics thereof \u2013 but finds some applications outside of those fields as well.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nA simple application of dimensional analysis to mathematics is in computing the form of the [[N-sphere#Volume of the n-ball|volume of an ''n''-ball]] (the solid ball in ''n'' dimensions), or the area of its surface, the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]]: being an ''n''-dimensional figure, the volume scales as <math>x^n,</math> while the surface area, being <math>(n-1)</math>-dimensional, scales as <math>x^{n-1}.</math> Thus the volume of the ''n''-ball in terms of the radius is <math>C_nr^n,</math> for some constant <math>C_n.</math> Determining the constant takes more involved mathematics, but the form can be deduced and checked by dimensional analysis alone.\n\n=== Finance, economics, and accounting ===\nIn finance, economics, and accounting, dimensional analysis is most commonly referred to in terms of the [[Stock and flow|distinction between stocks and flows]]. More generally, dimensional analysis is used in interpreting various [[financial ratios]], economics ratios, and accounting ratios.\n* For example, the [[P/E ratio]] has dimensions of time (units of years), and can be interpreted as \"years of earnings to earn the price paid\".\n* In economics, [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] also has units of years (debt has units of currency, GDP has units of currency/year).\n* More surprisingly, [[bond duration]] also has units of years, which can be shown by dimensional analysis, but takes some financial intuition to understand.\n* [[Velocity of money]] has units of 1/years (GDP/money supply has units of currency/year over currency): how often a unit of currency circulates per year.\n* Interest rates are often expressed as a percentage, but more properly percent per annum, which has dimensions of 1/years.\n\n=== Fluid mechanics ===\nIn fluid mechanics, dimensional analysis is performed in order to obtain dimensionless Pi terms or groups. According to the principles of dimensional analysis, any prototype can be described by a series of these terms or groups that describe the behaviour of the system. Using suitable Pi terms or groups, it is possible to develop a similar set of Pi terms for a model that has the same dimensional relationships.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Waite |first1=Lee |last2=Fine |first2=Jerry |title=Applied Biofluid Mechanics |date=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-147217-3 |page=260 }}</ref> In other words, Pi terms provide a shortcut to developing a model representing a certain prototype.

This led to the conclusion that meaningful laws must be homogeneous equations in their various units of measurement, a result which was eventually formalized in the [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]]. However, the first application of dimensional analysis has been credited to the Italian scholar [[Fran\u00e7ois Daviet de Foncenex]] (1734\u20131799). It was published in 1761, 61 years before the publication of Fourier's work.<ref name=\"Martins 1981\"/>\n\n[[James Clerk Maxwell]] played a major role in establishing modern use of dimensional analysis by distinguishing mass, length, and time as fundamental units, while referring to other units as derived.<ref name=\"maxwell\">{{Citation |last=Roche |first=John J |title=The Mathematics of Measurement: A Critical History |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=203 |isbn=978-0-387-91581-4 |quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiQOqS-Q6EkC&lpg=PP1&dq=ISBN978-0387915814&pg=PA203#v=onepage&q&f=false Beginning apparently with Maxwell, mass, length and time began to be interpreted as having a privileged fundamental character and all other quantities as derivative, not merely with respect to measurement, but with respect to their physical status as well.]}}</ref> Although Maxwell defined length, time and mass to be \"the three fundamental units\", he also noted that gravitational mass can be derived from length and time by assuming a form of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] in which the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is taken as unity, thereby defining {{nowrap|1=M = L<sup>3</sup>T<sup>\u22122</sup>}}.<ref name=\"maxwell2\">{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism |year=1873 |page=4 }}</ref> By assuming a form of [[Coulomb's law]] in which [[Coulomb's constant]] ''k''<sub>e</sub> is taken as unity, Maxwell then determined that the dimensions of an electrostatic unit of charge were {{nowrap|1=Q = L<sup>3/2</sup>M<sup>1/2</sup>T<sup>\u22121</sup>}},<ref name=\"maxwell3\">{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism |year=1873 |page=45 }}</ref> which, after substituting his {{nowrap|1=M = L<sup>3</sup>T<sup>\u22122</sup>}} equation for mass, results in charge having the same dimensions as mass, viz. {{nowrap|1=Q = L<sup>3</sup>T<sup>\u22122</sup>}}.\n\nDimensional analysis is also used to derive relationships between the physical quantities that are involved in a particular phenomenon that one wishes to understand and characterize.  It was used for the first time {{harv|Pesic|2005}} in this way in 1872 by [[Lord Rayleigh]], who was trying to understand why the sky is blue.

Furthermore, and most importantly, it provides a method for computing these dimensionless parameters from the given variables.\n\nA dimensional equation can have the dimensions reduced or eliminated through [[nondimensionalization]], which begins with dimensional analysis, and involves scaling quantities by [[characteristic units]] of a system or [[natural units]] of nature. This gives insight into the fundamental properties of the system, as illustrated in the examples below.\n\n=== Definition ===\nThe dimension of a [[physical quantity]] can be expressed as a product of the basic physical dimensions such as [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]], each raised to a [[Rational number|rational]] [[Exponentiation|power]]. The ''dimension'' of a physical quantity is more fundamental than some ''scale'' [[units of measurement|unit]] used to express the amount of that physical quantity.  For example, ''mass'' is a dimension, while the [[kilogram]] is a particular scale unit chosen to express a quantity of mass. Except for [[natural units]], the choice of scale is cultural and arbitrary.\n\nThere are many possible choices of basic physical dimensions. The [[International System of Units|SI standard]] recommends the usage of the following dimensions and corresponding symbols: [[length]] (L), [[mass]] (M), [[time]] (T), [[electric current]] (I), [[absolute temperature]] (\u0398), [[amount of substance]] (N) and [[luminous intensity]] (J). The symbols are by convention usually written in [[roman type|roman]] [[sans serif]] typeface.<ref>{{cite web | title = SI Brochure (8th edition).

Other physical quantities could be defined as the base quantities, as long as they form a [[linearly independent]] [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. For instance, one could replace the dimension of [[electrical current]] (I) of the SI basis with a dimension of [[electric charge]] (Q), since Q = IT.\n\nAs examples, the dimension of the physical quantity [[speed]] ''v'' is\n:<math>\\text{dim}~v = \\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{\\mathsf{L}}{\\mathsf{T}} = \\mathsf{LT}^{-1}</math>\nand the dimension of the physical quantity [[force (physics)|force]] ''F'' is\n:<math>\\text{dim}~F = \\text{mass} \\times \\text{acceleration} = \\text{mass} \\times \\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{time}^2} = \\frac{\\mathsf{ML}}{\\mathsf{T}^2} = \\mathsf{MLT}^{-2}</math>\n\nThe unit chosen to express a physical quantity and its dimension are related, but not identical concepts. The units of a physical quantity are defined by convention and related to some standard; e.g., length may have units of metres, feet, inches, miles or micrometres; but any length always has a dimension of L, no matter what units of length are chosen to express it. Two different units of the same physical quantity have [[conversion of units|conversion factors]] that relate them. For example, 1&nbsp;[[inch|in]] = 2.54&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]; in this case (2.54&nbsp;cm/in) is the conversion factor, which is itself dimensionless. Therefore, multiplying by that conversion factor does not change the dimensions of a physical quantity.\n\nThere are also physicists that have cast doubt on the very existence of incompatible fundamental dimensions of physical quantity,<ref name=\"duff\">{{Citation |last1=Duff |first1=M.J. |last2=Okun |first2=L.B. |last3=Veneziano |first3=G. |title=Trialogue on the number of fundamental constants |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=03 |page=023 |date=September 2002 |doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2002/03/023 |arxiv=physics/0110060|bibcode = 2002JHEP...03..023D |issue=3 }}</ref> although this does not invalidate the usefulness of dimensional analysis.\n\n=== Mathematical properties ===\n{{Main article|Buckingham \u03c0 theorem}}\n\nThe dimensions that can be formed from a given collection of basic physical dimensions, such as M, L, and T, form an [[abelian group]]: The identity is written as 1; {{nowrap|1=L<sup>0</sup> = 1}}, and the inverse to L is 1/L or L<sup>\u22121</sup>. L raised to any rational power ''p'' is a member of the group, having an inverse of L<sup>\u2212''p''</sup> or 1/L<sup>p</sup>.  The operation of the group is multiplication, having the usual rules for handling exponents ({{nowrap|1=L<sup>''n''</sup> \u00d7 L<sup>''m''</sup> = L<sup>''n''+''m''</sup>}}).\n\nThis group can be described as a [[vector space]] over the rational numbers, with for example dimensional symbol M<sup>''i''</sup>L<sup>''j''</sup>T<sup>''k''</sup> corresponding to the vector {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'', ''k'')}}. When physical measured quantities (be they like-dimensioned or unlike-dimensioned) are multiplied or divided by one other, their dimensional units are likewise multiplied or divided; this corresponds to addition or subtraction in the vector space. When measurable quantities are raised to a rational power, the same is done to the dimensional symbols attached to those quantities; this corresponds to [[scalar multiplication]] in the vector space.\n\nA basis for such a vector space of dimensional symbols is called a set of [[Base quantity|base quantities]], and all other vectors are called derived units. As in any vector space, one may choose different [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]], which yields different systems of units (e.g., [[ampere#Proposed future definition|choosing]] whether the unit for charge is derived from the unit for current, or vice versa).\n\nThe group identity 1, the dimension of dimensionless quantities, corresponds to the origin in this vector space.\n\nThe set of units of the physical quantities involved in a problem correspond to a set of vectors (or a matrix). The [[Kernel (linear algebra)#nullity|nullity]] describes some number (e.g., ''m'') of ways in which these vectors can be combined to produce a zero vector. These correspond to producing (from the measurements) a number of dimensionless quantities, {\u03c0<sub>1</sub>, ..., \u03c0<sub>''m''</sub>}. (In fact these ways completely span the null subspace of another different space, of powers of the measurements.) Every possible way of multiplying (and [[Exponent (mathematics)|exponentiating]]) together the measured quantities to produce something with the same units as some derived quantity ''X'' can be expressed in the general form\n\n:<math>X = \\prod_{i=1}^m (\\pi_i)^{k_i}\\,.</math>\n\nConsequently, every possible [[dimensional analysis#Commensurability|commensurate]] equation for the physics of the system can be rewritten in the form\n\n:<math>f(\\pi_1,\\pi_2, ..., \\pi_m)=0\\,.</math>\n\nKnowing this restriction can be a powerful tool for obtaining new insight into the system.\n\n=== Mechanics ===\nThe dimension of physical quantities of interest in [[mechanics]] can be expressed in terms of base dimensions M, L, and T \u2013 these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is the one most commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (as some have done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a [[change of basis]]. The choice of the base set of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility and familiarity. The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must [[Linear span|span]] the space, and be [[linearly independent]].\n\nFor example, F, L, M form a set of fundamental dimensions because they form a basis that is equivalent to M, L, T: the former can be expressed as [F = ML/T<sup>2</sup>], L, M, while the latter can be expressed as M, L, [T = (ML/F)<sup>1/2</sup>].\n\nOn the other hand, length, velocity and time {{nowrap|(L, V, T)}} do not form a set of as base dimensions, for two reasons:\n* There is no way to obtain mass \u2013 or anything derived from it, such as force \u2013 without introducing another base dimension (thus, they do not ''span the space'').\n* Velocity, being expressible in terms of length and time (V = L/T), is redundant (the set is not ''linearly independent'').\n\n=== Other fields of physics and chemistry ===\nDepending on the field of physics, it may be advantageous to choose one or another extended set of dimensional symbols. In electromagnetism, for example, it may be useful to use dimensions of M, L, T, and Q, where Q represents the dimension of [[electric charge]].  In [[thermodynamics]], the base set of dimensions is often extended to include a dimension for temperature, \u0398.  In chemistry, the [[amount of substance]] (the number of molecules divided by the [[Avogadro constant]], \u2248 {{val|6.02|e=23|u=mol-1}}) is defined as a base dimension, N, as well.\nIn the interaction of [[relativistic plasma]] with strong laser pulses, a dimensionless [[relativistic similarity parameter]], connected with the symmetry properties of the collisionless [[Vlasov equation]], is constructed from the plasma-, electron- and critical-densities in addition to the electromagnetic vector potential. The choice of the dimensions or even the number of dimensions to be used in different fields of physics is to some extent arbitrary, but consistency in use and ease of communications are common and necessary features.\n\n=== Polynomials and transcendental functions ===\n[[Scalar (physics)|Scalar]] arguments to [[transcendental function]]s such as [[Exponential function|exponential]], [[Trigonometric function|trigonometric]] and [[logarithm]]ic functions, or to [[inhomogeneous polynomials]], must be [[dimensionless number|dimensionless quantities]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  (Note: this requirement is somewhat relaxed in Siano's orientational analysis described below, in which the square of certain dimensioned quantities are dimensionless.)\n\n<!--see discussion page/transcendental functions This requirement is clear when one observes the [[Taylor expansion]]s for these functions (a sum of various powers of the function argument). For example, the logarithm of 3&nbsp;kg is undefined even though the logarithm of&nbsp;3 is nearly&nbsp;0.477. An attempt to compute ln&nbsp;3&nbsp;kg would produce, if one naively took ln&nbsp;3&nbsp;kg to mean the dimensionally meaningless \"ln&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;kg)\",\n\n: <math>2\\,\\mathrm{kg} - \\frac{4\\,\\mathrm{kg}^2}{2} + \\cdots</math>\n\nwhich is dimensionally incompatible \u2013 the sum has no meaningful dimension \u2013 requiring the argument of transcendental functions to be dimensionless.\n\nAnother way to understand this problem is that the different coefficients ''scale'' differently under change of units \u2013 were one to reconsider this in grams as \"ln&nbsp;3000&nbsp;g\" instead of \"ln&nbsp;3&nbsp;kg\", one could compute ln&nbsp;3000, but in terms of the Taylor series, the degree 1 term would scale by 1000, the degree-2 term would scale by 1000<sup>2</sup>, and so forth \u2013 the overall output would not scale as a particular dimension.\n-->\nWhile most mathematical identities about dimensionless numbers translate in a straightforward manner to dimensional quantities, care must be taken with logarithms of ratios: the identity log(a/b) = log a \u2212 log b, where the logarithm is taken in any base, holds for dimensionless numbers a and b, but it does ''not'' hold if a and b are dimensional, because in this case the left-hand side is well-defined but the right-hand side is not.\n\nSimilarly, while one can evaluate [[monomials]] (''x''<sup>''n''</sup>) of dimensional quantities, one cannot evaluate polynomials of mixed degree with dimensionless coefficients on dimensional quantities: for ''x''<sup>2</sup>, the expression (3&nbsp;m)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;9&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> makes sense (as an area), while for ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'', the expression (3&nbsp;m)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;m&nbsp;=&nbsp;9&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;m does not make sense.\n\nHowever, polynomials of mixed degree can make sense if the coefficients are suitably chosen physical quantities that are not dimensionless.  For example,\n\n: <math> \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(-32\\frac{\\text{foot}}{\\text{second}^2}\\right) \\cdot t^2 + \\left(500\\frac{\\text{foot}}{\\text{second}}\\right) \\cdot t. </math>\n\nThis is the height to which an object rises in time&nbsp;''t'' if the acceleration of gravity is 32&nbsp;feet&nbsp;per&nbsp;second&nbsp;per&nbsp;second and the initial upward speed is 500&nbsp;feet&nbsp;per&nbsp;second.  It is not even necessary for ''t'' to be in ''seconds''.  For example, suppose ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.01&nbsp;minutes.  Then the first term would be\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n      &\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(-32\\frac{\\text{foot}}{\\text{second}^2}\\right) \\cdot (0.01 \\text{ minute})^2 \\\\[10pt]\n  ={} &\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot -32 \\cdot \\left(0.01^2\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\text{minute}}{\\text{second}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\text{foot} \\\\[10pt]\n  ={} &\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot -32 \\cdot \\left(0.01^2\\right) \\cdot 60^2 \\cdot \\text{foot}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Incorporating units ===\nThe value of a dimensional physical quantity ''Z'' is written as the product of a [[Units of measurement|unit]] [''Z''] within the dimension and a dimensionless numerical factor, ''n''.<ref name=Pisanty13>For a review of the different conventions in use see: {{cite web |url=http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/77690 |title=Square bracket notation for dimensions and units: usage and conventions |last1=Pisanty |first1= E|date=2013-09-17 |website=Physics Stack Exchange  |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>\n\n:<math>Z = n \\times [Z] = n [Z]</math>\n\nWhen like-dimensioned quantities are added or subtracted or compared, it is convenient to express them in consistent units so that the numerical values of these quantities may be directly added or subtracted. But, in concept, there is no problem adding quantities of the same dimension expressed in different units. For example, 1 meter added to 1 foot is a length, but one cannot derive that length by simply adding 1 and 1. A [[Conversion of units|conversion factor]], which is a ratio of like-dimensioned quantities and is equal to the dimensionless unity, is needed:\n\n:<math> 1 \\ \\mbox{ft} = 0.3048 \\ \\mbox{m} \\ </math>  is identical to <math> 1 = \\frac{0.3048 \\ \\mbox{m}}{1 \\ \\mbox{ft}}.\\ </math>\n\nThe factor <math> 0.3048 \\ \\frac{\\mbox{m}}{\\mbox{ft}} </math> is identical to the dimensionless 1, so multiplying by this conversion factor changes nothing. Then when adding two quantities of like dimension, but expressed in different units, the appropriate conversion factor, which is essentially the dimensionless 1, is used to convert the quantities to identical units so that their numerical values can be added or subtracted.\n\nOnly in this manner is it meaningful to speak of adding like-dimensioned quantities of differing units.\n\n=== Position vs displacement ===\n{{Main article|Affine space}}\nSome discussions of dimensional analysis implicitly describe all quantities as mathematical vectors. (In mathematics scalars are considered a special case of vectors{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}; vectors can be added to or subtracted from other vectors, and, inter alia, multiplied or divided by scalars. If a vector is used to define a position, this assumes an implicit point of reference: an [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. While this is useful and often perfectly adequate, allowing many important errors to be caught, it can fail to model certain aspects of physics. A more rigorous approach requires distinguishing between position and displacement (or moment in time versus duration, or absolute temperature versus temperature change).\n\nConsider points on a line, each with a position with respect to a given origin, and distances among them. Positions and displacements all have units of length, but their meaning is not interchangeable:\n* adding two displacements should yield a new displacement (walking ten paces then twenty paces gets you thirty paces forward),\n* adding a displacement to a position should yield a new position (walking one block down the street from an intersection gets you to the next intersection),\n* subtracting two positions should yield a displacement,\n* but one may ''not'' add two positions.\nThis illustrates the subtle distinction between ''affine'' quantities (ones modeled by an [[affine space]], such as position) and ''vector'' quantities (ones modeled by a [[vector space]], such as displacement).\n* Vector quantities may be added to each other, yielding a new vector quantity, and a vector quantity may be added to a suitable affine quantity (a vector space ''[[group action|acts on]]'' an affine space), yielding a new affine quantity.\n* Affine quantities cannot be added, but may be subtracted, yielding ''relative'' quantities which are vectors, and these ''relative differences'' may then be added to each other or to an affine quantity.\n\nProperly then, positions have dimension of ''affine'' length, while displacements have dimension of ''vector'' length. To assign a number to an ''affine'' unit, one must not only choose a unit of measurement, but also a [[Origin (mathematics)|point of reference]], while to assign a number to a ''vector'' unit only requires a unit of measurement.\n\nThus some physical quantities are better modeled by vectorial quantities while others tend to require affine representation, and the distinction is reflected in their dimensional analysis.\n\nThis distinction is particularly important in the case of temperature, for which the numeric value of [[absolute zero]] is not the origin 0 in some scales. For absolute zero,\n: 0 K = \u2212273.15 \u00b0C = \u2212459.67 \u00b0F = 0 \u00b0R,\nbut for temperature differences,\n: 1 K = 1 \u00b0C \u2260 1 \u00b0F = 1 \u00b0R.\n(Here \u00b0R refers to the [[Rankine scale]], not the [[R\u00e9aumur scale]]).\nUnit conversion for temperature differences is simply a matter of multiplying by, e.g., 1&nbsp;\u00b0F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to \u2212272.15&nbsp;\u00b0C, or the temperature difference equal to 1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n=== Orientation and frame of reference ===\nSimilar to the issue of a point of reference is the issue of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a ''direction''. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a [[frame of reference]].\n\nThis leads to the [[#Extensions|extensions]] discussed below, namely Huntley's directed dimensions and Siano's orientational analysis.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== A simple example: period of a harmonic oscillator ===\nWhat is the period of [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillation]] {{mvar|T}} of a mass {{mvar|m}} attached to an ideal linear spring with spring constant {{mvar|k}} suspended in gravity of strength {{mvar|g}}? That period is the solution for {{mvar|T}} of some dimensionless equation in the variables {{mvar|T}}, {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|k}}, and {{mvar|g}}.\nThe four quantities have the following dimensions:  {{mvar|T}}  [T];  {{mvar|m}}  [M]; {{mvar|k}} [M/T<sup>2</sup>]; and  {{mvar|g}} [L/T<sup>2</sup>]. From these we can form only one dimensionless product of powers of our chosen variables, <math>G_1</math> = <math>T^2 k/m</math> {{nowrap|1=[T<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 M/T<sup>2</sup> / M = 1]}}, and putting <math>G_1 = C</math> for some dimensionless constant {{mvar|C}} gives the dimensionless equation sought.  The dimensionless product of powers of variables is sometimes referred to as a dimensionless group of variables; here the term \"group\" means \"collection\" rather than mathematical [[Group (mathematics)|group]].  They are often called [[dimensionless number]]s as well.\n\nNote that the variable {{mvar|g}} does not occur in the group. It is easy to see that it is impossible to form a dimensionless product of powers that combines {{mvar|g}} with {{mvar|k}}, {{mvar|m}}, and {{mvar|T}}, because {{mvar|g}} is the only quantity that involves the dimension L. This implies that in this problem the {{mvar|g}} is irrelevant. Dimensional analysis can sometimes yield strong statements about the ''irrelevance'' of some quantities in a problem, or the need for additional parameters. If we have chosen enough variables to properly describe the problem, then from this argument we can conclude that the period of the mass on the spring is independent of {{mvar|g}}: it is the same on the earth or the moon. The equation demonstrating the existence of a product of powers for our problem can be written in an entirely equivalent way:  <math>T = \\kappa \\sqrt\\tfrac{m}{k}</math>, for some dimensionless constant \u03ba (equal to <math>\\sqrt{C}</math> from the original dimensionless equation).\n\nWhen faced with a case where dimensional analysis rejects a variable ({{mvar|g}}, here) that one intuitively expects to belong in a physical description of the situation, another possibility is that the rejected variable is in fact relevant, but that some other relevant variable has been omitted, which might combine with the rejected variable to form a dimensionless quantity. That is, however, not the case here.\n\nWhen dimensional analysis yields only one dimensionless group, as here, there are no unknown functions, and the solution is said to be \"complete\" \u2013 although it still may involve unknown dimensionless constants, such as {{mvar|\u03ba}}.\n\n=== A more complex example: energy of a vibrating wire ===\nConsider the case of a vibrating wire of [[length]] ''\u2113'' (L) vibrating with an [[amplitude]] ''A'' (L).  The wire has a [[linear density]] ''\u03c1'' (M/L) and is under [[Tension (physics)|tension]] ''s'' (ML/T<sup>2</sup>), and we want to know the [[energy]] ''E'' (ML<sup>2</sup>/T<sup>2</sup>) in the wire.  Let ''\u03c0''<sub>1</sub> and ''\u03c0''<sub>2</sub> be two dimensionless products of [[Power (mathematics)|powers]] of the variables chosen, given by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\pi_1 &= \\frac{E}{As} \\\\\n  \\pi_2 &= \\frac{\\ell}{A}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe linear density of the wire is not involved. The two groups found can be combined into an equivalent form as an equation\n:<math>F\\left(\\frac{E}{As}, \\frac{\\ell}{A}\\right) = 0 ,</math>\n\nwhere ''F'' is some unknown function, or, equivalently as\n:<math>E = As f\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{A}\\right) ,</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is some other unknown function.  Here the unknown function implies that our solution is now incomplete, but dimensional analysis has given us something that may not have been obvious: the energy is proportional to the first power of the tension.  Barring further analytical analysis, we might proceed to experiments to discover the form for the unknown function ''f''.  But our experiments are simpler than in the absence of dimensional analysis.  We'd perform none to verify that the energy is proportional to the tension.  Or perhaps we might guess that the energy is proportional to ''\u2113'', and so infer that {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''\u2113s''}}.  The power of dimensional analysis as an aid to experiment and forming hypotheses becomes evident.\n\nThe power of dimensional analysis really becomes apparent when it is applied to situations, unlike those given above, that are more complicated, the set of variables involved are not apparent, and the underlying equations hopelessly complex.  Consider, for example, a small pebble sitting on the bed of a river.  If the river flows fast enough, it will actually raise the pebble and cause it to flow along with the water.  At what critical velocity will this occur?  Sorting out the guessed variables is not so easy as before.  But dimensional analysis can be a powerful aid in understanding problems like this, and is usually the very first tool to be applied to complex problems where the underlying equations and constraints are poorly understood. In such cases, the answer may depend on a [[dimensionless number]] such as the [[Reynolds number]], which may be interpreted by dimensional analysis.\n\n=== A third example: demand versus capacity for a rotating disc ===\nConsider the case of a thin, solid, parallel-sided rotating disc of axial thickness ''t'' (L) and radius ''R'' (L).  The disc has a density ''\u03c1'' (M/L<sup>3</sup>), rotates at an angular velocity ''\u03c9'' (T<sup>\u22121</sup>) and this leads to a stress ''S'' (ML<sup>\u22121</sup>T<sup>\u22122</sup>) in the material.  There is a theoretical linear elastic solution, given by Lame, to this problem when the disc is thin relative to its radius, the faces of the disc are free to move axially, and the plane stress constitutive relations can be assumed to be valid.  As the disc becomes thicker relative to the radius then the plane stress solution breaks down.  If the disc is restrained axially on its free faces then a state of plane strain will occur.  However, if this is not the case then the state of stress may only be determined though consideration of three-dimensional elasticity and there is no known theoretical solution for this case.  An engineer might, therefore, be interested in establishing a relationship between the five variables.  Dimensional analysis for this case leads to the following (5&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;2) non-dimensional groups:\n\n: demand/capacity = ''\u03c1R''<sup>2</sup>''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>/''S''\n: thickness/radius or aspect ratio = ''t''/''R''\n\n[[File:Dimensional analysis 01.jpg|thumb|Dimensional analysis and numerical experiments for a rotating disc]]\n\nThrough the use of numerical experiments using, for example, the finite element method, the nature of the relationship between the two non-dimensional groups can be obtained as shown in the figure.  As this problem only involves two non-dimensional groups, the complete picture is provided in a single plot and this can be used as a design/assessment chart for rotating discs<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ramsay|first1=Angus|title=Dimensional Analysis and Numerical Experiments for a Rotating Disc|url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/knowledge-base/technical-notes/dimensional-analysis--numerical-experiments-for-a-rotating-disc/|website=Ramsay Maunder Associates|accessdate=15 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\n\n=== Huntley's extension: directed dimensions ===\nHuntley {{harv|Huntley|1967}} has pointed out that it is sometimes productive to refine our concept of dimension. Two possible refinements are:\n* The magnitude of the components of a vector are to be considered dimensionally distinct. For example, rather than an undifferentiated length dimension L, we may have L<sub>{{mvar|x}}</sub> represent dimension in the x-direction, and so forth. This requirement stems ultimately from the requirement that each component of a physically meaningful equation (scalar, vector, or tensor) must be dimensionally consistent.\n* Mass as a measure of quantity is to be considered dimensionally distinct from mass as a measure of inertia.\n\nAs an example of the usefulness of the first refinement, suppose we wish to calculate the [[trajectory#Range and height|distance a cannonball travels]] when fired with a vertical velocity component <math>V_\\mathrm{y}</math> and a horizontal velocity component <math>V_\\mathrm{x}</math>, assuming it is fired on a flat surface. Assuming no use of directed lengths, the quantities of interest are then <math>V_\\mathrm{x}</math>, <math>V_\\mathrm{y}</math>, both dimensioned as LT<sup>\u22121</sup>, {{mvar|R}}, the distance travelled, having dimension L, and {{mvar|g}} the downward acceleration of gravity, with dimension LT<sup>\u22122</sup>.\n\nWith these four quantities, we may conclude that the equation for the range {{mvar|R}} may be written:\n\n:<math>R \\propto V_\\text{x}^a\\,V_\\text{y}^b\\,g^c.\\,</math>\n\nOr dimensionally\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{L} = \\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{L}}{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)^{a+b} \\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{L}}{\\mathsf{T}^2}\\right)^c\\,</math>\n\nfrom which we may deduce that <math>a + b + c = 1</math> and <math>a + b + 2c = 0</math>, which leaves one exponent undetermined. This is to be expected since we have two fundamental dimensions L and T, and four parameters, with one equation.\n\nIf, however, we use directed length dimensions, then <math>V_\\mathrm{x}</math> will be dimensioned as L<sub>{{math|x}}</sub>T<sup>\u22121</sup>, <math>V_\\mathrm{y}</math> as L<sub>{{math|y}}</sub>T<sup>\u22121</sup>, {{mvar|R}} as L<sub>{{math|x}}</sub> and {{mvar|g}} as L<sub>{{math|y}}</sub>T<sup>\u22122</sup>. The dimensional equation becomes:\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathsf{L}_\\mathrm{x} =\n    \\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{L}_\\mathrm{x}}{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)^a\n    \\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{L}_\\mathrm{y}}{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)^b \n    \\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{L}_\\mathrm{y}}{\\mathsf{T}^2}\\right)^c\n</math>\n\nand we may solve completely as <math>a = 1</math>, <math>b = 1</math> and <math>c = -1</math>. The increase in deductive power gained by the use of directed length dimensions is apparent.\n\nIn a similar manner, it is sometimes found useful (e.g., in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics) to distinguish between mass as a measure of inertia (inertial mass), and mass as a measure of quantity (substantial mass). For example, consider the derivation of [[Poiseuille's Law]]. We wish to find the rate of mass flow of a viscous fluid through a circular pipe. Without drawing distinctions between inertial and substantial mass we may choose as the relevant variables\n* <math>\\dot{m}</math> the mass flow rate with dimension MT<sup>\u22121</sup>\n* <math>p_\\text{x}</math> the pressure gradient along the pipe with dimension ML<sup>\u22122</sup>T<sup>\u22122</sup>\n* {{mvar|&rho;}} the density with dimension ML<sup>\u22123</sup>\n* {{mvar|&eta;}} the dynamic fluid viscosity with dimension ML<sup>\u22121</sup>T<sup>\u22121</sup>\n* {{mvar|r}} the radius of the pipe with dimension L\n\nThere are three fundamental variables so the above five equations will yield two dimensionless variables which we may take to be <math>\\pi_1 = \\dot{m}/\\eta r</math> and <math>\\pi_2 = p_\\mathrm{x}\\rho r^5/\\dot{m}^2</math> and we may express the dimensional equation as\n\n:<math>C = \\pi_1\\pi_2^a = \\left(\\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\eta r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{p_\\mathrm{x}\\rho r^5}{\\dot{m}^2}\\right)^a</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|C}} and {{mvar|a}} are undetermined constants. If we draw a distinction between inertial mass with dimension <math>M_\\text{i}</math> and substantial mass with dimension <math>M_\\text{s}</math>, then mass flow rate and density will use substantial mass as the mass parameter, while the pressure gradient and coefficient of viscosity will use inertial mass. We now have four fundamental parameters, and one dimensionless constant, so that the dimensional equation may be written:\n\n:<math>C = \\frac{p_\\mathrm{x}\\rho r^4}{\\eta \\dot{m}}</math>\n\nwhere now only {{mvar|C}} is an undetermined constant (found to be equal to <math>\\pi/8</math> by methods outside of dimensional analysis). This equation may be solved for the mass flow rate to yield [[Poiseuille's law]].\n\n=== Siano's extension: orientational analysis ===\n\nHuntley's extension has some serious drawbacks:\n\n* It does not deal well with vector equations involving the ''[[cross product]],''\n* nor does it handle well the use of ''angles'' as physical variables.\n\nIt also is often quite difficult to assign the L, L<sub>{{math|x}}</sub>, L<sub>{{math|y}}</sub>, L<sub>{{math|z}}</sub>, symbols to the physical variables involved in the problem of interest. He invokes a procedure that involves the \"symmetry\" of the physical problem. This is often very difficult to apply reliably: It is unclear as to what parts of the problem that the notion of \"symmetry\" is being invoked. Is it the symmetry of the physical body that forces are acting upon, or to the points, lines or areas at which forces are being applied? What if more than one body is involved with different symmetries?\n\nConsider the spherical bubble attached to a cylindrical tube, where one wants the flow rate of air as a function of the pressure difference in the two parts. What are the Huntley extended dimensions of the viscosity of the air contained in the connected parts? What are the extended dimensions of the pressure of the two parts? Are they the same or different? These difficulties are responsible for the limited application of Huntley's addition to real problems.\n\nAngles are, by convention, considered to be dimensionless variables, and so the use of angles as physical variables in dimensional analysis can give less meaningful results. As an example, consider the projectile problem mentioned above. Suppose that, instead of the x-  and y-components of the initial velocity, we had chosen the magnitude of the velocity {{mvar|v}} and the angle {{mvar|\u03b8}} at which the projectile was fired. The angle is, by convention, considered to be dimensionless, and the magnitude of a vector has no directional quality, so that no dimensionless variable can be composed of the four variables {{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|v}}, {{mvar|R}}, and {{mvar|\u03b8}}. Conventional analysis will correctly give the powers of {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|v}}, but will give no information concerning the dimensionless angle {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n\n{{harvs|txt=yes|last=Siano|year1=1985-I|year2=1985-II}} has suggested that the directed dimensions of Huntley be replaced by using ''orientational symbols'' {{math|1<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;1<sub>y</sub>&nbsp;1<sub>z</sub>}} to denote vector directions, and an orientationless symbol 1<sub>0</sub>. Thus, Huntley's L<sub>{{math|x}}</sub> becomes L&thinsp;1<sub>{{math|x}}</sub> with L specifying the dimension of length, and {{math|1<sub>x</sub>}} specifying the orientation. Siano further shows that the orientational symbols have an algebra of their own.  Along with the requirement that {{math|1=1<sub>''i''</sub><sup>\u22121</sup> = 1<sub>''i''</sub>}}, the following multiplication table for the orientation symbols results:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n                         & \\mathbf{1_0}\n                                       & \\mathbf{1_\\text{x}}\n                                                    & \\mathbf{1_\\text{y}}\n                                                                 & \\mathbf{1_\\text{z}} \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\mathbf{1_0}        &  1_0        & 1_\\text{x} & 1_\\text{y} & 1_\\text{z}          \\\\\n     \\mathbf{1_\\text{x}} &  1_\\text{x} & 1_0        & 1_\\text{z} & 1_\\text{y}          \\\\\n     \\mathbf{1_\\text{y}} &  1_\\text{y} & 1_\\text{z} & 1_0        & 1_\\text{x}          \\\\\n     \\mathbf{1_\\text{z}} &  1_\\text{z} & 1_\\text{y} & 1_\\text{x} & 1_0\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nNote that the orientational symbols form a group (the [[Klein four-group]] or \"Viergruppe\"). In this system, scalars always have the same orientation as the identity element, independent of the \"symmetry of the problem\".  Physical quantities that are vectors have the orientation expected:  a force or a velocity in the z-direction has the orientation of {{math|1<sub>z</sub>}}.  For angles, consider an angle {{mvar|\u03b8}} that lies in the z-plane.  Form a right triangle in the z-plane with {{mvar|\u03b8}} being one of the acute angles.  The side of the right triangle adjacent to the angle then has an orientation {{math|1<sub>x</sub>}} and the side opposite has an orientation {{math|1<sub>y</sub>}}.  Then, since {{math|1=tan(''\u03b8'') = 1<sub>y</sub>/1<sub>x</sub> = ''\u03b8''&nbsp;+&nbsp;...}} we conclude that an angle in the xy-plane must have an orientation {{math|1=1<sub>y</sub>/1<sub>x</sub> = 1<sub>z</sub>}}, which is not unreasonable.  Analogous reasoning forces the conclusion that {{math|1=sin(''\u03b8'')}} has orientation {{math|1<sub>z</sub>}} while {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} has orientation 1<sub>0</sub>.  These are different, so one concludes (correctly), for example, that there are no solutions of physical equations that are of the form {{math|''a'' cos(''\u03b8'') + ''b'' sin(''\u03b8'')}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real scalars. Note that an expression such as <math>\\sin(\\theta+\\pi/2)=\\cos(\\theta)</math> is not dimensionally inconsistent since it is a special case of the sum of angles formula and should properly be written:\n\n:<math>\n  \\sin\\left(a\\,1_\\text{z} + b\\,1_\\text{z}\\right) =\n    \\sin\\left(a\\,1_\\text{z}) \\cos(b\\,1_\\text{z}\\right) +\n    \\sin\\left(b\\,1_\\text{z}) \\cos(a\\,1_\\text{z}\\right),\n</math>\n\nwhich for <math>a = \\theta</math> and <math>b = \\pi/2</math> yields <math>\\sin(\\theta\\,1_\\text{z} + [\\pi/2]\\,1_\\text{z}) = 1_\\text{z}\\cos(\\theta\\,1_\\text{z})</math>. Physical quantities may be expressed as complex numbers (e.g. <math>e^{i\\theta}</math>) which imply that the complex quantity {{mvar|i}} has an orientation equal to that of the angle it is associated with ({{math|1<sub>z</sub>}} in the above example).\n\nThe assignment of orientational symbols to physical quantities and the requirement that physical equations be orientationally homogeneous can actually be used in a way that is similar to dimensional analysis to derive a little more information about acceptable solutions of physical problems.  In this approach one sets up the dimensional equation and solves it as far as one can.  If the lowest power of a physical variable is fractional, both sides of the solution is raised to a power such that all powers are integral.  This puts it into \"normal form\".  The orientational equation is then solved to give a more restrictive condition on the unknown powers of the orientational symbols, arriving at a solution that is more complete than the one that dimensional analysis alone gives. Often the added information is that one of the powers of a certain variable is even or odd.\n\nAs an example, for the projectile problem, using orientational symbols, \u03b8, being in the xy-plane will thus have dimension {{math|1<sub>z</sub>}} and the range of the projectile {{mvar|R}} will be of the form:\n\n:<math>R = g^a\\,v^b\\,\\theta^c\\text{ which means }\\mathsf{L}\\,1_\\mathrm{x} \\sim\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{L}\\,1_\\text{y}}{\\mathsf{T}^2}\\right)^a \\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{L}}{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)^b\\,1_\\mathsf{z}^c.\\,</math>\n\nDimensional homogeneity will now correctly yield {{math|1=''a'' = \u22121}} and {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}, and orientational homogeneity requires that {{mvar|c}} be an odd integer. In fact the required function of theta will be {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')cos(''\u03b8'')}} which is a series of odd powers of {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n\nIt is seen that the Taylor series of {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} are orientationally homogeneous using the above multiplication table, while expressions like {{math|cos(''\u03b8'') + sin(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|exp(''\u03b8'')}} are not, and are (correctly) deemed unphysical.\n\nIt should be clear that the multiplication rule used for the orientational symbols is not the same as that for the cross product of two vectors.  The cross product of two identical vectors is zero, while the product of two identical orientational symbols is the identity element.\n\n== Dimensionless concepts ==\n\n=== Constants ===\n{{Main article|Dimensionless quantity}}\nThe dimensionless constants that arise in the results obtained, such as the C in the Poiseuille's Law problem and the <math>\\kappa</math> in the spring problems discussed above, come from a more detailed analysis of the underlying physics and often arise from integrating some differential equation.  Dimensional analysis itself has little to say about these constants, but it is useful to know that they very often have a magnitude of order unity.  This observation can allow one to sometimes make \"[[back of the envelope]]\" calculations about the phenomenon of interest, and therefore be able to more efficiently design experiments to measure it, or to judge whether it is important, etc.\n\n=== Formalisms ===\nParadoxically, dimensional analysis can be a useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the [[Ising model]] can be used to study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. As we approach the critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, <math>\\xi</math> ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on \"dimensional grounds\" that the non-analytical part of the free energy per lattice site should be <math>\\sim 1/\\xi^{d}</math> where <math>d</math> is the dimension of the lattice.\n\nIt has been argued by some physicists, e.g., [[Michael Duff (physicist)|M. J. Duff]],<ref name=\"duff\"/><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Duff |first=M.J. |eprint=hep-th/0208093v3 |title=Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants |version= |date=July 2004}}</ref> that the laws of physics are inherently dimensionless. The fact that we have assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, there was no way to relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: ''[[Speed of light|c]]'', ''[[Planck constant|\u0127]]'', and ''[[Gravitational constant|G]]'', in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere conversion factors to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.\n\nJust as in the case of critical properties of lattice models, one can recover the results of dimensional analysis in the appropriate scaling limit; e.g., dimensional analysis in mechanics can be derived by reinserting the constants ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''G'' (but we can now consider them to be dimensionless) and demanding that a nonsingular relation between quantities exists in the limit <math>c\\rightarrow \\infty</math>,  <math>\\hbar\\rightarrow 0</math> and <math>G\\rightarrow  0</math>. In problems involving a gravitational field the latter limit should be taken such that the field stays finite.\n\n== Dimensional equivalences ==\nFollowing are tables of commonly occurring expressions in physics, related to the dimensions of energy, momentum, and force.<ref>{{citation |last=Woan |first=G. |title=The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-57507-2 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Mosca |first=Gene |last2=Tipler |first2=Paul Allen |title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers \u2013 with Modern Physics |publisher=W.

It is an innovative advance that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since [[color television]] in the 1950s.<ref>Kruger, L. G. (2001).

A switchover from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation. Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world; below are the more widely used standards:\n* Digital Video Broadcasting ([[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]) uses coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ([[OFDM]]) modulation and supports hierarchical transmission. This standard has been adopted in Europe, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.\n* Advanced Television System Committee ([[ATSC]]) uses eight-level vestigial sideband ([[8VSB]]) for terrestrial broadcasting. This standard has been adopted by six countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Dominican Republic and Honduras.\n* Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ([[ISDB]]) is a system designed to provide good reception to fixed receivers and also portable or mobile receivers. It utilizes [[OFDM]] and two-dimensional interleaving. It supports hierarchical transmission of up to three layers and uses [[MPEG-2 video]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding]]. This standard has been adopted in Japan and the Philippines. [[ISDB-T International]] is an adaptation of this standard using [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] that been adopted in most of South America and is also being embraced by Portuguese-speaking African countries.\n* Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting ([[DTMB]]) adopts time-domain synchronous (TDS) OFDM technology with a pseudo-random signal frame to serve as the guard interval (GI) of the OFDM block and the training symbol. The DTMB standard has been adopted in the People's Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau.<ref>Ong, C. Y., Song, J., Pan, C., & Li, Y.(2010, May).

It wasn't until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility.<ref name=\"benton\">{{cite web |url= http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1 |title= The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television |publisher= [[Benton Foundation]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, as Japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with the development of [[HDTV]] technology, and as the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format was proposed by Japan's public broadcaster [[NHK]] as a worldwide standard, Japanese advancements were seen as pacesetters that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard\u2014based on an analog system\u2014was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, [[General Instrument]], demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.\n\nIn March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced [[analog signal]], but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images. Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \"[[simulcast]]\" on different channels. The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.<ref name=\"benton\" />\n\nThe final standard adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes\u2014interlaced or progressive\u2014is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format.<ref name=\"benton\" />\n\n=== Inaugural launches ===\n[[DirecTV]] in the U.S. launched the first commercial digital [[satellite television|satellite]] platform in May 1994, using the [[Digital Satellite System]] (DSS) standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/u-s-satellite-broadcasting-company-inc-history/|title=History of U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc. \u2013 FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu.indystar.com/story/money/2015/09/04/business-insider-digital-satellite-tv-indy-roots/71611606/|title=Business Insider: Digital satellite TV has Indy roots|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> [[Digital cable]] broadcasts were tested and launched in the U.S. in 1996 by [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]] and [[Time Warner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1997/12/17/technology/nextlevel/|title=NextLevel signs cable deal - Dec. 17, 1997|website=money.cnn.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1996/08/15/companies/tci_pkg/|title=TCI faces big challenges - Aug. 15, 1996|website=money.cnn.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> The first [[digital terrestrial]] platform was launched in November 1998 as [[ONdigital]] in the United Kingdom, using the [[DVB-T]] standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onhistory.co.uk/timeline/1998/11/10/canal-technologies-and-worlds-first-digital-terres|title=CANAL+ TECHNOLOGIES and the world's first digital terrestrial television service in the United Kingdom|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Technical information ==\n\n=== Formats and bandwidth ===\n[[File:Digital & Analog TV screen quality comparison-1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Comparison of image quality between [[ISDB-T]] (top) and [[NTSC]] (bottom)]]\nDigital television supports many different picture formats defined by the [[broadcast television system]]s which are a combination of size and [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] (width to height ratio).\n\nWith [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) broadcasting, the range of formats can be broadly divided into two categories: [[high definition television]] (HDTV) for the transmission of [[high-definition video]] and [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV). These terms by themselves are not very precise, and many subtle intermediate cases exist.\n\nOne of several different HDTV formats that can be transmitted over DTV is: 1280&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;720 [[pixel]]s in [[progressive scan]] mode (abbreviated ''[[720p]]'') or 1920&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1080 pixels in [[interlaced video]] mode (''[[1080i]]''). Each of these uses a [[16:9]] aspect ratio. HDTV cannot be transmitted over analog [[television channel]]s because of [[channel capacity]] issues.\n\nSDTV, by comparison, may use one of several different formats taking the form of various aspect ratios depending on the technology used in the country of broadcast. In terms of rectangular pixels, [[NTSC]] countries can deliver a 640&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;480 resolution in 4:3 and 854&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;480 in [[16:9]], while [[PAL]] can give 768&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;576 in [[4:3]] and 1024&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;576 in [[16:9]]. However, broadcasters may choose to reduce these resolutions to reduce [[bit rate]] (e.g., many DVB-T channels in the United Kingdom use a horizontal resolution of 544 or 704 pixels per line).<ref>[http://dtt.me.uk Latest snapshots - Freeview/DTT bitrates] (Mendip transmitter, UK)</ref>\n\nEach [[commercial broadcasting]] [[terrestrial television]] DTV channel in North America is permitted to be broadcast at a bit rate up to 19 [[megabit]]s per second. However, the broadcaster does not need to use this entire bandwidth for just one broadcast channel. Instead the broadcast can use the channel to include [[PSIP]] and can also subdivide across several video [[subchannel]]s (a.k.a. feeds) of varying quality and compression rates, including non-video [[datacasting]] services that allow one-way high-bit-rate streaming of data to computers like [[National Datacast]].\n\nA broadcaster may opt to use a standard-definition (SDTV) digital signal instead of an [[HDTV]] signal, because current convention allows the bandwidth of a DTV channel (or \"[[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]]\") to be subdivided into multiple [[digital subchannel]]s, (similar to what most FM [[radio station]]s offer with [[HD Radio]]), providing multiple feeds of entirely different [[television program]]ming on the same channel. This ability to provide either a single HDTV feed or multiple lower-resolution feeds is often referred to as distributing one's \"[[bit budget]]\" or [[multicasting]]. This can sometimes be arranged automatically, using a [[statistical multiplexer]] (or \"stat-mux\"). With some implementations, image resolution may be less directly limited by bandwidth; for example in [[DVB-T]], broadcasters can choose from several different modulation schemes, giving them the option to reduce the transmission [[bit rate]] and make reception easier for more distant or mobile viewers.\n\n=== Receiving digital signal ===\nThere are several different ways to receive digital television. One of the oldest means of receiving DTV (and TV in general) is from terrestrial transmitters using an [[Television antenna|antenna]] (known as an ''aerial'' in some countries). This way is known as [[Digital terrestrial television]] (DTT). With DTT, viewers are limited to channels that have a terrestrial transmitter in range of their antenna.\n\nOther ways have been devised to receive digital television. Among the most familiar to people are [[digital cable]] and [[digital satellite]]. In some countries where transmissions of TV signals are normally achieved by [[microwaves]], digital [[MMDS]] is used. Other standards, such as [[Digital multimedia broadcasting]] (DMB) and [[DVB-H]], have been devised to allow handheld devices such as [[mobile phones]] to receive TV signals. Another way is [[IPTV]], that is receiving TV via Internet Protocol, relying on [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) or optical cable line. Finally, an alternative way is to receive digital TV signals via the open Internet ([[Internet television]]), whether from a central streaming service or a P2P (peer-to-peer) system.\n\nSome signals carry [[encryption]] and specify use conditions (such as \"may not be recorded\" or \"may not be viewed on displays larger than 1 m in diagonal measure\") backed up with the force of law under the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty ([[WIPO Copyright Treaty]]) and national [[legislation]] implementing it, such as the U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Access to encrypted channels can be controlled by a removable [[smart card]], for example via the Common Interface ([[DVB-CI]]) standard for Europe and via [[Point Of Deployment]] (POD) for IS or named differently [[CableCard]].\n\n=== Protection parameters for terrestrial DTV broadcasting ===\n{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}\nDigital television signals must not interfere with each other, and they must also coexist with analog television until it is phased out.\nThe following table gives allowable signal-to-noise and signal-to-interference ratios for various interference scenarios. This table is a crucial regulatory tool for controlling the placement and power levels of stations. Digital TV is more tolerant of interference than analog TV, and this is the reason a smaller range of channels can carry an all-digital set of television stations.{{Citation needed|reason=As far as I know, it's the data compression possible with digital that makes higher channel density possible.|date=September 2011}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One can, for example, browse the [[electronic program guide]].  Modern DTV systems sometimes use a return path providing feedback from the end user to the broadcaster.  This is possible with a coaxial or fiber optic cable, a dialup modem, or Internet connection but is not possible with a standard antenna.\n\nSome of these systems support [[video on demand]] using a [[communication channel]] localized to a neighborhood rather than a city (terrestrial) or an even larger area (satellite).\n\n=== 1-segment broadcasting ===\n{{main article|1seg}}\n[[1seg]] (1-segment) is a special form of [[ISDB]]. Each channel is further divided into 13 segments. The 12 segments of them are allocated for [[HDTV]] and remaining segment, the 13th, is used for narrow-band receivers such as mobile television or [[cell phone]].\n\n== Timeline of transition ==\n{{Further information|Digital television transition}}\n\n== Comparison of analog vs digital ==\n{{See also|Analog television}}\n\nDTV has several advantages over analog TV, the most significant being that digital channels take up less bandwidth, and the bandwidth needs are continuously variable, at a corresponding reduction in image quality depending on the level of compression as well as the resolution of the transmitted image. This means that digital broadcasters can provide more digital channels in the same space, provide [[high-definition television]] service, or provide other non-television services such as multimedia or interactivity. DTV also permits special services such as multiplexing (more than one program on the same channel), electronic program guides and additional languages (spoken or subtitled). The sale of non-television services may provide an additional revenue source.\n\nDigital and analog signals react to interference differently. For example, common problems with analog television include [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] of images, noise from weak signals, and many other potential problems which degrade the quality of the image and sound, although the program material may still be watchable. With digital television, the audio and video must be synchronized digitally, so reception of the digital signal must be very nearly complete; otherwise, neither audio nor video will be usable. Short of this complete failure, \"blocky\" video is seen when the digital signal experiences interference.\n\nAnalog TV began with monophonic sound, and later developed [[multichannel television sound]] with two independent audio signal channels. DTV allows up to 5 audio signal channels plus a [[sub-woofer]] bass channel, with broadcasts similar in quality to movie theaters and DVDs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/crashcourse/digital_v_analog/sound.html |title=Digital TV: A Cringley Crash Course&nbsp;\u2014 Digital Vs. Analog |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Compression artifacts, picture quality monitoring, and allocated bandwidth ===\nDTV images have some picture defects that are not present on analog television or motion picture cinema, because of present-day limitations of bit rate and compression algorithms such as [[MPEG-2]]. This defect is sometimes referred to as \"[[mosquito noise]]\".<ref>{{cite web\n |author1=Le Dinh, Phuc-Tue |author2=Patry, Jacques | url=http://www.videsignline.com/howto/180207350\n | title=Video compression artifacts and MPEG noise reduction\n | work=Video Imaging DesignLine | date=February 24, 2006\n | accessdate=April 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the way the human visual system works, defects in an image that are localized to particular features of the image or that come and go are more perceptible than defects that are uniform and constant. However, the DTV system is designed to take advantage of other limitations of the human visual system to help mask these flaws, e.g. by allowing more [[compression artifacts]] during fast motion where the eye cannot track and resolve them as easily and, conversely, minimizing artifacts in still backgrounds that may be closely examined in a scene (since time allows).\n\nBroadcast, cable, satellite, and Internet DTV operators control the picture quality of television signal encodes using sophisticated, neuroscience-based algorithms, such as the structural similarity ([[SSIM]]) video quality measurement tool, which was accorded each of its inventors a [[Primetime Emmy]] because of its global use. Another tool, called [[Visual Information Fidelity (VIF)]], is a top-performing algorithm at the core of the [[Netflix]] [[VMAF]] video quality monitoring system, which accounts for about 35% of all U.S. bandwidth consumption.\n\n=== Effects of poor reception ===\nChanges in signal reception from factors such as degrading antenna connections or changing weather conditions may gradually reduce the quality of analog TV. The nature of digital TV results in a perfectly decodable video initially, until the receiving equipment starts picking up interference that overpowers the desired signal or if the signal is too weak to decode. Some equipment will show a garbled picture with significant damage, while other devices may go directly from perfectly decodable video to no video at all or lock up. This phenomenon is known as the digital [[cliff effect]].\\\\\n\n[[Block error]] may occur when transmission is done with compressed images. A block error in a single frame often results in black boxes in several subsequent frames, making viewing difficult.\n\nFor remote locations, distant channels that, as analog signals, were previously usable in a snowy and degraded state may, as digital signals, be perfectly decodable or may become completely unavailable. The use of higher frequencies will add to these problems, especially in cases where a clear line-of-sight from the receiving antenna to the transmitter is not available.\n\n=== Effect on old analog technology ===\n{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}\nTelevision sets with only analog tuners cannot decode digital transmissions. When analog broadcasting over the air ceases, users of sets with analog-only tuners may use other sources of programming (e.g. cable, recorded media) or may purchase set-top converter boxes to tune in the digital signals. In the United States, a [[Coupon-eligible converter box|government-sponsored coupon]] was available to offset the cost of an external converter box. Analog switch-off (of full-power stations) took place on December 11, 2006 in The Netherlands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/sloot/switch-off.pdf |title=How Television went Digital in The Netherlands |accessdate=2013-02-04 |format=PDF |work=Open Society Foundations September 2011 }}</ref> June 12, 2009 in the United States for full-power stations, and later for Class-A Stations on September 1, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtv.gov/affected.html |title=The Digital TV Transition: Will You Be Affected? |accessdate=2009-11-02 |work=FCC }}</ref> July 24, 2011 in Japan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/BC_DC_Eggerton_on_Washington/15430-New_DTV_Hard_Date_July_24_2011_.php |title=New DTV Hard Date: July 24, 2011? |accessdate=2009-11-02 |work=B&C }}</ref> August 31, 2011 in Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/DTV_PLAN_Dec08-e.pdf/$file/DTV_PLAN_Dec08-e.pdf |title=DTV Post-Transition Allotment Plan |accessdate=2009-11-02 |format=PDF |work=Spectrum Management and Telecommunications }}</ref> February 13, 2012 in Arab states, May 1, 2012 in Germany, October 24, 2012 in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82057/24-10-12_DSO_completion.pdf |title=End of analogue TV era as switchover completes in the UK |accessdate=2012-12-21 |work=Digital UK }}</ref> and Ireland,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saorview.ie/news/analogue-switch-off-has-finally-happened/|title=Analogue switch off has finally happened|accessdate=2012-12-21 |work=SAORVIEW}}</ref> October 31, 2012 in selected Indian cities,<ref name=\"india-switchover\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalindiamib.com/digital_switch_over.html |title=Find out when digital switch over is coming to you |accessdate=2012-12-21 |work=Government of India Ministry of Information & Broadcasting }}</ref> and December 10, 2013 in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalready.gov.au/|title=Australia's ready for digital TV |accessdate=2013-12-25 |work=Digital Ready AU }}</ref> Completion of analog switch-off is scheduled for December 31, 2017 in the whole of India,<ref name=\"india-switchover\"/> December 2018 in Costa Rica and around 2020 for the Philippines.\n\n=== Disappearance of TV-audio receivers ===\nPrior to the conversion to digital TV, analog television broadcast audio for TV channels on a separate FM [[carrier signal]] from the video signal. This FM audio signal could be heard using standard radios equipped with the appropriate tuning circuits.\n\nHowever, after the [[digital television transition|transition of many countries to digital TV]], no portable radio manufacturer has yet developed an alternative method for portable radios to play just the audio signal of digital TV channels. ([[DTV radio]] is not the same thing.)\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\nThe adoption of a broadcast standard incompatible with existing analog receivers has created the problem of large numbers of analog receivers being discarded during [[digital television transition]].

It is in the form of a letter in [[Latin]] submitted to [[Pope John XXII]], dated 6 April 1320, intended to confirm [[Scotland]]'s status as an [[sovereign state|independent, sovereign state]] and defending Scotland's right to use military action when unjustly attacked.\n\nGenerally believed to have been written in the [[Arbroath Abbey]] by [[Bernard of Kilwinning]], then [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor of Scotland]] and [[Abbot of Arbroath]],{{sfn|Scott|1999|p=196}} and sealed by fifty-one [[magnate]]s and [[nobles]], the letter is the sole survivor of three created at the time. The others were a letter from the [[King of Scots]], [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]], and a letter from four Scottish bishops which all presumably made similar points.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Declaration was part of a broader diplomatic campaign which sought to assert Scotland's position as an independent kingdom,{{sfn|Barrow|1984}} rather than being a feudal land controlled by England's Norman kings, as well as lift the [[excommunication]] of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]].{{sfn|Lynch|1992}} The Pope had recognised [[Edward I of England]]'s claim to overlordship of Scotland in 1305 and Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope for murdering [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] before the altar in Greyfriars Church in Dumfries in 1306.{{sfn|Lynch|1992}}\n\nThe Declaration made a number of points: that Scotland had always been independent, indeed for longer than England; that [[Edward I of England]] had unjustly attacked Scotland and perpetrated atrocities; that Robert the Bruce had delivered the Scottish nation from this peril; and, most controversially, that the independence of Scotland was the prerogative of the Scottish people, rather than the King of Scots. In fact it stated that the nobility would choose someone else to be king if Bruce proved to be unfit in maintaining Scotland's independence.\n\n==Debates==\nSome have interpreted this last point as an early expression of '[[popular sovereignty]]'{{sfn|McLean|2005|p=247}} &ndash; that government is contractual and that kings can be chosen by the community rather than by God alone. Modern Scottish nationalists point to the  \u201cDeclaration\" as evidence of the long-term persistence of the Scots as a distinct national community, giving a very early date for the emergence of [[nationalism]]. However \"the overwhelming majority of academics challenge this vision. Scholars point out that definitions change with time.

Mathematician [[George Stibitz]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] used the word ''digital'' in reference to the fast electric pulses emitted by a device designed to aim and fire anti-aircraft guns in 1942.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ceruzzi|first1=Paul E|date=June 29, 2012|title=Computing: A Concise History|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0-262-51767-6}}</ref>  The term is most commonly used in [[computing]] and [[electronics]], especially where real-world information is converted to [[Binary numeral system|binary]] numeric form as in [[digital audio]] and [[digital photography]].\n\n== Symbol to digital conversion ==\n{{original reasearch|section|date=August 2016}}\nSince symbols (for example, [[alphanumeric]] [[Character (computing)|characters]]) are not continuous, representing symbols digitally is rather simpler than conversion of continuous or analog information to digital. Instead of [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] as in [[analog-to-digital conversion]], such techniques as [[polling (computer science)|polling]] and [[Character encoding|encoding]] are used.\n\nA symbol input device usually consists of a group of switches that are polled at regular intervals to see which switches are switched. Data will be lost if, within a single polling interval, two switches are pressed, or a switch is pressed, released, and pressed again. This polling can be done by a specialized processor in the device to prevent burdening the main [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. When a new symbol has been entered, the device typically sends an [[interrupt]], in a specialized format, so that the CPU can read it.\n\nFor devices with only a few switches (such as the buttons on a [[joystick]]), the status of each can be encoded as bits (usually 0 for released and 1 for pressed) in a single word. This is useful when combinations of key presses are meaningful, and is sometimes used for passing the status of modifier keys on a keyboard (such as shift and control). But it does not scale to support more keys than the number of bits in a single byte or word.\n\nDevices with many switches (such as a [[computer keyboard]]) usually arrange these switches in a scan matrix, with the individual switches on the intersections of x and y lines. When a switch is pressed, it connects the corresponding x and y lines together. Polling (often called scanning in this case) is done by activating each x line in sequence and detecting which y lines then have a signal, thus which keys are pressed. When the keyboard processor detects that a key has changed state, it sends a signal to the CPU indicating the scan code of the key and its new state. The symbol is then [[Code|encoded]], or converted into a number, based on the status of modifier keys and the desired [[character encoding]].\n\nA custom [[Character encoding|encoding]] can be used for a specific application with no loss of data. However, using a standard encoding such as [[ASCII]] is problematic if a symbol such as '\u00df' needs to be converted but is not in the standard.\n\nIt is estimated that in the year 1986 less than 1% of the world's technological capacity to store information was digital and in 2007 it was already 94%.<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\">[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 \"The World\u2019s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information\"], especially [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/02/08/science.1200970.DC1/Hilbert-SOM.pdf Supporting online material], Martin Hilbert and Priscila L\u00f3pez (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60\u201365; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html</ref> The year 2002 is assumed to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital than in analog format (the \"beginning of the [[digital age]]\").<ref name=\"Hilbertvideo2011\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo \"video animation on The World\u2019s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010]</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== States ==\nDigital data come in these three states: [[data at rest]], [[data in transit]] and [[data in use]]. The [[CIA Triad|confidentiality, integrity and availability]] have to be managed during the entire lifecycle from 'birth' to the destruction of the data.\n\n== Properties of digital information ==\nAll digital information possesses common properties that distinguish it from analog data with respect to communications:\n* '''Synchronization:''' Since digital information is conveyed by the sequence in which symbols are ordered, all digital schemes have some method for determining the beginning of a sequence. In written or spoken human languages, synchronization is typically provided by [[pausa|pauses]] (spaces), [[capitalization]], and [[punctuation]]. Machine communications typically use special [[synchronization sequence]]s.\n* '''Language:''' All digital communications require a ''[[formal language]]'', which in this context consists of all the information that the sender and receiver of the digital communication must both possess, in advance, in order for the communication to be successful. Languages are generally arbitrary and specify the meaning to be assigned to particular symbol sequences, the allowed range of values, methods to be used for synchronization, etc.\n* '''Errors:''' Disturbances ([[noise (signal processing)|noise]]) in analog communications invariably introduce some, generally small deviation or error between the intended and actual communication. Disturbances in a digital communication do not result in errors unless the disturbance is so large as to result in a symbol being misinterpreted as another symbol or disturb the sequence of symbols. It is therefore generally possible to have an entirely [[Error detection and correction|error-free]] digital communication. Further, techniques such as check codes may be used to detect errors and guarantee error-free communications through redundancy or retransmission. Errors in digital communications can take the form of ''substitution errors'' in which a symbol is replaced by another symbol, or ''insertion/deletion'' errors in which an extra incorrect symbol is inserted into or deleted from a digital message. Uncorrected errors in digital communications have unpredictable and generally large impact on the information content of the communication.\n* '''[[data transmission|Copying]]:''' Because of the inevitable presence of noise, making many successive copies of an analog communication is infeasible because each generation increases the noise. Because digital communications are generally error-free, copies of copies can be made indefinitely.\n* '''[[Granularity]]:''' The digital representation of a continuously variable analog value typically involves a selection of the number of symbols to be assigned to that value. The number of symbols determines the precision or resolution of the resulting datum. The difference between the actual analog value and the digital representation is known as ''[[quantization error]]''. For example, if the actual temperature is 23.234456544453 degrees, but if only two digits (23) are assigned to this parameter in a particular digital representation, the quantizing error is: 0.234456544453. This property of digital communication is known as ''granularity''.\n*'''[[data compression|Compressible]]:''' According to Miller, \"Uncompressed digital data is very large, and in its raw form, it would actually produce a larger signal (therefore be more difficult to transfer) than analog data. However, digital data can be compressed. Compression reduces the amount of bandwidth space needed to send information.  Data can be compressed, sent and then decompressed at the site of consumption. This makes it possible to send much more information and result in, for example, digital television signals offering more room on the airwave spectrum for more television channels.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Vincent|year=2011|title=Understanding digital culture|at=sec. \"Convergence and the contemporary media experience\"|location=London|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-497-9}}</ref>\n\n== Historical digital systems ==\nEven though digital signals are generally associated with the binary electronic digital systems used in modern electronics and computing, digital systems are actually ancient, and need not be binary or electronic.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n* [[DNA]] [[genetic code]] is a naturally occurring form of digital data storage.\n* Written text (due to the limited character set and the use of discrete symbols&nbsp;\u2013 the alphabet in most cases)\n* The ''[[abacus]]'' was created sometime between 1000 BC and 500 BC, it later became a form of calculation frequency. Nowadays it can be used as a very advanced, yet basic digital calculator that uses beads on rows to represent numbers. Beads only have meaning in discrete up and down states, not in analog in-between states.\n* A ''[[beacon]]'' is perhaps the simplest non-electronic digital signal, with just two states (on and off). In particular, ''[[smoke signal]]s'' are one of the oldest examples of a digital signal, where an analog \"carrier\" (smoke) is [[modulated]] with a blanket to generate a digital signal (puffs) that conveys information.\n* [[Morse code]] uses six digital states\u2014dot, dash, intra-character gap (between each dot or dash), short gap (between each letter), medium gap (between words), and long gap (between sentences)\u2014to send messages via a variety of potential carriers such as electricity or light, for example using an [[electrical telegraph]] or a flashing light.\n* The [[Braille]] system was the first binary format for character encoding, using a six-bit code rendered as dot patterns.\n* [[Flag semaphore]] uses rods or flags held in particular positions to send messages to the receiver watching them some distance away.\n* [[International maritime signal flags]] have distinctive markings that represent letters of the alphabet to allow ships to send messages to each other.\n* More recently invented, a [[modem]] modulates an analog \"carrier\" signal (such as sound) to encode binary electrical digital information, as a series of binary digital sound pulses. A slightly earlier, surprisingly reliable version of the same concept was to bundle a sequence of audio digital \"signal\" and \"no signal\" information (i.e. \"sound\" and \"silence\") on [[compact audio cassette|magnetic cassette tape]] for use with early [[home computer]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col||colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Analog-to-digital converter]]\n* [[Binary number]]\n* [[Comparison of analog and digital recording]]\n* [[Data (computing)]]\n* [[Data remanence]]\n* [[Digital architecture]]\n* [[Digital art]]\n* [[Digital control]]\n* [[Digital divide]]\n* [[Digital electronics]]\n* [[Digital infinity]]\n* [[Digital native]]\n* [[Digital physics]]\n* [[Digital recording]]\n* [[Digital Revolution]]\n* [[Digital video]]\n* [[Digital-to-analog converter]]\n* [[Internet forum]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Tocci, R. 2006.

This fragment holds much rich language that reflects the sentiment shared between the [[Qumran]] towards [[Belial]]. In many ways this text shows how these people thought Belial influenced sin through the way they address him and speak of him. By addressing \"Belial and all his guilty lot,\" (4Q286:2) they make it clear that he is not only impious, but also guilty of sins. Informing this state of uncleanliness are both his \"hostile\" and \"wicked design\" (4Q286:3,4). Through this design, Belial poisons the thoughts of those who are not necessarily sinners. Thus a dualism is born from those inclined to be wicked and those who aren't.<ref>{{cite book |last=Frey |first=J. |chapter=Different patterns of dualistic thought in the Qumran library |title=Legal Texts And Legal Issues |year=1984 |page=287 |ref=harv}}</ref> It is clear that Belial directly influences sin by the mention of \"abominable plots\" and \"guilty inclination\" (4Q286:8,9). These are both mechanisms by which Belial advances his evil agenda that the Qumran have exposed and are calling upon God to protect them from. There is a deep sense of fear that Belial will \"establish in their heart their evil devices\" (4Q286:11,12). This sense of fear is the stimulus for this prayer in the first place. Without the worry and potential of falling victim to Belial's demonic sway, the Qumran people would never feel impelled to craft a curse. This very fact illuminates the power Belial was believed to hold over mortals, and the fact that sin proved to be a temptation that must stem from an impure origin.\n\nIn [[Jubilees]] 1:20, Belial's appearance continues to support the notion that sin is a direct product of his influence. Moreover, Belial's presence acts as a placeholder for all negative influences or those that would potentially interfere with God's will and a pious existence. Similarly to the \"gentiles ... [who] cause them to sin against you\" (Jubilees 1:19), Belial is associated with a force that drives one away from God. Coupled in this plea for protection against foreign rule, in this case the Egyptians, is a plea for protection from \"the spirit of Belial\" (Jubilees 1:19). Belial's tendency is to \"ensnare [you] from every path of righteousness\" (Jubilees 1:19). This phrase is intentionally vague, allowing room for interpretation. Everyone, in one way or another, finds themselves straying from the path of righteousness and by pawning this transgression off on Belial, he becomes a scapegoat for all misguidance, no matter what the cause. By associating Belial with all sorts of misfortune and negative external influence, the Qumran people are henceforth allowed to be let off for the sins they commit.\n\nBelial's presence is found throughout the War Scrolls, located in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and is established as the force occupying the opposite end of the spectrum of God. In Col. I, verse 1, the very first line of the document, it is stated that \"the first attack of the Sons of Light shall be undertaken against the forces of the Sons of Darkness, the army of Belial\" (1Q33;1:1).<ref>{{cite book |last=Nickelsburg |first=George |title=Jewish Literature between the Bible and the Mishna |ref=harv}}</ref> This dichotomy sheds light on the negative connotations that Belial held at the time.{{sfnp|Frey|1984|p=278}} Where God and his Sons of Light are forces that protect and promote piety, Belial and his Sons of Darkness cater to the opposite, instilling the desire to sin and encouraging destruction. This opposition is only reinforced later in the document; it continues to read that the \"holy ones\" will \"strike a blow at wickedness\", ultimately resulting in the \"annihilation of the Sons of Darkness\" (1Q33:1:13). This epic battle between good and evil described in such abstract terms, however it is also applicable to everyday life and serves as a lens through which the Qumran see the world. Every day is the Sons of Light battle evil and call upon God to help them overcome evil in ways small and large.\n\nBelial's influence is not taken lightly. In Col. XI, verse 8, the text depicts God conquering the \"hordes of Belial\" (1Q33;11:8). This defeat is indicative of God's power over Belial and his forces of temptation. However the fact that Belial is the leader of hordes is a testament to how persuasive he can be. If Belial was obviously an arbiter of wrongdoing and was blatantly in the wrong, he wouldn't be able to amass an army. This fact serves as a warning message, reasserting God's strength, while also making it extremely clear the breadth of Belial's prowess. Belial's \"council is to condemn and convict\", so the Qumran feel strongly that their people are not only aware of his purpose, but also equipped to combat his influence (1Q33;13:11).\n\nIn the [[Damascus Document]], Belial also makes a prominent appearance, being established as a source of evil and an origin of several types of sin. In Column 4, the first mention of Belial reads: \"Belial shall be unleashed against Israel\" (4Q266). This phrase is able to be interpreted myriad different ways. Belial is characterized in a wild and uncontrollable fashion, making him seem more dangerous and unpredictable. The notion of being unleashed is such that once he is free to roam; he is unstoppable and able to carry out his agenda uninhibited. The passage then goes to enumerate the \"three nets\" (4Q266;4:16) by which Belial captures his prey and forces them to sin. \"Fornication ..., riches ..., [and] the profanation of the temple\" (4Q266;4:17,18) make up the three nets. These three temptations were three agents by which people were driven to sin, so subsequently, the Qumran people crafted the nets of Belial to rationalize why these specific temptations were so toxic. Later in Column 5, Belial is mentioned again as one of \"the removers of bound who led Israel astray\" (4Q266;5:20). This statement is a clear display of Belial's influence over man regarding sin. The passage goes on to state: \"they preached rebellion against ... God\" (4Q266;5:21,22). Belial's purpose is to undermine the teachings of God, and he achieves this by imparting his nets on humans, or the incentive to sin.{{sfnp|Nickelsburg|p=147}}\n\nIn the ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', Belial controls scores of demons, which are specifically allotted to him by God for the purpose of performing evil.<ref>Dead Sea Scrolls 1QS III 20\u201325</ref> Belial, despite his malevolent disposition, is considered an [[Angels in Judaism|angel]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dale Basil |last=Martin |authorlink=Dale Basil Martin |title=When did Angels Become Demons? |journal=[[Journal of Biblical Literature]] |year=2010 |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=657\u2013677 |doi=10.2307/25765960 |jstor=25765960}}</ref>\n\n== Christianity ==\n=== Christian Bible ===\n\n==== Old Testament ====\nDemons in the Old Testament of the [[Christian Bible]] are of two classes: the \"satyrs\" or \"shaggy goats\" (from [[Hebrew language|Hebr.]] ''se'irim'' \"hairy beings\" and [[Greek Old Testament]] \u03c3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ''satyros'', \"[[satyr]]\"; {{bibleverse||Isaiah|13:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|34:14|KJV}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biblesuite.com/hebrew/useirim_8163.htm |title=Hebrew Concordance: \u016b\u00b7\u015b\u0259\u00b7\u2018\u00ee\u00b7r\u00eem \u2013 1 Occurrence |publisher=Biblesuite.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref> and the \"demons\" (from Hebr.

In Jubilees the sins of man are attributed to \"the unclean demons [who] began to lead astray the children of the sons of Noah, and to make to err and destroy them\" (Jubilees 10:1). In Jubilees Mastema questions the loyalty of Abraham and tells God to \"bid him offer him as a burnt offering on the altar, and Thou wilt see if he will do this command\" (Jubilees 17:16). The discrepancy between the story in Jubilees and the story in Genesis 22 exists with the presence of [[Mastema]]. In Genesis, God tests the will of Abraham merely to determine whether he is a true follower, however; in Jubilees Mastema has an agenda behind promoting the sacrifice of Abraham's son, \"an even more demonic act than that of the Satan in Job.\"<ref>Moshe Berstein, ''Angels at the Aqedah: A Study in the Development of a Midrashic Motif'', (Dead Sea Discoveries, 7, 2000), 267.</ref> In Jubilees, where Mastema, an angel tasked with the tempting of mortals into sin and iniquity, requests that God give him a tenth of the spirits of the children of the watchers, demons, in order to aid the process.<ref>Jubilees 10:7\u20139</ref> These demons are passed into Mastema\u2019s authority, where once again, an angel is in charge of demonic spirits.\n\n[[File:Vrubel Demon.jpg|thumb|''Demon Seated'' by [[Mikhail Vrubel]] (1890), an illustration to the Russian romantic poem ''[[Demon (poem)|demon]]'' by [[Mikhail Lermontov]].

The Nephilim were seen as the source of the sin and evil on earth because they are referenced in Genesis 6:4 before the story of the Flood.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hanneken Henoch|first=T. R.|title=ANGELS AND DEMONS IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES AND CONTEMPORARY APOCALYPSES|year=2006|pages=11\u201325}}</ref> In Genesis 6:5, God sees evil in the hearts of men. The passage states, \"the wickedness of humankind on earth was great\", and that \"Every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only continually evil\" (Genesis 5). The mention of the Nephilim in the preceding sentence connects the spread of evil to the Nephilim. Enoch is a very similar story to Genesis 6:4\u20135, and provides further description of the story connecting the Nephilim to the corruption of humans. In Enoch, sin originates when angels descend from heaven and fornicate with women, birthing giants as tall as 300 cubits. The giants and the angels' departure of Heaven and mating with human women are also seen as the source of sorrow and sadness on Earth. The book of Enoch shows that these fallen angels can lead humans to sin through direct interaction or through providing forbidden knowledge. In Enoch, Semyaz leads the angels to mate with women. Angels mating with humans is against God's commands and is a cursed action, resulting in the wrath of God coming upon Earth. Azazel indirectly influences humans to sin by teaching them divine knowledge not meant for humans. Asael brings down the \"stolen mysteries\" (Enoch 16:3). Asael gives the humans weapons, which they use to kill each other. Humans are also taught other sinful actions such as beautification techniques, alchemy, astrology and how to make medicine (considered forbidden knowledge at the time). Demons originate from the evil spirits of the giants that are cursed by God to wander the earth. These spirits are stated in Enoch to \"corrupt, fall, be excited, and fall upon the earth, and cause sorrow\" (Enoch 15:11).<ref>{{cite book|last=VanderKam|first=James C.|title=THE ANGEL STORY IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES IN: Pseudepigraphic Perspectives : The Apocrypha And Pseudepigrapha In Light Of The Dead Sea Scrolls|year=1999|pages=151\u2013170}}</ref>\n\nThe Book of Jubilees conveys that sin occurs when Cainan accidentally transcribes astrological knowledge used by the Watchers (Jubilees 8). This differs from Enoch in that it does not place blame on the Angels. However, in Jubilees 10:4 the evil spirits of the Watchers are discussed as evil and still remain on earth to corrupt the humans. God binds only 90 percent of the Watchers and destroys them, leaving 10 percent to be ruled by Mastema. Because the evil in humans is great, only 10 percent would be needed to corrupt and lead humans astray. These spirits of the giants also referred to as \"the bastards\" in the Apotropaic prayer Songs of the Sage, which lists the names of demons the narrator hopes to expel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Geza|title=The complete Dead Sea scrolls in English|year=2011|publisher=Penguin|location=London|page=375}}</ref>\n\n=== Christian demonology ===\n{{Main article|Christian demonology|Exorcism in Christianity|Exorcism in the Catholic Church|Demonic possession#Christianity}}\n[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 050 detail 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Death and the Miser]]'' (detail), a [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painting, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nIn Christianity, demons are corrupted spirits carrying the execution of Satan's desires.

The Catholic Church has a cadre of officially sanctioned exorcists which perform many [[exorcism]]s each year. The exorcists of the Catholic Church teach that demons attack humans continually but that afflicted persons can be effectively healed and protected either by the formal rite of exorcism, authorized to be performed only by bishops and those they designate, or by prayers of deliverance, which any Christian can offer for themselves or others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fathercorapi.com/articledet.asp?articleID=1928275639 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405135007/http://www.fathercorapi.com/articledet.asp?articleID=1928275639 |archivedate=2004-04-05 |title=Angels and Demons \u2013 Facts not Fiction |website=fathercorapi.com |first=John |last=Corapi |date=February 9, 2004}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in Christian history, attempts have been made to classify demons according to various proposed [[demonic hierarchy|demonic hierarchies]].\n\nIn the Gospels, particularly the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus cast out many demons from those afflicted with various ailments.

[[Rakshasas]] and [[Asuras]] are often misunderstood to be as demons. There are no demons in Hinduism as Hinduism is not based on good and evil and is not constructed by the principle of duality. \n\n=== Asuras ===\n[[File:The Army of Super Creatures.jpg|thumb|The Army of Super Creatures \u2013 from The Saugandhika Parinaya Manuscript (1821 CE)]]\nOriginally, ''Asura'', in the earliest hymns of the [[Rig Veda]], meant any supernatural spirit, either good or bad. Since the /s/ of the Indic linguistic branch is cognate with the /h/ of the Early Iranian languages, the word ''Asura'', representing a category of celestial beings, became the word ''Ahura'' (Mazda), the Supreme God of the monotheistic [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]]. Ancient Hinduism tells that [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (also called ''suras'') and [[Asura]]s are half-brothers, sons of the same father [[Kashyapa]]; although some of the Devas, such as [[Varuna]], are also called Asuras. Later, during [[Puranic]] age, [[Asura]] and [[Rakshasa]] came to exclusively mean any of a race of anthropomorphic, powerful, possibly evil beings. Daitya (lit. sons of the mother \"Diti\"), Rakshasa (lit. from \"harm to be guarded against\"), and Asura are incorrectly translated into English as \"demon\".\n\nPost Vedic, Hindu scriptures, pious, highly enlightened Asuras, such as [[Prahlada]] and [[Vibhishana]], are not uncommon. The Asura are not fundamentally against the gods, nor do they tempt humans to fall. Many people metaphorically interpret the Asura as manifestations of the ignoble passions in the human mind and as a symbolic devices. There were also cases of power-hungry Asuras challenging various aspects of the Gods, but only to be defeated eventually and seek forgiveness\u2014see [[Surapadman]] and [[Narakasura]].\n\n=== Evil spirits ===\nHinduism advocates the reincarnation and transmigration of souls according to one's [[karma]]. Souls ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) of the dead are adjudged by the [[Yama]] and are accorded various purging punishments before being reborn. Humans that have committed extraordinary wrongs are condemned to roam as lonely, often mischief mongers, spirits for a length of time before being reborn. Many kinds of such spirits ([[Vetala]]s, [[Pishacha]]s, [[Bhoot (ghost)|Bh\u016bta]]) are recognized in the later Hindu texts.\n\n== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith ==\nIn the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], demons are not regarded as independent evil spirits as they are in some faiths. Rather, evil spirits described in various faiths' traditions, such as Satan, fallen angels, demons and jinns, are metaphors for the base character traits a human being may acquire and manifest when he turns away from God and follows his lower nature. Belief in the existence of ghosts and earthbound spirits is rejected and considered to be the product of superstition.<ref name=\"Psmith112\">{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-86251-6 | ref = harv | page = 112}}</ref>\n\n== Ceremonial magic ==\nWhile some people fear demons, or attempt to exorcise them, others willfully attempt to summon them for knowledge, assistance, or power. The ceremonial magician usually consults a [[grimoire]], which gives the names and abilities of demons as well as detailed instructions for conjuring and controlling them. Grimoires are not limited to demons \u2013 some give the names of angels or spirits which can be called, a process called [[theurgy]]. The use of ceremonial magic to call demons is also known as [[goetia]], the name taken from a section in the famous grimoire known as the ''[[Lesser Key of Solomon]]''.<ref>A. E.

Invented in 1915 by [[Wolfgang Gaede]]<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1915 | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 46 | page = 357 | author = Gaede, W. | doi = 10.1002/andp.19153510304 | title = Die Diffusion der Gase durch Quecksilberdampf bei niederen Drucken und die Diffusionsluftpumpe | issue = 3|bibcode = 1915AnP...351..357G }}</ref> using mercury vapor, and improved by [[Irving Langmuir]] and W. Crawford, they were the first type of high [[vacuum pump]]s operating in the regime of [[free molecular flow]], where the movement of the gas molecules can be better understood as [[diffusion]] than by conventional [[fluid dynamics]]. Gaede used the name ''diffusion pump'' since his design was based on the finding that gas cannot diffuse against the vapor stream, but will be carried with it to the exhaust.<ref>{{cite journal | author = D. G. Avery and R. Witty | title = Diffusion pumps: a critical discussion of existing theories| journal = [[Proc. Phys. Soc.]] | volume = 59 | year = 1947 | pages = 1016\u20131030 | doi =  10.1088/0959-5309/59/6/313 | issue = 6|bibcode = 1947PPS....59.1016A }}</ref> However, the principle of operation might be more precisely described as '''gas-jet pump''', since diffusion plays a role also in other high vacuum pumps. In modern textbooks, the diffusion pump is categorized as a [[vacuum pump#Momentum transfer|momentum transfer]] pump.\n\nThe diffusion pump is widely used in both industrial and research applications. Most modern diffusion pumps use [[silicone oil]] or [[polyphenyl ether]]s as the working fluid. [[Cecil Reginald Burch]] discovered the possibility of using silicone oil in 1928.<ref>{{cite journal | author = C. R. Burch | title = Oils, greases and high vacua | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 122 | year = 1928 | page = 729 | doi = 10.1038/122729c0 | issue = 3080|bibcode = 1928Natur.122..729B }}</ref>\n\n==Oil diffusion pumps==\n\nAn oil diffusion pump is used to achieve higher vacuum (lower pressure) than is possible by use of [[Positive displacement vacuum pump|positive displacement]] pumps alone. Although its use has been mainly associated within the high-vacuum range (down to 10<sup>\u22129</sup> mbar), diffusion pumps today can produce pressures approaching 10<sup>\u221210</sup> mbar when properly used with modern fluids and accessories. The features that make the diffusion pump attractive for high and ultra-high vacuum use are its high pumping speed for all gases and low cost per unit pumping speed when compared with other types of pump used in the same vacuum range. Diffusion pumps cannot discharge directly into the atmosphere, so a mechanical forepump is typically used to maintain an outlet pressure around 0.1 mbar.\n\n[[Image:Calutron diffusion pumps.jpg|left|thumb|250 px|Diffusion pumps used on the [[Calutron]] [[mass spectrometer]]s during the [[Manhattan Project]].]]\n\n[[Image:Diffusion pump schematic.svg|thumb|right|250 px|Diagram of an oil diffusion pump]]\n\nThe oil diffusion pump is operated with an oil of low [[vapor pressure]]. The high speed jet is generated by boiling the fluid and directing the vapor through a jet assembly. Note that the oil is gaseous when entering the nozzles. Within the nozzles, the flow changes from [[laminar flow|laminar]] to [[supersonic]] and [[free molecular flow|molecular]]. Often, several jets are used in series to enhance the pumping action. The outside of the diffusion pump is cooled using either air flow or a water line. As the vapor jet hits the outer cooled shell of the diffusion pump, the working fluid condenses and is recovered and directed back to the boiler. The pumped gases continue flowing to the base of the pump at increased pressure, flowing out through the diffusion pump outlet, where they are compressed to ambient pressure by the secondary mechanical forepump and exhausted. \n\nUnlike [[turbomolecular pump]]s and [[cryopump]]s, diffusion pumps have no moving parts and as a result are quite durable and reliable. They can function over pressure ranges of 10<sup>\u221210</sup> to 10<sup>\u22122</sup> mbar. They are driven only by [[convection]] and thus have a very low energy efficiency.\n\nOne major disadvantage of diffusion pumps is the tendency to backstream oil into the vacuum chamber. This oil can contaminate surfaces inside the chamber or upon contact with hot filaments or electrical discharges may result in carbonaceous or siliceous deposits. Due to backstreaming, oil diffusion pumps are not suitable for use with highly sensitive analytical equipment or other applications which require an extremely clean vacuum environment, but mercury diffusion pumps may be in the case of ultra high vacuum chambers used for metal deposition. Often [[cold trap]]s and [[Baffle_(heat_transfer)|baffles]] are used to minimize backstreaming, although this results in some loss of pumping ability.\n\nThe oil of a diffusion pump cannot be exposed to the atmosphere when hot. If this occurs, the oil will burn and has to be replaced.\n\n==Steam ejectors==\n[[Image:DP_pumping_speed_plot.png|thumb|right|250 px|Plot of pumping speed as a function of pressure for a diffusion pump.]]\n{{main|Injector}}\n[[Image:Langmuir mercury diffusion pump.jpg|thumb|Early Langmuir mercury diffusion pump ''(vertical column)'' and its backing pump ''(in background)'', about 1920.  The diffusion pump was widely used in manufacturing [[vacuum tube]]s, the key technology which dominated the radio and electronics industry for 50 years.]]  \n \nThe steam ejector is a popular form of diffusion pump for vacuum [[distillation]] and [[freeze-drying]]. A jet of steam entrains the vapour that must be removed from the vacuum chamber. Steam ejectors can have single or multiple stages, with and without [[Condenser (steam turbine)|condensers]] in between the stages.\n\n==Compressed-air ejectors==\nOne class of diffusion vacuum pumps is the multistage compressed-air driven ejector. It is very popular in applications where objects are moved around using [[suction cup]]s and vacuum lines.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Turbomolecular pump]]\n* [[Vacuum pump]]\n* [[Aspirator (pump)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.public.asu.edu/~aomdw/GLASS/DIFFUSION_PUMP.html An oil diffusion pump built from glass by the Arizona State University Main]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{cite book\n | last = Hablanian\n | first = M.

These sonatas frequently employ [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[accompaniment]] in the left hand in one of several patterns that are now collectively known as ''[[Alberti bass]]''. Alberti was one of the earliest composers to use these patterns, but was not the first or only.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Classical Music|last=Downs|first=Philip G.|publisher=Norton|year=1992|isbn=0-393-95191-X|location=New York|pages=36}}</ref> The most well-known of these patterns consists of regular broken [[chord (music)|chord]]s, with the lowest note sounding first, then the highest, then the middle and then the highest again.

He often used to accompany himself on the harpsichord. In 1736, he served as a page for Pietro Andrea Cappello, the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to [[Spain]]. While at the Spanish court, the famous [[castrato]] singer [[Farinelli]] heard him sing. Farinelli was said to have been impressed, although Alberti was an amateur.\n\nAlberti's best known pieces are his keyboard sonatas, although even they are very rarely performed. It is thought he wrote around 36 sonatas, of which 14 have survived. They all have two movements, each in [[binary form]].\n\nIt is probable that [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s first [[violin sonata]]s, written at the age of seven, were modeled on Alberti's work.\n\nAlberti died in 1740 or 1746 in [[Rome]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMSLP|id=Alberti, Domenico}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alberti, Domenico}}\n[[Category:1710s births]]\n[[Category:1740 deaths]]\n[[Category:Italian Baroque composers]]\n[[Category:Classical-period composers]]\n[[Category:Italian classical composers]]\n[[Category:Italian male classical composers]]\n[[Category:Italian opera composers]]\n[[Category:Male opera composers]]\n[[Category:People from Venice]]\n[[Category:18th-century classical composers]]\n\n\n{{Opera-bio-stub}}", "sha1": "8zmzwsccpzgyi73zx9i7i5ztmedvgga"}}, {"title": "Doris Day", "ns": "0", "id": "8300", "revision": {"id": "864851883", "parentid": "864800738", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T22:24:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "WikiPedant", "id": "596674"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/119.56.80.28|119.56.80.28]] ([[User talk:119.56.80.28|talk]]) to last version by 1.42.39.16", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other people}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name = Doris Day\n| image = Doris Day - 1957.JPG\n| caption = Doris Day in 1957\n| birth_name = Doris Mary Kappelhoff<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisday.com/about|title=About Doris \u2013 Doris Day|accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref>\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1922|4|3}}\n| birth_place = [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], U.S.\n| occupation = Actress, singer, animal rights activist\n| years_active = 1939\u2013present\n| spouse = {{marriage|Al Jorden|1941|1943|end=div.}}<br />{{marriage|[[George William Weidler|George Weidler]]|1946|1949|end=div.}}<br />{{marriage|[[Martin Melcher]]|1951|1968|end=his death}}<br />{{marriage|Barry Comden|1976|1981|end=div.}}\n| children = [[Terry Melcher]]\n| website = {{URL|dorisday.com}}\n}}\n\n'''Doris Day''' (born '''Doris Mary Kappelhoff'''; April 3, 1922) is an American actress, singer, and [[animal welfare]] activist. After she began her career as a big band singer in 1939, her popularity increased with her first hit recording \"[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]\" (1945). After leaving [[Les Brown & His Band of Renown]] to embark on a solo career, she recorded more than 650 songs from 1947 to 1967, which made her one of the most popular and acclaimed singers of the 20th century.\n\nDay's film career began during the latter part of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classical Hollywood Film era]] with the 1948 film ''[[Romance on the High Seas]]'', and its success sparked her twenty-year career as a motion picture actress. She starred in a series of successful films, including musicals, comedies, and dramas. She played the title role in ''[[Calamity Jane (film)|Calamity Jane]]'' (1953), and starred in Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956) with [[James Stewart]]. Her most successful films were the [[Sex comedy|bedroom comedies]] she made co-starring [[Rock Hudson]] and [[James Garner]], such as ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959) and ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'' (1963), respectively. She also co-starred in films with such leading men as [[Clark Gable]], [[Cary Grant]], [[David Niven]], and [[Rod Taylor]]. After her final film in 1968, she went on to star in the CBS sitcom ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'' (1968\u20131973).\n\nShe was usually one of the top ten singers between 1951 and 1966.{{vague|date=September 2017}} As an actress, she became the biggest female film star in the early 1960s, and ranked sixth among the box office performers by 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ten Money Making Stars|url=http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html|work=Quigley Publishing Company|publisher=QP Media, Inc.|access-date=December 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114130743/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html|archivedate=January 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&prodId=BIC1&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Biographies&limiter=&currPage=&disableHighlighting=false&displayGroups=&sortBy=&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&action=e&catId=&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CK2419200293&source=Bookmark&u=xavier_main&jsid=9460d7cd6fd7bee022fae21120e7eb84|title=Doris Day|date=2013|accessdate=January 15, 2016|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|publication-place=Detroit, MI}}</ref><ref name=\"AEHotchner1976\">{{Cite book|title=Doris Day: Her Own Story|last=Hotchner|first=A.E.|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1976|isbn=978-0-688-02968-5|location=New York}}</ref> In 2011, she released her 29th studio album, ''[[My Heart (Doris Day album)|My Heart]]'', which became a UK Top 10 album featuring new material.

In April 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the lower court's judgment. In June 1987, Rosenthal filed a $30&nbsp;million lawsuit against lawyers he claimed cheated him out of millions of dollars in real estate investments. He named Day as a co-defendant, describing her as an \"unwilling, involuntary plaintiff whose consent cannot be obtained\". Rosenthal claimed that millions of dollars Day lost were in real estate sold after Melcher died in 1968, in which Rosenthal asserted that the attorneys gave Day bad advice, telling her to sell, at a loss, three hotels, in [[Palo Alto, California]], [[Dallas, Texas]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and some oil leases in [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]].\n\nRosenthal claimed he had made the investments under a long-term plan, and did not intend to sell them until they appreciated in value. Two of the hotels sold in 1970 for about $7&nbsp;million, and their estimated worth in 1986 was $50&nbsp;million. In July 1984, after a hearing panel of the State Bar Court, after 80 days of testimony and consideration of documentary evidence, the panel accused Rosenthal of 13 separate acts of misconduct and urged his disbarment in a 34-page unsigned opinion.<ref name=Disbarred1987>{{cite news|last=Hager|first=Philip|title=Doris Day's Former Lawyer Disbarred|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-14/news/mn-4016_1_doris-day|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 14, 1987}}</ref> The State Bar Court's review department upheld the panel's findings, which asked the justices to order Rosenthal's disbarment. He continued representing clients in federal courts until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against him on March 21, 1988. Disbarment by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals followed on August 19, 1988. The Supreme Court of California, in affirming the disbarment, held that Rosenthal had engaged in transactions involving undisclosed conflicts of interest, took positions adverse to his former clients, overstated expenses, double-billed for legal fees, failed to return client files, failed to provide access to records, failed to give adequate legal advice, failed to provide clients with an opportunity to obtain independent counsel, filed fraudulent claims, gave false testimony, engaged in conduct designed to harass his clients, delayed court proceedings, obstructed justice and abused legal process.

Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components in the mixture. In either case, the process exploits differences in the [[Volatility (physics)|volatility]] of the mixture's components. In [[Chemical industry|industrial chemistry]], distillation is a [[unit operation]] of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process, not a [[chemical reaction]].\n\nDistillation has many applications. For example:\n* Distillation of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] products produces [[distilled beverage]]s with a high [[Ethanol|alcohol]] content or separates out other fermentation products of commercial value.\n* Distillation is an effective and traditional method of [[desalination]].\n* In the [[fossil fuel]] industry, oil stabilization is a form of partial distillation that reduces vapor pressure of crude oil, thereby making it safe for storage and transport as well as reducing the atmospheric emissions of volatile hydrocarbons. In midstream operations at [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], distillation is a major class of [[unit operation|operation]] for transforming [[crude oil]] into [[fuel]]s and chemical [[raw material|feed stocks]].\n* [[Cryogenic]] distillation leads to the [[Air separation|separation of air]] into its components \u2013 notably [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[argon]] \u2013 for [[industrial gas|industrial use]].\n* In the field of [[Chemical industry|industrial chemistry]], large amounts of crude liquid products of [[chemical synthesis]] are distilled to separate them, either from other products, from impurities, or from unreacted starting materials.\n\nAn installation used for distillation, especially of distilled beverages, is called a distillery. The distillation equipment at a distillery is a [[still]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Distilled beverage}}\n[[File:Zosimos distillation equipment.jpg|thumb|Distillation equipment used by the 3rd century alchemist [[Zosimos of Panopolis]],<ref>{{cite book|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/?id=earQAAAAMAAJ|title=The Volatile Oils|author1=Gildemeister, E. |author2=Hoffman, Fr. |author3=translated by Edward Kremers |volume=1|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|year=1913}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=88|title=The History of Science and Technology|author1=Bryan H.

Both [[alembic]]s and retorts are forms of [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle to act as air-cooled [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] to [[Condensation|condense]] the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173651/http://www.copper-alembic.com/manufacturing/specs_sealing.php Sealing Technique], accessed 16 November 2006.</ref> These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water, for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called [[pot still]]s. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols, such as [[cognac (drink)|cognac]], [[Scotch whisky]], Irish whiskey, [[tequila]], and some [[vodka]]s. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by [[Rum-runner|bootleggers]] in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for use in the domestic production<ref>[http://www.essentialoil.com/alembic5.html Traditional Alembic Pot Still] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121163501/https://www.essentialoil.com/alembic5.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, accessed 16 November 2006.</ref> of flower water or [[essential oils]].\n\nEarly forms of distillation involved batch processes using one vaporization and one condensation. Purity was improved by further distillation of the condensate. Greater volumes were processed by simply repeating the distillation. Chemists reportedly carried out as many as 500 to 600 distillations in order to obtain a pure compound.<ref name=Othmer>Othmer, D. F.

In 1830, [[Aeneas Coffey]] got a patent for improving the design even further.<ref>{{cite patent |inventor-first=A. |inventor-last=Coffey |inventor-link=Aeneas Coffey |title=Apparatus for Brewing and Distilling |country-code=GB |patent-number=5974 |publication-date=5 August 1830 |issue-date=5 February 1831}}; [http://www.kennetpans.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231&Itemid=405 image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204221819/http://kennetpans.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231&Itemid=405 |date=4 February 2017 }}</ref> Coffey's continuous still may be regarded as the [[archetype]] of modern petrochemical units.

The developing [[petroleum]] industry in the early 20th century provided the impetus for the development of accurate design methods, such as the [[McCabe\u2013Thiele method]] by [[Ernest Thiele]] and the [[Fenske equation]]. The availability of powerful computers also allowed direct [[computer simulation|computer simulations]] of distillation columns.\n\n==Applications of distillation==\nThe application of distillation can roughly be divided into four groups: [[#Laboratory scale distillation|laboratory scale]], [[#Industrial distillation|industrial distillation]], distillation of herbs for perfumery and medicinals ([[herbal distillate]]), and [[#Distillation in food processing|food processing]]. The latter two are distinctively different from the former two in that distillation is not used as a true purification method but more to transfer all [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] from the source materials to the distillate in the processing of beverages and herbs.\n\nThe main difference between laboratory scale distillation and industrial distillation is that laboratory scale distillation is often performed on a batch basis, whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously. In [[batch distillation]], the composition of the source material, the vapors of the distilling compounds, and the distillate change during the distillation. In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions, which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms \u2013 remaining least or non-volatile fraction \u2013 removed at the end. The still can then be recharged and the process repeated.\n\nIn [[continuous distillation]], the source materials, vapors, and distillate are kept at a constant composition by carefully replenishing the source material and removing fractions from both vapor and liquid in the system. This results in a more detailed control of the separation process.\n\n==Idealized distillation model==\nThe [[boiling point]] of a liquid is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid equals the pressure around the liquid, enabling bubbles to form without being crushed. A special case is the [[normal boiling point]], where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the ambient [[atmospheric pressure]].\n\nIt is a common misconception that in a liquid mixture at a given pressure, each component boils at the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure, allowing the vapors of each component to collect separately and purely. However, this does not occur, even in an idealized system. Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by [[Raoult's law]] and [[Dalton's law]] and assume that [[Vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium|vapor\u2013liquid equilibria]] are attained.\n\nRaoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is dependent on 1) the vapor pressure of each chemical component in the solution and 2) the fraction of solution each component makes up, a.k.a. the [[mole fraction]]. This law applies to [[ideal solution]]s, or solutions that have different components but whose molecular interactions are the same as or very similar to pure solutions.\n\nDalton's law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual component in the mixture. When a multi-component liquid is heated, the vapor pressure of each component will rise, thus causing the total vapor pressure to rise. When the total vapor pressure reaches the pressure surrounding the liquid, [[boiling]] occurs and liquid turns to gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. Note that a mixture with a given composition has one boiling point at a given pressure when the components are mutually soluble. A mixture of constant composition does not have multiple boiling points.\n\nAn implication of one boiling point is that lighter components never cleanly \"boil first\". At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor is the same as its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and, thus, are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily vaporize also, albeit at a lower concentration in the vapor. Indeed, batch distillation and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In batch distillation, the batch vaporizes, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures. Therefore, starting from a given mixture, it appears to have a boiling range instead of a boiling point, although this is because its composition changes: each intermediate mixture has its own, singular boiling point.\n\nThe idealized model is accurate in the case of chemically similar liquids, such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]]. In other cases, severe deviations from Raoult's law and Dalton's law are observed, most famously in the mixture of ethanol and water. These compounds, when heated together, form an [[azeotrope]], which is when the vapor phase and liquid phase contain the same composition. Although there are [[computational chemistry|computational methods]] that can be used to estimate the behavior of a mixture of arbitrary components, the only way to obtain accurate [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium]] data is by measurement.\n\nIt is not possible to completely purify a mixture of components by distillation, as this would require each component in the mixture to have a zero [[partial pressure]]. If ultra-pure products are the goal, then further [[Separation of chemicals|chemical separation]] must be applied. When a binary mixture is vaporized and the other component, e.g., a salt, has zero partial pressure for practical purposes, the process is simpler.\n\n===Batch or differential distillation===\n\n[[File:BatchDistill.svg|thumb|left|A batch still showing the separation of A and B.]]\nHeating an ideal mixture of two volatile substances, A and B, with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point, in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus depicted in the opening figure) until the mixture is boiling results in a vapor above the liquid that contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid. The ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This, in turn, means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than in the starting liquid).\n\nThe result is that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, becoming richer in component B. This causes the boiling point of the mixture to rise, which results in a rise in the temperature in the vapor, which results in a changing ratio of A : B in the gas phase (as distillation continues, there is an increasing proportion of B in the gas phase). This results in a slowly changing ratio of A : B in the distillate.\n\nIf the difference in vapor pressure between the two components A and B is large \u2013 generally expressed as the difference in boiling points \u2013 the mixture in the beginning of the distillation is highly enriched in component A, and when component A has distilled off, the boiling liquid is enriched in component B.\n\n===Continuous distillation===\n{{Main article|Continuous distillation}}\n\nContinuous distillation is an ongoing distillation in which a liquid mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams occur over time during the operation. Continuous distillation produces a minimum of two output fractions, including at least one [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor and then condensed to a liquid. There is always a bottoms (or residue) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor.\n\nContinuous distillation differs from batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run at a [[steady state]] for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio and the number of theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.\n\n===General improvements===\nBoth batch and continuous distillations can be improved by making use of a [[fractionating column]] on top of the distillation flask. The column improves separation by providing a larger surface area for the vapor and condensate to come into contact. This helps it remain at equilibrium for as long as possible. The column can even consist of small subsystems ('trays' or 'dishes') which all contain an enriched, boiling liquid mixture, all with their own vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium.\n\nThere are differences between laboratory-scale and industrial-scale fractionating columns, but the principles are the same. Examples of laboratory-scale fractionating columns (in increasing efficiency) include\n* [[Condenser (laboratory)#Air condenser|Air condenser]]\n* [[Vigreux column]] (usually laboratory scale only)\n* [[Packed bed|Packed column]] (packed with glass beads, metal pieces, or other chemically inert material)\n* [[Spinning band distillation]] system.\n\n==Laboratory scale distillation==\n[[File:Double Distilled Water Unit.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Typical laboratory fractional distillation unit]]\nLaboratory scale distillations are almost exclusively run as batch distillations. The device used in distillation, sometimes referred to as a ''[[still]]'', consists at a minimum of a '''reboiler''' or ''pot'' in which the source material is heated, a '''condenser''' in which the heated [[gas|vapour]] is cooled back to the liquid [[phase (matter)|state]], and a '''receiver''' in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the '''distillate''', is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation exist (see also [[:Category:Distillation|distillation types]]).\n\n===Simple distillation===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Fractional distillation]] -->\nIn '''simple distillation''', the vapor is immediately channeled into a condenser. Consequently, the distillate is not pure but rather its composition is identical to the composition of the vapors at the given temperature and pressure. That concentration follows [[Raoult's law]].\n\nAs a result, simple distillation is effective only when the liquid boiling points differ greatly (rule of thumb is 25&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000656/http://www.iupac.org/didac/Didac%20Eng/Didac05/Content/ST07.htm ST07 Separation of liquid\u2013liquid mixtures (solutions)], DIDAC by [[IUPAC]]</ref> or when separating liquids from non-volatile solids or oils. For these cases, the vapor pressures of the components are usually different enough that the distillate may be sufficiently pure for its intended purpose.\n\n===Fractional distillation===\n{{Main article|Fractional distillation}}\nFor many cases, the boiling points of the components in the mixture will be sufficiently close that [[Raoult's law]] must be taken into consideration. Therefore, '''fractional distillation''' must be used in order to separate the components by repeated vaporization-condensation cycles within a packed fractionating column. This separation, by successive distillations, is also referred to as '''rectification'''.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nAs the solution to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the [[fractionating column]]. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, the composition of the fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a ''[[theoretical plate]]'') will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070903202418/http://wulfenite.fandm.edu/labtech/fractdistill.htm Fractional Distillation]. fandm.edu</ref> In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; ''theoretical plate'' is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.\n\nMore theoretical plates lead to better separations. A [[spinning band distillation]] system uses a spinning band of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] or metal to force the rising vapors into close contact with the descending condensate, increasing the number of theoretical plates.<ref>[http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html Spinning Band Distillation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825161209/http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html |date=25 August 2006 }}. B/R Instrument Corporation (accessed 8 September 2006)</ref>\n\n===Steam distillation===\n{{Main article|Steam distillation}}\nLike [[vacuum distillation]], '''steam distillation''' is a method for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive.<ref>{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|pp=151\u2013153}}</ref> The temperature of the steam is easier to control than the surface of a heating element, and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.\n\nSteam distillation of various [[aromatic]] herbs and flowers can result in two products; an [[essential oil]] as well as a watery [[herbal distillate]]. The [[essential oils]] are often used in perfumery and [[aromatherapy]] while the watery distillates have many applications in [[aromatherapy]], [[food processing]] and [[skin care]].\n\n[[File:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] usually boils at 189 \u00b0C. Under a vacuum, it distills off into the receiver at only 70 \u00b0C.]]\n[[File:perkin triangle distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|'''Perkin triangle distillation setup'''<br> '''1:''' Stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2:''' Still pot '''3:''' Fractionating column '''4:''' Thermometer/Boiling point temperature '''5:''' Teflon tap 1 '''6:''' Cold finger '''7:''' Cooling water out '''8:''' Cooling water in '''9:''' Teflon tap 2 '''10:''' Vacuum/gas inlet '''11:''' Teflon tap 3 '''12:''' Still receiver]]\n\n===Vacuum distillation===\n{{Main article|Vacuum distillation}}\nSome compounds have very high boiling points. To boil such compounds, it is often better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling and the rest of the distillation process can commence. This technique is referred to as '''vacuum distillation''' and it is commonly found in the laboratory in the form of the [[rotary evaporator]].\n\nThis technique is also very useful for compounds which boil beyond their [[decomposition temperature]] at atmospheric pressure and which would therefore be decomposed by any attempt to boil them under atmospheric pressure.\n\n[[Molecular distillation]] is vacuum distillation below the pressure of 0.01 [[torr]]. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above [[Hard vacuum|high vacuum]], where fluids are in the [[free molecular flow]] regime, i.e. the [[mean free path]] of molecules is comparable to the size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.\n\n===Air-sensitive vacuum distillation===\nSome compounds have high boiling points as well as being [[air sensitive]]. A simple vacuum distillation system as exemplified above can be used, whereby the vacuum is replaced with an inert gas after the distillation is complete. However, this is a less satisfactory system if one desires to collect fractions under a reduced pressure. To do this a \"cow\" or \"pig\" adaptor can be added to the end of the condenser, or for better results or for very air sensitive compounds a [[Perkin triangle]] apparatus can be used.\n\nThe Perkin triangle, has means via a series of glass or [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] taps to allows fractions to be isolated from the rest of the [[still]], without the main body of the distillation being removed from either the vacuum or heat source, and thus can remain in a state of [[reflux]]. To do this, the sample is first isolated from the vacuum by means of the taps, the vacuum over the sample is then replaced with an inert gas (such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]) and can then be stoppered and removed. A fresh collection vessel can then be added to the system, evacuated and linked back into the distillation system via the taps to collect a second fraction, and so on, until all fractions have been collected.\n\n===Short path distillation===\n[[File:short path distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|right|Short path vacuum distillation apparatus with vertical condenser (cold finger), to minimize the distillation path; '''1: '''Still pot with stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2:''' Cold finger \u2013 bent to direct condensate '''3: '''Cooling water out '''4:''' cooling water in '''5: '''Vacuum/gas inlet '''6:''' Distillate flask/distillate.]]\n[[Short path distillation]] is a distillation technique that involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure.<ref>{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|p=150}}</ref> A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, without the need for a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus. The [[Kugelrohr]] is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.\n\n===Zone distillation===\nZone distillation is a distillation process in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate pulling in cold area. The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is moving from the top to the bottom of the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution is forming. Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with number of repetitions of the process.\nZone distillation is a distillation analog of zone recrystallization. Impurity distribution in the condensate is described by known equations of zone recrystallization with various numbers of iteration of process \u2013 with replacement distribution efficient k of crystallization on separation factor \u03b1 of distillation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kravchenko |first=A.

In this process, the product is usually significantly lower-boiling than its reactants. As the product is formed from the reactants, it is vaporized and removed from the reaction mixture. This technique is an example of a continuous vs. a batch process; advantages include less downtime to charge the reaction vessel with starting material, and less workup. Distillation \"over a reactant\" could be classified as a reactive distillation. It is typically used to remove volatile impurity from the distallation feed. For example, a little [[lime (material)|lime]] may be added to remove carbon dioxide from water followed by a second distillation with a little [[sulfuric acid]] added to remove traces of ammonia.\n* [[Catalytic distillation]] is the process by which the reactants are catalyzed while being distilled to continuously separate the products from the reactants. This method is used to assist equilibrium reactions reach completion.\n* [[Pervaporation]] is a method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporization through a non-porous [[Artificial membrane|membrane]].\n* [[Extractive distillation]] is defined as distillation in the presence of a miscible, high boiling, relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no [[azeotrope]] with the other components in the mixture.\n* [[Flash evaporation]] (or partial evaporation) is the partial [[vaporization]] that occurs when a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling [[valve]] or other throttling device. This process is one of the simplest unit operations, being equivalent to a distillation with only one equilibrium stage.\n* Codistillation is distillation which is performed on mixtures in which the two compounds are not miscible. In the laboratory, the [[Dean-Stark apparatus]] is used for this purpose to remove water from synthesis products. The [[Bleidner]] is another example with two refluximg solvents.\n* Membrane distillation is a type of distillation in which vapors of a mixture to be separated are passed through a membrane, which selectively permeates one component of mixture. Vapor pressure difference is the driving force. It has potential applications in seawater desalination and in removal of organic and inorganic components.\n\nThe unit process of [[evaporation]] may also be called \"distillation\":\n* In [[rotary evaporation]] a vacuum distillation apparatus is used to remove bulk [[solvent]]s from a sample. Typically the vacuum is generated by a [[aspirator (pump)|water aspirator]] or a [[membrane pump]].\n* In a [[kugelrohr]] a short path distillation apparatus is typically used (generally in combination with a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (> 300&nbsp;\u00b0C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the oven, and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.\n\nOther uses:\n* [[Dry distillation]] or [[destructive distillation]], despite the name, is not truly distillation, but rather a [[chemical reaction]] known as [[pyrolysis]] in which solid substances are heated in an inert or [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere and any volatile fractions, containing high-boiling liquids and products of pyrolysis, are collected. The destructive distillation of [[wood]] to give [[methanol]] is the root of its common name \u2013 ''wood alcohol''.\n* [[Freeze distillation]] is an analogous method of purification using [[freezing]] instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] where the product is the [[mother liquor]], and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process is used in the production of [[American-style lager#Ice beer|ice beer]] and [[ice wine]] to increase ethanol and [[sugar]] content, respectively. It is also used to produce [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]]. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. However, reducing methanol with the absorption of 4A [[molecular sieve]] is a practical method for production.<ref>[http://124.205.222.100/Jwk_spkx/EN/abstract/abstract15544.shtml Study on Method of Decreasing Methanol in Apple Pomace Spirit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517231120/http://124.205.222.100/Jwk_spkx/EN/abstract/abstract15544.shtml |date=17 May 2013 }}.</ref> Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.\n\n==Azeotropic distillation==\n{{Main article|Azeotropic distillation}}\nInteractions between the components of the solution create properties unique to the solution, as most processes entail nonideal mixtures, where [[Raoult's law]] does not hold. Such interactions can result in a constant-boiling '''[[azeotrope]]''' which behaves as if it were a pure compound (i.e., boils at a single temperature instead of a range). At an azeotrope, the solution contains the given component in the same proportion as the vapor, so that evaporation does not change the purity, and distillation does not effect separation. For example, [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and [[Water (molecule)|water]] form an azeotrope of 95.6% at 78.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIf the azeotrope is not considered sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as '''azeotropic distillation'''. Some techniques achieve this by \"jumping\" over the azeotropic composition (by adding another component to create a new azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a drying agent (or [[desiccant]], such as [[potassium carbonate]]) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble [[water of crystallization]]. [[Molecular sieve]]s are often used for this purpose as well.\n\nImmiscible liquids, such as water and [[toluene]], easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are referred to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid\u2013liquid separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.\n\nHigh boiling azeotropes, such as a 20 weight percent mixture of hydrochloric acid in water, also exist. As implied by the name, the boiling point of the azeotrope is greater than the boiling point of either pure component.\n\nTo break azeotropic distillations and cross distillation boundaries, such as in the DeRosier Problem, it is necessary to increase the composition of the light key in the distillate.\n\n===Breaking an azeotrope with unidirectional pressure manipulation===\nThe boiling points of components in an azeotrope overlap to form a band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component away from the other by exploiting the differing vapour pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.\n\nThis method can remove the need to add other chemicals to a distillation, but it has two potential drawbacks.\n\nUnder negative pressure, power for a vacuum source is needed and the reduced boiling points of the distillates requires that the condenser be run cooler to prevent distillate vapours being lost to the vacuum source. Increased cooling demands will often require additional energy and possibly new equipment or a change of coolant.\n\nAlternatively, if positive pressures are required, standard glassware can not be used, energy must be used for pressurization and there is a higher chance of side reactions occurring in the distillation, such as decomposition, due to the higher temperatures required to effect boiling.\n\nA unidirectional distillation will rely on a pressure change in one direction, either positive or negative.\n\n===Pressure-swing distillation===\n{{further information|Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation}}\n\nPressure-swing distillation is essentially the same as the unidirectional distillation used to break azeotropic mixtures, but here both [[Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation|positive and negative pressures may be employed]].\n\nThis improves the selectivity of the distillation and allows a chemist to optimize distillation by avoiding extremes of pressure and temperature that waste energy. This is particularly important in commercial applications.\n\nOne example of the application of pressure-swing distillation is during the industrial purification of [[ethyl acetate]] after its catalytic synthesis from [[ethanol]].\n\n==Industrial distillation==\n[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|right|thumb|Typical industrial distillation towers]]\n{{Main article|Continuous distillation}}\nLarge scale '''industrial distillation''' applications include both batch and continuous fractional, vacuum, azeotropic, extractive, and steam distillation. The most widely used industrial applications of continuous, steady-state fractional distillation are in [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s and [[natural gas processing]] plants.\n\nTo control and optimize such industrial distillation, a standardized laboratory method, ASTM D86, is established. This test method extends to the atmospheric distillation of petroleum products using a laboratory batch distillation unit to quantitatively determine the boiling range characteristics of petroleum products.\n\nIndustrial distillation<ref name=Perry>{{cite book|author1=Perry, Robert H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=978-0-07-049479-4|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}}</ref><ref name=Kister>{{cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title=Distillation Design|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=978-0-07-034909-4|title-link=Distillation Design}}</ref> is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns known as '''distillation towers''' or '''distillation columns''' with diameters ranging from about 65&nbsp;centimeters to 16&nbsp;meters and heights ranging from about 6&nbsp;meters to 90&nbsp;meters or more. When the process feed has a diverse composition, as in distilling [[crude oil]], liquid outlets at intervals up the column allow for the withdrawal of different ''fractions'' or products having different [[boiling points]] or boiling ranges. The \"lightest\" products (those with the lowest boiling point) exit from the top of the columns and the \"heaviest\" products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column and are often called the '''bottoms'''.\n\n[[File:Continuous Binary Fractional Distillation.PNG|left|thumb|Diagram of a typical industrial distillation tower]]\nIndustrial towers use [[reflux]] to achieve a more complete separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided for a given number of [[theoretical plate]]s, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. [[Chemical engineer]]s must choose what combination of reflux rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the distillation column.\n\nSuch industrial fractionating towers are also used in [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]], producing [[liquid oxygen]], [[liquid nitrogen]], and high purity [[argon]]. Distillation of [[chlorosilane]]s also enables the production of high-purity [[silicon]] for use as a [[semiconductor]].\n\n[[File:Bubble Cap Trays.PNG|frame|right|Section of an industrial distillation tower showing detail of trays with bubble caps]]\nDesign and operation of a distillation tower depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the [[McCabe\u2013Thiele method]]<ref name=Perry/><ref name=SeaderHenley>{{cite book|author1=Seader, J. D.  |author2=Henley, Ernest J.|title=Separation Process Principles|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471-58626-5}}</ref> or the [[Fenske equation]]<ref name=Perry/> can be used. For a multi-component feed, [[simulation]] models are used both for design and operation. Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor\u2013liquid contact devices (referred to as \"plates\" or \"trays\") used in distillation towers are typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient [[equilibrium stage]]. Hence, a distillation tower needs more trays than the number of theoretical vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium stages. A variety of models have been postulated to estimate tray efficiencies.\n\nIn modern industrial uses, a packing material is used in the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor [[plate column]]s are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.\n[[File:Vacuum Column.jpg|thumb|left|183px|Large-scale, industrial vacuum distillation column<ref>[http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html Energy Institute website page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012072758/http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html |date=12 October 2007 }}.

Retrieved on 2014-04-20.</ref>]]\nThis packing material can either be random dumped packing (1\u20133\" wide) such as [[Raschig ring]]s or [[structured packing|structured sheet metal]]. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where [[mass transfer]] takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium, the vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns, it is useful to compute a number of \"theoretical stages\" to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.\n\nAnother factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of [[Theoretical plate|theoretical stages]] required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The [[Theoretical plate|height equivalent to a theoretical plate]] (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references.<ref name=Moore>Moore, F., Rukovena, F.

Spirits such as [[whiskey]] and [[rum]] are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol, including water, esters, and other alcohols, are collected in the condensate, which account for the flavor of the beverage. Some of these beverages are then stored in barrels or other containers to acquire more flavor compounds and characteristic flavors.\n\n==Gallery==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Retort-in-operation-early-chemistry.PNG|100px]]|| Chemistry in its beginnings used [[retort]]s as [[laboratory equipment]] exclusively for distillation processes.\n|-\n|[[File:Distillation of dry and oxygen-free toluene.jpg|100px]]|| A simple set-up to distill dry and oxygen-free [[toluene]].\n|-\n|[[File:Vacuum Column.png|100px]]||Diagram of an industrial-scale vacuum distillation column as commonly used in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]\n|-\n|[[File:Rotavapor.jpg|100px]]|| A [[rotary evaporator]] is able to distill solvents more quickly at lower temperatures through the use of a [[vacuum]].\n|-\n|[[File:Semi-microscale distillation.jpg|100px]]|| Distillation using semi-microscale apparatus.

G\u00f6del's contributed talk took place on Saturday, 6 September [1930], from 3 until 3:20 in the afternoon, and on Sunday the meeting concluded with a round table discussion of the first day's addresses. During the latter event, without warning and almost offhandedly, G\u00f6del quietly announced that \"one can even give examples of propositions (and in fact of those of the type of [[Christian Goldbach|Goldbach]] or [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]) that, while contentually true, are unprovable in the formal system of classical mathematics [153]\" (Dawson:69) \"...

Constance Reid tells a story on the subject:<blockquote>The Hilberts had by this time [around 1902] left the Reformed Protestant Church in which they had been baptized and married. It was told in G\u00f6ttingen that when [David Hilbert's son] Franz had started to school he could not answer the question, \u2018What religion are you?\u2019 (1970, p.&nbsp;91)</blockquote> In the 1927 Hamburg address, Hilbert asserted: \"mathematics is pre-suppositionless science (die Mathematik ist eine voraussetzungslose Wissenschaft)\" and \"to found it I do not need a good God ([z]u ihrer Begr\u00fcndung brauche ich weder den lieben Gott)\" (1928, S. 85; van Heijenoort, 1967, p.&nbsp;479). However, from Mathematische Probleme (1900) to Naturerkennen und Logik (1930) he placed his quasi-religious faith in the human spirit and in the power of pure thought with its beloved child\u2013 mathematics. He was deeply convinced that every mathematical problem could be solved by pure reason: in both mathematics and any part of natural science (through mathematics) there was \"no ignorabimus\" (Hilbert, 1900, S. 262; 1930, S. 963; Ewald, 1996, pp. 1102, 1165). That is why finding an inner absolute grounding for mathematics turned into Hilbert\u2019s life-work. He never gave up this position, and it is symbolic that his words \"wir m\u00fcssen wissen, wir werden wissen\" (\"we must know, we shall know\") from his 1930 K\u00f6nigsberg address were engraved on his tombstone. Here, we meet a ghost of departed theology (to modify George Berkeley\u2019s words), for to absolutize human cognition means to identify it tacitly with a divine one.}}</ref> He also argued that mathematical truth was independent of the existence of God or other ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' assumptions.<ref>\"Mathematics is a presuppositionless science. To found it I do not need God, as does Kronecker, or the assumption of a special faculty of our understanding attuned to the principle of mathematical induction, as does Poincar\u00e9, or the primal intuition of Brouwer, or, finally, as do Russell and Whitehead, axioms of infinity, reducibility, or completeness, which in fact are actual, contentual assumptions that cannot be compensated for by consistency proofs.\" David Hilbert, ''Die Grundlagen der Mathematik'', [http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~odonnell/OData/Courses/22C:096/Lecture_notes/Hilbert_program.html Hilbert's program, 22C:096, University of Iowa].</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Science, Worldviews and Education|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789048127795|page=129|author=Michael R.

Twenty years earlier, [[Paul Gordan]] had demonstrated the [[theorem]] of the finiteness of generators for binary forms using a complex computational approach. Attempts to generalize his method to functions with more than two variables failed because of the enormous difficulty of the calculations involved. In order to solve what had become known in some circles as ''Gordan's Problem'', Hilbert realized that it was necessary to take a completely different path. As a result, he demonstrated ''[[Hilbert's basis theorem]]'', showing the existence of a finite set of generators, for the invariants of [[algebraic form|quantics]] in any number of variables, but in an abstract form. That is, while demonstrating the existence of such a set, it was not a [[constructive proof]] \u2014 it did not display \"an object\" \u2014 but rather, it was an [[existence proof]]<ref>Constance Reid 1996, pp. 36\u201337.</ref> and relied on use of the [[law of excluded middle]] in an infinite extension.\n\nHilbert sent his results to the ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]''. Gordan, the house expert on the theory of invariants for the ''Mathematische Annalen'', could not appreciate the revolutionary nature of Hilbert's theorem and rejected the article, criticizing the exposition because it was insufficiently comprehensive. His comment was:\n\n:''Das ist nicht Mathematik. Das ist Theologie.''\n::(''This is not Mathematics. This is Theology.'')<ref>Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;34.</ref>\n\n[[Felix Klein|Klein]], on the other hand, recognized the importance of the work, and guaranteed that it would be published without any alterations. Encouraged by Klein, Hilbert extended his method in a second article, providing estimations on the maximum degree of the minimum set of generators, and he sent it once more to the ''Annalen''. After having read the manuscript, Klein wrote to him, saying:\n\n:''Without doubt this is the most important work on general algebra that the ''Annalen'' has ever published.''<ref>Rowe, p.&nbsp;195</ref>\n\nLater, after the usefulness of Hilbert's method was universally recognized, Gordan himself would say:\n\n:''I have convinced myself that even theology has its merits.''<ref name=\"Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;37\">Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;37.</ref>\n\nFor all his successes, the nature of his proof stirred up more trouble than Hilbert could have imagined at the time. Although [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] had conceded, Hilbert would later respond to others' similar criticisms that \"many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea\" \u2014 in other words (to quote Reid): \"Through a proof of existence, Hilbert had been able to obtain a construction\"; \"the proof\" (i.e. the symbols on the page) ''was'' \"the object\".<ref name=\"Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;37\"/> Not all were convinced. While [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] would die soon afterwards, his [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] philosophy would continue with the young [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and his developing [[intuitionist]] \"school\", much to Hilbert's torment in his later years.<ref>cf. Reid 1996, pp. 148\u2013149.</ref> Indeed, Hilbert would lose his \"gifted pupil\" [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]] to intuitionism \u2014 \"Hilbert was disturbed by his former student's fascination with the ideas of Brouwer, which aroused in Hilbert the memory of Kronecker\".<ref>Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;148.</ref> Brouwer the intuitionist in particular opposed the use of the Law of Excluded Middle over infinite sets (as Hilbert had used it). Hilbert would respond:\n\n:''Taking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician ... is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.''<ref>Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\n==Axiomatization of geometry==\n{{Main|Hilbert's axioms}}\n\nThe text ''[[Grundlagen der Geometrie]]'' (tr.: ''Foundations of Geometry'') published by Hilbert in 1899 proposes a formal set, called Hilbert's axioms, substituting for the traditional [[Euclid's elements|axioms of Euclid]]. They avoid weaknesses identified in those of [[Euclid]], whose works at the time were still used textbook-fashion. It is difficult to specify the axioms used by Hilbert without referring to the publication history of the ''Grundlagen'' since Hilbert changed and modified them several times. The original monograph was quickly followed by a French translation, in which Hilbert added V.2, the Completeness Axiom. An English translation, authorized by Hilbert, was made by E.J. Townsend and copyrighted in 1902.<ref>{{harvnb|Hilbert|1950}}</ref><ref>[[G. B. Mathews]](1909) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v80/n2066/pdf/080394a0.pdf The Foundations of Geometry] from [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 80:394,5 (#2066)</ref> This translation incorporated the changes made in the French translation and so is considered to be a translation of the 2nd edition. Hilbert continued to make changes in the text and several editions appeared in German. The 7th edition was the last to appear in Hilbert's lifetime. New editions followed the 7th, but the main text was essentially not revised.\n<!-- Independently and contemporaneously, a 19-year-old American student named [[Robert Lee Moore]] published an equivalent set of axioms. Some of the axioms coincide, while some of the axioms in Moore's system are theorems in Hilbert's and vice-versa. -->\n\nHilbert's approach signaled the shift to the modern [[axiomatic method]].  In this, Hilbert was anticipated by [[Moritz Pasch]]'s work from 1882.  Axioms are not taken as self-evident truths. Geometry may treat ''things'', about which we have powerful intuitions, but it is not necessary to assign any explicit meaning to the undefined concepts. The elements, such as [[point (geometry)|point]], [[Line (geometry)|line]], [[plane (geometry)|plane]], and others, could be substituted, as Hilbert is reported to have said to [[Schoenflies]] and [[Ernst K\u00f6tter|K\u00f6tter]], by tables, chairs, glasses of beer and other such objects.<ref>{{cite book| author=[[Otto Blumenthal]]| title=Lebensgeschichte| year=1935| volume=3| pages=388\u2013429| publisher=Julius Springer| editor=David Hilbert| series=Gesammelte Abhandlungen| url=http://gdz-lucene.tc.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gcs/gcs?action=pdf&metsFile=PPN237834022&divID=LOG_0001&pagesize=original&pdfTitlePage=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/pdftitle/?metsFile=PPN237834022%7C&targetFileName=PPN237834022_LOG_0001.pdf&| access-date=2018-09-06| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122623/http://gdz-lucene.tc.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gcs/gcs?action=pdf&metsFile=PPN237834022&divID=LOG_0001&pagesize=original&pdfTitlePage=http%3A%2F%2Fgdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de%2Fdms%2Fload%2Fpdftitle%2F%3FmetsFile%3DPPN237834022%7C&targetFileName=PPN237834022_LOG_0001.pdf&| archive-date=2016-03-04| dead-url=yes| df=}} Here: p.402-403</ref> It is their defined relationships that are discussed.\n\nHilbert first enumerates the undefined concepts: point, line, plane, lying on (a relation between points and lines, points and planes, and lines and planes), betweenness, congruence of pairs of points ([[line segment]]s), and [[criteria of congruence of angles|congruence]] of [[angle]]s. The axioms unify both the [[Euclidean geometry|plane geometry]] and [[solid geometry]] of Euclid in a single system.\n\n==The 23 problems==\n{{Main|Hilbert's problems}}\n\nHilbert put forth a most influential list of 23 unsolved problems at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Paris]] in 1900. This is generally reckoned as the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician.\n\nAfter re-working the foundations of classical geometry, Hilbert could have extrapolated to the rest of mathematics. His approach differed, however, from the later 'foundationalist' Russell-Whitehead or 'encyclopedist' [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], and from his contemporary [[Giuseppe Peano]]. The mathematical community as a whole could enlist in problems, which he had identified as crucial aspects of the areas of mathematics he took to be key.\n\nThe problem set was launched as a talk \"The Problems of Mathematics\" presented during the course of the Second International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris. The introduction of the speech that Hilbert gave said:\n\n:''Who among us would not be happy to lift the veil behind which is hidden the future; to gaze at the coming developments of our science and at the secrets of its development in the centuries to come? What will be the ends toward which the spirit of future generations of mathematicians will tend? What methods, what new facts will the new century reveal in the vast and rich field of mathematical thought?''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs121/handouts/Hilbert.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530182730/http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs121/handouts/Hilbert.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}, archived from [www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs121/handouts/Hilbert.pdf]</ref>\n\nHe presented fewer than half the problems at the Congress, which were published in the acts of the Congress. In a subsequent publication, he extended the panorama, and arrived at the formulation of the now-canonical 23 Problems of Hilbert. See also [[Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem]]. The full text is important, since the exegesis of the questions still can be a matter of inevitable debate, whenever it is asked how many have been solved.\n\nSome of these were solved within a short time. Others have been discussed throughout the 20th century, with a few now taken to be unsuitably open-ended to come to closure. Some even continue to this day to remain a challenge for mathematicians.\n\n==Formalism==\nIn an account that had become standard by the mid-century, Hilbert's problem set was also a kind of manifesto, that opened the way for the development of the [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] school, one of three major schools of mathematics of the 20th century. According to the formalist, mathematics is manipulation of symbols according to agreed upon formal rules. It is therefore an autonomous activity of thought.  There is, however, room to doubt whether Hilbert's own views were simplistically formalist in this sense.\n\n===Hilbert's program===\n{{Main|Hilbert's program}}\nIn 1920 he proposed explicitly a research project (in ''[[metamathematics]]'', as it was then termed) that became known as Hilbert's program. He wanted [[mathematics]] to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation. He believed that in principle this could be done, by showing that:\n\n# all of mathematics follows from a correctly chosen finite system of [[axiom]]s; and\n# that some such axiom system is provably consistent through some means such as the [[epsilon calculus]].\n\nHe seems to have had both technical and philosophical reasons for formulating this proposal. It affirmed his dislike of what had become known as the ''[[ignorabimus]]'', still an active issue in his time in German thought, and traced back in that formulation to [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]].\n\nThis program is still recognizable in the most popular [[philosophy of mathematics]], where it is usually called ''formalism''. For example, the [[Bourbaki group]] adopted a watered-down and selective version of it as adequate to the requirements of their twin projects of (a) writing encyclopedic foundational works, and (b) supporting the [[axiomatic method]] as a research tool. This approach has been successful and influential in relation with Hilbert's work in algebra and functional analysis, but has failed to engage in the same way with his interests in physics and logic.\n\nHilbert wrote in 1919:\n\n:We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules.  Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.<ref>Hilbert, D. (1919-20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919-1920 in G\\\"ottingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul Bernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), Basel, Birkh\\\"auser (1992).</ref>\n\nHilbert published his views on the foundations of mathematics in the 2-volume work [[Grundlagen der Mathematik]].\n\n===G\u00f6del's work===\nHilbert and the mathematicians who worked with him in his enterprise were committed to the project. His attempt to support axiomatized mathematics with definitive principles, which could banish theoretical uncertainties, ended in failure.\n\n[[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] demonstrated that any non-contradictory formal system, which was comprehensive enough to include at least arithmetic, cannot demonstrate its completeness by way of its own axioms. In 1931 his [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]] showed that Hilbert's grand plan was impossible as stated. The second point cannot in any reasonable way be combined with the first point, as long as the axiom system is genuinely [[finitary]].\n\nNevertheless, the subsequent achievements of [[proof theory]] at the very least ''clarified'' consistency as it relates to theories of central concern to mathematicians. Hilbert's work had started logic on this course of clarification; the need to understand G\u00f6del's work then led to the development of [[recursion theory]] and then [[mathematical logic]] as an autonomous discipline in the 1930s. The basis for later [[theoretical computer science]], in the work of [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]], also grew directly out of this 'debate'.\n\n==Functional analysis==\nAround 1909, Hilbert dedicated himself to the study of differential and [[integral equation]]s; his work had direct consequences for important parts of modern functional analysis. In order to carry out these studies, Hilbert introduced the concept of an infinite dimensional [[Euclidean space]], later called [[Hilbert space]]. His work in this part of analysis provided the basis for important contributions to the mathematics of physics in the next two decades, though from an unanticipated direction.\nLater on, [[Stefan Banach]] amplified the concept, defining [[Banach spaces]]. Hilbert spaces are an important class of objects in the area of [[functional analysis]], particularly of the [[spectral theory]] of self-adjoint linear operators, that grew up around it during the 20th century.\n\n==Physics==\nUntil 1912, Hilbert was almost exclusively a \"pure\" mathematician.  When planning a visit from Bonn, where he was immersed in studying physics, his fellow mathematician and friend [[Hermann Minkowski]] joked he had to spend 10 days in quarantine before being able to visit Hilbert.  In fact, Minkowski seems responsible for most of Hilbert's physics investigations prior to 1912, including their joint seminar in the subject in 1905.\n\nIn 1912, three years after his friend's death, Hilbert turned his focus to the subject almost exclusively.  He arranged to have a \"physics tutor\" for himself.<ref>Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;129.</ref>  He started studying [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic gas theory]] and moved on to elementary [[radiation]] theory and the molecular theory of matter.  Even after the war started in 1914, he continued seminars and classes where the works of [[Albert Einstein]] and others were followed closely.\n\nBy 1907 Einstein had framed the fundamentals of the theory of gravity, but then struggled for nearly 8 years with a confounding problem of putting the theory into final form.<ref>Isaacson 2007:218</ref> By early summer 1915, Hilbert's interest in physics had focused on [[general relativity]], and he invited Einstein to G\u00f6ttingen to deliver a week of lectures on the subject.<ref>Sauer 1999, Folsing 1998, Isaacson 2007:212</ref> Einstein received an enthusiastic reception at G\u00f6ttingen.<ref>Isaacson 2007:213</ref> Over the summer Einstein learned that Hilbert was also working on the field equations and redoubled his own efforts. During November 1915 Einstein published several papers culminating in \"The Field Equations of Gravitation\" (see [[Einstein field equations]]).<ref>In time, associating the gravitational field equations with Hilbert's name became less and less common. A noticeable exception is P. Jordan (Schwerkraft und Weltall, Braunschweig, Vieweg, 1952), who called the equations of gravitation in the vacuum the Einstein\u2013Hilbert equations. (Leo Corry, David Hilbert and the Axiomatization of Physics, p.&nbsp;437)</ref> Nearly simultaneously David Hilbert published \"The Foundations of Physics\", an axiomatic derivation of the field equations (see [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]]). Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory, and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.<ref>Since 1971 there have been some spirited and scholarly discussions about which of the two men first presented the now accepted form of the field equations. \"Hilbert freely admitted, and frequently stated in lectures, that the great idea was Einstein's.\"Every boy in the streets of Gottingen understands more about four dimensional geometry than Einstein,\" he once remarked. \"Yet, in spite of that, Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians\" (Reid 1996, pp.&nbsp;141\u2013142, also Isaacson 2007:222 quoting Thorne p.&nbsp;119).</ref> See more at [[relativity priority dispute#General Relativity 3|priority]].\n\nAdditionally, Hilbert's work anticipated and assisted several advances in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]]. His work was a key aspect of [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[John von Neumann]]'s work on the mathematical equivalence of [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] and [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave equation]] and his namesake [[Hilbert space]] plays an important part in quantum theory.  In 1926 von Neumann showed that if atomic states were understood as vectors in Hilbert space, then they would correspond with both Schr\u00f6dinger's wave function theory and Heisenberg's matrices.<ref>In 1926, the year after the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory by [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], the mathematician [[John von Neumann]] became an assistant to David Hilbert at G\u00f6ttingen.  When von Neumann left in 1932, von Neumann's book on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, based on Hilbert's mathematics, was published under the title  ''Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik''.  See: Norman Macrae, ''John von Neumann:  The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear Deterrence, and Much More'' (Reprinted by the American Mathematical Society, 1999) and Reid 1996.</ref>\n\nThroughout this immersion in physics, Hilbert worked on putting rigor into the mathematics of physics.  While highly dependent on higher mathematics, physicists tended to be \"sloppy\" with it.  To a \"pure\" mathematician like Hilbert, this was both \"ugly\" and difficult to understand.  As he began to understand physics and how physicists were using mathematics, he developed a coherent mathematical theory for what he found, most importantly in the area of [[integral equations]].  When his colleague [[Richard Courant]] wrote the now classic ''[[Methoden der mathematischen Physik]]'' (Methods of Mathematical Physics) including some of Hilbert's ideas, he added Hilbert's name as author even though Hilbert had not directly contributed to the writing.  Hilbert said \"Physics is too hard for physicists\", implying that the necessary mathematics was generally beyond them; the Courant-Hilbert book made it easier for them.\n\n==Number theory==\nHilbert unified the field of [[algebraic number theory]] with his 1897 treatise ''[[Zahlbericht]]'' (literally \"report on numbers\"). He also resolved a significant number-theory [[Waring's problem|problem formulated by Waring]] in 1770.  As with [[#The finiteness theorem|the finiteness theorem]], he used an existence proof that shows there must be solutions for the problem rather than providing a mechanism to produce the answers.<ref>Reid 1996, p.&nbsp;114</ref>  He then had little more to publish on the subject; but the emergence of [[Hilbert modular form]]s in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area.\n\nHe made a series of conjectures on [[class field theory]]. The concepts were highly influential, and his own contribution lives on in the names of the [[Hilbert class field]] and of the [[Hilbert symbol]] of [[local class field theory]]. Results were mostly proved by 1930, after work by [[Teiji Takagi]].<ref>This work established Takagi as Japan's first mathematician of international stature.</ref>\n\nHilbert did not work in the central areas of [[analytic number theory]], but his name has become known for the [[Hilbert\u2013P\u00f3lya conjecture]], for reasons that are anecdotal.\n\n==Works==\nHis collected works (''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'') have been published several times. The original versions of his papers contained \"many technical errors of varying degree\";<ref>Reid, chap.13</ref> when the collection was first published, the errors were corrected and it was found that this could be done without major changes in the statements of the theorems, with one exception\u2014a claimed proof of the [[continuum hypothesis]].<ref name=\"Sieg13\">Page 284f in: {{Cite book|title=Hilbert's Programs and Beyond|author=Wilfried Sieg|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=9780195372229|year=2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Rota97\">[[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota G.-C.]] (1997), \"[http://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf Ten lessons I wish I had been taught]\", ''[[Notices of the AMS]], 44: 22-25.</ref> The errors were nonetheless so numerous and significant that it took [[Olga Taussky-Todd]] three years to make the corrections.<ref name=\"Rota97\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Logic}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[List of things named after David Hilbert]]\n* [[Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy]]\n* [[Foundations of geometry]]\n* [[Geometry and the Imagination]]\n* [[Hilbert\u2013Burch theorem]]\n* [[Hilbert C*-module]]\n* [[Hilbert cube]]\n* [[Hilbert curve]]\n* [[Hilbert matrix]]\n* [[Hilbert metric]]\n* [[Hilbert\u2013Mumford criterion]]\n* [[Hilbert number]]\n* [[Hilbert ring]]\n* [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]]\n* [[Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial]]\n* [[Hilbert spectrum]]\n* [[Hilbert system]]\n* [[Hilbert transform]]\n* [[Hilbert's arithmetic of ends]]\n* [[Hilbert's irreducibility theorem]]\n* [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]\n* [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]\n* [[Hilbert's theorem (differential geometry)]]\n* [[Hilbert's Theorem 90]]\n* [[Hilbert's syzygy theorem]]\n* [[Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator]]\n* [[Hilbert\u2013Smith conjecture]]\n* [[Hilbert\u2013Speiser theorem]]\n* [[Relativity priority dispute]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary literature in English translation===\n* Ewald, William B., ed., 1996.

Artenstein: \"By 1895 Beijerinck had returned to academia after leaving the [[Wageningen University|Agricultural School]] for a 10-year stint in industrial microbiology in Delft, the South Holland birthplace of [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]], one of the founding fathers of microbiology. During his first years at the [[Technical University of Delft]], Beijerinck resumed the research on [[tobacco mosaic disease]] that he had started while working with [[Adolf Mayer|Mayer]]. Even then, he had appreciated that the affliction was microbial in nature, although he felt that the actual agents had yet to be discovered. Beijerinck's investigations at Delft proved fruitful; he not only confirmed the infectivity of the [[contagium vivum fluidum]]\u2014soluble living germ\u2014despite filtration, but he importantly demonstrated that unlike bacteria, the culprit of tobacco disease of plants was incapable of independent growth, requiring the presence of living, dividing host cells in order to replicate.\"</ref> Delft can be considered to be the true birthplace of microbiology, with its several sub-disciplines such as [[bacteriology]], [[protozoology]], and [[history of virology|virology]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Delft}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Cornelis Springer, The Gemeenlandshuis and the Old Church, Delft, Summer (1877).jpg|thumb|upright|255px|The Gemeenlandshuis and the Old Church in (1877) by [[Cornelis Springer]]]]\n[[File:Antique map of Delft, Netherlands by Blaeu J. 1649.jpg|thumb|upright|255px|Delft in 1649 (Blaeu)]]\nThe city of Delft came into being beside a canal, the 'Delf', which comes from the word ''delven'', meaning delving or digging, and led to the name Delft. It presumably started around the 11th century as a landlord court.\n\nFrom a rural village in the early Middle Ages, Delft developed into a city, that in the 13th century (1246) received its [[City rights in the Netherlands|charter]]. (For some more information about the early development, see [[Gracht#Delft as an example|Gracht]]).''\n\nThe town's association with the [[House of Orange]] started when [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Willem van Oranje), nicknamed [[William the Silent]] (Willem de Zwijger), took up residence in 1572. At the time he was the leader of growing national Dutch resistance against Spanish occupation, known as the [[Eighty Years' War]].  By then Delft was one of the leading cities of [[County of Holland|Holland]] and it was equipped with the necessary [[city wall]]s to serve as a headquarters. [[Battle of Delft (1573)|An attack by Spanish forces]] in October of that year was repelled.\n\nAfter the [[Act of Abjuration]] was proclaimed in 1581, Delft became the ''[[de facto]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of the newly independent Netherlands, as the seat of the [[Prince of Orange]].\n\nWhen William was shot dead in 1584 by [[Balthazar Gerards]] in the hall of the Prinsenhof, the family's traditional burial place in [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] was still in the hands of the Spanish. Therefore, he was buried in the Delft [[Nieuwe Kerk, Delft|Nieuwe Kerk]] (New Church), starting a tradition for the House of Orange that has continued to the present day.\n\n===Delft Explosion===\n\nThe Delft Explosion, also known in history as the Delft Thunderclap, occurred on 12 October 1654 when a [[gunpowder]] store exploded, destroying much of the city.  Over a hundred people were killed and thousands were wounded.\n[[File:Delftsedonderslag.jpg|thumb|upright|130px|left|[[Egbert van der Poel]]: A View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654]]About {{convert|30|t|1|lk=on}} of gunpowder were stored in [[Barrel (storage)|barrels]] in a [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] in a former [[Order of Poor Ladies|Clarissen]] [[convent]] in the Doelenkwartier district.  Cornelis Soetens, the keeper of the magazine, opened the store to check a sample of the powder and a huge explosion followed.  Luckily, many citizens were away, visiting a [[Market (place)|market]] in [[Schiedam]] or a [[fair]] in [[The Hague]].\n\nToday, the explosion is remembered primarily for killing Rembrandt's most promising pupil, [[Carel Fabritius]], and destroying almost all his works.\n\nDelft artist [[Egbert van der Poel]] painted several pictures of Delft showing the devastation.\n\n==Sights==\nThe city centre retains a large number of monumental buildings, while in many streets there are [[canal]]s of which the banks are connected by typical bridges,<ref>[[:Commons:Category:Bridges in Delft|Bridges in Delft]]</ref> altogether making this city a notable tourist destination.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\">{{cite book|author=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to The Netherlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j03xxJasTMC&pg=PA393|accessdate=24 November 2011|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-84836-882-8|page=169}}</ref>\n\nHistorical buildings and other sights of interest include:\n* [[Oude Kerk, Delft|Oude Kerk]] (Old Church).

The city had an early start in this area since it was a home port of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. It can still be seen at the pottery factories [[De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles|De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles (or Royal Delft)]] and De Delftse Pauw.\n\nThe painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] (1632\u20131675) was born in Delft. Vermeer used Delft streets and home interiors as the subject or background in his paintings.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/>\nSeveral other famous painters lived and worked in Delft at that time, such as [[Pieter de Hooch|Pieter de Hoogh]], [[Carel Fabritius]], [[Nicolaes Maes]], Gerard Houckgeest and Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet. They were all members of the [[Delft School (painting)|Delft School]]. The Delft School is known for its images of domestic life, views of households, church interiors, courtyards, squares and the streets of Delft. The painters also produced pictures showing historic events, flowers, portraits for patrons and the court as well as decorative pieces of art.\nDelft supports creative arts companies. From 2001 the Bacinol, a building that had been disused since 1951, began to house small companies in the creative arts sector. However, demolition of the building started in December 2009, making way for the construction of the new railway tunnel in Delft. The occupants of the building, as well as the name 'Bacinol', moved to another building in the city.  The name Bacinol relates to [[DSM (company)#History|Dutch penicillin research during WWII]].\n<!-- not needed ?

Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that egg-laying and nest-building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs, avian and non-avian alike.\n\nWhile dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedalism|bipedal]], many extinct groups included [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]].

Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small: ''[[Xixianykus]]'', for example, was only about {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nSince the first dinosaur [[fossil]]s were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[taxon]] 'Dinosauria' was formally named in 1841 by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Richard Owen|Sir Richard Owen]], who used it to refer to the \"distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles\" that were then being recognized in England and around the world.<ref name=Owen1841/> The term is derived {{ety|grc|''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2|\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2]]'' (deinos)|terrible, potent or fearfully great||''[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (sauros)|lizard or reptile}}.<ref name=Owen1841/><ref name=LSJ/> Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.<ref name=FBS97/>\n\nOther prehistoric animals, including [[pterosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]], and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] classified as dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |title=Dinosaurs, Pterosaurs And Other Saurs \u2013 Big Differences |last=Chamary |first= JV |date=2014-09-30 |website=Forbes |access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref> Pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs, being members of the clade [[Ornithodira]]. The other groups mentioned are, like dinosaurs and pterosaurs, members of [[Sauropsida]] (the reptile and bird [[clade]]), with the exception of ''Dimetrodon'' (which is a [[synapsid]]).\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:LA-Triceratops mount-2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Triceratops]]'' skeleton, [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]]]]\nUnder [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of the [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) of ''[[Triceratops]]'' and [[Modern birds|Neornithes]], and all its descendants.<ref name=MJB04dino/> It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]'', because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.<ref name=olshevsky2000/> Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs: \"Dinosauria = [[Ornithischia]] + [[Saurischia]]\", encompassing [[ankylosauria]]ns (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), [[stegosauria]]ns (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), [[ceratopsia]]ns (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), [[ornithopod]]s (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including \"duck-bills\"), [[theropoda|theropods]] (mostly [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[carnivore]]s and [[bird]]s), and [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]] (mostly large [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[quadruped]]s with long necks and tails).<ref name=\"Letal05\"/>\n\nBirds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate [[class (biology)|class]] that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct [[superorder]]. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |title=Using the tree for classification |website=University of Berkeley}}</ref> Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are [[saurischia]]ns, which are dinosaurs.<ref name=basalavialae>Padian, K.

They resurrected the clade [[Ornithoscelida]] to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of ''[[Triceratops|Triceratops horridus]]'', ''[[house sparrow|Passer domesticus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus carnegii]]'', and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.<ref name=\"NYT-20170322\">{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |title=Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html |date=22 March 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=22 March 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"NAT-20170322\">{{cite journal |last1=Baron |first1=Matthew G. |last2=Norman |first2=David B. |last3=Barrett |first3=Paul M. |title=A new hypothesis of dinosaur relationships and early dinosaur evolution |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7646/full/nature21700.html |date=22 March 2017 |volume=543 |issue=7646 |pages=501\u2013506 |doi=10.1038/nature21700|pmid=28332513 |accessdate=22 March 2017 |journal=Nature|bibcode=2017Natur.543..501B }}</ref>\n\n===General description===\n[[File:Neognathae.jpg|thumb|alt=montage of four birds|In [[phylogenetic]] taxonomy, birds are included in the group Dinosauria.]]\nUsing one of the above definitions, dinosaurs can be generally described as [[archosaur]]s with [[Terrestrial locomotion#Posture|hind limbs held erect beneath the body]].<ref name=DFG97/> Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and [[pelycosaur]]s (especially ''[[Dimetrodon]]''), but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs.<ref name=DL90/> Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods.

Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]].

Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period.<ref name=MacLeod/> Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as ''[[Microraptor]]'') could fly or at least glide, and others, such as [[spinosauridae|spinosaurids]], had [[list of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]] habits.<ref name=RMetal10/>\n\n===Distinguishing anatomical features===\nWhile recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral [[archosaur]]ian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants.

Some of these are also present in [[Silesauridae|silesaurids]], which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.<ref name=MJB04dino/>\n[[File:Skull diapsida 1.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a typical diapsid skull<br />j: [[jugal bone]], po: [[postorbital bone]], p: [[parietal bone]], sq: [[squamosal bone]], q: [[quadrate bone]], qj: [[quadratojugal bone]]]]\nA variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of [[archosaurs]] or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]]s, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[temporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.<ref name=TRHJ00/> Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated [[scapula]], or shoulder blade; a [[sacrum]] composed of three or more fused [[Spinal vertebra|vertebrae]] (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'');<ref name=MJB04dino/> and a [[Acetabulum#Perforate Acetabulum|perforate acetabulum]], or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in ''[[Saturnalia (dinosaur)|Saturnalia]]'', for example).<ref name=\"UC Berkeley Journal of Earth Sciences\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Dave|title=Dinosauria Morphology|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/dinomm.html|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=LARB99/> Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.<ref name=NIP07/>\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|Hip joints and hindlimb postures of: (left to right) typical reptiles (sprawling), dinosaurs and mammals (erect), and [[rauisuchia]]ns (erect)]]\nDinosaurs stand with their hind limbs erect in a manner similar to [[Evolution of mammals#Erect limbs|most modern mammals]], but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side.<ref name=Holland1909/> This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur.<ref name=MJB00/> Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that [[Carrier's constraint|surpassed those of \"sprawling\" reptiles]].<ref name=RC05/> Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs.<ref name=TKMB07/> Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including [[rauisuchia]]ns, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a \"pillar erect\" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the [[ilium (bone)|upper pelvic bone]] was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.<ref name=TKMB07/>\n\n==Evolutionary history==\n{{Main|Evolution of dinosaurs}}\n\n===Origins and early evolution===\nDinosaurs diverged from their [[archosaur]] ancestors during the middle to late [[Triassic]] period, roughly 20&nbsp;million years after the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] wiped out an estimated 95% of all [[life|life on Earth]].<ref name=KPA/><ref name=TannerLucas/> [[Radiometric dating]] of the [[rock formation]] that contained fossils from the early dinosaur [[genus]] ''[[Eoraptor]]'' at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.<ref name=\"OARM2010\">{{cite journal|last=Alcober|first=Oscar A.|author2=Martinez, Ricardo N.|year=2010|title=A new herrerasaurid (Dinosauria, Saurischia) from the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina|journal=ZooKeys|volume=63|issue=63|pages=55\u201381|doi=10.3897/zookeys.63.550|pmc=3088398|pmid=21594020}} [https://www.pensoft.net/inc/journals/download.php?fileId=1401&fileTable=J_GALLEYS]</ref> Paleontologists think that ''Eoraptor'' resembles the [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of all dinosaurs;<ref name=Sereno1999/> if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal [[predation|predators]].<ref name=SFRM93/> The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like [[ornithodiran]]s such as ''[[Marasuchus]]'' and ''[[Lagerpeton]]'' in [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[Middle Triassic]] strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.

In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass [[Pangaea]], and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of [[coelophysoidea|coelophysoid]] [[carnivore]]s and early [[sauropodomorph]] [[herbivore]]s.<ref name=HCL04/> [[Gymnosperm]] plants (particularly [[conifer]]s), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.<ref name=FS04/> The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[spinosauroidea|spinosauroids]], and [[carnosauria]]ns, and herbivores consisting of [[stegosauria]]n ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of North America and [[Tendaguru|Tendaguru Beds]] of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized [[sinraptoridae|sinraptorid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.<ref name=HCL04/> [[Ankylosauria]]ns and [[ornithopoda|ornithopods]] were also becoming more common, but [[prosauropods]] had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.<ref name=FS04/> Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns.<ref name=KP04/>\n[[File:Marasuchus.JPG|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Marasuchus lilloensis]]'', a dinosaur-like [[avemetatarsalia|ornithodiran]]]]\nBy the early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, [[iguanodontia]]ns, and [[brachiosauridae|brachiosaurids]] through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large [[spinosaurid]] and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia, maniraptoran coelurosaurians like [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early [[ceratopsia]]ns like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.<ref name=HCL04/> The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late early Cretaceous or early late Cretaceous. A major change in the early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[angiosperm|flowering plants]]. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with [[Dinosaur dental histology|tooth batteries]], taken to its extreme in [[hadrosaurid]]s.<ref name=FS04/> Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.<ref name=serenoetal07/>\n[[File:Herrerasaurusskeleton.jpg|thumb|alt=Full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur, displayed in a glass case in a museum|The early forms ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' (large), ''[[Eoraptor]]'' (small) and a ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' skull]]\nThere were three general dinosaur faunas in the late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and [[pachycephalosauria]]ns. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, [[rhabdodontidae|rhabdodontid]] iguanodontians, [[nodosauridae|nodosaurid]] ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent.<ref name=HCL04/> Flowering plants were greatly radiating,<ref name=FS04/> with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name=PSAS05/> Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia.

There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in crocodiles (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar [[ecological niche]]s.<ref name=dinobiomechanics/>\n\nThe first potential evidence for [[herd]]ing or [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&nbsp;''[[Iguanodon bernissartensis]]'', ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.<ref name=Yans/> Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that [[Hadrosaurid|duck-bills]] (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison]] or the African [[Springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,<ref name=Day2002/> although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.<ref name=JLW05/> Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.<ref name=DVetal08sino/> The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.<ref name=LG93/><ref name=\"maxwell&ostrom1995\"/> However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, [[crocodile]]s, and other reptiles, and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern [[diapsid]] predators.<ref name=RB07/>\n\n[[File:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of two ''[[Centrosaurus|Centrosaurus apertus]]'' engaged in intra-specific combat]]\nThe crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, [[Theropoda|theropods]] and [[lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.<ref name=PC98/>\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',<ref name=AMNH/> providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.<ref name=carpenter1998/> Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.<ref name=carpenter1998/> [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.<ref name=rogersetal2003/>\n\nComparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral rings]] of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized [[herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[omnivore|omnivorous]] dinosaurs such as [[ceratopsia]]ns, [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]], [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurids]], [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small [[ornithischia]]n ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].<ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/>\n\nBased on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.<ref name=VMK07/> Many modern birds are [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the [[enantiornithine]]s.<ref>Chiappe, L.M. and Witmer, L.M. (2002). ''Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-20094-2}}</ref> While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''[[Microraptor]]''<ref name=chatterjee2007/>) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], pioneered by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]], has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,<ref name=alexander2006/> whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,<ref name=goriely/> and whether sauropods could float.<ref name=Henderson2006/>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a striking and unusual visual display in a ''[[Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus magnicristatus]]'']]\nModern birds are known to [[Animal communication|communicate]] using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.<ref name=senter2008/> Reconstruction of the plumage color of ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Li2010\"/> The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged [[maniraptora]]n dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the [[larynx]] and the latter through the unique [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\nThe earliest remains of a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, was found in a specimen of the [[duck]]-like ''[[Vegavis iaai]]'' dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently.<ref name=\"Clarke2016\"/> A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.<ref name=\"Tobias2016\"/> The crests of the [[Lambeosaurini]] and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in [[vocal resonance]],<ref name=\"Weishampel981\"/><ref name=\"Witmer\"/> though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\n===Reproductive biology===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n[[File:Gniazdo sieweczki RB.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three bluish eggs with black speckling sit atop a layer of white mollusk shell pieces, surrounded by sandy ground and small bits of bluish stone|Nest of a [[plover]] (''[[Charadrius]]'')]]\n\nAll dinosaurs lay [[amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs | publisher=Academic Press | editor=Currie, Philip J |editor2=Kevin Padian | year=1997 | page=206}}</ref> Eggs are usually laid in a [[Bird nest|nest]].

Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as ''[[Troodon]]'', exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.<ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Varricchio | first1 = David J. | last2 = Horner | first2 = John J. | last3 = Jackson | first3 = Frankie D. | year = 2002 | title = Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 564\u2013576 }}</ref>\n\nWhen laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs.

Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.<ref name=LW08/>\n\n[[File:Citipati IGM 100 979.jpg|thumb|Fossil interpreted as a nesting [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'' at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

Some scientists propose that the meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson |first=D.S. |title=Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |date=30 September 2003 |volume=116 |issue=5/6 |pages=760\u2013768 |doi=10.1130/B25402.1 |url=http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |accessdate=15 June 2011 |bibcode=2004GSAB..116..760R |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918141759/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Deccan Traps===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] -->\n{{Main|Deccan Traps}}\n\nBefore 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the [[extinction]] were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]] and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66&nbsp;million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.<ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe [[Deccan Traps]] in [[India]] could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosols, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions, which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.<ref name=Duncan/> Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es during the formation of the [[Deccan Traps]] \"contributed to an apparently massive global warming. Some data point to an average rise in temperature of {{convert|8|C-change|F-change}} in the last half million years before the [[Chicxulub Crater|impact [at Chicxulub]]].\"<ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nIn the years when the [[Deccan Traps]] theory was linked to a slower extinction, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] (who died in 1988) replied that [[paleontologists]] were being misled by [[Signor\u2013Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even [[Walter Alvarez]] has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian [[Deccan Traps]], and these may have contributed to the extinctions.<ref name=Alvarez1997/>\n\n===Possible Paleocene survivors===\n{{Main|Paleocene dinosaurs}}\nNon-avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]]. In 2001, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]] leg-bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, and described it as evidence of [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early [[Paleocene]] epoch, approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that [[stratum]] by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era.<ref name=Fassett/> Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] up to {{convert|1.3|m|in|abbr=on}} above the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary, representing {{gaps|40|000}}&nbsp;years of elapsed time. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China.<ref name=Sloan/> Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.<ref name=FS05/><ref name=Sullivan/> Direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with U\u2013Pb dating methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 \u00b1 0.9 million years ago.<ref name=fassettetall2011/> If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.<ref name=FS05/>\n\n==History of study==\n{{Further|History of paleontology}}\nDinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese considered them to be [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] [[bone]]s and documented them as such. For example, ''[[Hua Yang Guo Zhi]]'', a book written by [[Chang Qu]] during the [[Western Jin Dynasty]] (265\u2013316), reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in [[Sichuan]] Province.<ref name=dong1992/> Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized \"dragon bones\" for use in [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medicines]], a practice that continues today.<ref name=BBCdinobonemed/> In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] and other biblical creatures.<ref name=benton2000>Benton, M.J. (2000). \"A brief history of dinosaur paleontology\". pp.&nbsp;10\u201344, In Paul, G.S. (ed.). ''The Scientific American book of dinosaurs''. St. Martin's Press, New York.</ref>\n\nScholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in [[England]]. Part of a bone, now known to have been the [[femur]] of a ''[[Megalosaurus]]'',<ref name=WAS97/> was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near [[Chipping Norton]], [[Oxfordshire]], in 1676. The fragment was sent to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description in his ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'' in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the [[femur]] of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the [[Bible]]. In 1699, [[Edward Lhuyd]], a friend of [[Sir Isaac Newton]], was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a [[sauropod]] [[tooth]], \"[[Rutellum|Rutellum implicatum]]\",<ref name=L99/><ref name=DS02/> that had been found in Caswell, near Witney, Oxfordshire.<ref name=G45/>\n\n[[File:William Buckland detail.png|thumb|left|[[William Buckland]]]]\nBetween 1815 and 1824, the Rev [[William Buckland]], a professor of [[geology]] at Oxford, collected more fossilized bones of ''Megalosaurus'' and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a [[scientific journal]].<ref name=WAS97/><ref name=buckland1824/> The second dinosaur genus to be identified, ''[[Iguanodon]]'', was discovered in 1822 by [[Mary Ann Mantell]]&nbsp;\u2013 the wife of English geologist [[Gideon Mantell]]. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern [[iguana]]s. He published his findings in 1825.<ref name=GM25/><ref name=HDS97/>\n\nThe study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist [[Richard Owen]] coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, ''Iguanodon'', ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of [[Queen Victoria]], Owen established the [[Natural History Museum, London]], to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.<ref name=owen94>Rupke, N. (1994). ''Richard Owen: A Victorian Naturalist''. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1858, [[William Parker Foulke]] discovered the first known American dinosaur, in [[marl]] pits in the small town of [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]]. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]]''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a [[bipedal]] creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the [[United States]].<ref name=weishampel06>{{cite journal | last1 = Prieto-Marques | first1 = A. | last2 = Weishampel | first2 = D.B. | last3 = Horner | first3 = J.R. | year = 2006 | title = The dinosaur ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', from the Campanian of the East Coast of North America, with a reevaluation of the genus | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 77\u201398 }}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image\n|width=130\n|image1=Edcope.jpg|caption1=[[Edward Drinker Cope]]\n|image2=OthnielCharlesMarsh.jpg|caption2=[[Othniel Charles Marsh]]}}\n[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1896 illustration of the bones of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a dinosaur he described and named in 1877]]\nDinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the [[plesiosaur]]'s head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the [[US Geological Survey]]. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City|New York]], while Marsh's is on display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nAfter 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent, including [[Antarctica]].

[[Vertebrate paleontology]] has become a global [[science]].

Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]], Italy]]\nOne of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in [[Pietraroja|Pietraroia, Italy]]. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young [[coelurosaur]], ''[[Scipionyx samniticus]]''. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.<ref name=\"softtissue\" />\n\nIn the March 2005 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the paleontologist [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]] and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' leg bone from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]]. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/> When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as [[blood vessel]]s, [[bone matrix]], and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/>\n\nIn 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a [[Hadrosaurid|duck-billed dinosaur]], ''[[Brachylophosaurus canadensis]]'', found in the [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]]. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells. Among other materials found in the bone was [[collagen]], as in the ''Tyrannosaurus'' bone. The type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its DNA and, in both cases, this collagen was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostriches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |author=Evershed, Nick |title=Blood, tissue extracted from duck-billed dinosaur bone |work=Cosmosmagazine.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215044640/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |archivedate=2016-02-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions;<ref name=bone>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schweitzer MH, Zheng W, Cleland TP, Bern M |title=Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules |journal=Bone |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=414\u2013423 |date=January 2013 |pmid=23085295 |doi= 10.1016/j.bone.2012.10.010}}</ref> upon further inspection and [[peer review]], however, neither of these reports could be confirmed.<ref name=Wangetal1997/> However, a functional [[peptide]] involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds.<ref name=changetal2002/> In addition, several [[protein]]s, including [[hemoglobin]],<ref name=Schweitzeretal1997/> have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils.<ref name=Emberyatal2003/><ref>\n{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Peterson | first1 = JE | last2 = Lenczewski | first2 = ME | last3 = Reed | first3 = PS\n  | title = Influence of Microbial Biofilms on the Preservation of Primary Soft Tissue in Fossil and Extant Archosaurs\n  | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5\n  | issue = 10\n  | pages = 13A\n  | date = October 2010\n  | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013334\n  | editor1-last = Stepanova\n  | editor1-first = Anna|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513334P | pmid=20967227 | pmc=2953520}} {{open access}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 2015, researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers, preserved in the bone fossils of six Cretaceous dinosaur specimens, which are approximately 75 million years old.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million-year-old dinosaur specimens|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150609/ncomms8352/full/ncomms8352.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = June 9, 2015|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms8352|first = Sergio|last = Bertazzo|first2 = Susannah C.R.|last2 = Maidment|first3 = Charalambos|last3 = Kallepitis|first4 = Sarah|last4 = Fearn|first5 = Molly M.|last5 = Stevens|first6 = Hai-nan|last6 = Xie|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E7352B|page=7352|pmid=26056764|pmc=4468865}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Scientists discover 75-million-year-old dinosaur blood and tissue|url = http://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/|accessdate = 2015-06-10|first = Nicole|last = Mortillaro|date = 2015-06-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Iguanodon Crystal Palace.jpg|thumb|Outdated ''[[Iguanodon]]'' statues created by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] for the Crystal Palace Park in 1853]]\n[[File:Triceratops-vs-T-Rex001.jpg|thumb|The battles that may have occurred between ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'' are a recurring theme in [[popular science]] and dinosaurs' depiction in culture.]]\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}\nBy human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word \"dinosaur\" into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, \"dinosaur\" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.<ref name=\"m-w\"/>\n\nPublic enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] were unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Museum#Natural history museums|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.<ref name=torrens1993/> Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the [[Bone Wars]] of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.<ref name=breithaupt1997/>\n\nThe popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]], and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens]]{{'}} ''[[Bleak House]]'',<ref name=bleakhouse/> dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the 1954 ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in [[advertising]]; numerous [[Company (law)|companies]] have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted, or obsolete.<ref name=DFGlut1997/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Animal track]]\n* [[Dinosaur diet and feeding]]\n* [[Evolutionary history of life]]\n* [[Lists of dinosaur-bearing stratigraphic units]]\n* [[List of dinosaur genera]]\n* [[List of unavailable dinosaur genera]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=AF02>{{cite journal |last=Feduccia |first=A. |year=2002 |title=Birds are dinosaurs: simple answer to a complex problem |journal=The Auk |volume=119 |pages=1187\u20131201 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[1187:BADSAT]2.0.CO;2 |issue=4}}</ref>\n<ref name=AF04>{{cite book |last=Archibald |first=J.

In contrast, [[paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetic]] materials are attracted by a magnetic field. '''Diamagnetism''' is a [[quantum mechanical]] effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism, the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of [[magnetic dipole]]s in the material. The [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] of diamagnetic materials is less than \u03bc<sub>0</sub>, the permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a [[superconductivity|superconductor]] acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.\n[[File:Diamagnetic material interaction in magnetic field.png|alt=On keeping diamagnetic materials in a magnetic field, the electron orbital motion changes in such a way that magnetic dipole moments are induced on the atoms / molecules in the direction opposite to the external magnetic field as shown in figure|thumb|349x349px|Dimagnetic material interaction in [[magnetic field]].]]\nDiamagnetism was first discovered when [[Sebald Justinus Brugmans]] observed in 1778 that [[bismuth]] and [[antimony]] were repelled by magnetic fields. In 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] demonstrated that it was a property of matter and concluded that every material responded (in either a diamagnetic or paramagnetic way) to an applied magnetic field. On a suggestion by [[William Whewell]], Faraday first referred to the phenomenon as ''diamagnetic'' (the prefix ''dia-'' meaning ''through'' or ''across''), then later changed it to ''diamagnetism''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Roland |date=21 July 2014 |title=John Tyndall and the Early History of Diamagnetism |journal=Annals of Science |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=435\u2013489 |doi=10.1080/00033790.2014.929743 |pmid=26221835 |pmc=4524391 }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |date=June 2017 |title=diamagnetic, adj. and n |encyclopedia=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n== Materials ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"float:right;\"\n|+Notable diamagnetic materials<ref name=hyper>{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl L. |title=Magnetic Properties of Solids |website=Hyper Physics |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/tables/magprop.html |accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref>\n!Material!! \u03c7<sub>v</sub> [&times; 10<sup>\u22125</sup> (SI units)]\n|-\n|Superconductor\n| \u221210<sup>5</sup>\n|-\n|[[Pyrolytic carbon]]\n| \u221240.9\n|-\n|[[Bismuth]]\n| \u221216.6\n|-\n|[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]\n| \u22122.9\n|-\n|[[Silver]]\n| \u22122.6\n|-\n|[[Diamond|Carbon (diamond)]]\n| \u22122.1\n|-\n|[[Lead]]\n| \u22121.8\n|-\n|[[Graphite|Carbon (graphite)]]\n| \u22121.6\n|-\n|[[Copper]]\n| \u22121.0\n|-\n|[[Water]]\n| \u22120.91\n|}\nDiamagnetism is a property of all materials, and always makes a weak contribution to the material's response to a magnetic field. However, other forms of magnetism (such as [[ferromagnetism]] or [[paramagnetism]]) are so much stronger that when multiple different forms of magnetism are present in a material, the diamagnetic contribution is usually negligible. Substances where the  diamagnetic behaviour is the strongest effect are termed diamagnetic materials, or diamagnets. Diamagnetic materials are those that laypeople generally think of as ''non-magnetic'', and include [[Water (properties)|water]], [[wood]], most organic compounds such as petroleum and some plastics, and many metals including [[copper]], particularly the heavy ones with many [[core electrons]], such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[gold]] and [[bismuth]]. The magnetic susceptibility values of various molecular fragments are called [[Pascal's constants]].\n\nDiamagnetic materials, like water, or water-based materials, have a relative magnetic permeability that is less than or equal to 1, and therefore a [[magnetic susceptibility]] less than or equal to 0, since susceptibility is defined as {{nowrap|\u03c7<sub>v</sub> {{=}} \u03bc<sub>v</sub> \u2212 1}}. This means that diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields. However, since diamagnetism is such a weak property, its effects are not observable in everyday life. For example, the magnetic susceptibility of diamagnets such as water is {{nowrap|\u03c7<sub>v</sub> {{=}} {{val|-9.05|e=-6}}}}. The most strongly diamagnetic material is [[bismuth]], {{nowrap|\u03c7<sub>v</sub> {{=}} {{val|-1.66|e=-4}}}}, although [[pyrolytic carbon]] may have a susceptibility of  {{nowrap|\u03c7<sub>v</sub> {{=}} {{val|-4.00|e=-4}}}} in one plane. Nevertheless, these values are orders of magnitude smaller than the magnetism exhibited by paramagnets and ferromagnets. Note that because \u03c7<sub>v</sub> is derived from the ratio of the internal magnetic field to the applied field, it is a dimensionless value.\n\nAll conductors exhibit an effective diamagnetism when they experience a changing magnetic field. The [[Lorentz force]] on electrons causes them to circulate around forming [[eddy currents]]. The eddy currents then produce an induced magnetic field opposite the applied field, resisting the conductor's motion.\n\nIn rare cases, the diamagnetic contribution can be stronger than paramagnetic contribution. As is the case for [[gold]], which has a magnetic susceptibility less than 0, so is by definition a diamagnetic material, but when measured carefully with [[X-ray magnetic circular dichroism]], shows an extremely weak paramagnetic contribution that is overcome by a stronger diamagnetic contribution.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.047201|publisher=Physical Review Letters|author=Motohiro Suzuki, Naomi Kawamura, Hayato Miyagawa, Jose S.

[[Earnshaw's theorem]] seems to preclude the possibility of static magnetic levitation. However, Earnshaw's theorem applies only to objects with positive susceptibilities, such as ferromagnets (which have a permanent positive moment) and paramagnets (which induce a positive moment). These are attracted to field maxima, which do not exist in free space.

Thus it might be imagined that diamagnetism effects in general would be common, since any applied magnetic field would generate currents in these loops that would oppose the change, in a similar way to superconductors, which are essentially perfect diamagnets. However, since the electrons are rigidly held in orbitals by the charge of the protons and are further constrained by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], many materials exhibit diamagnetism, but typically respond very little to the applied field.\n\nThe [[Bohr\u2013van Leeuwen theorem]] proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or paramagnetism in a purely classical system. However, the classical theory of Langevin for diamagnetism gives the same prediction as the quantum theory.<ref name=Kittel>{{cite book  |last = Kittel |first = Charles |author-link=Charles Kittel |title = Introduction to Solid State Physics |publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] |edition = 6th |year = 1986  |pages= 299\u2013302|isbn = 978-0-471-87474-4}}</ref> The classical theory is given below.\n\n=== Langevin diamagnetism ===\n\n[[Paul Langevin]]'s theory of diamagnetism (1905)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langevin|first=Paul|author-link=Paul Langevin|date=1905|title=Sur la th\u00e9orie du magn\u00e9tisme|journal=Journal de Physique Th\u00e9orique et Appliqu\u00e9e|language=fr|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1051/jphystap:019050040067800&lang=fr|issn=0368-3893|doi-broken-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> applies to materials containing atoms with closed shells (see [[dielectrics]]).

It was created by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1702 for [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough]] (1650\u20131722), the noted military leader. In historical texts, it is often to him that an unqualified use of the title refers. The name of the dukedom refers to [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] in [[Wiltshire]]. It is one of the few titles in the peerage which allows for ''[[suo jure]]'' female inheritance, and the only current dukedom to do so.\n\nThe [[Earl of Marlborough|earldom of Marlborough]] was held by the family of Ley from its creation 1626 until its extinction with the death of the 4th earl in 1679. The title was recreated 10 years later for John Churchill (in 1689).\n\n==History of the Dukedom==\nChurchill had been made ''Lord Churchill of [[Eyemouth]]'' (1682) in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[peerage]], and ''Baron Churchill'' of [[Sandridge]] (1685) and ''Earl of Marlborough'' (1689) in the [[Peerage of England]]. Shortly after her accession to the throne in 1702, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] made Churchill the first ''Duke of Marlborough'' and granted him the subsidiary title ''Marquess of [[Blandford]]''.\n\nIn 1678, Churchill married [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Jennings]] (1660\u20131744), a courtier and influential favourite of the queen. They had seven children, of whom four daughters married into some of the most important families in [[Great Britain]];<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Family Lineage: Duke of Marlborough\n| publisher = [[Burke's Peerage]]\n|date=August 2004\n| url = http://www.burkes-peerage.net/Search/FullRecord.aspx?ID=9123\n| accessdate = 2007-08-06 }}</ref> one daughter and one son died in infancy. He was pre-deceased by his son, [[John Churchill, Marquess of Blandford]], in 1703; so, to prevent the extinction of the titles, a special [[Act of Parliament]] was passed. When the 1st Duke of Marlborough died in 1722 his title as ''Lord Churchill of Eyemouth'' in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[peerage]] became extinct and the Marlborough titles passed, according to the Act, to his eldest daughter [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|Henrietta]] (1681\u20131733), the 2nd Duchess of Marlborough. She was married to the [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|2nd Earl of Godolphin]] and had a son who predeceased her.\n\nWhen Henrietta died in 1733, the Marlborough titles passed to her nephew [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough|Charles Spencer]] (1706\u20131758), the third son of her late sister [[Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1683-1716)|Anne]] (1683\u20131716), who had married the [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|3rd Earl of Sunderland]] in 1699. After his older brother's death in 1729, Charles Spencer had already inherited the [[Spencer family]] estates and the titles of ''[[Earl of Sunderland]]'' (1643) and ''Baron Spencer'' of [[Wormleighton Manor|Wormleighton]] (1603), all in the [[Peerage of England]]. Upon his maternal aunt Henrietta's death in 1733, Charles  Spencer succeeded to the Marlborough family estates and titles and became the 3rd Duke. When he died in 1758, his titles passed to his eldest son [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|George]] (1739\u20131817), who was succeeded by his eldest son George, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|5th Duke]] (1766\u20131840). In 1815, [[Francis Spencer, 1st Baron Churchill|Francis Spencer]] (the younger son of the [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|4th Duke]]) was created ''[[Baron Churchill of Whichwood|Baron Churchill]]'' in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1902, his grandson, the [[Victor Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill|3rd Baron Churchill]], was created ''[[Viscount Churchill]]''.\n\nIn 1817, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|5th Duke]] obtained permission to assume and bear the [[surname]] of Churchill in addition to his surname of [[Spencer family|Spencer]], to perpetuate the name of his illustrious great-great-grandfather. At the same time he received [[Royal Licence]] to quarter the [[coat of arms]] of Churchill with his paternal arms of Spencer.<ref name=\"Courtenay \">Paul Courtenay, The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/reference/the-armorial-bearings-of-sir-winston-churchill The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill] (accessed 20 July 2013).</ref> The modern Dukes thus originally bore the surname \"Spencer\": the [[double-barrelled name|double-barrelled surname]] of \"Spencer-Churchill\" as used since 1817 remains in the family, though some members have preferred to style themselves \"Churchill\".\n\nThe 7th Duke was the paternal grandfather of the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]], born at [[Blenheim Palace]] on 30 November 1874.\n\nThe 11th Duke, [[John Spencer-Churchill, 11th Duke of Marlborough|John Spencer-Churchill]] died in 2014, having assumed the title in 1972. The 12th and present Duke is [[Jamie Spencer-Churchill, 12th Duke of Marlborough|Charles James Spencer-Churchill]].\n\n==Family seat==\n[[File:Blenheim Palace IMG 3675.JPG|thumb|Burial place of most Dukes and Duchesses of Marlborough in the chapel at [[Blenheim Palace]].]]\nThe family seat is [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], [[Oxfordshire]].\n\nAfter his leadership in the victory against the [[France|French]] in the [[Battle of Blenheim]] on 13 August 1704, the 1st Duke was honoured by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] granting him the royal manor of [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], and building him a house at her expense to be called Blenheim. Construction started in 1705 and the house was completed in 1722, the year of the 1st Duke's death. Blenheim Palace has since remained in the Churchill and Spencer-Churchill family.\n\nWith the exception of the [[John Spencer-Churchill, 10th Duke of Marlborough|10th Duke]] and his first wife, the Dukes and Duchesses of Marlborough are buried in Blenheim Palace's chapel. Most other members of the Spencer-Churchill family are interred in [[St Martin's Church, Bladon|St. Martin's parish churchyard]] at [[Bladon]], a short distance from the palace.\n\n==Succession to the title==\nThe dukedom is the only one in the [[United Kingdom]] that can still pass through a female line. However, unlike the remainder to [[Hereditary peer#Writ of Summons|heirs general]] found in most other peerages that allow [[male-preference primogeniture]], the grant does not allow for [[Abeyance#Peerage law|abeyance]] and follows a more restrictive [[Semi-Salic]] formula designed to keep succession wherever possible in the male line. The succession is as follows:\n\n# The heirs-male of the 1st Duke's body lawfully begotten;\n# his eldest daughter and the heirs-male of her body lawfully begotten;\n# his second and other daughters, in seniority, and the heirs-male of their bodies lawfully begotten;\n# his eldest daughter's oldest daughter and the heirs male of her body lawfully begotten;\n# his eldest daughter's second and other daughters, in seniority, and the heirs-male of their bodies lawfully begotten\n# all other daughters of his daughters, in seniority, and the heirs-male of their bodies lawfully begotten;\n# and other descendants into the future in like fashion, with the intent that the Marlborough title never become extinct.\n\nSuccession to the title under the first and second contingencies have lapsed;

The Duke's eldest son's eldest son can use the courtesy title ''Earl of Sunderland'', and the duke's eldest son's eldest son's eldest son (not necessarily the eldest great-grandson) the title ''Lord Spencer of Wormleighton'' (not to be confused with [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earl Spencer]]).\n\nThe title of ''Earl of Marlborough'', created for John Churchill in 1689, had previously been created for [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]], in 1626, becoming extinct in 1679.\n\n===Foreign titles===\nThe 1st Duke was honoured with land and titles in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] created him a [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire|Prince]] in 1704, and in 1705, his successor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph I]] gave him the [[principality of Mindelheim]] (once the lordship of the noted soldier [[Georg von Frundsberg]]). He was obliged to surrender Mindelheim in 1714 by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which returned it to [[Bavaria]]. He tried to obtain [[Nellenburg]] in Austria in exchange, which at that time was only a county ('Landgrafschaft'), but this failed, partially because Austrian law did not allow for Nellenburg being converted into a sovereign principality.<ref>William Coxe, ''Herzogs Johann von Marlborough Leben und Denkw\u00fcrdigkeiten'', vol. 6, Vienna 1822, pp. 297-8.</ref> The 1st Duke's principality title of Mindelheim became extinct either on the return of the land to Bavaria or on his death, as the Empire operated Salic Law, which prevented female succession.\n\n==Coats of arms==\n\n===Original arms of the Churchill family===\n\nThe original arms of Sir [[Winston Churchill (1620\u20131688)]], father of the 1st Duke of Marlborough, were simple and in use by his own father in 1619. The shield was Sable a lion rampant Argent, debruised by a bendlet Gules. The addition of a [[St George's cross|canton of Saint George]] (see below) rendered the distinguishing mark of the bendlet unnecessary.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\nThe Churchill crest is blazoned as a lion couchant guardant Argent, supporting with its dexter forepaw a banner Gules, charged with a dexter hand appaum\u00e9e of the first, staff Or.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\nIn recognition of Sir Winston's services to King Charles I as Captain of the Horse, and his loyalty to King Charles II as a Member of Parliament, he was awarded an [[augmentation of honour]] to his arms around 1662. This rare mark of royal favour took the form of a [[St George's cross|canton of Saint George]]. At the same time, he was authorised to omit the bendlet, which had served the purpose of distinguishing this branch of the Churchill family from others which bore an undifferenced lion.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\n===Arms of the 1st Duke of Marlborough===\n\nSir Winston's shield and crest were inherited by his son [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]]. Minor modifications reflected the bearer's social rise: the helm was now shown in profile and had a closed grille to signify the bearer's rank as a peer, and there were now supporters placed on either side of the shield. They were the mythical [[Griffin]] (part lion, part eagle) and [[Wyvern]] (a dragon without hind legs).<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/> The supporters were derived from the arms of the family of the 1st Duke's mother, Drake of [[Ash, Musbury|Ash]] (Argent, a wyvern gules; these arms can be seen on the monument in Musbury Church to Sir [[Bernard Drake]], d.1586).\n\nThe motto was ''Fiel pero desdichado'' (Spanish for \"Faithful but unfortunate\").<ref name=\"Robson, Thomas 1830, p 401\">Robson, Thomas, ''The British Herald, or Cabinet of Armorial Bearings of the Nobility & Gentry of Great Britain & Ireland'', Volume I, Turner & Marwood, Sunderland, 1830, p. 401 (CHU-CLA).</ref> The 1st Duke was also entitled to a [[coronet]] indicating his rank.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\nWhen the 1st Duke was made a [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1705, two unusual features were added: the Imperial Eagle and a Princely Coronet.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/> His estates in Germany, such as [[Mindelheim]], were represented in his arms by additional quarterings.\n\n===Arms of the Spencer-Churchill family===\n\nIn 1817, the 5th Duke received Royal Licence to place the quarter of Churchill ahead of his paternal arms of Spencer.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/> The shield of the [[Spencer family]] arms is: quarterly Argent and Gules, in the second and third quarters a fret Or, over all on a bend Sable three escallops of the first. The Spencer crest is: out of a ducal coronet Or, a griffin's head between two wings expanded Argent, gorged with a collar gemel and armed Gules.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/> Paul Courtenay observes that \"It would be normal in these circumstances for the paternal arms (Spencer) to take precedence over the maternal (Churchill), but because the Marlborough dukedom was senior to the Sunderland earldom, the procedure was reversed in this case.\"<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\nAlso in 1817, a further [[augmentation of honour]] was added to his armorial achievement. This incorporated the bearings from the standard of the Manor of Woodstock and was borne on an escutcheon, displayed over all in the centre chief point, as follows: Argent a cross of [[St George's cross|Saint George]] surmounted by an [[inescutcheon]] Azure, charged with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, two over one. This inescutcheon represents the royal arms of France.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\nThese quartered arms, incorporating the two augmentations of honour, have been the arms of all subsequent Dukes of Marlborough.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\n===Motto===\nThe [[motto]] ''Fiel pero desdichado'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"Faithful though Joyless\". \"Desdichado\" means without happiness or without joy, alluding to the first Duke's father, [[Winston Churchill (1620\u20131688)|Winston]], who was a royalist and faithful supporter of the king during the [[English Civil War]] but was not compensated for his losses after the restoration. Charles II [[knight]]ed Winston Churchill and other Civil War royalists but did not compensate them for their wartime losses, thereby inducing Winston to adopt the motto. It is unusual for the motto of an Englishman of the era to be in Spanish rather than [[Latin]], and it is not known why this is the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/fielpero.html |title=Churchill's Motto |publisher=Churchill Society of London |accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nCoat of arms of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough.svg|Arms of [[Winston Churchill (1620\u20131688)|Sir Winston Churchill]], father of the 1st Duke\n1st Duke of Marlborough arms.png|Arms of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], with quarterings representing his estates in Germany\nMarlboroughCoatOfArms.jpg|Simple arms of the [[Spencer family|Spencer]] Dukes of Marlborough before they changed their name to \"Spencer-Churchill\" and took the modern arms\nFile:Coat of arms of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough, KG, PC.png|Arms of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough, KG, PC\nGeorge Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough Color.jpg|Arms of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough \nFile:Coat of arms of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough, KG, PC, FRS.png|Arms of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough, KG, PC, FRS\nFile:Coat of arms of John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, KG, PC.png|Arms of John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, KG, PC\nArms of Winston Churchill.svg|Shield of the Spencer-Churchill Dukes of Marlborough since 1817\nFile:Coat of Arms of Winston Churchill as a Gentleman.svg|Arms of [[Winston Churchill]] (or any Spencer-Churchill) as a [[gentleman]]\nCoat of Arms of Winston Churchill.svg|Arms of Sir Winston Churchill, grandson of the 7th Duke, as a Knight of the Garter showing the Spencer-Churchill arms and both crests\n</gallery>\n\n===Achievement===\n\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image=Coat of arms of the duke of Marlborough.png\n|year_adopted = 1817 (by the 5th Duke of Marlborough)\n|coronet = [[Coronet#British coronet rankings|The coronet of a Duke]]<br>[[Furst|Princely hat]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|crest = 1st: a lion couchant guardant Argent supporting a banner Gules charged with a dexter hand couped Argent (Churchill) <br> 2nd: out of a ducal coronet Or a griffin's head between two wings expanded Argent gorged with a collar gemel and armed Gules (Spencer)\n|escutcheon = Quarterly:  1st and 4th, Sable a lion rampant Argent, on a canton of the second a cross Gules (Churchill);  2nd and 3rd, quarterly Argent and Gules a fret Or, over all on a bend Sable three Escallops of the first (Spencer); over all in the centre chief point (as an [[augmentation of honour]]) an escutcheon Argent charged with the cross of [[St George's cross|Saint George]] surmounted by an inescutcheon Azure charged with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, two over one \n|supporters = On either side, a [[wyvern]] wings elevated Gules<br> Behind, the [[Reichsadler|Imperial eagle]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|motto =''FIEL PERO DESDICHADO'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"FAITHFUL THOUGH JOYLESS\")\n}}\n\n==List of title holders==\n\n===Earls of Marlborough, first creation (1626\u20131679) ===\n{{main|Earl of Marlborough}}\nThe earldom of Marlborough was held by the family of Ley from 1626 to 1679.

In 1624 he was created Baron Ley and in 1626 Earl of Marlborough. The 3rd earl was his grandson [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|James]] (1618\u20131665), a naval officer who was killed in action with the Dutch.

Notice how the wheels are mirrored, with counting up from left-to-right, or counting down from left-to-right. Also notice the metal tab between \"6\" and \"7\".

In 1832, Babbage and [[Joseph Clement]] produced a small working model (1/7 of the calculating section of Difference Engine No. 1,<ref name=\":0\" /> which was intended to operate on 20-digit numbers and sixth-order differences) which operated on 6-digit numbers and second-order differences.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqrItgm351EC&lpg=PA204&dq=Difference%20Engine%20No.%202%20order&hl=en&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q=Difference%20Engine%20No.%202%20order&f=false|title=A Brief History of Computing|last=O'Regan|first=Gerard|date=2012-03-05|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=|isbn=9781447123590|location=|pages=204|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JckCvpOQDOoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=difference%20engine&f=false|title=The Philosophical Breakfast Club: Four Remarkable Friends Who Transformed Science and Changed the World|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|date=2011-02-22|publisher=Crown/Archetype|year=|isbn=9780307716170|location=|pages=192, 210, 217|language=en}}</ref> [[Lady Byron]] described seeing the working prototype in 1833: \"We both went to see the thinking machine (for so it seems) last Monday.

Once completed, both the engine and its printer worked flawlessly, and still do. The difference engine and printer were constructed to tolerances achievable with 19th-century technology, resolving a long-standing debate as to whether Babbage's design would actually have worked. (One of the reasons formerly advanced for the non-completion of Babbage's engines had been that engineering methods were insufficiently developed in the Victorian era.)\n\nThe printer's primary purpose is to produce [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]] plates for use in printing presses, which it does by pressing type into soft plaster to create a [[flong]].

The machine is able to store one decimal number in each column. The machine can only add the value of a column ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 to column ''n'' to produce the new value of ''n''. Column ''N'' can only store a [[wiktionary:Constant|constant]], column 1 displays (and possibly [[Computer printer|prints]]) the value of the calculation on the current [[iteration]].\n\nThe engine is programmed by setting initial values to the columns. Column 1 is set to the value of the polynomial at the start of computation. Column 2 is set to a value derived from the first and higher [[derivative]]s of the polynomial at the same value of '''''X'''''. Each of the columns from 3 to ''N'' is set to a value derived from the <math>(n-1)</math> first and higher derivatives of the polynomial.\n\n=== Timing ===\nIn the Babbage design, one iteration (i.e., one full set of addition and [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]] operations) happens for each rotation of the main shaft. Odd and even columns alternately perform an addition in one cycle. The sequence of operations for column <math>n</math> is thus:\n\n# Count up, receiving the value from column <math>n+1</math> (Addition step)\n# Perform [[carry propagation]] on the counted up value\n# Count down to zero, adding to column <math>n-1</math>\n# Reset the counted-down value to its original value\n\nSteps 1,2,3,4 occur for every odd column, while steps 3,4,1,2 occur for every even column.\n\nWhile Babbage's original design placed the crank directly on the main shaft, it was later realized that the force required to crank the machine would have been too great for a human to handle comfortably. Therefore, the two models that were built incorporate a 4:1 reduction gear at the crank, and four revolutions of the crank are required to perform one full cycle.\n\n=== Steps ===\nEach iteration creates a new result, and is accomplished in four steps corresponding to four complete turns of the handle shown at the far right in the picture below. The four steps are:\n\n* Step 1. All even numbered columns (2,4,6,8) are added to all odd numbered columns (1,3,5,7) simultaneously. An interior sweep arm turns each even column to cause whatever number is on each wheel to count down to zero. As a wheel turns to zero, it transfers its value to a sector gear located between the odd/even columns. These values are transferred to the odd column causing them to count up. Any odd column value that passes from \"9\" to \"0\" activates a [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]] lever.\n* Step 2.  [[Carry propagation]] is accomplished by a set of spiral arms in the back that poll the carry levers in a helical manner so that a carry at any level can increment the wheel above by one. That can create a carry, which is why the arms move in a spiral. At the same time, the sector gears are returned to their original position, which causes them to increment the even column wheels back to their original values. The sector gears are double-high on one side so they can be lifted to disengage from the odd column wheels while they still remain in contact with the even column wheels.\n* Step 3. This is like Step 1, except it is odd columns (3,5,7) added to even columns (2,4,6), and column one has its values transferred by a sector gear to the print mechanism on the left end of the engine. Any even column value that passes from \"9\" to \"0\" activates a carry lever. The column 1 value, the result for the polynomial, is sent to the attached printer mechanism.\n* Step 4. This is like Step 2, but for doing carries on even columns, and returning odd columns to their original values.\n\n=== Subtraction ===\nThe engine represents negative numbers as [[Method of complements|ten's complements]]. Subtraction amounts to addition of a negative number. This works in the same manner that modern computers perform subtraction, known as [[two's complement]].\n\n== Method of differences ==\n[[File:Difference engine.JPG|thumb|320px|right|Fully operational difference engine at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]]]]\nThe principle of a difference engine is [[Newton polynomial|Newton's method]] of [[divided differences]]. If the initial value of a polynomial (and of its [[finite difference]]s) is calculated by some means for some value of '''''X''''', the difference engine can calculate any number of nearby values, using the method generally known as the '''method of finite differences'''. For example, consider the quadratic [[polynomial]]\n\n: <math>p(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 2 \\,</math>\n\nwith the goal of tabulating the values ''p''(0), ''p''(1), ''p''(2), ''p''(3), ''p''(4), and so forth. The table below is constructed as follows: the second column contains the values of the polynomial, the third column contains the differences of the two left neighbors in the second column, and the fourth column contains the differences of the two neighbors in the third column:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!x!!''p''(''x'') = 2''x''<sup>2</sup> &minus; 3''x'' + 2!!diff1(''x'') = (&nbsp;''p''(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;p(''x'') )!!diff2(''x'') = (&nbsp;diff1(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;diff1(''x'')&nbsp;)\n|-\n|0||2||\u22121||4\n|-\n|1||1||3||4\n|-\n|2||4||7||4\n|-\n|3||11||11||\n|-\n|4||22|| ||\n|}\n\nThe numbers in the third values-column are constant. In fact, by starting with any polynomial of degree ''n'', the column number ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 will always be constant. This is the crucial fact behind the success of the method.\n\nThis table was built from left to right, but it is possible to continue building it from right to left down a diagonal in order to compute more values.  To calculate ''p''(5) use the values from the lowest diagonal. Start with the fourth column constant value of 4 and copy it down the column. Then continue the third column by adding 4 to 11 to get 15. Next continue the second column by taking its previous value, 22 and adding the 15 from the third column. Thus ''p''(5) is 22&nbsp;+&nbsp;15&nbsp;=&nbsp;37.  In order to compute ''p''(6), we iterate the same algorithm on the ''p''(5) values: take 4 from the fourth column, add that to the third column's value 15 to get 19, then add that to the second column's value 37 to get 56, which is ''p''(6).  This process may be continued [[ad infinitum]]. The values of the polynomial are produced without ever having to multiply. A difference engine only needs to be able to add. From one loop to the next, it needs to store 2 numbers\u2014in this example (the last elements in the first and second columns).  To tabulate polynomials of degree ''n'', one needs sufficient storage to hold ''n'' numbers.\n\nBabbage's difference engine No. 2, finally built in 1991, could hold 8 numbers of 31 decimal digits each and could thus tabulate 7th degree polynomials to that precision. The best machines from Scheutz could store 4 numbers with 15 digits each.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqrItgm351EC&lpg=PA201&ots=SECGXk9jSd&dq=scheutz%204%20numbers%2015%20digits&pg=PA201#v=onepage&q=scheutz%204%20numbers%2015%20digits&f=false|title=A Brief History of Computing|last=O'Regan|first=Gerard|date=2012-03-05|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9781447123590|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Initial values ==\nThe initial values of columns can be calculated by first manually calculating N consecutive values of the function and by [[backtracking]], i.e. calculating the required differences.\n\nCol <math>1_0</math> gets the value of the function at the start of computation <math>f(0)</math>.

The initial values can be calculated to any degree of accuracy; if done correctly the engine will give exact results for first N steps. After that, the engine will only give an [[approximation]] of the function.\n\nThe Taylor series expresses the function as a sum obtained from its [[derivative]]s at one point.  For many functions the higher derivatives are trivial to obtain; for instance, the [[sine]] function at 0 has values of 0 or <math>\\pm1</math> for all derivatives. Setting 0 as the start of computation we get the simplified [[Maclaurin series]]\n:<math>\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infin} \\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\  x^{n}\n</math>\n\nThe same method of calculating the initial values from the coefficients can be used as for polynomial functions. The polynomial constant coefficients will now have the value\n:<math>\na_n \\equiv \\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\n</math>\n\n=== Curve fitting ===\nThe problem with the methods described above is that errors will accumulate and the series will tend to diverge from the true function. A solution which guarantees a constant maximum error is to use [[curve fitting]]. A minimum of ''N'' values are calculated evenly spaced along the range of the desired calculations. Using a curve fitting technique like [[Gaussian reduction]] an ''N''&minus;1th degree [[polynomial interpolation]] of the function is found.<ref name=\"Thelen\" /> With the optimized polynomial, the initial values can be calculated as above.\n\n== The difference engine in other works ==\nWilliam Gibson and Bruce Sterling's ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' is an alternate history<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=William|title=The Difference Engine}}</ref> novel that looks how society would have progressed had the difference engine worked the way Babbage envisioned it.\n\nThe story takes places in Victorian England where technological advancement is on the rise. This is due to the effect of the success of Babbage's analytical machine. The convention of [[steampunk]] where Victorian fashion is combined with the technological elements of the Industrial Revolution is seen throughout the story due to technology being so advanced in that era.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Computing}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ada Lovelace]]\n* [[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan Bromley]]\n* [[Analytical Engine]]\n* [[Antikythera mechanism]]\n* [[J.

The ring Draupnir is visible among other creations by the [[Sons of Ivaldi]].]]\nIn [[Norse mythology]], '''Draupnir''' ([[Old Norse]] \"the dripper\"<ref name=ORCHARD34>Orchard (1997:34).</ref>) is a gold ring possessed by the god [[Odin]] with the ability to multiply itself: Every ninth night, eight new rings 'drip' from Draupnir, each one of the same size and weight as the original.\n\nDraupnir was forged by the [[Norse dwarves|dwarven]] brothers [[Brokkr]] and [[Eitri]] (or [[Sindri (mythology)|Sindri]]). Brokkr and Eitri made this ring as one of a set of three gifts which included [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] and [[Gullinbursti]]. They made these gifts in accordance with a wager [[Loki]] made saying that Brokkr and Eitri could not make better gifts than the three made by the [[Sons of Ivaldi]]. In the end, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, won the contest for Brokkr and Eitri. Loki used a [[loophole]] to get out of the wager for his head (the wager was for Loki's head only, but he argued that, to remove his head, they would have to injure his neck, which was not in the bargain) and Brokkr punished him by sealing his lips shut with wire.\n\nThe ring was placed by Odin on the funeral pyre of his son [[Baldr]]:\n<blockquote>\nOdin laid upon the pyre the gold ring called Draupnir; this quality attended it: that every ninth night there fell from it eight gold rings of equal weight. (from the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'').\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ring was subsequently retrieved by [[Herm\u00f3\u00f0r]]. It was offered as a gift by [[Freyr]]'s servant [[Sk\u00edrnir]] in the wooing of [[Ger\u00f0r]], which is described in the poem ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nDraupnir is represented as a card in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game]]. It has an effect that mimics the multiplication ability of the mythological version. If it is destroyed by another card's effect, you can add another \"Nordic Relic\" card to your hand. The art represents it as an arm brace, with another brace seemingly growing from it, once again mimicking the story.\n\n''DRAUPNIR'' was revealed as the key to a website that [[Neal Caffrey]] and [[Mozzie (White Collar)|Mozzie]] used to view their stolen Nazi U-boat treasure in \"Taking Account\", the seventh episode of the third season of ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''.\n\nIt also appeared in episode 11 of ''[[Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold]]'' as a tool to seal Loki's spirit.\n\nThe Draupnir is never called by name but is simply known as Odin's ring in the first three books of the [[Witches of East End]] novels. This rings allows the wearer to teleport to any place of the nine worlds, and a copy of equal power was once owned by Loki before it was destroyed by Freya.\n\n==Notes==\n{{commons category|Draupnir}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Orchard, Andy (1997).

This is a field of speed convergent on the left and divergent on the right.]]\n{{Calculus|Vector}}\n\nIn [[vector calculus]], '''divergence''' is a [[vector operator]] that produces a [[scalar field]], giving the quantity of a [[vector field]]'s [[Current sources and sinks|source]] at each point. More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward [[flux]] of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point.\n\nAs an example, consider air as it is heated or cooled. The [[velocity]] of the air at each point defines a vector field. While air is heated in a region, it expands in all directions, and thus the velocity field points outward from that region. The divergence of the velocity field in that region would thus have a positive value. While the air is cooled and thus contracting, the divergence of the velocity has a negative value.\n\n== Physical interpretation of divergence ==\n\nIn physical terms, the divergence of a three-dimensional vector field is the extent to which the vector field flow behaves like a source at a given point. It is a local measure of its \"outgoingness\" \u2013 the extent to which there is more of some quantity exiting an infinitesimal region of space than entering it. If the divergence is nonzero at some point then there is compression or expansion at that point. (Note that we are imagining the vector field to be like the velocity vector field of a fluid (in motion) when we use the terms ''flow'' and so on.)\n\nMore rigorously, the divergence of a vector field {{math|'''F'''}} at a point {{math|''p''}} can be defined as the limit of the net flow of {{math|'''F'''}} across the smooth boundary of a three-dimensional region {{math|''V''}} divided by the volume of {{math|''V''}} as {{math|''V''}} shrinks to {{math|''p''}}. Formally,\n\n:<math>\\left. \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} \\right|_p = \\lim_{V \\rightarrow \\{p\\}} \\iint_{S(V)} \\frac{\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat n}}{|V|} \\, dS,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|{{abs|''V''}}}} is the volume of {{math|''V''}}, {{math|''S''(''V'')}} is the boundary of {{math|''V''}}, and the integral is a [[surface integral]] with {{math|'''n\u0302'''}} being the outward unit normal to that surface. The result, {{math|div '''F'''}}, is a function of {{math|''p''}}. From this definition it also becomes obvious that {{math|div '''F'''}} can be seen as the ''source density'' of the flux of {{math|'''F'''}}.\n\nIn light of the physical interpretation, a vector field with zero divergence everywhere is called ''incompressible'' or ''[[solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]]'' \u2013 in which case any closed surface has no net flow across it.\n\nThe intuition that the sum of all sources minus the sum of all sinks should give the net flow outwards of a region is made precise by the [[divergence theorem]].\n\n== Definition  ==\n===Cartesian coordinates===\n\nLet {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''z''}} be a system of [[Cartesian coordinates]] in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], and let {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, {{math|'''k'''}} be the corresponding [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of [[unit vector]]s. The divergence of a [[continuously differentiable]] [[vector field]] {{math|1='''F''' = ''U'''''i''' + ''V'''''j''' + ''W'''''k'''}} is defined as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]-valued function:{{sfn|Rudin|1976|loc=p. 281}}{{sfn|Edwards|1994|loc=p. 309}}\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} = \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right) \\cdot (U,V,W) = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial z}.</math>\n\nAlthough expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under [[Rotation matrix|rotations]], as the physical interpretation suggests. This is because the trace of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional vector field {{math|'''F'''}} in {{math|''N''}}-dimensional space is invariant under any invertible linear transformation.\n\nThe common notation for the divergence {{math|\u2207 \u00b7 '''F'''}} is a convenient mnemonic, where the dot denotes an operation reminiscent of the [[dot product]]: take the components of the {{math|\u2207}} operator (see [[del]]), apply them to the corresponding components of {{math|'''F'''}}, and sum the results. Because applying an operator is different from multiplying the components, this is considered an [[abuse of notation]].\n\nThe divergence of a continuously differentiable second-order [[tensor field]] {{math|'''''\u03b5'''''}} is a first-order tensor field:{{sfn|Gurtin|1981|loc=p. 30}}\n\n:<math>\\overrightarrow{\\operatorname{div}} (\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial x} +\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{yx}}{\\partial y} +\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zx}}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x} +\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial y} +\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zy}}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{xz}}{\\partial x} +\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{yz}}{\\partial y} +\\dfrac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial z}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\n=== Cylindrical coordinates ===\nFor a vector expressed in '''local''' unit cylindrical coordinates as\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{e}_r F_r + \\mathbf{e}_\\theta F_\\theta + \\mathbf{e}_z F_z,</math>\nwhere {{math|'''e'''<sub>''a''</sub>}} is the unit vector in direction {{math|''a''}}, the divergence is{{refn|[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricalCoordinates.html Cylindrical coordinates] at Wolfram Mathworld}}\n:<math>\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf F = \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf F = \\frac1r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(rF_r\\right) + \\frac1r \\frac{\\partial F_\\theta}{\\partial\\theta} + \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial z}.\n</math>\n\nThe use of local coordinates is vital for the validity of the expression. If we consider {{math|'''x'''}} the position vector and the functions <math>r(\\mathbf{x})</math>, <math>\\theta(\\mathbf{x})</math>, and <math>z(\\mathbf{x})</math>, which assign the corresponding '''global''' cylindrical coordinate to a vector, in general <math>r(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}))\\neq F_r(\\mathbf{x})</math>, <math>\\theta(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}))\\neq F_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})</math>, and <math>z(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}))\\neq F_z(\\mathbf{x})</math>. In particular, if we consider the identity function  <math>\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})= \\mathbf{x}</math>, we find that:\n\n:<math>\\theta(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})) = \\theta \\neq F_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0</math>.\n\n=== Spherical coordinates ===\nIn [[spherical coordinates]], with {{math|''\u03b8''}} the angle with the {{math|''z''}} axis and {{math|''\u03c6''}} the rotation around the {{math|''z''}} axis, and <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> again written in local unit coordinates, the divergence is{{refn|[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html Spherical coordinates] at Wolfram Mathworld}}\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}\\mathbf{F} = \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf F = \\frac1{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2 F_r\\right) + \\frac1{r\\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} (\\sin\\theta\\, F_\\theta) + \\frac1{r\\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial F_\\varphi}{\\partial \\varphi}.</math>\n\n=== General coordinates ===\nUsing [[Einstein notation]] we can consider the divergence in [[Curvilinear_coordinates| general coordinates]], which we write as {{math|''x''<sup>1</sup>, ..., ''x''<sup>''i''</sup>, ...,''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of dimensions of the domain. Here, the upper index refers to the number of the coordinate or component, so {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}} refers to the second component, and not the quantity {{math|''x''}} squared. The index variable {{math|''i''}} is used to refer to an arbitrary element, such as {{math|''x''<sup>''i''</sup>}}. The divergence can then be written via the [https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=59087 Voss]-[[Hermann_Weyl| Weyl]] formula<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grinfeld|first1=Pavel|title=The Voss-Weyl Formula|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD2AiFk651E&list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq&index=23|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=English}}</ref>, as:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F}) = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial \\left(\\rho\\, F^i\\right)}{\\partial x^i},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the local coefficient of the [[volume element]] and {{math|''F''{{sup|''i''}} }} are the components of {{math|'''F'''}} with respect to the local '''unnormalized''' [[Curvilinear_coordinates#Covariant and contravariant bases|covariant basis]] (sometimes written as <math>\\mathbf{e}_i  = \\partial\\mathbf{x} / \\partial x^i</math>). The Einstein notation implies summation over {{math|''i''}}, since it appears as both an upper and lower index.\n\nThe volume coefficient <math>\\rho</math> is a function of position which depends on the coordinate system. In Cartesian, cylindrical and polar coordinates, <math>\\rho=1, r,</math> and <math>r^2\\sin{\\theta}</math> respectively, using the same conventions as above. It can also be expressed as <math>\\rho=\\sqrt{\\operatorname{det}g_{ab}}</math>, where <math>g_{ab}</math> is the [[metric tensor]]. Since the determinant is a scalar quantity which doesn't depend on the indices, we can suppress them and simply write <math>\\rho=\\sqrt{\\operatorname{det}g}</math>. Another expression comes from computing the determinant of the Jacobian for transforming from Cartesian coordinates, which for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} gives <math>\\rho=\\left |\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial (x^1,x^2,x^3)}\\right|.</math>\n\nSome conventions expect all local basis elements to be normalized to unit length, as was done in the previous sections. If we write <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i</math> for the normalized basis, and <math>\\hat{F}^i</math> for the components of {{math|'''F'''}} with respect to it, we have that \n:<math>\\mathbf{F}=F^i \\mathbf{e}_i =\nF^i {\\lVert{\\mathbf{e}_i }\\rVert } \\frac{\\mathbf{e}_i}{\\lVert{\\mathbf{e}_i }\\rVert} =\nF^i {\\sqrt{g_{ii}}} \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i =\n\\hat{F}^i \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i,</math>\nusing one of the properties of the metric tensor. By dotting both sides of the last equality with the contravariant element <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}^i</math>, we can conclude that <math>F^i = \\hat{F}^i / \\sqrt{g_{ii}}</math>. After substituting, the formula becomes:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F}) = \\frac1{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\sqrt{g_{ii}}}\\hat{F}^i\\right)}{\\partial x^i} =\n \\frac1{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{det}g}} \\frac{\\partial \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\operatorname{det}g}{g_{ii}}}\\,\\hat{F}^i\\right)}{\\partial x^i}\n</math>.\n\nSee ''{{section link||Generalizations}}'' for further discussion.\n\n== Decomposition theorem==\n{{main|Helmholtz decomposition}}\nIt can be shown that any stationary flux {{math|'''v'''('''r''')}} that is at least twice continuously differentiable in {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} and vanishes sufficiently fast for {{math|{{abs|'''r'''}} \u2192 \u221e}} can be decomposed into an ''irrotational part'' {{math|'''E'''('''r''')}} and a ''source-free part'' {{math|'''B'''('''r''')}}. Moreover, these parts are explicitly determined by the respective ''source densities'' (see above) and ''circulation densities'' (see the article [[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]]):\n\nFor the irrotational part one has\n\n:<math>\\mathbf E=-\\nabla \\Phi(\\mathbf r),</math>\nwith\n:<math>\\Phi (\\mathbf{r})=\\int_{\\mathbb R^3}\\,d^3\\mathbf r'\\;\\frac{\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{r}')}{4\\pi\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|}.</math>\n\nThe source-free part, {{math|'''B'''}}, can be similarly written: one only has to replace the ''scalar potential'' {{math|\u03a6('''r''')}} by a ''vector potential'' {{math|'''A'''('''r''')}} and the terms {{math|\u2212\u2207\u03a6}} by {{math|+\u2207 \u00d7 '''A'''}}, and the source density {{math|div '''v'''}}\nby the circulation density {{math|\u2207 \u00d7 '''v'''}}.\n\nThis \"decomposition theorem\" is a by-product of the stationary case of [[electrodynamics]]. It is a special case of the more general [[Helmholtz decomposition]] which works in dimensions greater than three as well.\n\n== Properties ==\n{{main|Vector calculus identities}}\n\nThe following properties can all be derived from the ordinary differentiation rules of [[calculus]]. Most importantly, the divergence is a [[linear operator]], i.e.,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}( a\\mathbf{F} + b\\mathbf{G} ) = a \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} + b \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{G}</math>\n\nfor all vector fields {{math|'''F'''}} and {{math|'''G'''}} and all [[real number]]s {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}.\n\nThere is a [[product rule]] of the following type: if {{mvar|\u03c6}} is a scalar-valued function and {{math|'''F'''}} is a vector field, then\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}(\\varphi \\mathbf{F}) = \\operatorname{grad} \\varphi \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + \\varphi \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F},</math>\n\nor in more suggestive notation\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot(\\varphi \\mathbf{F}) = (\\nabla\\varphi) \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + \\varphi (\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F}).</math>\n\nAnother product rule for the [[cross product]] of two vector fields {{math|'''F'''}} and {{math|'''G'''}} in three dimensions involves the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] and reads as follows:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{G}) = \\operatorname{curl} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot\\mathbf{G} - \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\operatorname{curl} \\mathbf{G},</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{F}\\times\\mathbf{G}) = (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{F})\\cdot\\mathbf{G} - \\mathbf{F}\\cdot(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{G}).</math>\n\nThe [[Laplacian]] of a [[scalar field]] is the divergence of the field's gradient:\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}(\\nabla\\varphi) = \\Delta\\varphi.</math>\n\nThe divergence of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of any vector field (in three dimensions) is equal to zero: \n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{F})=0.</math>\n\nIf a vector field {{math|'''F'''}} with zero divergence is defined on a ball in {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}, then there exists some vector field {{math|'''G'''}} on the ball with {{math|'''F''' {{=}} curl '''G'''}}. For regions in {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} more topologically complicated than this, the latter statement might be false (see [[Poincar\u00e9 lemma]]). The degree of ''failure'' of the truth of the statement, measured by the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of the [[chain complex]]\n\n:<math>\\{ \\text{scalar fields on } U \\} ~ \\overset{\\operatorname{grad}}{\\rarr} ~ \\{ \\text{vector fields on } U \\} ~ \\overset{\\operatorname{curl}}{\\rarr} ~ \\{ \\text{vector fields on } U \\} ~ \\overset{\\operatorname{div}}{\\rarr} ~ \\{ \\text{scalar fields on } U \\}</math>\n\nserves as a nice quantification of the complicatedness of the underlying region {{math|''U''}}. These are the beginnings and main motivations of [[de Rham cohomology]].\n\n==Relation with the exterior derivative==\nOne can express the divergence as a particular case of the exterior derivative, which takes a 2-form to a 3-form in {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}. Define the current two-form as\n:<math>j = F_1 \\, dy \\wedge dz + F_2 \\, dz \\wedge dx + F_3 \\, dx \\wedge dy .</math>\nIt measures the amount of \"stuff\" flowing through a surface per unit time in a \"stuff fluid\" of density {{math|''\u03c1'' {{=}} 1 ''dx'' \u2227 ''dy'' \u2227 ''dz''}} moving with local velocity {{math|'''F'''}}. Its [[exterior derivative]] {{math|''dj''}} is then given by\n:<math>dj = \\left( \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x} +\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial y} +\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial z} \\right) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = ( \\nabla \\cdot {\\mathbf F} ) \\rho .</math>\n\nThus, the divergence of the vector field {{math|'''F'''}} can be expressed as:\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot {\\mathbf F} = {\\star} d{\\star} \\big( {\\mathbf F}^\\flat \\big) .</math>\nHere the superscript {{music|flat}} is one of the two [[musical isomorphism]]s, and {{math|\u22c6}} is the [[Hodge star operator]]. Working with the current two-form and the exterior derivative is usually easier than working with the vector field and divergence, because unlike the divergence, the exterior derivative commutes with a change of (curvilinear) coordinate system.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nThe divergence of a vector field can be defined in any number of dimensions. If \n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = ( F_1 , F_2 , \\ldots F_n ) ,</math>\n\nin a Euclidean coordinate system with coordinates {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, define\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F} = \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial x_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\partial F_n}{\\partial x_n}.</math>\nThe appropriate expression is more complicated in [[Curvilinear coordinates#Grad, curl, div, Laplacian|curvilinear coordinates]].\n\nIn the case of one dimension, {{math|'''F'''}} reduces to a regular function, and the divergence reduces to the derivative.\n\nFor any {{math|''n''}}, the divergence is a linear operator, and it satisfies the \"product rule\"\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot(\\varphi \\mathbf{F}) = (\\nabla\\varphi) \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + \\varphi (\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F})</math>\n\nfor any scalar-valued function {{mvar|\u03c6}}.\n\nThe divergence of a vector field extends naturally to any [[differentiable manifold]] of dimension {{math|''n''}} that has a [[volume form]] (or [[density on a manifold|density]]) {{mvar|\u03bc}}, e.g. a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or [[Lorentzian manifold]]. Generalising the construction of a two-form for a vector field on {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}, on such a manifold a vector field {{math|''X''}} defines an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-form {{math|''j'' {{=}} ''i<sub>X</sub>&thinsp;\u03bc''}} obtained by contracting {{math|''X''}} with {{mvar|\u03bc}}. The divergence is then the function defined by\n\n:<math>dj = ( \\operatorname{div} X ) \\mu .</math>\n\nStandard formulas for the [[Lie derivative]] allow us to reformulate this as\n\n:<math>{\\mathcal L}_X \\mu = ( \\operatorname{div} X ) \\mu .</math>\n\nThis means that the divergence measures the rate of expansion of a volume element as we let it flow with the vector field.\n\nOn a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], the divergence with respect to the metric volume form can be computed in terms of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] {{math|\u2207}}:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div} X = \\nabla \\cdot X = {X^a}_{;a} ,</math>\n\nwhere the second expression is the contraction of the vector field valued 1-form {{math|\u2207''X''}} with itself and the last expression is the traditional coordinate expression from [[Ricci calculus]].\n\nAn equivalent expression without using connection is\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{div}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{det} g}} \\partial_a \\left(\\sqrt{\\operatorname{det} g} \\, X^a\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|g}} is the metric and {{math|\u2202{{sub|''a''}}}} denotes the partial derivative with respect to coordinate {{math|''x''{{i sup|''a''}}}}.\n\nDivergence can also be generalised to [[tensors]]. In [[Einstein notation]], the divergence of a [[contravariant vector]] {{mvar|F{{isup|\u03bc}}}} is given by\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = \\nabla_\\mu F^\\mu ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2207<sub>''\u03bc''</sub>}} denotes the [[covariant derivative]].\n\nEquivalently, some authors define the divergence of a [[mixed tensor]] by using the [[musical isomorphism]] {{music|sharp}}: if {{math|''T''}} is a {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}-[[tensor]] ({{math|''p''}} for the contravariant vector and {{math|''q''}} for the covariant one), then we define the ''divergence of {{mvar|T}}'' to be the {{math|(''p'', ''q'' \u2212 1)}}-tensor\n\n:<math>( \\operatorname{div} T ) ( Y_1 , \\ldots , Y_{q-1}) = {\\operatorname{trace}} \\Big( X \\mapsto \\sharp ( \\nabla T ) ( X , \\cdot , Y_1 , \\ldots , Y_{q-1} ) \\Big);</math>\n\nthat is, we take the trace over the ''first two'' covariant indices of the covariant derivative{{efn| The choice of \"first\" covariant index of a tensor is intrinsic and depends on the ordering of the terms of the Cartesian product of vector spaces on which the tensor is given as a multilinear map {{math|V \u00d7 V \u00d7 ... \u00d7 V \u2192 '''R'''}}. But equally well defined choices for the divergence could be made by using other indices. Consequently, it is more natural to specify the divergence of {{math|''T''}} with respect to a specified index. There are however two important special cases where this choice is essentially irrelevant: with a totally symmetric contravariant tensor, when every choice is equivalent, and with a totally antisymmetric contravariant tensor ({{aka}} a ''k''-vector), when the choice affects only the sign.}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]]\n*[[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]]\n*[[Divergence theorem]]\n*[[Gradient]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite web|ref=harv |url=http://musr.phas.ubc.ca/~jess/hr/skept/Gradient/node4.html|title=DIVERGENCE of a Vector Field|last=Brewer|first=Jess H.|date=1999|website=musr.phas.ubc.ca|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-09}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv |last=Rudin|first=Walter |title=Principles of mathematical analysis|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X |location= |via= }}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv |last=Edwards|first=C.

Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]], that is, the question of the existence of an [[effective method]] to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set; some of the most important problems in mathematics are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].\n\nFor example, the problem \"given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does ''x'' evenly divide ''y''?\" is a decision problem.  The answer can be either 'yes' or 'no', and depends upon the values of ''x'' and ''y''. A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an [[algorithm]], is called a '''decision procedure''' for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem \"given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does ''x'' evenly divide ''y''?\" would give the steps for determining whether ''x'' evenly divides ''y'', given ''x'' and ''y''.  One such algorithm is [[long division]], taught to many school children. If the remainder is zero the answer produced is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm, such as this example, is called ''decidable''.\n\nThe field of computational complexity categorizes ''decidable'' decision problems by how difficult they are to solve. \"Difficult\", in this sense, is described in terms of the [[computational resource]]s needed by the most efficient algorithm for a certain problem. The field of [[recursion theory]], meanwhile, categorizes ''undecidable'' decision problems by [[Turing degree]], which is a measure of the noncomputability inherent in any solution.\n\n==Definition==\nA ''decision problem'' is any arbitrary yes-or-no question on an [[infinite set]] of inputs. Because of this, it is traditional to define the decision problem equivalently as: the set of possible inputs together with the set of inputs for which the problem returns ''yes''.\n\nThese inputs can be natural numbers, but may also be values of some other kind, such as [[string (computer science)|string]]s over the binary [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] {0,1} or over some other finite set of symbols. The subset of strings for which the problem returns \"yes\" is a [[formal language]], and often decision problems are defined in this way as formal languages.\n\nAlternatively, using an encoding such as [[G\u00f6del numbering]]s, any string can be encoded as a natural number, via which a decision problem can be defined as a subset of the natural numbers.\n\n==Examples==\nA classic example of a decidable decision problem is the set of prime numbers. It is possible to effectively decide whether a given natural number is prime by testing every possible nontrivial factor. Although much more efficient methods of [[primality testing]] are known, the existence of any effective method is enough to establish decidability.\n\n== Decidability ==\n\n{{main|Undecidable problem|Decidability (logic)}}\n\nA decision problem ''A'' is called ''decidable'' or ''effectively solvable'' if ''A'' is a [[recursive set]].  A problem is called ''partially decidable'', ''semidecidable'', ''solvable'', or ''provable'' if ''A'' is a [[recursively enumerable set]].  Problems that are not decidable are called ''undecidable''.\n\nThe [[halting problem]] is an important undecidable decision problem; for more examples, see [[list of undecidable problems]].\n\n== Complete problems ==\n\n{{main|Complete problem}}\n\nDecision problems can be ordered according to [[many-one reduction|many-one reducibility]] and related to feasible reductions such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s. A decision problem ''P'' is said to be ''[[complete problem|complete]]'' for a set of decision problems ''S'' if ''P'' is a member of ''S'' and every problem in ''S'' can be reduced to ''P''. Complete decision problems are used in [[computational complexity theory]] to characterize [[complexity class]]es of decision problems. For example, the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is complete for the class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] of decision problems under polynomial-time reducibility.\n\n==Function problems==\n{{main|function problem}}\n\nDecision problems are closely related to [[function problem]]s, which can have answers that are more complex than a simple 'yes' or 'no'.  A corresponding function problem is \"given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', what is ''x'' divided by ''y''?\".\n\nA [[function problem]] consists of a [[partial function]] ''f''; the informal \"problem\" is to compute the values of ''f'' on the inputs for which it is defined.\n\nEvery function problem can be turned into a decision problem; the decision problem is just the graph of the associated function.   (The graph of a function ''f'' is the set of pairs (''x'',''y'') such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''.)  If this decision problem were effectively solvable then the function problem would be as well.  This reduction does not respect computational complexity, however.  For example, it is possible for the graph of a function to be decidable in polynomial time (in which case running time is computed as a function of the pair (''x'',''y'') ) when the function is not computable in [[polynomial time]] (in which case running time is computed as a function of ''x'' alone).  The function ''f''(''x'') = ''2''<sup>''x''</sup> has this property.\n\nEvery decision problem can be converted into the function problem of computing the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the set associated to the decision problem.   If this function is computable then the associated decision problem is decidable. However, this reduction is more liberal than the standard reduction used in computational complexity (sometimes called polynomial-time many-one reduction); for example, the complexity of the characteristic functions of an [[NP-complete]] problem and its [[co-NP-complete]] [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] is exactly the same even though the underlying decision problems may not be considered equivalent in some typical models of computation.\n\n==Optimization problems==\n{{main|Optimization problem}}\n\nUnlike decision problems, for which there is only one correct answer for each input, optimization problems are concerned with finding the ''best'' answer to a particular input.  Optimization problems arise naturally in many applications, such as the [[traveling salesman problem]] and many questions in [[linear programming]].\n\nThere are standard techniques for transforming function and optimization problems into decision problems. For example, in the traveling salesman problem, the optimization problem is to produce a tour with minimal weight. The associated decision problem is: for each ''N'', to decide whether the graph has any tour with weight less than ''N''.  By repeatedly answering the decision problem, it is possible to find the minimal weight of a tour.\n\nBecause the theory of decision problems is very well developed, research in complexity theory has typically focused on decision problems. Optimization problems themselves are still of interest in computability theory, as well as in fields such as [[operations research]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ALL (complexity)]]\n* [[Computational problem]]\n* [[Decidability (logic)]] &ndash; for the problem of deciding whether a formula is a consequence of a [[logical theory]].\n* [[Search problem]]\n* [[Counting problem (complexity)]]\n* [[Word problem (mathematics)]]\n\n== References ==\n* Kozen, D.C.

It associates various information with [[domain name]]s assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical [[IP address]]es needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying [[communication protocol|network protocol]]s. By providing a worldwide, distributed [[directory service]], the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.\n\nThe Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating [[authoritative name server]]s for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over [[sub-domain]]s of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and [[fault tolerance|fault-tolerant]] service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.\n\nThe Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the [[Database model|database]] service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]].\n\nThe Internet maintains two principal [[namespace]]s, the domain name hierarchy<ref name=rfc1034>RFC 1034, ''Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)</ref> and the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[address space]]s.<ref name=\"rfc781\">RFC 781, ''Internet Protocol - DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, J. Postel (Ed.), The Internet Society (September 1981)</ref> The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet [[name server]]s and a [[communication protocol]] implement the Domain Name System.<ref name=rfc1035>RFC 1035, ''Domain Names - Implementation and Specification'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)</ref> A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.\n\nThe most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority ([[SOA record|SOA]]), [[IP address]]es ([[List of DNS record types#A|A]] and [[AAAA record|AAAA]]), [[SMTP]] [[mail exchanger]]s (MX), [[name server]]s (NS), pointers for [[reverse DNS lookup]]s (PTR), and [[domain name alias]]es (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as [[DNSSEC]] records, or for human queries such as ''responsible person'' (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating [[unsolicited email]] (spam) by storing a [[real-time blackhole list]] (RBL).  The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the [[zone file]], but other database systems are common.\n\n==Function==\nAn often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the [[telephone directory|phone book]] for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer [[hostname]]s into IP addresses. For example, the domain name [[example.com|www.example.com]] translates to the addresses 93.184.216.34 ([[IPv4]]) and 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 ([[IPv6]]). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same hostname. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators ([[URL]]s), and [[e-mail address]]es without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.\n\nAn important and ubiquitous function of DNS is its central role in distributed Internet services such as [[cloud service]]s and  [[content delivery network]]s.<ref>J.

The key functionality of DNS exploited here is that different users can ''simultaneously'' receive different translations for the ''same'' domain name, a key point of divergence from a traditional phone-book view of the DNS. This process of using the DNS to assign proximal servers to users is key to providing faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is widely used by most major Internet services.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nygren., E. |author2=Sitaraman R.

For example, the label ''example'' specifies a subdomain of the ''com'' domain, and ''www'' is a subdomain of example.com. This tree of subdivisions may have up to 127 levels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nA label may contain zero to 63 characters. The null label, of length zero, is reserved for the root zone. The full domain name may not exceed the length of 253 characters in its textual representation.<ref name=rfc1034/> In the internal binary representation of the DNS the maximum length requires 255 octets of storage, as it also stores the length of the name.<ref name=rfc1035/>\n\nAlthough no technical limitation exists to use any character in domain name labels which are representable by an octet, hostnames use a preferred format and character set. The characters allowed in labels are a subset of the [[ASCII]] character set, consisting of characters ''a'' through ''z'', ''A'' through ''Z'', digits ''0'' through ''9'', and hyphen. This rule is known as the ''LDH rule'' (letters, digits, hyphen). Domain names are interpreted in case-independent manner.<ref>Network Working Group of the IETF, January 2006, RFC 4343: Domain Name System (DNS) Case Insensitivity Clarification</ref> Labels may not start or end with a hyphen.<ref name=rfc3696>RFC 3696, ''Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names'', J. Klensin</ref> An additional rule requires that top-level domain names should not be all-numeric.<ref name=rfc3696 />\n\n===Internationalized domain names===\nThe limited set of ASCII characters permitted in the DNS prevented the representation of names and words of many languages in their native alphabets or scripts. To make this possible, [[ICANN]] approved the [[Internationalized domain name|Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications]] (IDNA) system, by which user applications, such as web browsers, map [[Unicode]] strings into the valid DNS character set using [[Punycode]]. In 2009 ICANN approved the installation of internationalized domain name [[Country code top-level domain|country code top-level domains (''ccTLD''s)]]. In addition, many [[domain name registry|registries]] of the existing top-level domain names ([[Top-level domain|''TLD'']]s) have adopted the IDNA system.\n\n===Name servers===\nThe Domain Name System is maintained by a [[distributed database]] system, which uses the [[client\u2013server model]]. The nodes of this database are the [[name server]]s. Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it. The top of the hierarchy is served by the [[root name server]]s, the servers to query when looking up (''resolving'') a TLD.\n\n====Authoritative name server====\nAn ''authoritative'' name server is a name server that only gives [[Name server#Authoritative answer|answers]] to DNS queries from data that has been configured by an original source, for example, the domain administrator or by dynamic DNS methods, in contrast to answers obtained via a query to another name server that only maintains a cache of data.\n\nAn authoritative name server can either be a ''master'' server or a ''slave'' server. A master server is a server that stores the original (''master'') copies of all zone records. A slave server uses a special automatic updating mechanism in the DNS protocol in communication with its master to maintain an identical copy of the master records.\n\nEvery DNS zone must be assigned a set of authoritative name servers. This set of servers is stored in the parent domain zone with name server (NS) records.\n\nAn authoritative server indicates its status of supplying definitive answers, deemed ''authoritative'', by setting a protocol flag, called the \"''Authoritative Answer''\" (''AA'') bit in its responses.<ref name=\"rfc1035\" /> This flag is usually reproduced prominently in the output of DNS administration query tools, such as [[Domain Information Groper|dig]], to indicate ''that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in question.''<ref name=\"rfc1035\" />\n\n==Operation==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Address resolution mechanism===\nDomain name resolvers determine the domain name servers responsible for the domain name in question by a sequence of queries starting with the right-most (top-level) domain label.\n\n[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|400px|A DNS resolver that implements the iterative approach mandated by RFC 1034; in this case, the resolver consults three name servers to resolve the [[fully qualified domain name]] \"www.wikipedia.org\".]]\n\nFor proper operation of its domain name resolver, a network host is configured with an initial cache (''hints'') of the known addresses of the root name servers. The hints are updated periodically by an administrator by retrieving a dataset from a reliable source.\n\nAssuming the resolver has no cached records to accelerate the process, the resolution process starts with a query to one of the root servers.  In typical operation, the root servers do not answer directly, but respond with a referral to more authoritative servers, e.g., a query for \"www.wikipedia.org\" is referred to the ''org'' servers.   The resolver now queries the servers referred to, and iteratively repeats this process until it receives an authoritative answer. The diagram illustrates this process for the host that is named by the [[fully qualified domain name]] \"www.wikipedia.org\".\n\nThis mechanism would place a large traffic burden on the root servers, if every resolution on the Internet required starting at the root. In practice [[#Record caching|caching]] is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and as a result, root name servers actually are involved in only a relatively small fraction of all requests.\n\n====Recursive and caching name server====\nIn theory, authoritative name servers are sufficient for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] of the Domain Name System and each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.\n\nTo improve efficiency, reduce DNS traffic across the Internet, and increase performance in end-user applications, the Domain Name System supports DNS cache servers which store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (''time-to-live'') of the domain name record in question.\nTypically, such caching DNS servers also implement the recursive algorithm necessary to resolve a given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With this function implemented in the name server, user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.\n\nThe combination of DNS caching and recursive functions in a name server is not mandatory; the functions can be implemented independently in servers for special purposes.\n\n[[Internet service providers]]  typically provide recursive and caching name servers for their customers. In addition, many home networking routers implement DNS caches and recursors to improve efficiency in the local network.\n\n===DNS resolvers===\nThe client side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. A resolver is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation of a domain name into an IP address. DNS resolvers are classified by a variety of query methods, such as ''recursive'', ''non-recursive'', and ''iterative''. A resolution process may use a combination of these methods.<ref name=\"rfc1034\" />\n\nIn a ''non-recursive query'', a DNS resolver queries a DNS server that provides a record either for which the server is authoritative, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers. In case of a [[#Record_caching|caching DNS resolver]], the non-recursive query of its local [[Name server#Caching name server|DNS cache]] delivers a result and reduces the load on upstream DNS servers by caching DNS request records for a period of time after an initial response from upstream DNS servers.\n\nIn a ''recursive query'', a DNS resolver queries a single DNS server, which may in turn query other DNS servers on behalf of the requester. For example, a simple stub resolver running on a [[home router]] typically makes a recursive query to the DNS server run by the user's [[ISP]]. A recursive query is one for which the DNS server answers the query completely by querying other name servers as needed. In typical operation, a client issues a recursive query to a caching recursive DNS server, which subsequently issues non-recursive queries to determine the answer and send a single answer back to the client. The resolver, or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the resolver, negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query headers. DNS servers are not required to support recursive queries.\n\nThe ''iterative query'' procedure is a process in which a DNS resolver queries a chain of one or more DNS servers. Each server refers the client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global root server, then a \"com\" server, and finally an \"example.com\" server.\n\n===Circular dependencies and glue records===\nName servers in delegations are identified by name, rather than by IP address. This means that a resolving name server must issue another DNS request to find out the IP address of the server to which it has been referred. If the name given in the delegation is a subdomain of the domain for which the delegation is being provided, there is a [[circular dependency]].\n\nIn this case, the name server providing the delegation must also provide one or more IP addresses for the authoritative name server mentioned in the delegation. This information is called ''glue''.   The delegating name server provides this glue in the form of records in the ''additional section'' of the DNS response, and provides the delegation in the ''authority section'' of the response. A glue record is a combination of the name server and IP address.\n\nFor example, if the [[authoritative name server]] for example.org is ns1.example.org, a computer trying to resolve www.example.org first resolves ns1.example.org. As ns1 is contained in example.org, this requires resolving example.org first, which presents a circular dependency. To break the dependency, the name server for the [[top level domain]] org includes glue along with the delegation for example.org.  The glue records are address records that provide IP addresses for ns1.example.org. The resolver uses one or more of these IP addresses to query one of the domain's authoritative servers, which allows it to complete the DNS query.\n\n===Record caching===\nA standard practice in implementing name resolution in applications is to reduce the load on the Domain Name System servers by caching results locally, or in intermediate resolver hosts. Results obtained from a DNS request are always associated with the [[time to live]] (TTL), an expiration time after which the results must be discarded or refreshed. The TTL is set by the administrator of the authoritative DNS server. The period of validity may vary from a few seconds to days or even weeks.\n\nAs a result of this distributed caching architecture, changes to DNS records do not propagate throughout the network immediately, but require all caches to expire and to be refreshed after the TTL. RFC 1912 conveys basic rules for determining appropriate TTL values.\n\nSome resolvers may override TTL values, as the protocol supports caching for up to sixty-eight years or no caching at all. [[Negative cache|Negative caching]], i.e. the caching of the fact of non-existence of a record, is determined by name servers authoritative for a zone which must include the [[SOA record|Start of Authority]] (SOA) record when reporting no data of the requested type exists. The value of the ''minimum'' field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself is used to establish the TTL for the negative answer.\n\n===Reverse lookup===\n{{Main article|Reverse DNS lookup}}\nA reverse lookup is a query of the DNS for domain names when the IP address is known. Multiple domain names may be associated with an IP address. The DNS stores IP addresses in the form of domain names as specially formatted names in pointer (PTR) records within the infrastructure top-level domain [[.arpa|arpa]]. For IPv4, the domain is in-addr.arpa.  For IPv6, the reverse lookup domain is ip6.arpa. The IP address is represented as a name in reverse-ordered octet representation for IPv4, and reverse-ordered nibble representation for IPv6.\n\nWhen performing a reverse lookup, the DNS client converts the address into these formats before querying the name for a PTR record following the delegation chain as for any DNS query. For example, assuming the IPv4 address 208.80.152.2 is assigned to Wikimedia, it is represented as a DNS name in reverse order: 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa. When the DNS resolver gets a pointer (PTR) request, it begins by querying the root servers, which point to the servers of [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) for the 208.in-addr.arpa zone. ARIN's servers delegate 152.80.208.in-addr.arpa to Wikimedia to which the resolver sends another query for 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which results in an authoritative response.\n\n===Client lookup===\n[[Image:DNS in the real world.svg|right|thumb|400px|DNS resolution sequence]]\nUsers generally do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as [[web browser]]s, [[e-mail client]]s, and other Internet applications. When an application makes a request that requires a domain name lookup, such programs send a resolution request to the [[DNS resolver]] in the local operating system, which in turn handles the communications required.\n\nThe DNS resolver will almost invariably have a cache (see above) containing recent lookups. If the cache can provide the answer to the request, the resolver will return the value in the cache to the program that made the request. If the cache does not contain the answer, the resolver will send the request to one or more designated DNS servers. In the case of most home users, the Internet service provider to which the machine connects will usually supply this DNS server: such a user will either have configured that server's address manually or allowed [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] to set it; however, where systems administrators have configured systems to use their own DNS servers, their DNS resolvers point to separately maintained name servers of the organization. In any event, the name server thus queried will follow the process outlined [[#Address resolution mechanism|above]], until it either successfully finds a result or does not. It then returns its results to the DNS resolver; assuming it has found a result, the resolver duly caches that result for future use, and hands the result back to the software which initiated the request.\n\n====Broken resolvers====\nSome large ISPs have configured their DNS servers to violate rules, such as by disobeying TTLs, or by indicating that a domain name does not exist just because one of its name servers does not respond.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://ask.slashdot.org/story/05/04/18/198259/providers-ignoring-dns-ttl\n|title = Providers ignoring DNS TTL?\n|publisher = [[Slashdot]]\n|year = 2005\n|accessdate = 2012-04-07\n}}</ref>\n\nSome applications, such as web browsers, maintain an internal DNS cache to avoid repeated lookups via the network. This practice can add extra difficulty when debugging DNS issues, as it obscures the history of such data. These caches typically use very short caching times \u2013 in the order of one minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dyn.com/web-browser-dns-caching-bad-thing/|title=Ben Anderson: Why Web Browser DNS Caching Can Be A Bad Thing|author=Ben Anderson|date=7 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Internet Explorer]] represents a notable exception: versions up to IE 3.x cache DNS records for 24 hours by default. Internet Explorer 4.x and later versions (up to IE 8) decrease the default time out value to half an hour, which may be changed by modifying default configuration.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;263558\n|title = How Internet Explorer uses the cache for DNS host entries\n|publisher = [[Microsoft Corporation]]\n|year = 2004\n|accessdate = 2010-07-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Google Chrome]] triggers a specific error message for DNS issues. When the DNS server is down or broken, Google Chrome returns an error message.\n===Other applications===\nThe Domain Name System includes several other functions and features.\n\nHostnames and IP addresses are not required to match in a one-to-one relationship. Multiple hostnames may correspond to a single IP address, which is useful in [[virtual hosting]], in which many web sites are served from a single host. Alternatively, a single hostname may resolve to many IP addresses to facilitate [[fault tolerance]] and [[load balancing (computing)|load distribution]] to multiple server instances across an enterprise or the global Internet.\n\nDNS serves other purposes in addition to translating names to IP addresses. For instance, [[mail transfer agent]]s use DNS to find the best mail server to deliver [[e-mail]]: An [[MX record]] provides a mapping between a domain and a mail exchanger; this can provide an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.\n\nThe DNS is used for efficient storage and distribution of IP addresses of blacklisted email hosts. A common method is to place the IP address of the subject host into the sub-domain of a higher level domain name, and to resolve that name to a record that indicates a positive or a negative indication.\n\nFor example:\n* The address {{IPaddr|102.3.4.5}} is blacklisted. It points to 5.4.3.102.blacklist.example, which resolves to {{IPaddr|127.0.0.1}}.\n* The address {{IPaddr|102.3.4.6}} is not blacklisted and points to 6.4.3.102.blacklist.example. This hostname is either not configured, or resolves to {{IPaddr|127.0.0.2}}.\nE-mail servers can query blacklist.example to find out if a specific host connecting to them is in the blacklist. Many of such blacklists, either subscription-based or free of cost, are available for use by email administrators and anti-spam software.\n\nThe [[Sender Policy Framework]] and [[DomainKeys]] were designed to take advantage of another DNS record type, the [[TXT record]], but have since been assigned specific record types.\n\nTo provide resilience in the event of computer or network failure, multiple DNS servers are usually provided for coverage of each domain. At the top level of global DNS, thirteen groups of root name servers exist, with additional \"copies\" of them distributed worldwide via [[anycast]] addressing.\n\n[[Dynamic DNS]] (DDNS) updates a DNS server with a client IP address on-the-fly, for example, when moving between ISPs or mobile [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hot spots]], or when the IP address changes administratively.\n\n==DNS message format==\nThe DNS protocol uses two types of DNS messages, queries and replies, and they both have the same format. Each message consists of a header and four sections: question, answer, authority, and an additional space. A header field (''flags'') controls the content of these four sections.<ref name=rfc1034/>\n\nThe header section contains the following fields: ''Identification'', ''Flags'', ''Number of questions'', ''Number of answers'', ''Number of authority resource records'' (RRs), and ''Number of additional RRs''. The identification field can be used to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits indicating the type of query, or the type of query this message is a response to. 0 is a standard query, 1 an inverse query, 2 is a server status request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query (\"RD\"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion (\"RA\"), as not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the message was truncated for some reason (\"TC\"), and a four-bit sub-field is used for error codes. The ''question'' section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The ''answer'' section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.<ref>James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross, Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 6th ed. Essex, England: Pearson Educ. Limited, 2012</ref>\n\n==DNS Protocol transport==\nDNS primarily uses the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on [[port number]] 53 to serve requests.<ref name=rfc1035/> DNS queries consist of a single UDP request from the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. When the length of the answer exceeds 512 bytes and both client and server support [[EDNS]], larger UDP packets are used. Otherwise, the query is sent again using the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).  TCP is also used for tasks such as [[DNS zone transfer|zone transfers]]. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.\n\n{{anchor|resource records|resource record}}\n\n==Resource records==\n{{Too abstract|date=November 2017}}\nThe Domain Name System specifies a set of various [[List of DNS record types|types of resource records]] (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time ([[Time to live#DNS records|time to live]]), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a ''resource record set'' (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement [[round-robin DNS|round-robin ordering]] to achieve [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]. The [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.\n\nWhen sent over an [[Internet Protocol]] network, all records use the common format specified in RFC 1035:<ref>RFC 5395, ''Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations'', D. Eastlake 3rd (November 2008), Section 3</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Resource record (RR) fields\n|-\n! Field !! Description !! Length ([[Octet (computing)|octets]])\n|-\n| NAME || Name of the node to which this record pertains || Variable\n|-\n| TYPE || Type of RR in numeric form (e.g., 15 for MX RRs) || 2\n|-\n| CLASS || Class code || 2\n|-\n| [[Time to live|TTL]] || Count of seconds that the RR stays valid (The maximum is 2<sup>31</sup>\u22121, which is about 68 years) || 4\n|-\n| RDLENGTH || Length of RDATA field (specified in octets) || 2\n|-\n| RDATA || Additional RR-specific data || Variable, as per RDLENGTH\n|}\n\n''NAME'' is the fully qualified domain name of the node in the tree {{clarify|date=November 2017}}. On the wire, the name may be shortened using label compression where ends of domain names mentioned earlier in the packet can be substituted for the end of the current domain name. A free standing ''@'' is used to denote the current origin.\n\n''TYPE'' is the record type. It indicates the format of the data and it gives a hint of its intended use. For example, the ''A'' record is used to translate from a domain name to an [[IPv4 address]], the ''NS'' record lists which name servers can answer lookups on a [[DNS zone]], and the ''MX'' record specifies the mail server used to handle mail for  a domain specified in an e-mail address.\n\n''RDATA'' is data of type-specific relevance, such as the IP address for address records, or the priority and hostname for MX records. Well known record types may use label compression in the RDATA field, but \"unknown\" record types must not (RFC 3597).\n\nThe ''CLASS'' of a record is set to IN (for ''Internet'') for common DNS records involving Internet hostnames, servers, or IP addresses. In addition, the classes [[Chaosnet|Chaos]] (CH) and [[Hesiod (name service)|Hesiod]] (HS) exist.<ref>RFC 5395, ''Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations'', D. Eastlake 3rd (November 2008), p. 11</ref>  Each class is an independent name space with potentially different delegations of DNS zones.\n\nIn addition to resource records defined in a [[zone file]], the domain name system also defines several request types that are used only in communication with other DNS nodes (''on the wire''), such as when performing zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR) or for [[EDNS]] (OPT).\n\n===Wildcard DNS records===\nThe domain name system supports [[wildcard DNS record]]s which specify names that start with the ''asterisk label'', '*', e.g., *.example.<ref name=rfc1034/><ref name=rfc4592>RFC 4592, ''The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System'', E. Lewis (July 2006)</ref> DNS records belonging to wildcard domain names specify rules for generating resource records within a single DNS zone by substituting whole labels with matching components of the query name, including any specified descendants. For example, in the following configuration, the DNS zone ''x.example'' specifies that all subdomains, including subdomains of subdomains, of ''x.example'' use the mail exchanger (MX) ''a.x.example''. The A record for ''a.x.example'' is needed to specify the mail exchanger IP address. As this has the result of excluding this domain name and its subdomains from the wildcard matches, an additional MX record for the subdomain ''a.x.example'', as well as a wildcarded MX record for all of its subdomains, must also be defined in the DNS zone.\n\n<pre>\nx.example.       MX   10 a.x.example.\n*.x.example.     MX   10 a.x.example.\n*.a.x.example.   MX   10 a.x.example.\na.x.example.     MX   10 a.x.example.\na.x.example.     AAAA 2001:db8::1\n</pre>\n\nThe role of wildcard records was refined in RFC 4592, because the original definition in RFC 1034 was incomplete and resulted in misinterpretations by implementers.<ref name=\"rfc4592\" />\n\n==Protocol extensions==\nThe original DNS protocol had limited provisions for extension with new features. In 1999, Paul Vixie published in RFC 2671 (superseded by RFC 6891) an extension mechanism, called [[Extension mechanisms for DNS]] (EDNS) that introduced optional protocol elements without increasing overhead when not in use. This was accomplished through the OPT pseudo-resource record that only exists in wire transmissions of the protocol, but not in any zone files. Initial extensions were also suggested (EDNS0), such as increasing the DNS message size in UDP datagrams.\n\n==Dynamic zone updates==\n[[Dynamic DNS|Dynamic DNS updates]] use the UPDATE DNS opcode to add or remove resource records dynamically from a zone database maintained on an authoritative DNS server. The feature is described in RFC 2136. This facility is useful to register network clients into the DNS when they boot or become otherwise available on the network. As a booting client may be assigned a different IP address each time from a [[DHCP]] server, it is not possible to provide static DNS assignments for such clients.\n\n==Security issues==\nOriginally, security concerns were not major design considerations for DNS software or any software for deployment on the early Internet, as the network was not open for participation by the general public. However, the expansion of the Internet into the commercial sector in the 1990s changed the requirements for security measures to protect [[data integrity]] and user [[authentication]].\n\nSeveral vulnerability issues were discovered and exploited by malicious users. One such issue is [[DNS cache poisoning]], in which data is distributed to caching resolvers under the pretense of being an authoritative origin server, thereby polluting the data store with potentially false information and long expiration times (time-to-live). Subsequently, legitimate application requests may be redirected to network hosts operated with malicious intent.\n\nDNS responses traditionally do not have a [[cryptographic signature]], leading to many attack possibilities; the [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses. [[DNSCurve]] has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as [[TSIG]], add support for cryptographic authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize zone transfer or dynamic update operations.\n\nSome domain names may be used to achieve spoofing effects. For example, {{not a typo|paypal.com}} and paypa1.com are different names, yet users may be unable to distinguish them in a graphical user interface depending on the user's chosen [[typeface]]. In many fonts the letter ''l'' and the numeral ''1'' look very similar or even identical. This problem is acute in systems that support [[internationalized domain name]]s, as many character codes in [[ISO 10646]] may appear identical on typical computer screens. This vulnerability is occasionally exploited in [[phishing]].<ref>APWG. \"Global Phishing Survey: Domain Name Use and Trends in 1H2010.\" [http://www.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_1H2010.pdf 10/15/2010 apwg.org]</ref>\n\nTechniques such as [[forward-confirmed reverse DNS]] can also be used to help validate DNS results.\n\n==Privacy/tracking issues==\nA device looking up a DNS record must communicate with a DNS server to do so. Considerable attention has been given to the adverse privacy implications. Even if DNS records cannot easily be read, modified or spoofed due to security extensions, a person with access to the DNS server or the traffic stream \"on the wire\" may have little difficulty in matching the IP address of the device (which often identifies the user), to the websites, email or other domains they visit, and track how often and when these records are queried, since DNS records typically expire and must be requeried regularly.\n\nDNS can also \"leak\" from otherwise secure or private connections, if attention is not paid to their configuration, and at times DNS has been used to bypass firewalls by malicious persons, and [[exfiltrate]] data, since it is often seen as innocuous.\n\nTwo main approaches are in use to counter privacy issues with DNS:\n* [[Proxy server|Proxies]] (including [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]) and [[VPN]]s which can reroute or anonymize DNS inquiries in order to mask the source IP address.\n* Intermediate DNS servers that are configured with minimal logging, and which can be queried instead of querying usual DNS servers whose privacy policy may be untrusted. In 2018, [[Cloudflare]] launched a DNS server of this kind.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.eweek.com/security/cloudflare-launches-1.1.1.1-dns-service-to-improve-internet-privacy |title=Cloudflare Launches 1.1.1.1 DNS Service to Improve Internet Privacy |access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==Domain name registration==\nThe right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars which are accredited by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) or other organizations such as [[OpenNIC]], that are charged with overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet. In addition to ICANN, each top-level domain (TLD) is maintained and serviced technically by an administrative organization, operating a registry. A ''registry'' is responsible for operating the database of names within its authoritative zone, although the term is most often used for TLDs.  A ''registrant'' is a person or organization who asked for domain registration.<ref name=\"rfc7719\"/>  The registry receives registration information from each domain name ''registrar'', which is authorized (accredited) to assign names in the corresponding zone and publishes the information using the [[WHOIS]] protocol.  As of 2015, usage of [[Registration Data Access Protocol|RDAP]] is being considered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2015-12-03-en |title=Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Operational Profile for gTLD Registries and Registrars |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=[[ICANN]] |access-date=18 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222144443/https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2015-12-03-en |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\nICANN publishes the complete list of TLDs, TLD registries, and domain name registrars. Registrant information associated with domain names is maintained in an online database accessible with the WHOIS service. For most of the more than 290 [[country code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs), the domain registries maintain the WHOIS (Registrant, name servers, expiration dates, etc.) information. For instance, [[DENIC]], Germany NIC, holds the DE domain data. From about 2001, most [[Generic top-level domain]] (gTLD) registries have adopted this so-called ''thick'' registry approach, i.e. keeping the WHOIS data in central registries instead of registrar databases.\n\nFor top-level domains on COM and NET, a ''thin'' registry model is used. The domain registry (e.g., [[GoDaddy]], [[Directi|BigRock and PDR]], [[VeriSign]], etc, etc) holds basic WHOIS data (i.e., registrar and name servers, etc.). Organizations, or registrants using ORG on the other hand, are on the [[Public Interest Registry]] exclusively.\n\nSome domain name registries, often called ''network information centers'' (NIC), also function as registrars to end-users, in addition to providing access to the WHOIS datasets. The top-level domain registries, such as for the domains COM, NET, and ORG use a registry-registrar model consisting of many domain name registrars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verisign.com/en_US/domain-names/domain-registrar/index.xhtml|title=Find a Registrar|publisher=VeriSign, Inc.|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref> In this method of management, the registry only manages the domain name database and the relationship with the registrars. The ''registrants'' (users of a domain name) are customers of the registrar, in some cases through additional subcontracting of resellers.\n\n==RFC documents==\n<!-- NOTE:\nListed are RFCs that are still current, and generally not better suited in other articles.

In 1982 he debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[\"Master Harold\"...and the Boys]],'' directed by the play's [[South Africa]]n author [[Athol Fugard]]. By 1988 Lindo had earned a [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination for his portrayal of Herald Loomis in [[August Wilson]]'s ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]''.\n\nLindo returned to film in the 1990s, acting alongside [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Joan Chen]] in the science fiction film ''[[The Blood of Heroes|Salute of the Jugger]]'' (1990), which has become a cult classic. Although he had turned down [[Spike Lee]] for a role in his debut ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', Lee cast him as Woody Carmichael in the drama ''[[Crooklyn]]'' (1994), which brought him notice. Together with his other roles with Lee - as the West Indian Archie, a psychotic gangster, in ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'', and a starring role as a neighbourhood drug dealer in ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'' - he became established in his film career.\n\nOther films in which he has starring roles are [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995), Ron Howard's ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'' (1996) and ''[[Soul of the Game]]'' (1996), as the baseball player [[Satchel Paige]].\n\nIn 1998 Lindo co-starred as African-American explorer [[Matthew Henson]], in the TV film ''Glory & Honor'', directed by [[Kevin Hooks]]. It portrayed his nearly 20-year partnership with Commander [[Robert Peary]] in Arctic exploration and their effort to find the [[Geographic North Pole]] in 1909. He received a Satellite Award as best actor. Lindo continues to work in television and was most recently seen on the short-lived NBC drama ''[[Kidnapped (2006 TV series)|Kidnapped]]''.\n\nLindo played an angel in the comedy film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]'' (1997).\n\nHe guest-starred on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode \"[[Brawl in the Family (The Simpsons)|Brawl in the Family]]\", playing a similar character named Gabriel.\n\nLindo had a small role in the 1995 science fiction/action film ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]],'' playing the [[corruption|corrupt]] [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Wanta. Lindo was not credited for the role.\n\nIn the British film, ''[[Wondrous Oblivion]]'' (2003), directed by [[Paul Morrison (director)|Paul Morrison]], he starred as Dennis Samuels, the father of a Jamaican immigrant family in London in the 1950s; he coaches his children and the son of a neighbour Jewish family in [[cricket]], earning their admiration in a time of strained social relations. Lindo said he made the film in honour of his parents, who had similarly moved to London in those years.<ref name=\"cricket\">[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/26/1085461828735.html \"It's not just cricket\"], ''The Age,'' 30 May 2004, accessed 27 September 2014.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Lindo began an association with [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]] in [[Berkeley, California]], when he directed [[Tanya Barfield]]'s play ''The Blue Door''. In the autumn of 2008, Lindo revisited [[August Wilson]]'s play, ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'', directing a production at the Berkeley Rep.

Janssen also had the title roles in three other series: ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''; ''[[Harry O]]''; and ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]''.\n\nIn 1996 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him number 36 on its ''50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time'' list.<ref name=\"TV Guide\">{{cite web|title=TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time [1996]|url=http://www.amiannoying.com/%28S%28g1g1bocjrzwlurkwaw4mhsqb%29%29/collection.aspx?collection=1194|website=Am I annoying}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJanssen was born in 1931 in [[Naponee, Nebraska|Naponee]], a village in [[Franklin County, Nebraska|Franklin County]] in southern [[Nebraska]], to Harold Edward Meyer, a banker (May 12, 1906&nbsp;\u2013 November 4, 1990) and Berniece Graf (May 11, 1910&nbsp;\u2013 November 26, 1995). Janssen was of Irish and Jewish descent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eder|first=Shirley|title='Angels' Will Be Back \u2013 Without Shelly Hack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19800220&id=TWhQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uVgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3044,1222316|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=February 20, 1980|page=12-B}}</ref>  Following his parents' divorce in 1935, his mother moved with five-year-old David to Los Angeles, California, and later married Eugene Janssen (February 18, 1918&nbsp;\u2013 March 30, 1996) in 1940 in Los Angeles. Young David used his stepfather's name after he entered show business as a child.\n\nHe attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in Los Angeles, where he excelled on the basketball court, setting a school-scoring record that lasted over 20 years. His first film part was at the age of thirteen, and by the age of twenty-five he had appeared in twenty films and served two years as an enlisted man in the [[United States Army]]. During his Army days, Janssen became friends with fellow enlistees [[Martin Milner]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] while posted at [[Fort Ord]], California.\n\n==Acting career==\n[[File:David Janssen Fugitive 1967.JPG|thumb|in TV series ''The Fugitive'', 1963\u20131967 (final episode)]]\nJanssen appeared in many television series before he landed programs of his own. In 1956, he and [[Peter Breck]] appeared in [[John Bromfield]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]'' in the episode \"The Turkey Farmers\". Later, he guest-starred on [[NBC]]'s [[medical drama]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' in the role of Hal Kincaid in the 1962 episode \"Make Me a Place\", with series co-stars [[Wendell Corey]] and [[Jack Ging]]. He joined friend Martin Milner in a 1962 episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' as the character Kamo in the episode \"One Tiger to a Hill.\"\n\nJanssen starred in four television series of his own:\n* ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'' (1957\u20131960), a [[CBS]]/[[Four Star Television|Four Star]] hit series that also introduced [[Mary Tyler Moore]], showing only her legs, and [[Barbara Bain]] as Diamond's girlfriend.\n* ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' (1963\u201367), the hit [[Quinn Martin]]-produced series, about a Midwest doctor wrongly convicted of murdering his wife;\n* ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]'' (1971\u20131972), one of [[Jack Webb]]'s [[Mark VII Limited]] productions for [[Universal Studios]], as a government agent investigating counterfeiters and other federal crimes;\n* ''[[Harry O]]'' (1974\u20131976), as a San Diego-based private eye.\n\nAt the time, the final episode of ''The Fugitive'' held the record for the greatest number of American homes with television sets to watch a series finale, at 72 percent in August 1967. David Janssen was well liked by everyone, but more loved by his fans.  He fit the perfect role of \"why me?\" One could not help feeling sorry for his Fugitive character of being quiet, unassuming, afraid, but mainly caring for others.  On an episode, he stopped to help an old lady cross the street, on another; he helped a young, attractive woman start up her stalled car in the middle of nowhere.\n\nHis films include ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]'', the biography of [[Audie Murphy]], who was the most decorated American soldier of World War II; [[John Wayne]]'s Vietnam war film ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''; opposite [[Gregory Peck]] in the space story ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', in which Janssen played an astronaut sent to rescue three stranded men in space, and ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]'', as a television journalist in Rome reporting on the election of a new Pope ([[Anthony Quinn]]).\n\nHe starred as a Los Angeles police detective trying to clear himself in the killing of an apparently innocent doctor in the 1967 film ''[[Warning Shot]]''. The film was shot during a break in the spring and summer of 1966 between the third and fourth seasons of ''The Fugitive.''\n\nJanssen played an alcoholic in the 1977 TV movie ''A Sensitive, Passionate Man'', which co-starred [[Angie Dickinson]], and an engineer who devises an unbeatable system for [[blackjack]] in the 1978 made-for-TV movie ''Nowhere to Run'', co-starring [[Stefanie Powers]] and [[Linda Evans]]. Janssen's impressively husky voice was used to good effect as the narrator for the TV mini-series ''Centennial'' (1978\u201379); he also appeared in the final episode.  He starred in the made for tv mini series \"S.O.S. Titanic\" as John Jacob Astor, playing opposite Beverly Ross as his wife, Madeleine, in 1979.\n\nThough Janssen's scenes were cut from the final release, he also appeared as a journalist in the film ''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'', which he accepted to work with [[Laurence Olivier]] who played General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. At the time of his death, Janssen had just begun filming a television movie playing the part of [[Father Damien]], the priest who dedicated himself to the [[leprosy|leper]] colony on the island of [[Molokai]], Hawaii. The part was eventually reassigned to actor [[Ken Howard]] of the CBS series ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]''.\n\nIn 1996 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him number 36 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|page=}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:David Janssen 1974.JPG|thumb|In 1974]]\nJanssen was married twice.

Others, however, doubt that there was actual docetism threatening the churches, arguing that he was merely criticizing Christians who lived Jewishly or that his critical remarks were directed at an [[Ebionism|Ebionite]] or [[Cerinthus|Cerinthian]] possessionist Christology, according to which Christ was a heavenly spirit that temporarily possessed Jesus.<ref>{{harvnb|Streett|2011|pp=42\u201344}}.</ref>\n\n==Islam and docetism==\n{{main|Islamic views on Jesus' death}}\n\nSome commentators have attempted to make a connection between Islam and Docetism using the following Quranic verse:<ref name=parrinder>{{cite book|title=Jesus in the Qur'an|author=Geoffrey Parrinder|publisher=Oneworld Publications|year=2013|pages=112,118-119}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah's messenger &mdash; they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain.

[[Shailer Mathews]] called Drews' theory a \"modern docetism\".{{Sfn |Mathews|2006 |p= 37}} [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]] thought any connection to be based on a misunderstanding of docetism.{{Sfn |Conybeare|1914|p= 104}} The idea recurred in [[classicist]] [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]]'s 1977 review of the evidence for Jesus, who compared modern scepticism about a historical Jesus to the ancient docetic idea that Jesus only ''seemed'' to come into the world \"in the flesh\". Modern theories did away with \"seeming\".{{Sfn |Grant |2004 |pp= 199\u2013200 | ps =: \"This skeptical way of thinking reached its culmination in the argument that Jesus as a human being never existed at all and is a myth. In ancient times, this extreme view was named the heresy of docetism (seeming) because it maintained that Jesus never came into the world \"in the flesh\", but only seemed to; (I John 4:2) and it was given some encouragement by Paul's lack of interest in his fleshly existence. Subsequently, from the eighteenth century onwards, there have been attempts to insist that Jesus did not even \"seem\" to exist, and that all tales of his appearance upon the earth were pure fiction.

A [[hoard]] of over 150 rod-shaped obeloi was uncovered at [[Heraion of Argos]] in [[Peloponnese]]. Six of them are displayed at the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens]].\n\nIt was the standard unit of silver coinage at most ancient Greek mints, and the name ''obol'' was used to describe a coin that was one-sixth of a drachma. The notion that ''drachma'' derived from the word for fistful was recorded by [[Heraclides Ponticus|Herakleides of Pontos]] (387\u2013312&nbsp;BC) who was informed by the priests of Heraion that [[Pheidon]], king of Argos, dedicated rod-shaped obeloi to Heraion. Similar information about Pheidon's obeloi was also recorded at the [[Parian Chronicle]].\n\n[[Ancient Greek coinage|Ancient Greek coins]] normally had distinctive names in daily use. The Athenian [[tetradrachm]] was called [[owl of Athena|owl]],<ref>[[Philochorus]]: Scholion to Aristophanes, Birds 1106</ref> the [[Aegina#Coinage and sea power (7th\u20135th centuries BC)|Aeginetic stater]] was called [[Chelone (Greek mythology)|chelone]], the Corinthian [[stater]] was called ''hippos'' ([[horse]]) and so on. Each city would mint its own and have them stamped with recognizable [[Ancient Greek coinage#Coins as a symbol of the city-state|symbols of the city]], known as [[badge]] in numismatics, along with suitable inscriptions, and they would often be referred to either by the name of the city or of the image depicted. The exact exchange value of each was determined by the quantity and quality of the metal, which reflected on the reputation of each mint.\n\nAmong the Greek cities that used the drachma were: [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]], [[Alexandria]], [[Aetna (city)|Aetna]], [[Antioch]], [[Athens]], [[Chios]], [[Cyzicus]], [[Corinth]], [[Ephesus]], [[Eretria]], [[Gela]], [[Catana]], [[Kos]], [[Maronia]], [[Naxos]], [[Pella]], [[Pergamum]], [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegion]], [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], [[Smyrni]], [[Sparta]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], [[Thasos]], [[Tenedos]], [[Troy]] and more.\n\nThe 5th century BC [[Athens|Athenian]] ''[[tetradrachm]]'' (\"four drachmae\") [[coin]] was perhaps the most widely used coin in the Greek world prior to the time of [[Alexander the Great]] (along with the [[Corinth]]ian [[stater]]). It featured the helmeted profile bust of [[Athena]] on the obverse (front) and an owl on the reverse (back). In daily use they were called {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u1fe6\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}} ''glaukes'' (owls),<ref>{{LSJ|glau/c|\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03cd\u03be|shortref}}.</ref> hence [[List of Greek phrases#\u0393\u03b3|the proverb]] {{lang|grc|\u0393\u03bb\u03b1\u1fe6\u03ba\u2019 \u1f08\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\u03b6\u03b5}}, 'an owl to Athens', referring to something that was in plentiful supply, like '[[coals to Newcastle]]'. The reverse is featured on the national side of the modern [[Greek euro coins|Greek 1 euro coin]].\n\nDrachmae were minted on different weight standards at different Greek mints. The standard that came to be most commonly used was the Athenian or Attic one, which weighed a little over 4.3&nbsp;grams.\n\nAfter [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests, the name ''drachma'' was used in many of the [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms in the [[Middle East]], including the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] kingdom in [[Alexandria]] and the [[Parthian Empire]] based in what is modern-day [[Iran]]. The [[Arabia|Arabic]] unit of currency known as ''[[dirham]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u062f\u0631\u0647\u0645}}), known from pre-[[Islam]]ic times and afterwards, inherited its name from the drachma or [[didrachm]] ({{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd}}, 2 drachmae); the dirham is still the name of the official currencies of [[Moroccan Dirham|Morocco]] and the [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates]]. The [[Armenia]]n [[dram (currency)|dram]] ({{lang-hy|\u0534\u0580\u0561\u0574}}) also derives its name from the drachma.\n\n===Value===\n\nIt is difficult to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes [[Purchasing power parity|purchasing power parity (PPP)]] calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] (in the year 1990 \u2013 equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015<ref>[http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ The Inflation Calculator] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QVXNUZmW?url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ |date=21 July 2007 }}</ref>), whereas classical historians regularly say that in the heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a skilled worker or a [[hoplite]]<ref>[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=thuc.%203.17 3.17.4].</ref> was one drachma, and for a [[Heliaia|heliast]] (juror) half a drachma since 425&nbsp;BC.<ref>It was originally set at 1/6 drachma by Pericles, until [[Cleon]] raised it in 425&nbsp;BC; see also [[Aristophanes]], ''Knights'' (line 255) and ''Wasps'' (line 609, 684, 690, 788\u2013790, 1121).</ref>\n\nModern commentators derived from [[Xenophon]]<ref>Cf. footnote 18 of H. G. Dakyns's translation of [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=1179 ''Ways and Means: A Pamphlet on Revenues'' alias ''On Revenues''] (''The Works of Xenophon'', Macmillan, 1897). This footnote is quoting George Grote (''Plato, and the Other Companions of Sokrates'', vol. 3, J. Murray, 1865, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=58cYAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA597 597]).</ref> that half a drachma per day (360 days per year) would provide \"a comfortable subsistence\" for \"the poor citizens\" (for the head of a household in 355&nbsp;BC). Earlier in 422&nbsp;BC, we also see in Aristophanes (''Wasps'', line 300\u2013302) that the daily half-drachma of a juror is just enough for the daily subsistence of a family of three.\n\nA modern person might think of one drachma as the rough equivalent of a skilled worker's daily pay in the place where they live, which could be as low as $1 [[USD]], or as high as $100 USD, depending on the country.\n\nFractions and multiples of the drachma were minted by many states, most notably in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which minted large coins in gold, silver and bronze.\n\nNotable Ptolemaic coins included the gold ''pentadrachm'' and ''octadrachm'', and silver ''tetradrachm'', ''decadrachm'' and ''pentakaidecadrachm''. This was especially noteworthy as it would not be until the introduction of the [[Guldengroschen]] in 1486 that coins of substantial size (particularly in silver) would be minted in significant quantities.\n\nFor the Roman successors of the drachma, see [[Roman provincial coins]].\n\n===Denominations of Ancient Greek drachma===\nThe weight of the silver drachma was approximately 4.3 grams or 0.15 ounces,<ref>British Museum Catalogue 11 \u2013 Attica Megaris Aegina</ref> although weights varied significantly from one city-state to another.

The drachma coin weighed 4.5&nbsp;g and contained 90% silver, with the 20-drachma coin containing 5.8&nbsp;g of gold.\n\nIn 1868, Greece joined the [[Latin Monetary Union]] and the drachma became equal in weight and value to the [[French franc]]. The new coinage issued consisted of copper coins of 1, 2, 5 and 10 lepta, with the 5- and 10-lepta coins bearing the names ''obolos'' ({{lang|el|\u1f40\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2}}) and ''diobolon'' ({{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}}), respectively; silver coins of 20 and 50 lepta, 1, 2 and 5 drachmae and gold coins of 5, 10 and 20 drachmae. (Very small numbers of 50- and 100-drachma coins in gold were also issued.)\n\nIn 1894, [[cupro-nickel]] 5-, 10- and 20-lepta coins were introduced.  No 1-lepton or 2-lepta coin had been issued since the late 1870s. Silver coins of 1 and 2 drachmae were last issued in 1911, and no coins were issued between 1912 and 1922, during which time the [[Latin Monetary Union]] collapsed due to [[World War I]].\n\nBetween 1926 and 1930, a new coinage was introduced for the new Hellenic Republic, consisting of cupro-nickel coins in denominations of 20 lepta, 50 lepta, 1 drachma, and 2 drachmae; nickel coins of 5 drachmae; and silver coins of 10 and 20 drachmae. These were the last coins issued for the first modern drachma, and none were issued for the second.\n\n====Notes====\n[[File:NBG banknote-1912.jpg|thumb|Banknote of 1912 issued by the NBG]] \nNotes were issued by the [[National Bank of Greece]] from 1841 until 2001 when Greece joined the [[Euro]]. Early denominations ranged from 10 to 500 drachmae. Smaller denominations (1, 2, 3 and 5 drachmae) were issued from 1885, with the first 5-drachma notes being made by cutting 10-drachma notes in half.\n\nWhen Greece finally achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1828, the [[Greek Phoenix|phoenix]] was introduced as the monetary unit; its use was short-lived, however, and in 1832 the phoenix was replaced by the drachma, adorned with the image of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto of Greece]], who reigned as modern Greece\u2019s first king from 1832 to 1862. The drachma was divided into 100 lepta. In 2002 the drachma ceased to be legal tender after the euro, the monetary unit of the European Union, became Greece\u2019s sole currency.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1920, the Greek government issued paper money in denominations of 10 lepta, 50 lepta, 1 drachma, 2 drachmae, and 5 drachmae. The National Bank of Greece introduced 1000-drachma notes in 1901, and the Bank of Greece introduced 5000-drachma notes in 1928. The Greek government again issued notes between 1940 and 1944, in denominations ranging from 50 lepta to 20 drachmae.\n\nIn 1922, the Greek government issued a forced loan in order to finance the budget deficit. On April 1, 1922, the government decreed that half of all bank notes had to be surrendered and exchanged for 6.5% bonds. The notes were then cut in half, with the portion bearing the Greek crown standing in for the bonds while the other half was exchanged for a new issue of central bank notes (at half the original value). The forced loan raised 1.6 billion drachma, roughly the size of the deficit.<ref name=\"Dornbusch Dornbusch Dornbusch Draghi 1990 p. 175\">{{cite book | last=Dornbusch | first=M. | last2=Dornbusch | first2=F.I.P.E.R. | last3=Dornbusch | first3=R. | last4=Draghi | first4=M. | author5=Italian Macroeconomic Policy Group | title=Public Debt Management: Theory and History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-521-39266-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oMJ-yMkevkC&pg=PA175 | access-date=2018-09-26 | page=175}}</ref> <ref>Schmidt, T.

Pg. 597</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-[[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]] [[Axis Occupation of Greece|occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, catastrophic [[hyperinflation]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] looting of the Greek treasury caused much higher denominations to be issued, culminating in 100,000,000,000-drachma notes in 1944.\n\n===Second modern drachma===\nIn November 1944, after Greece was liberated from Germany, old drachmae were exchanged for new ones at the rate of 50,000,000,000 to 1. Only paper money was issued. The government issued notes of 1, 5, 10 and 20 drachmae, with the Bank of Greece issuing 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5000-, and 10,000-drachma notes. This drachma also suffered from high inflation. The government later issued 100-, 500-, and 1000-drachma notes, and the Bank of Greece issued 20,000-and 50,000-drachma notes.\n\n===Third modern drachma===\nIn 1953, in an effort to halt inflation, Greece joined the [[Bretton Woods system]]. In 1954, the drachma was revalued at a rate of 1000 to 1. The new currency was pegged at 30 drachmae = 1 [[United States dollar]]. In 1973, the Bretton Woods System was abolished; over the next 25 years the official exchange rate gradually declined, reaching 400 drachmae to 1 U. S. dollar.  On 1 January 2002, the Greek drachma was officially replaced as the circulating currency by the [[euro]], and it has not been [[legal tender]] since 1 March 2002.\n\n====Third modern drachma coins====\nThe first issue of coins minted in 1954 consisted of holed aluminium 5-, 10- and 20-lepton pieces, with 50-lepton, 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-drachma pieces in cupro-nickel. A silver 20-drachma piece was issued in 1960, replacing the 20-drachma banknote, and also minted only in collector sets in 1965.  Coins in denominations from 50 lepta to 20 drachmae carried a portrait of [[Paul of Greece|King Paul]] (1947\u20131964). New coins were introduced in 1966, ranging from 50 lepta to 10 drachmae, depicting [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]] (1964\u20131974). A silver 30 drachma coin for the centennial of Greece's royal dynasty was minted in 1963.  The following year a non-circulating coin of this value was produced to commemorate the royal wedding.  The reverse of all coins was altered in 1971 to reflect the military junta which was in power from 1967 to 1974. This design included a soldier standing in front of the flames of the rising phoenix.\n\nA 20-drachmae coin in cupro-nickel with an image of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] on the obverse was issued in 1973. In the latter part of 1973, several new coin types were introduced: unholed aluminium (10 and 20 lepta), nickel-brass (50 lepta, 1 drachma, and 2 drachmae) and cupro-nickel (5, 10, and 20 drachmae). These provisional coins carried the design of the phoenix rising from the flame on the obverse, and used the country's new designation as the \"Hellenic Republic\", replacing the coins also issued in 1973 as the Kingdom of Greece with King Constantine II's portrait. A new series of all 8 denominations was introduced in 1976 carrying images of early national heroes on the smaller values.\n\nCupro-nickel 50-drachmae coins were introduced in 1980. In 1986, nickel-brass 50-drachma coins were introduced, followed by copper 1- and 2-drachma pieces in 1988 and nickel-brass coins of 20 and 100 drachmae in 1990. In 2000, a set of 6 themed 500-drachma coins was issued to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympic Games]].\n\n[[Coin]]s in circulation at the time of the adoption of the euro<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/Banknotes/coins.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204174343/http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/banknotes/coins.htm |archivedate=4 February 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> were\n* 50 lepta (\u20ac0.0015){{refn|group=n|name=coin1|Minted but rarely used.
